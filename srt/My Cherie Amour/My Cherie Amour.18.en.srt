00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,080
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,720
Anong Suntorapong is no more.

3
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,760
ANONG WARATHABUT

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,440
She said she had a stomachache.
I think she might've got an abortion.

5
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,800
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,680
<i>I have proof.</i>

7
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
Goodness.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,600
MENSTRUAL TONIC

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,360
What exactly is wrong with you?

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,280
I lost the baby.

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,240
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

12
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Rumor is that Wichai
once got his wife to accept a bribe.

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Who is he?

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
He's an ex-con.

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,560
He sent me a letter once he learned
that Wichai is your husband.

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,400
He's threatening to expose Wichai.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,080
I had a miscarriage.

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,520
But I didn't tell Chut.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,680
<i>You're rooting for your kids to fail.</i>

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,320
You want our marriage to fall apart
so you can rub it in our faces.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
- Shut your mouth!
- That's enough.

22
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
That's enough!

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,920
You should blame yourself
for raising Chut to be this way.

24
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,480
I grazed a man with my car.

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
I asked Chut not to tell you.

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,600
I kept it from you because
I was afraid it'd affect your work.

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,640
It seems I really can't take care of you.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Chantorn wanted you to have this back.

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,400
CHANTORN, 10,000 BAHT

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,560
You gave her money
to pay off the mortgage, right?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
Chantorn works really hard

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,320
to help Chut pay for the mortgage.

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
I felt sorry for her.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
So I gave her the money and told her
to pay me back when she can.

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,880
But you're taking responsibility
for my family's problems.

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,200
If it can help lessen your burden,

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,240
then I'm willing to do it.

38
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
I'm sorry my family caused you trouble.

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
But I'd rather be the one
to handle everything.

40
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Wichai.

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,240
I like that you're a gentleman.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,000
But you don't have to carry
everything on your shoulders.

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Anong.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
When you married me,

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
did you marry Wichai

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,240
or did you marry Pra Atthakadee Wichai?

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
What?

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,600
Wichai, aren't they the same person?

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,080
They're the same person.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,800
But you keep thinking
that you're married to a judge.

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,440
You keep worrying
about hurting my reputation.

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,480
My work and my title
don't mean that much to me.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,120
Outside of work,

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm a son, a brother,
an uncle, and a husband.

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm proud of all the roles I'm given.

56
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,079
But it's like you don't believe
that I'll be good at those things.

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
It's not like that.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Then how come when you have problems,

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,240
you choose to keep them to yourself?

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Why is that? Anong.

61
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,760
No one can take advantage of me

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,560
if I don't let them.

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
In the end, you're the one
who doesn't trust me to take care of you.

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
I…

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm just afraid you'll feel stifled
like Chut.

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,400
If Chut hadn't spoken up today,

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
your mom wouldn't have realized

68
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,000
how controlling she is of everyone.

69
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Hang on.

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,040
My mom misunderstood
because you helped cover for Chantorn.

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,520
If you think she will judge you
for having a miscarriage,

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
then you're the prejudiced one.

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,800
Anong.

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,600
We're a family.

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,280
From now on,
we'll solve every problem together.

76
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't keep things to yourself.

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Okay?

78
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,160
Fine.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,080
What was that?

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,680
All right.

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,920
I won't keep any more secrets from you.

82
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,960
My mom was right.

83
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,080
Those guys only see me as their lapdog.

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,480
I was a fool for thinking
that they needed me.

85
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,520
It was my fault
for letting them cause you trouble.

86
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
Just forget it.

87
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,040
No.

88
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Yell at me.

89
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,360
Go ahead and rail at me.

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,360
I deserve it for letting you down.

91
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,600
You crybaby.

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,040
No. Be really harsh with me.
Just let me have it.

93
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
Yell at me more.

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,320
Do your worst.

95
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,960
You're a player.

96
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
You're all talk and no action.

97
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
You have no purpose.

98
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,720
You're petty and childish.

99
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,960
Anything else?

100
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
You're unreliable.

101
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,160
You're fickle.

102
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,720
You always overspend.

103
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,920
You're full of yourself.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
You're undependable.

105
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
You're a liar and a poser.

106
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,720
You're a weak and cowardly man

107
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,640
who always seeks attention.

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,280
Am I a lost cause?

109
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
Chut.

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,280
You don't have to act tough
all the time when you're with me.

111
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,360
Even if you're lousy,

112
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
it doesn't mean you're a bad person.

113
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,480
But I'm still not good enough

114
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,120
to be a dad.

115
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,840
I don't know why you still put up with me.

116
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,880
Because I've also made mistakes.

117
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
And you forgave me.

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,360
I don't expect our marriage

119
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,600
to be all sunshine and rainbows.

120
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
I just want you

121
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,160
to stand by me

122
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,520
when I make a mistake.

123
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,880
I don't want to say sorry anymore.

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
I've said it so often
that it feels meaningless.

125
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't know what to say

126
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,920
to make you believe
that I truly regret my actions.

127
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
Can you give me another chance?

128
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
Give me one last chance.

129
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,080
I promise to never make
you cry again from now on.

130
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,320
If I can't keep my promise,
you can chase me away.

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,920
All right?

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Please forgive me.

133
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
That's enough.

134
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,480
I forgive you.

135
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,280
You've probably heard that
my family is being sued for fraud.

136
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,440
What about it?

137
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,880
I heard that your eldest son
is working as a judge in Bangkok.

138
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,920
The general and I want him
to preside over our case

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,240
since he might be able to help us out.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,920
Wichai is a principled man.

141
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,880
But his family is
also very important to him.

142
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,280
I imagine he'd want to do you proud.

143
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,000
If he can save us
from being sued into bankruptcy,

144
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,240
our association will be happy to give you

145
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
the Outstanding Woman Award
that you've always wanted.

146
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,880
I don't know whether
Wichai will be willing to do it.

147
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,600
You can tell me if there's something else
you want other than the award.

148
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,360
I don't have that much influence
over Wichai anymore.

149
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,880
These days,
the only person that he listens to

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,640
is his wife.

151
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Then there's still hope.

152
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,240
Maybe Anong is more deserving
of the Outstanding Woman Award than me.

153
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,840
A businesswoman like her might know
a better way out of your problem.

154
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,640
I'll give you the Outstanding Woman Award

155
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,080
if you can get your husband
to oversee my family's case.

156
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,560
I don't think it would be appropriate

157
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,000
for me to accept your offer.

158
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,880
Chuen gave up the award
so you could have it.

159
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,640
You should be quick to accept it
out of respect for your mother-in-law.

160
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,680
What does Chuen have to do with this?

161
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,640
Everyone knows this isn't the first time
Wichai has accepted a bribe.

162
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,160
That's how his family
could afford to send his brother

163
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,280
to study abroad.

164
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,600
What you said can be considered
slander if you don't have proof.

165
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,160
I have both evidence and witnesses.

166
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,080
Take your time to think about this.

167
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,600
I won't expose your husband
if you agree to help me.

168
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
Or you can stand by

169
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,160
and watch his life go up in smoke.

170
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,520
If you agree to accept my offer,

171
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,120
you can help protect your husband.

172
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,640
That's a pretty color.

173
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,080
What's the matter?

174
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,600
It's a nice drawing.

175
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,800
Maybe you can draw another one.

176
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,760
I've noticed a stranger
hanging around our house lately.

177
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,720
What stranger?

178
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,640
I've also seen him

179
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,400
hanging around the court.

180
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,040
Could it have something
to do with that case?

181
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,800
What case?

182
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,960
I just mean the case
that you're working on right now.

183
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,680
I do receive threats sometimes
when I try court cases.

184
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,640
It makes me worried for my family.

185
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I'll tell Boi to keep an eye on things.

186
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,680
You shouldn't go out alone
in the meantime.

187
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,400
You too, okay?

188
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
Don't wander off by yourself
when you're out playing.

189
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,520
Did you find it?

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Is this it?

191
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
It's the only government bond I found.

192
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,120
So where's your proof?

193
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,600
I gave a government bond
to his wife as a bribe.

194
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,880
That bond can be used
as evidence against him.

195
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,160
How much do you want

196
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,920
in exchange for your silence?

197
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Someone is willing to give me 10,000 baht

198
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,160
for this complaint letter.

199
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,120
You have people offering you money.

200
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,320
How can I be sure

201
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
you won't sell this information to them?

202
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,960
It's fine if you're not interested.

203
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
I'll tell you something.

204
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,240
There are lots of people
who are looking to take revenge

205
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,120
on your brother-in-law.

206
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,520
He claimed that Wichai's ex-wife
was the one who accepted the bribe.

207
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,880
But Soon didn't keep the bond.
It was in my mom's drawer.

208
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,000
This means that my mom
was aware of what happened.

209
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
But I'm sure that

210
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,280
Wichai doesn't know about this.

211
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,880
That's why he sentenced
that man to prison.

212
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,800
How can we know how much
Lady Mayom knows about this?

213
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,520
She could use this
to get Wichai off the case

214
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,480
if he refuses to help her.

215
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,640
Wichai won't just get taken off the case

216
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
if people find out about the bribe.

217
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,480
He could be dismissed
from government service.

218
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
This is infuriating.

219
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,240
How could Mom and Soon
do something so stupid?

220
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,960
Could it be that
Soon decided to kill herself

221
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,160
because of this?

222
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,800
Do you remember the last letter
that Soon wrote to Wichai?

223
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,560
Soon didn't die of an illness.

224
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,760
You made sure
Wichai didn't get her letters.

225
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,720
I don't understand.

226
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,680
How could she be so greedy for money

227
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,480
that she was willing
to risk destroying Wichai's career?

228
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,600
Do you think it's possible

229
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,080
that my mom took this opportunity
to get Soon out of Wichai's life?

230
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,960
Don't forget that Wichai
didn't really want to marry Soon.

231
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,720
He was forced to marry her
to help sort out Mom's debt.

232
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Mom might've tried to get rid of Soon.

233
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
She just didn't think

234
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,920
it would lead Soon to commit suicide.

235
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,240
And now she tries to get rid of me
by pressuring me to help Sa-Ang's family.

236
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,600
Mom needs to realize that
this won't do anyone any good,

237
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,360
especially Wichai.

238
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,640
There's a way to prove

239
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,160
whether your mom is the one behind this.

240
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
We can't let this matter
come back to hurt Wichai.

241
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,680
Did you hear the news?

242
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
What news?

243
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,480
Wichai was selected as one of the judges
to preside over the general's case.

244
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,000
The court will be holding a hearing soon.

245
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,600
So Wichai will be working
on the general's case?

246
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,880
We should celebrate
since there's more good news.

247
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,800
The Women's Association

248
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,040
named my mom
this year's Outstanding Woman.

249
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,640
It said in the announcement that
she's an exemplary mom

250
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,560
and a good role model for others.

251
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
They praised her for her virtue

252
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,960
and the sacrifices she made

253
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,240
as a single mom
who devoted herself to her family.

254
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,080
Congratulations.

255
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,880
No one deserves this award more than you.

256
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,640
<i>Anong thought it'd be improper
for her to accept the award.</i>

257
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,200
She insisted that I give it to you,
so I did as she asked.

258
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,080
But I didn't agree to anything.

259
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,760
We made a deal.

260
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,560
You must have your son
dismiss my case for lack of evidence.

261
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,000
<i>Otherwise, I'll get the court
to take disciplinary action against him.</i>

262
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,080
You should know better
than to mess with me.

263
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,080
<i>My husband will be expecting your son.</i>

264
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,600
<i>If he doesn't come,
we'll have him taken off the case.</i>

265
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,560
If you dare betray me,
I'll kick your son off this case myself.

266
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,000
COMPLAINT LETTER

267
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
Enjoy the fruit, ma'am.

268
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,520
9 YEARS AGO

269
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,240
What's that?

270
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,800
My gosh.

271
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,600
Who gave you that?

272
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,320
Someone brought Wichai a gift basket.

273
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,280
That's a bribe. Are you naive or stupid?

274
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,080
You took their money.
You must take responsibility for this.

275
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,200
What should I do?
Can I return this to them?

276
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,720
You caused this problem,
so deal with it yourself.

277
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,080
Wichai won't forgive you

278
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,080
if he knew about this.

279
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,240
Lamoon.

280
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,960
Where did this basket come from? Lamoon.

281
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,720
Who brought this in here?

282
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
Is something the matter?

283
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,200
Who is this flower basket from?

284
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
What does the card say?

285
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,040
Why did you accept things from strangers?

286
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
Get it out of here!

287
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,720
People probably want to congratulate you
after hearing about the award.

288
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,440
Don't get smart with me.

289
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,400
What are you afraid of?
They're just flowers.

290
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,320
Are you trying to mess with me?

291
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,320
I thought you would be happy

292
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,560
that the association gave you the award.

293
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
Did you do this to get back at me?

294
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
Get back at you for what?

295
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,800
Well…

296
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,120
You said that I wasn't fit to be a mom.

297
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,920
So that's what you're so mad about.

298
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,000
You should ask Wichai what he thinks.

299
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
I can't speak for him on this matter.

300
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,320
Do you want to pick a fight with me?

301
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,360
If you really love your kids,

302
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,320
you shouldn't hurt others.

303
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,040
The consequences of your actions
will fall on your kids one day.

304
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
Goodness! Madam!

305
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,240
Madam!

306
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,200
What happened, Madam?

307
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,640
What's this?

308
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,880
COMPLAINT LETTER

309
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
"Dear Honorable Court.

310
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,760
Nine years ago

311
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,640
at Lampang Provincial Court,

312
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,840
a judge had his family
demand a bribe from me

313
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,960
before he presided over the case
in which I was the defendant.

314
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,800
He promised to declare me innocent

315
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,400
if I gave him a bribe
in the form of a bond."

316
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,800
A bond?

317
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,040
<i>My family paid a bribe
to the wife of that said judge.</i>

318
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
<i>Yet he sentenced me</i>

319
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,160
<i>to several years in prison.</i>

320
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,200
<i>I believe in karma.</i>

321
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,200
<i>So I demand for justice to be served.</i>

322
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,200
<i>If you still want people
to respect the law,</i>

323
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,840
<i>you must bring this judge to justice.</i>

324
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,800
<i>If you let this matter slide,</i>

325
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,600
<i>I'll consider you to be as corrupt as him
and I hope karma comes back to bite you.</i>

326
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,440
Hang on.

327
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
This is about that incident.

328
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Did someone in our family
accept money from him?

329
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,360
- Madam, this is--
- Be quiet.

330
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,080
My gosh. Who gave you that?

331
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,320
Someone brought Wichai a gift basket.

332
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,720
What is this?

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,160
I should be the one to ask you that.

334
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,720
How did you get this?

335
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,240
Wichai doesn't even realize
what he did wrong.

336
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
You need to come clean about this.

337
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,640
If you don't, it's Wichai who will suffer.

338
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,400
Soon was the one
who accepted the bribe, not me.

339
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,240
Is that what you made her believe
so she decided to kill herself?

340
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,640
Are you doing all this
just to get me out of Wichai's life?

341
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,720
Why would I do that to someone he loves?

342
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,560
Give me a break.
How much do you even love Wichai?

343
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,080
If Wichai's ex-wife was still alive

344
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,520
and they were happy together,

345
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,680
I would be happy for him.

346
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,640
If there's someone
who can love Wichai more than me,

347
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,320
I'll be okay with it.

348
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,640
Wichai's never asked anyone for anything.

349
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,720
So I'm begging you.

350
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,680
Stop making him responsible
for your happiness and sorrow.

351
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Don't let him get involved
with the general's case.

352
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,320
You need to come clean
before Wichai is found guilty of bribery.

353
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,200
Last time,

354
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,480
his dad took the blame for his worker.

355
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,680
This time,

356
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,000
Wichai might end up
having to take the blame for you.

357
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,720
I heard about the award.

358
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,400
Congratulations.

359
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,600
I feel so proud to have you as my mom.

360
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,840
A good man like you

361
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,200
deserves a better mom than me.

362
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,480
Why would you say that?

363
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,760
I got selected as one of the judges
to preside over the general's case.

364
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
That's good.

365
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,800
Well done, Wichai.

366
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,240
My job is to decide whether
we'll accept or reject the plaint.

367
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,560
This is a big case since no one believes
that the general will be prosecuted.

368
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,800
Well…

369
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,400
I believe that you can do it.

370
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,960
Just do your best.

371
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,400
Hey.

372
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,760
Why are you still up?

373
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,200
This is a high-profile case
so I have a lot to prepare.

374
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,920
Is it very difficult?

375
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,600
It looks like I'll have to issue
a search warrant for more evidence.

376
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
Wichai.

377
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,600
After everything you've done,

378
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,320
will you be sad if you don't get
to work on the case?

379
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,280
I'll be sadder if we can't bring
a man like the general to justice.

380
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,360
If we let him use his influence
to get away with crime,

381
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,320
people will lose faith
in the justice system.

382
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,160
If we can bring him to justice,

383
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,480
I won't regret anything even if this case

384
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,680
is the last case I get to try.

385
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,360
I'll help you.

386
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,960
I can finally put this behind me.

387
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Sir.

388
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,680
The guard managed
to identify the man you saw.

389
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,680
His name is Terd Buachuen.

390
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
That's him.

391
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,760
He was recently released from prison.

392
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
He often hangs around here.

393
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
Have the guard bring him
to see me if he comes back.

394
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,840
Yes, sir.

395
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,560
Wichai!

396
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,680
Wichai!

397
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,440
- Choy.
- Did you go pick Nid up from school?

398
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,840
I thought you picked her up.

399
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,400
Wichai. I couldn't find Nid at school.

400
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,120
She wasn't there.

401
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,000
Choy, you need to calm down.
You should call and ask Anong.

402
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,760
Nid isn't here.

403
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,560
<i>If you didn't pick her up, then who did?</i>

404
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,520
<i>I couldn't find her at school.</i>

405
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,160
Where is my kid, Wichai?

406
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,960
Nid never goes anywhere by herself.
She doesn't know her way home.

407
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,760
I'll have the school help look for her.

408
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,440
Nid couldn't have gone far.

409
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
What if she got kidnapped?

410
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
Does this have to do with your case?

411
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
My case?

412
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,280
Could it be that…

413
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,160
Someone must've taken Nid
to negotiate about the case.

414
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,640
What are you talking about?

415
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
What case?

416
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,760
It's Lady Mayom.

417
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,440
She wants you to help oversee her case.

418
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,920
<i>She knew Mom took a bribe on your behalf.</i>

419
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,720
So Mom couldn't say no to her.

420
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,280
Wichai.

421
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,280
She must've taken my kid.

422
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
Do you think she will hurt Nid?

423
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,800
Will Nid be okay?
Do you think she'll hurt my kid?

424
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,520
Just wait for me there.
I'll head there right now.

425
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,680
Don't do anything yet.

426
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,400
What happened?

427
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,240
Madam!

428
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,640
Madam!

429
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,040
My gosh! Madam!

430
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,720
Are you okay, Madam? Somebody help!

431
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,360
- Madam!
- What happened?

432
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,000
Please help Madam.

433
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,120
<i>Tell your son to come see me.</i>

434
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,520
<i>He can't avoid me forever.
My bank account was just frozen.</i>

435
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,239
<i>I know your son is behind this.
Are you trying to double-cross me?</i>

436
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,840
She said she'll give Nid back
if you go meet her.

437
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,719
Nid must be so scared.

438
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,320
You stay here, Choy. I'll go.

439
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,520
Will you head there now?
Shouldn't we inform the authorities?

440
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,360
She has my niece. I have to do something.

441
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,800
Boi.

442
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,199
Take Choy home. Call the police
if you don't hear from me in an hour.

443
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,040
Wichai.

444
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,239
Just do as I say.

445
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Wait, Wichai. Where are you going?

446
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,239
You can't go. It's a trap.

447
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,800
Wichai. Don't do anything yet.
Please just wait here.

448
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,760
Where is Anong?

449
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,480
Why isn't she here?

450
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,040
- She--
- Where is Anong?

451
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,680
Answer me.

452
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,880
She's on her way here.

453
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,960
- Please don't go.
- This is all my fault.

454
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
How can I just do nothing?

455
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,440
Anong told you to wait!

456
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
You two need to stop!

457
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,320
Stop risking yourself for me!

458
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,000
We were too complacent.

459
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,120
Don't worry.

460
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,040
Everyone will be okay.

461
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,520
My essay won a prize.

462
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,720
Let's go home. Your mom is waiting.

463
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,960
Here's something for your grandma.

464
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,600
It's a foolish move to use a child
to do your dirty bidding.

465
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,920
I'm showing you respect
by inviting you to have a talk with me.

466
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,560
You have your men taking my picture
so you can blackmail me.

467
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,600
Do you call this showing respect?

468
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Let's talk this out.

469
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,640
Don't think you can treat people like dirt
just because you're a noble.

470
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,160
You may have connections,
but you're still under the law.

471
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,080
What makes you think
you can get me to do as you say?

472
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,240
I know money can't buy someone like you.

473
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,720
You won't do as you agree

474
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
even if you accept my money.

475
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,240
I don't expect anything from you.

476
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,640
It's why I'm trying
to get you off the case.

477
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,040
When things don't go your way,
you change the rules to suit your needs

478
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,360
instead of fighting fair.

479
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
Spare me the lecture.

480
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,920
Will you drop out of the case
or do I have to get you dismissed?

481
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,320
You wouldn't be doing all this
if you were innocent.

482
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,520
I already knew before I came here

483
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,320
that I wouldn't get
to work on this case anymore.

484
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,880
But even if I'm off the case,

485
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,640
there are other honorable judges

486
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,680
who won't let you
get away with your crime.

487
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,960
At the very least,

488
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,760
you'll face several charges
for what you did today.

489
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,800
I'll take you down with me
if my family goes bankrupt.

490
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,360
I'm having my men submit
evidence of your bribery

491
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,880
from nine years ago.

492
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,720
You won't just be taken off our case.

493
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,680
You'll be dismissed

494
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,240
from government service for what you did.

495
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,880
You think you're so honorable
since you've made it as a judge.

496
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,520
But you also accepted bribes, didn't you?

497
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,480
You're a disgrace to the justice system.

498
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,080
You should think about your actions
before you go around judging others.

499
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,720
You're trying to hide your faults
by pointing out mine,

500
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
but it doesn't make you
any more respectable.

501
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,000
Just admit that you're as corrupt as me.

502
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,400
You're setting a bad example
for your niece.

503
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,160
I feel sorry for her.

504
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,040
We must own up to our mistakes.

505
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,240
My niece can tell right from wrong.

506
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,880
Unlike you.

507
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,040
You do despicable things
and pretend like you're innocent.

508
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,720
Keep running your mouth.
I'll make sure your life is over.

509
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,320
Your family will suffer

510
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,440
because of what you did.

511
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,120
Just keep acting cocky.
You're nothing more than a fraud.

512
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,680
You're all liars.

513
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,200
It's over.

514
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,560
Did Lady Mayom threaten you?

515
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,120
She and the general were trying
to have you taken off the case.

516
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,440
COMPLAINT LETTER

517
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,360
DEAR HONORABLE COURT

518
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,600
NINE YEARS AGO
AT LAMPANG PROVINCIAL COURT…

519
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,440
If this is true,

520
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,800
how will I be able
to continue working as a judge?

521
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,480
Nid. Come to me, dear.

522
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,520
Grandma.

523
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,840
I'm not saying this as an excuse,

524
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,160
but it was Soon who took the money.

525
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,040
Why did you keep the bond?

526
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,440
That man was already sentenced to prison.

527
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,640
I thought this would be over

528
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,600
after Soon died.

529
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,040
I kept the bond
because I didn't want anyone to find it.

530
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,640
I was just trying to protect you.

531
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,040
Do you realize

532
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,840
that I could go to jail for this?

533
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,560
I didn't know.

534
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,720
I didn't know how to fix what happened.

535
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
But I swear to you.

536
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,440
I swear on my life
that I never wanted that money.

537
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,920
Your dad was accused

538
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,680
of embezzling government money.

539
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,640
I never wanted
the same thing to happen to you.

540
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,080
I was only trying to protect you.

541
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,640
So you're saying that

542
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,480
Soon was the one who accepted the bribe?

543
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Soon blamed herself too much.

544
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,360
She shouldn't have to die
for what she did.

545
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,120
She was easily frightened.

546
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,400
She couldn't handle being terrorized.

547
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,760
All the threats she received
were too much for her.

548
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,640
You liar!

549
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,120
You shameless bitch!

550
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,960
Give me back my brother!

551
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,360
What's with the ruckus?

552
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
Just you wait.
I'll have the court put you in jail.

553
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,240
Why did you take my money
if you weren't going to help me?

554
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,000
Get back here!

555
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,080
Don't you dare run from me!

556
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,000
You lying snake! Give me back my brother!

557
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,040
You witch!

558
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,760
Close the door, Lamoon!

559
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,120
Look what you've done!

560
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,840
Your stupidity caused everyone trouble.

561
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,920
My son's career
could be over because of you.

562
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,440
You stupid girl.

563
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,600
I could kill you right now.

564
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,680
Wichai will be furious
if he finds out what you did.

565
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,480
How could you do something so stupid?

566
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,040
Just get out of here!

567
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,840
<i>I never thought that the whole incident</i>

568
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,720
<i>would make her kill herself.</i>

569
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,760
Where is she?

570
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
Maybe she decided to run away.

571
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,680
Do you think she ran away
to be with Wichai?

572
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,280
See if her clothes are in the closet.

573
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,240
- My gosh!
- My gosh!

574
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,840
What should we do?

575
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,640
She tried to tell you
the truth many times.

576
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,760
But I made sure that
her letters didn't get posted.

577
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,280
I was afraid that people would find out

578
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,480
if we made a big deal out of it.

579
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,800
Soon didn't die of an illness.

580
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,200
And these unposted letters were
the reason she hung herself, right?

581
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,000
I never thought that

582
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,760
what I did would make her commit suicide.

583
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,520
I didn't mean for all of that to happen.

584
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,640
Soon might not have killed herself

585
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,760
if you had let her tell me the truth.

586
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,720
I was partly to blame

587
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,440
for driving Soon to kill herself.

588
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,240
And after all that,

589
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,400
you still dare pressure Wichai
to get the general's case thrown out.

590
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,440
I swear to you.
I never said that I'd help them.

591
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,800
I wouldn't dare
after what happened with Soon.

592
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,080
I didn't want history to repeat itself.

593
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,040
Then why did you have
Lady Mayom offer me the award?

594
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,640
I wasn't trying to throw the blame on you.

595
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,800
I did it because I know that

596
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,560
you're strong enough

597
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,160
to handle this matter for Wichai.

598
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,360
You were afraid
to stand up to those people.

599
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,720
Now Wichai might get taken off the case.

600
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,720
Are you happy now?

601
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,240
What do you plan to do

602
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,240
if Wichai is investigated for misconduct?

603
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,640
It took our family a long time

604
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,200
to recover from Dad's embezzlement charge.

605
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,960
If Wichai gets kicked off the case,

606
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,120
no one will have any respect for us.

607
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,800
This is all my fault.

608
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,240
I'm a lousy mom.

609
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,320
If your dad was here instead of me,

610
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,640
all of you might not have
to be in this position.

611
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,240
Please don't blame yourself.

612
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,720
What happened is in the past.

613
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,840
At least we're all safe.

614
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,640
If I had known
I'd be putting everyone at risk,

615
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,960
I wouldn't have taken on this case.

616
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,240
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

617
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
You're the one who got terrorized.

618
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,320
Why must you drop out of the case?

619
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,720
I don't think I can remain impartial
after what happened.

620
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,360
If I can't trust my own judgment,

621
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,880
it'd be more appropriate
to let someone else do the job.

622
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,800
You're right.

623
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,320
I still want to get back at those people.

624
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,040
The court must know what they did to us.

625
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,440
They won't let the general and his wife

626
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,120
keep using their power to abuse others.

627
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,640
RECUSAL LETTER

628
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,280
The general and his wife
just filed a petition

629
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,760
to have you removed
from the panel of judges.

630
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,760
They claimed that
your mom is their creditor.

631
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,360
Is that true?

632
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,040
That's the first I've heard of it.

633
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,800
They believe that
you had their property seized

634
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,000
so your mom could collect their debt.

635
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,480
They said your mom
lent them her ruby necklace.

636
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,400
So they don't believe
that you'll give them a fair trial.

637
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,960
I'm the one who should be
demanding justice.

638
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,280
We'll have to postpone the trial

639
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,480
until this matter is resolved.

640
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,960
Will you be willing
to drop out of the case?

641
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,760
Or would you like to plead your case?

642
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,000
Is everything all right?

643
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,120
- Sir.
- Hey.

644
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,120
Is it true that you got dismissed?

645
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,160
How much will this affect the case?

646
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Will the trial be postponed?

647
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,920
Please answer our questions.

648
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,800
The court is reviewing the petition,

649
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,200
but I can assure you that
it will have no effect on the trial.

650
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,280
Why were you dismissed from the case?

651
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,200
- Wait, sir.
- Sir.

652
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,440
- Sir, wait.
- Calm down, everyone.

653
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,200
Please excuse us. Sir.

654
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,360
We have a problem.

655
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,040
That ex-convict was found dead last night.

656
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,840
You asked the deceased to come see you.

657
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,440
Were there issues between you two?

658
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,240
Thank you for your time, ma'am.

659
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,720
Please excuse me.

660
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,080
You've fallen on hard times.

661
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,480
I wouldn't have become a judge
if I was afraid of hardship.

662
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,800
You'll have an easier time
once you're dismissed from service.

663
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,200
Can you answer
a few more questions, ma'am?

664
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,520
Please excuse me.

665
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,640
You must keep doing the right thing.

666
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,480
Your integrity and honesty

667
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,320
are the only things that can save you.

668
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,840
Yes, Dad.

669
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,240
Was he killed because
he betrayed Lady Mayom?

670
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,160
MURDER VICTIM FOUND DEAD IN RIVER

671
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,680
That's probably the case
if it wasn't a murder robbery.

672
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,280
He probably got silenced.

673
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,440
This means that
I'm partly responsible for his death.

674
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,640
That man was sent to terrorize you.

675
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,840
But if we were to tell the police that,

676
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,800
then we would have to tell them
about the bribery.

677
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,600
So we can't say anything.

678
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,440
Mom.

679
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,760
Is it true that Lady Mayom owes you money?

680
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,040
She'd been borrowing money from me.

681
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,280
I lent her my ruby necklace,
but I never thought that

682
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,680
it'd come back to bite me.

683
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,320
Please keep the money.
I heard that you're having problems.

684
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,760
Are you sure?
I want to pay back what I owe you.

685
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,760
We'll become one family one day.

686
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,320
All I ask is that

687
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,200
you help talk Chut up to the general.

688
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,200
I'd appreciate it if the general
could help Chut advance in his career

689
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,200
or give him a chance
to demonstrate his abilities.

690
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,480
I've been praising Chut
to him night and day.

691
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,920
I'm so glad to hear that.

692
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,960
If you ever need my help with anything,

693
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,320
please let me know.

694
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,400
Lady Mayom kidnapped my kid.

695
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,600
Can't we tell the police about that?

696
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,160
If they want to know where we were
at the time of the incident,

697
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,080
Wichai will have to admit that
he went to see Lady Mayom that day.

698
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,560
If what I did causes you
to be investigated for misconduct,

699
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,720
I'll take the blame for everything.

700
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,080
Wichai had nothing to do with the murder.

701
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,920
<i>Wichai might get dismissed
from government service if it turns out</i>

702
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,400
<i>that he engaged in corruption.</i>

703
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,040
I thought you were trying
to make me a scapegoat.

704
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,280
<i>I tried to get you to win the award</i>

705
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,440
<i>knowing it'd make you a nervous wreck.</i>

706
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,600
Wichai.

707
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,080
Do your arms and legs feel weak again?

708
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,400
<i>What did you do
to make Anong come back here?</i>

709
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,760
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

710
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,880
Prasit. Where is Anong?

711
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,040
Don't come near me. You forgot about me.

712
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
<i>I feel a bit sad</i>

713
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,360
<i>that it's going to be
just the three of us.</i>

714
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,560
I wish our baby could be born
into a big family.

715
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,280
Being a dad is also
an important opportunity.

716
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,800
Will you be okay

717
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,560
<i>without me and Wichai?</i>
