00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,000
BASED ON A NOVEL BY DOK MAI SOD

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,240
<i>The defendant who represents
Chamnankan Construction Company</i>

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,360
<i>was found to be negligent
of his duties and must be held liable.</i>

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,960
<i>He must pay the plaintiff compensation
for the damage he caused.</i>

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
<i>Someone broke in last night.</i>

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,960
<i>Does it have to do with the case?</i>

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,160
<i>Maybe they are trying to get back at us.</i>

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>Don't tell Anong about this.
Just keep an eye on things for now.</i>

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,480
<i>I'll make everyone jealous of you
for having the best partner.</i>

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,360
You'll have the best wife
a man could ask for.

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,280
<i>I can handle everything
that I've read about you.</i>

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,479
<i>Then that means
we can spend our lives together.</i>

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Are you asking me to marry you?

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Can you go wait for me in Bangkok?

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,960
<i>If we're to get married, I want
to do it right according to traditions.</i>

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
<i>You have to promise me
that we'll live together</i>

17
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>once we're married.</i>

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,960
<i>I refuse to be away from you.</i>

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,920
- How's the food?
- I haven't tried it.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
We're just about to eat.

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,880
- Here comes the food.
- It's about time.

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
- It looks delicious.
- Let's eat, everyone.

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,240
- Here you go.
- I want to try everything.

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,680
Hey.

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,600
Just so you know.

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
I had no part in planning
this surprise wedding.

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
You can't say I forced your hand.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,680
I know our wedding should be grander
for a woman of your status.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,840
Let's eat.

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,040
Everyone here is happy for us.

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
I still don't know

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,120
whether anyone back home
will be happy for us like these people.

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,600
That's true.

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
Who knows how our families will react?

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Everyone here sees us
as part of their community.

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,920
That's why they organized
this wedding for us.

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
This means that

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,800
we probably won't be able

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,080
to settle down anywhere else.

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,840
We'll have to make this place our home.

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm going to throw you
another wedding anyway

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,040
even if you're not asking me to.

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
You'll have the best wedding
that I can give you.

44
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,440
I promise.

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,800
Hey.

46
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,520
You should go into the bedroom.

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
- Yes.
- That's right.

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,640
Just go to your bedroom.

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,400
You must wait for the right time
according to ancient tradition.

50
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,760
After the wedding ceremony,

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,920
the bride and groom must abstain
from physical intimacy.

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,200
You must keep this bowl on the bed
between you until three days have passed.

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,160
I see.

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,960
All right, then.

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,880
Can you wait that long, Wichai?

56
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
Actually, you two have been
living together for a while.

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
This probably won't be necessary.

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,840
Wait, ma'am.
I'd rather follow the tradition.

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,000
You don't need this.

60
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,040
Have some water.

61
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,080
All taken care of.

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
- Here.
- Hey!

63
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
They threw away the bowl.

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Give me your hand, Wichai.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,960
- All right.
- Can I have your hand, dear?

66
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,000
I wish you two a long and happy marriage.

67
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,320
May you two be together
until you're old and grey

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,520
with lots of kids and grandchildren.

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,760
Hey. Prasit.

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,120
- Come on out.
- Right.

71
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,440
I hope you have kids soon.

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
This is my home now.

73
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,160
What are you doing?

74
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,720
There will be no wedding

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,240
until I get permission from your family.

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,480
If we get married
without telling your family,

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
I'll be disrespecting them and you.

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Do you mean the wedding today
doesn't count?

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,440
I just don't want your family to know
we're living here together

80
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
and think we did anything inappropriate.

81
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
Anong.

82
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,920
You should go back to Bangkok
like we talked about.

83
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,200
You're so old-fashioned.

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
I am.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I want us to legally register our marriage
before we live together,

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,800
so we both have nothing to hide
from our families.

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,840
So I guess we're not married.

88
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,400
But…

89
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,720
can we have our honeymoon now?

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,760
Everyone here organized a wedding for us.

91
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,640
It would be rude if I left right away.

92
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,040
At least let me stay
for another two weeks until the festival.

93
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,480
I want to help out

94
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,040
to thank everyone
for throwing us a wedding today.

95
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,760
We can sleep in separate rooms.

96
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,320
In two weeks,

97
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,280
you'll probably have
all your cases sorted out.

98
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,800
We both can go home together after that.

99
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,600
I promise I won't tell anyone

100
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,680
that I ran away to Trang to be with you.

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Will you two be all right by yourselves?

102
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,280
Anong just told me she'll stay
until the festival next month.

103
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,600
I hope nothing bad happens
in the meantime.

104
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,440
I heard that Thian-chai lost
a lot of business since the trial.

105
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,440
I was afraid he'd send someone
to cause trouble today.

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,400
Carry this with you if you're worried.

107
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,680
If anyone comes to mess with you,

108
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
shoot the gun into the sky

109
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,240
and I'll come right away.

110
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,040
If Anong finds out
that we're being terrorized,

111
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
she will never go back to Bangkok.

112
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,760
Hey.

113
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,520
Why haven't you showered?

114
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm not really used to

115
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,600
sharing my bathroom with anyone.

116
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
The bathroom is a mess.

117
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,200
One of the guests
must've come to smoke in here.

118
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
If you want me

119
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,760
to go wash myself outside,
I don't think I can do that either.

120
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,560
Am I being too fussy?

121
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
Not at all.

122
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,560
It's no big deal.

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Don't worry. I'll clean up the mess.

124
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,800
Thank you.

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,440
We can celebrate
our wedding night right here.

126
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,800
What's taking him so long?

127
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,280
Huh?

128
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
The bathroom looks clean.

129
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,880
Don't tell me

130
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
you're trying to practice abstinence.

131
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,280
Are you meditating?

132
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,520
Hey.

133
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

134
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,040
- Wichai.
- The mosquito net fell down.

136
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I see. My gosh.

137
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
- That's my leg, Wichai.
- Right.

138
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
What are you looking for?

139
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm sorry. My bad.

140
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,440
- Hold on.
- My gosh!

141
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,680
Wichai.

142
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,360
Don't move. Just stay still.

143
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,760
Be gentle, Wichai.

144
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,160
Scoot over a little.

145
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,360
It's getting hot in here.

146
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
I'm trying my best.

147
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,760
What are you doing?

148
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
It's late.

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,800
Well…

150
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,800
The mosquito net fell down.

151
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,280
That's all.

152
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,160
That's all that happened.

153
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
We weren't doing anything.

154
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Are you sure about that?

155
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
- Prasit.
- Wichai, wait.

156
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,240
Your pants.

157
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,520
Prasit.

158
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,600
Prasit.

159
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Wait.

160
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,560
Is something wrong?
Why are you here so early?

161
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,480
- Let me--
- No!

162
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,640
What do you mean it's early? It's late.

163
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,120
I want to explain about earlier.

164
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
It was really nothing. We were just…

165
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,560
Wait.

166
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,360
How did you get in here?

167
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
Wasn't the door locked?

168
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,960
The door was open,
so I thought you guys were up.

169
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
Did you guys celebrate
your wedding night here?

170
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,560
I didn't know you knew how to cook.

171
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,440
You make me feel like a bad girlfriend.

172
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,200
Well…

173
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,640
I want to make up
for falling asleep last night.

174
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,560
I usually go to bed

175
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,240
about the same time
you get up to go give alms.

176
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm going to try
to wake up early from now on.

177
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Why do you have to do that?
You can get up whenever you want.

178
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,280
What is it?

179
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,680
I…

180
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,040
I'm afraid that I won't be able
to measure up to what you had before.

181
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,720
I saw that you still keep
a picture of your late wife.

182
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,839
I can't help comparing myself to her.

183
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,680
<i>I can't help but think
whether you would be</i>

184
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,800
<i>happier than you are now</i>

185
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,960
if you had your ex-wife or Chantorn
here with you instead of me.

186
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,400
I know it's stupid, but…

187
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,880
I really can't help thinking about it.

188
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,440
I made my ex-wife so miserable

189
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,120
that she committed suicide.

190
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,280
Your ex-wife was prevented
from contacting you.

191
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,320
Your mom tried
to get her out of your life.

192
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
That's why she was heartbroken.

193
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,040
It wasn't your fault.

194
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
If she got to be with me,

195
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
she might be even more unhappy.

196
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,960
I was a lousy husband to her.

197
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
You didn't show her that you loved her.

198
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
If you'd shown her that,

199
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,360
she wouldn't have been able to leave you.

200
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,080
Please don't blame yourself.

201
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,320
Why do you think that you're boring?

202
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
Since I was a kid,

203
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
Chut has always been
the one that people remember.

204
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,680
As for me,

205
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,280
people only know me as Chut's brother.

206
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,440
That's because you don't like
to talk about yourself

207
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,720
and you don't talk about others.

208
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
But that doesn't mean you're invisible.

209
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,920
My family loves it

210
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
when you come to our house.

211
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
They always ask about you

212
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,760
when they don't see you around.

213
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,640
Besides,

214
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,240
you're the topic
of every conversation I hear.

215
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
It surprises me

216
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,000
how popular you are.

217
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,080
Wichai.

218
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,560
Every day that
I spend with you is extraordinary.

219
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,080
So how can you say you're boring?

220
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,400
Do you know something?

221
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,480
I used to believe that
I would live a short life like my dad.

222
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,040
But after I recovered from my illness,

223
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm starting to feel
like my life will be happy

224
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
from here on out.

225
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,040
I also feel like
my life is finally worth living

226
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,760
now that we're together.

227
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,040
We wasted so much time
on things that didn't matter.

228
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,040
It's your fault.

229
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
You took forever to know your own heart.

230
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I promise I'll make it up to you.

231
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
We're going to spend
the rest of our lives together.

232
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,280
We have plenty of time.

233
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
It should spin like that.

234
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,080
Is this the right side? Okay.

235
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,760
All right.

236
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,480
Put it up slowly.

237
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
Be careful.

238
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
Anong! Wichai!

239
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
Wait. Come look at this.

240
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Isn't it pretty?

241
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,200
The whole thing was my idea.

242
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Doesn't it look nice?

243
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,400
The wind wheel up there can spin too.

244
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,640
Like this.

245
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
We haven't had any visitors.

246
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,920
People know that we're on our honeymoon.

247
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,320
They probably don't want to disturb us.

248
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,080
Be careful.

249
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,720
I don't have any cases to work on,
so I have time on my hands.

250
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,720
Time passes by so slowly

251
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,480
on our honeymoon.

252
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,400
A day seems to drag on forever.

253
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,000
It's probably because

254
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,360
we're just sitting around doing nothing.

255
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,840
It's because this isn't a real honeymoon.

256
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,560
We still have to wait.

257
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Right.

258
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,960
Do you want a bite?

259
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,000
It looks good.

260
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,240
You sure know how to take care of others.

261
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,960
I usually have to peel fruit for my niece.

262
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
I want to learn how to do it.

263
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,600
Be careful.

264
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
Don't hold the knife like that.

265
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,040
Hold it like this.

266
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,880
- Right.
- Well…

267
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
I…

268
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,280
I just remembered that I have

269
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,040
to organize some documents.

270
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,560
- Is that so?
- Yes.

271
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,000
Did I pick up the chair? Yes, I did.

272
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
All right. I'll clean up here.

273
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,600
Okay.

274
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,520
I'll clean everything up.

275
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,120
All right.

276
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Chut is so in love.
Chantorn is all he wrote about.

277
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,560
I didn't know that
he was so obsessed with his wife.

278
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,880
Well…

279
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,760
You should tell him
about your love life too.

280
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
That's asking for trouble.
Do you want us to get caught?

281
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,200
Can I see what you wrote?

282
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,480
I want to see you brag about me to people.

283
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,560
Hey.

284
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,840
You know that
I don't like to brag to people

285
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,280
about my life.

286
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,400
Can't you write a few sentences
about me to make Chut jealous?

287
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,680
Please?

288
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,360
Fine.

289
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,480
All right.

290
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,720
What should I write about you
that won't raise suspicion?

291
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,400
I'll help you.

292
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
Let me see what you wrote.

293
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,680
Well?

294
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
Wichai.

295
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,920
You wrote about me in every paragraph.

296
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,480
What? Now wait a minute.

297
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,600
When did I write about you?

298
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
You wrote about the eagles.

299
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,120
You told him about the wedding.
Whose wedding was it?

300
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Come on. I just wrote that
I went to a friend's wedding.

301
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,640
You also wrote about
the island that we went to together.

302
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,680
I'm all that you think about.

303
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,920
You can't stop thinking about me.

304
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,880
You're obviously obsessed with me.

305
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,520
You're imagining it.
It's all in your head.

306
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,680
Do you think I'm being obvious?

307
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,520
- Let me rewrite it.
- No. Don't.

308
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,160
It's good the way it is.

309
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,840
It's great.

310
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,200
Don't change anything.

311
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
I'll keep this letter,

312
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,280
so I remember how obsessed you were
with me when we first fell in love.

313
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
I'll help you

314
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,080
write a new letter for Chut.

315
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,960
Start writing.

316
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,680
- What should I write?
- "Hey, Chut.

317
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,760
Last night, I had a dream about Anong."

318
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,600
HEY, CHUT

319
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,760
Is she a clean freak or something?

320
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,600
How often does she shower?

321
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,480
Just leave the laundry there
if you don't want to do it.

322
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,600
I'll do it myself.

323
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,400
You're spoiling her.

324
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,920
You're even worse

325
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
than a love-crazed teenager.

326
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,960
If you love her,

327
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,400
then I'll be supportive.

328
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,720
Here.

329
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,240
You newlyweds.

330
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,960
You can't take your eyes off each other.

331
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,880
I have to make sure
no one's here to hurt us.

332
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,920
That's just an excuse.

333
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Just admit you want to be near her.

334
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,920
Hey.

335
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,720
I dropped the spade.

336
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,320
Come on. Get up.

337
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,080
Let me do it.

338
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,960
Last time, I taught you
to weave a shawl for your husband.

339
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,480
Today, I'll teach you

340
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,000
to weave fabric for your son.

341
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,440
Okay. Which color of yarn should I use?

342
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
This one.

343
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,640
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you.

344
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Will we hear good news from you soon?

345
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,360
What good news?

346
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,640
You're already married,
so kids are the next step.

347
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,280
I thought you were weaving
fabric for your son.

348
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,080
No.

349
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,360
Are you here to weave?

350
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,960
Will I hear good news from you?

351
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,720
No. I'm actually here to see you.

352
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,120
Do you know

353
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,400
how jealous I am of you?

354
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
You're a department store heiress,

355
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,240
but you ran away here to be with a man.

356
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,400
You're free to live the way you want.

357
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,200
It's different for me.

358
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,400
If my husband gets convicted,

359
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,760
I'll have to move to Penang with him.

360
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,000
Evidence to shut down the mine?

361
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,320
There's proof that
Thian-chai committed tax fraud.

362
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,080
He falsified the amount
of ore that was mined

363
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,240
to reduce his taxes.

364
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,400
Someone sent me these documents
to expose him.

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,720
Who sent you these?

366
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,120
I don't know.

367
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,480
All I know is that

368
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,920
this person wants me
to help them take Thian-chai down.

369
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,720
Someone really wants

370
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,320
to take down the mayor and his son-in-law

371
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,720
while remaining anonymous.

372
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,520
Are you going to do as this person wants?

373
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,800
Though I know they're corrupt,

374
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,760
I have no personal grudge
against the mayor and Thian-chai.

375
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,960
I want to get rid of the corruption here,

376
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,760
but I have to think
whether it's worth the risk.

377
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,440
I'm not worried for myself.

378
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,680
But I don't want to also put you at risk.

379
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,280
Is this the reason why

380
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,240
you want me to go back to Bangkok?

381
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,400
No matter where I'm stationed,

382
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm always at risk of being terrorized
by those whom I've crossed.

383
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,679
But now that I have you,
I have to think about your safety.

384
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,400
I know that you're worried about me,

385
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,280
but I don't want you
to decide anything for me.

386
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,560
We should be making decisions together,

387
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,600
not making decisions for each other.

388
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,719
We'll decide together
what we're going to do about this.

389
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,760
First of all, we need
to find out who this person is

390
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,120
and whether they mean us well.

391
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,160
Wichai, can I try that?

392
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,160
- Sure.
- What are they?

393
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,680
They're rice balls wrapped in palm leaves.

394
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,320
Wichai.

395
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
She's right there.

396
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,600
Should we just go
and ask her about the documents?

397
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,040
- Come on.
- Anong.

398
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Let's wait.

399
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,400
Let's wait for her
to show her true colors.

400
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,680
Anong.

401
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,440
Look at this.

402
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,560
Give it a try.

403
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,280
Wait.

404
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,200
- Gosh.
- Anong.

405
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,920
That's disgusting, Prasit.

406
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,880
- Is it really that bad?
- Yes.

407
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,840
Are you pregnant?

408
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
She just ate something bad.
It's not morning sickness.

409
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,120
I'll bring the baby to meet everyone
at the festival in October.

410
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,760
You'll give people the wrong idea.

411
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,360
Why would you say that?

412
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,840
People think we're married.
This won't make us look bad.

413
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,560
You said October, right?

414
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,120
- Do I hang them on the hook?
- Yes.

415
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,840
Does this festival help bring rain?

416
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
Not exactly.

417
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,960
The festival is believed to help
bring prosperity to the community

418
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,760
and help strengthen harmony
between villages.

419
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,160
I see.

420
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
Don't think too much about it.
Let's just have fun.

421
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,200
Have fun?

422
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,560
Just don't go beat up anyone if you lose.

423
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,360
What? Will people fight?

424
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,320
This is about pride.
We can't lose to the other team.

425
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,800
All right, Boi. Let's do this.

426
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
Let's go.

427
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,040
You can stay in front of me.

428
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,360
You got this, Wichai.

429
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,120
Come on, guys. Let's work together.

430
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,640
- Yes!
- All right!

431
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,480
Keep pulling!

432
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Pull!

433
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,160
- Gosh!
- I knew this would happen.

434
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
- No!
- Prasit!

435
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,520
Prasit!

436
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,280
Prasit!

437
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,360
Your head is bleeding!

438
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
That's the bastard.

439
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,240
Wichai.

440
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Prasit.

441
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,760
- Boi! Get over here!
- Prasit.

442
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,120
Prasit.

443
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,320
Prasit, can you hear me?

444
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,040
I'm right here. Prasit.

445
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,960
Please wake up.

446
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,760
Are you in a lot of pain, Prasit?
Why won't you wake up?

447
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,160
He's awake.

448
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,680
Prasit.

449
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,880
Don't be scared.

450
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,160
You're safe now.

451
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,320
My head hurts.

452
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,440
Prasit.

453
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,640
You cracked your head.

454
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,520
Are you hurt anywhere else?

455
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,240
Pong.

456
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
Pong?

457
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,120
What is he doing here?

458
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,720
Do you think you're playing hide-and-seek?

459
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,440
Have you had enough fun?

460
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,200
Does someone have to die
before you come to your senses?

461
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,680
Sompong, wait. Goodness!

462
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
- Anong.
- Young lady.

463
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,680
You're pregnant.
You need to watch your step.

464
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,960
You lied to me that you were in Hua Hin

465
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,480
when you were actually here with a man.

466
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,840
What are you playing at, Anong?

467
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,640
I just came here
to set things straight with Wichai.

468
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,400
Are you afraid
no one will want to marry you?

469
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,080
Is that why you chase after this guy?

470
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,240
I already thought things through
before coming here.

471
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,040
Wichai can't even protect you.

472
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,440
It was his fault

473
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,560
that Prasit almost died.

474
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,200
That wasn't Wichai's fault.

475
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Someone's trying to hurt him.

476
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,480
You're making a mistake, Anong.

477
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,760
A man like him can't take care of you.

478
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,200
I don't see how this is Wichai's fault.

479
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,920
Why should I regret anything?

480
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Anong.

481
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,720
His bluntness makes him
the enemy of everyone.

482
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,320
He got you to think

483
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,600
that he's so much better
than everybody else.

484
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,160
His arrogance is the reason
someone is trying to kill him.

485
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,320
He'll never get anywhere in life.

486
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,080
It's why he's stuck here.

487
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,360
Wichai is just a victim
who's being terrorized by evil people.

488
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,640
I love him for the person he is.

489
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,680
I won't blame anyone even if
it turns out I made a wrong decision.

490
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,720
I won't regret anything.

491
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,560
- Anong.
- It's my choice to be with this man.

492
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,920
You have to go home. It's not safe here.

493
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,640
You're not afraid to be here,
so I'll stay here with you.

494
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,040
We can't change the world by ourselves.
These things take time.

495
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,680
You should take Prasit to recover at home.

496
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,440
Catch the person behind this

497
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
and follow me home soon.

498
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,320
I appreciate your concern.

499
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,520
But I'd feel worse
if someone got hurt because of me.

500
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,480
Anong.

501
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,720
You don't have to defend me anymore.

502
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,600
What I did was wrong
and I'll go apologize to your family.

503
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,240
I'm already so grateful
that you lowered yourself to be with me.

504
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,400
Come on.

505
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,320
We can't live in the world
with just the two of us.

506
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,000
If we live as we please without caring
about who we hurt or disappoint,

507
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,640
then it's us who are the selfish ones.

508
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,080
Your family is also my family.

509
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,720
What they think matters to me.

510
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,880
Our parents never let you suffer
a day in your life.

511
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,960
How do you think they would feel

512
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,320
if they saw their dearest daughter

513
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,120
just throw her life away?

514
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,200
The police still can't find the shooter.

515
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,080
They will keep an eye on Thian-chai
and his men as suspects.

516
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,280
He sent a man to kill you
right at the festival.

517
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,240
Who does he think he is?

518
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,480
We're lucky everyone is safe.

519
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,480
People were gossiping at the market

520
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,400
that no one in his family
came to the festival.

521
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,520
It's like they knew
there would be a shooting.

522
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,200
If Thian-chai really sent
someone to kill you,

523
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,160
I hope karma catches up with him.

524
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
He needs to be locked up behind bars.

525
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,560
KANTANG TRAIN STATION

526
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,520
Hello.

527
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,560
This is my wife.

528
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,440
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

529
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,840
Was it difficult to get here?

530
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,000
Not at all. Thank you for asking.

531
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,800
Let me know if I can help with anything.

532
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,400
Thank you so much.

533
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,480
KANTANG TRAIN STATION

534
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,880
I hope we'll get to see each other again.

535
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,240
Did you tell Pong that I'm here?

536
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,920
We're both in the same position.
Why would I do that?

537
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
The police still can't find the shooter.

538
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,160
But they caught Thian-chai's driver

539
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,320
who was in contact with the shooter.

540
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,360
So it was really Thian-chai
who hired the gunman?

541
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,320
Eiam confessed he knew the shooter,
but he didn't help him escape.

542
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,120
He said he'll help
the police catch the guy.

543
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,960
He said the shooter was hired
to kill Thian-chai's wife, not you.

544
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,000
Anong.

545
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,160
What are you doing here?
Aren't you leaving?

546
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,040
I know who sent you
the documents about the mine.

547
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,760
She wants us to help her
get rid of Thian-chai.

548
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,040
Because if we can put Thian-chai in jail,

549
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,160
she will have her freedom.

550
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,960
And this person is Thian-chai's wife?

551
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
Yes.

552
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,440
She told me that
she was forced to marry Thian-chai.

553
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,240
They didn't get married because of love.

554
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,160
That kid isn't his legitimate son.

555
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,400
And that woman is only his mistress.

556
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,600
This is his wife.

557
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,960
<i>Thian-chai married his wife
to gain power and influence.</i>

558
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,360
<i>He blamed her for not being able
to give him children.</i>

559
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,280
<i>Then he cheated on her</i>

560
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,720
with countless women.

561
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,080
His wife gave the documents
about the mine to the mayor.

562
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,400
But since Thian-chai is the one
running the family business,

563
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,400
the mayor let the matter slide.

564
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,920
He turned a blind eye
to Thian-chai's corruption

565
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,880
and helped cover up his crimes.

566
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,160
Once Thian-chai knew
his wife tried to expose him,

567
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,040
he hired someone to kill her.

568
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,920
He knows the mayor needs him

569
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,040
more than he needs his daughter.

570
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,240
About what happened yesterday,

571
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,640
the gunman wasn't sent there to kill us.

572
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,360
Thian-chai got Sompong involved
so he could get rid of us.

573
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,280
That day when Thian-chai's wife
came to talk to me,

574
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,560
<i>she tried to give me a warning.</i>

575
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,240
<i>She tried to warn me
that Pong was on his way here.</i>

576
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,880
<i>She probably wants us as allies.</i>

577
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,720
She wants us to help her fight back
and put her husband in jail.

578
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,160
Thian-chai actually tried
to get his driver

579
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,680
to be the one to kill his wife.

580
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,680
But the driver refused to do it,

581
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,000
so he had to hire a gunman.

582
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,040
- Gosh!
- I knew this would happen.

583
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,360
- No!
- Prasit!

584
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,120
Prasit.

585
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,080
Prasit.

586
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,160
That's the bastard!

587
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,120
<i>Yesterday, Eiam knew that
a gunman was coming to kill me.</i>

588
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,720
He was going to make it look like

589
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,000
a fight broke out between two villages.

590
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,520
So Eiam sneaked me out of there.

591
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,080
Wichai.

592
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,640
She's right there.

593
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,680
<i>He had a woman pretend to be me</i>

594
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,440
<i>to lure the gunman to the festival.</i>

595
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,960
Anong.

596
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Let's wait.

597
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,240
Let's wait for her
to show her true colors.

598
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
You're not safe here.

599
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,360
<i>Once Thian-chai knew that Eiam saved me,</i>

600
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,640
he threatened to tell everyone

601
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,360
that Eiam and I were having an affair.

602
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,000
He said he was going to divorce me.

603
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,800
My reputation will be destroyed.

604
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,160
Even my own father will want
nothing to do with me.

605
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,240
That's why I'm in this state.

606
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,160
Men like to decide
how we women should live our lives.

607
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,520
But few of them are willing
to get hurt for us.

608
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,040
If you find someone like that,
don't ever let him go.

609
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

610
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,160
I didn't try to kill her.

611
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,160
Where were you during the incident?

612
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,320
I was at the market.

613
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,320
Anong.

614
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,240
Did you come here to tell me this?

615
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,040
Thian-chai's wife wanted me to ask you

616
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,920
if you would help her
file a divorce against her husband.

617
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,320
I think I should go back to Bangkok.

618
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,040
I don't want you to deal
with your family on your own.

619
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,840
All along,

620
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,720
you've always been the one
to stand up for me.

621
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,040
It's time for me to go back
and face the problems myself.

622
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,720
Prasit.

623
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,160
Where is Anong?

624
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,200
What?

625
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,560
Where is Anong?

626
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,280
I don't know.

627
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,160
Don't tell me she ran back to Wichai.

628
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,240
You're so useless.

629
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,560
Go and find Anong.
Bring her back here to me.

630
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,600
Yes, sir.

631
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,920
KANTANG TRAIN STATION

632
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,360
Where have you been?

633
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,360
The police now know that
the gunman didn't try to shoot Wichai.

634
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,240
He wasn't the reason that Prasit got hurt.

635
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,520
So you're just going to stay here

636
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,400
until someone actually comes for you?

637
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,120
I'm going back with you.

638
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,560
But not before he brings
someone here to justice.

639
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,360
I won't make him stay with me.

640
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,600
Wichai.

641
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,000
Help give a new life
to a woman who's lost hope.

642
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,160
Please help her get away
from that horrible man.

643
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,080
That's what's most important right now.

644
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
Why are you doing this?

645
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,760
I'll come back here after we get married.

646
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
Please prove to me

647
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,480
that I've chosen the right guy.

648
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,680
Don't just assume things.

649
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,160
I never said I'd let Anong marry you.

650
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,920
Can I have a word with you?

651
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,360
I don't know what caused us
to have a falling-out.

652
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,800
You really don't know?

653
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,960
I asked you to help look out for Anong,

654
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,120
but you ended up taking her for yourself.

655
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,960
I know you want Anong
to be with a better man than me.

656
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,280
You took advantage of her.

657
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,760
I swear on my life that
we didn't do anything inappropriate.

658
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,960
Yet you let Anong stay with you for months

659
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,600
and did God knows what with her.

660
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,000
It's fine if you don't believe me.

661
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,960
But show some respect
when you talk about your sister.

662
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,880
It just feels personal how you try
to get me out of Anong's life.

663
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,600
I don't like how you made
the guys in her life look like jerks.

664
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,920
You even turned against your own brother

665
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,480
and made him look
like a fool in Anong's eyes.

666
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,920
And now you're making me
look like the bad guy.

667
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,280
I won't let you turn my family
against each other.

668
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,600
Let me tell you something.

669
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,360
I've never even told Anong
about you and Prapat.

670
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,760
She wouldn't mind even if I told her.

671
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,240
She would understand.

672
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,640
Leave Prapat out of this.

673
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,640
There's nothing shameful about your love.

674
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,560
But you're trying to hide your faults
by projecting them onto me.

675
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,920
That's what you should be ashamed of.

676
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,760
The truth is, we should be able
to love whoever we want.

677
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,360
A girl like Anong showed us that.

678
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,760
Don't make your sister think of you
as another lousy man in her life.

679
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,440
Is everything all right?

680
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,560
<i>"The beautiful socialist

682
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,760
I knew that girl was up to no good.

683
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,360
I'm marrying Anong.

684

<i>Are you going to take

685

<i>Just wait until the baby is born.</i>

686
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,880
Then we'll see whether
the baby really is Wichai's.

687
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,800
If the baby takes after his father,

688
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,040
I know he will have good manners.

692

He's probably lost at sea somewhere.

All we can do is pray for his safety.

695
