1
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
Miss Asi has had too much to drink

2
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,200
We should send her back

3
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,133
I haven't finished this wine yet

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,833
If you're still not satisfied

5
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,466
Just continue

6
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:41,733
I'll take her home first

7
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,333
I

8
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,200
I can still drink

9
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,366
I'm not drunk

10
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:09,900
Quick, someone

11
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,133
Not drunk at all

12
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:14,633
Thank you, young master

13
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,900
For bringing our eldest young lady back

14
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,366
Miss Asi drank too much

15
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,666
Take good care of her

16
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,233
That guy

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,033
Could he still be drinking?

18
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,200
Here, for you

19
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,600
Young master

20
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,766
Young master

21
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,900
Where is your residence?

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,066
Do you need

23
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,300
Someone to escort you home?

24
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,000
Residence

25
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:54,900
Go home?

26
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,333
They all left me behind and went away

27
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,700
I'm not going back

28
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,600
You, go, go, go

29
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:08,866
At such a young age

30
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,733
Why drown your sorrows in alcohol?

31
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,833
Go back early

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,633
Sleep it off and forget everything

33
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,900
Even if I go back, he ignores me

34
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,433
All along

35
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,233
We were the closest of friends

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,333
Promised to trust each other in life and death

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
In the blink of an eye, he won't even speak to me

38
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,100
Cheat

39
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,566
Then it must be that you did something

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,433
That let your friend down

41
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,000
I shouldn't have been suspicious of him

42
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,400
When people meet each other

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's fate, and it should be cherished

44
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,300
The world is unpredictable

45
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,366
Having one true friend in life is enough

46
00:03:58,566 --> 00:03:59,433
Especially

47
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,600
The companions made in youth

48
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,633
Are even more precious

49
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,766
Rare and precious

50
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,766
A little misunderstanding doesn't matter

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,600
The two brothers just need to have an open conversation.

52
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,800
Close friends

53
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,233
Close friends

54
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,166
I really want to

55
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,433
continue being friends with him

56
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,800
Brother Tao

57
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,466
Brother Jiang, here

58
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,100
How is it

59
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,433
Just picked

60
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,100
Brother Xin

61
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:30,866
Hmm

62
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,100
How did I get back last night

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,833
Brother E Shun brought you back

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm telling you

65
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,866
If you're going to drink in the future, have some good wine

66
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,800
Don’t always go to those taverns

67
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,633
and drink that cheap liquor

68
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,633
The next day, your head is splitting with pain

69
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,300
It’s the worst for your health

70
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,366
Really?

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,666
But he wasn’t—

72
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,433
He was the one who brought you back

73
00:05:58,433 --> 00:05:59,700
late last night

74
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,400
Let’s go

75
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,666
Last night, you were the one who brought me back

76
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:24,666
Sorry

77
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:25,966
I drank too much

78
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,333
Don't remember anything

79
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:30,166
Thank you

80
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:36,733
No need

81
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:38,900
If something happens to you

82
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:40,866
We all get punished

83
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm doing this for myself too

84
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,600
Good

85
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,266
Good

86
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:02,466
Good, very good

87
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,633
Brother Chong is impressive

88
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,200
Good

89
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,600
Good

90
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,366
Good

91
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,800
Not good

92
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:45,766
Not good

93
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,666
Not good, not good

94
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,233
What's wrong

95
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,766
Tomorrow's Gaomei sacrificial wine feast

96
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,666
Chong of Libei

97
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,566
The Crown Prince Chong and his wife

98
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:02,866
Are also coming

99
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,233
The Crown Prince Chong is coming

100
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,366
Why are they coming

101
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
I heard the relationship between the two brothers

102
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,233
Isn't very good

103
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,133
The Gaomei Sacrifice is just

104
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,400
An old minor ritual in the Eastern Realm to worship the ancestral founder

105
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,800
Although every year we invite the heirs of the various feudal lords

106
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,566
often those who come to the banquet

107
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,933
are merely envoys

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,133
This time, the heir of the Northern Bo Marquis

109
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,400
has come in person

110
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,100
I wonder what the deeper meaning is

111
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,100
This year, due to the matter of the heir's camp

112
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,000
Donglu is in the spotlight

113
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:43,700
No matter what

114
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,900
it's better to be cautious

115
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,000
The heir of the Northern Bo Marquis has come from afar

116
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
we failed to greet you properly

117
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,333
please do not take offense

118
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,566
General Jiang, you are too polite

119
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,166
We in Libei are not like Donglu

120
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,333
we never stand on such ceremony

121
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:21,966
The Gaomei Festival ceremony

122
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,566
has always been a minor event in the eastern region

123
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,300
Why trouble the heir

124
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
to grace us with your presence in person

125
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,166
On this trip, I have come

126
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,966
not only to congratulate the Gaomei Festival

127
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,300
but also for another matter

128
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,600
There are more important matters to attend to.

129
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,833
Has General Jiang forgotten

130
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,700
my younger brother Chong Yibiao

131
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,000
is still troubling your esteemed territory?

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,300
As his older brother,

133
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,200
I naturally wished to pay him a visit.

134
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,933
Could it be that General Jiang

135
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,633
does not welcome this heir?

136
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Of course, you are welcome.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,766
Most welcome indeed.

138
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,100
The Marquis's residence has prepared a banquet

139
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,266
to welcome Your Highness.

140
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,500
Your Highness, please.

141
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:09,366
Lady about.

142
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:21,566
Isn't this Lady Asi?

143
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:23,033
What are you doing here?

144
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,033
What a coincidence, isn't it?

145
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,833
My Li family is assisting the Dongwu Marquis's residence

146
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,766
in co-hosting the Gaomei Festival.

147
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,733
Naturally, I came

148
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:29,466
at General Jiang's invitation.

149
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,900
Your appearance—

150
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,733
Why is your face all red?

151
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,433
Are you feeling unwell?

152
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,133
But.

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Miss but

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,266
You are truly elegant and refined today

155
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,933
Exceptionally radiant and magnificent

156
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:49,533
You flatter me, Lord Eshun

157
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,866
Yes, yes, that is a bit excessive

158
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,533
Right, Eshun?

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
Look at that expression of yours

160
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,166
Lord Eshun here

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,900
Doesn't even want to acknowledge you

162
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,066
Right, Eshun?

163
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:01,566
Let's go

164
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:04,766
Li Asi

165
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,433
Stop trying to sow discord

166
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,266
Wait for me

167
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,866
Let go, let go, let go

168
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:11,800
Run quickly, run quickly

169
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
The banquet is about to begin

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,433
Let me tell you

171
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:14,900
This female bandit runs really fast

172
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:15,533
Run quickly

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,266
This woman is really

174
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,333
Chong Yibiao's sister-in-law

175
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,400
The Northern Earl's daughter-in-law

176
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,466
Not bad at all

177
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,600
I, the heir, represent North Li

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,333
Respectfully celebrate the
Donglu Gaomei Festival ceremony.

179
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,800
Successfully held

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,433
The dance performed by my wife

181
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,766
is precisely the most sublime

182
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,466
If dance of libei

183
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,566
to show respect

184
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,500
The Crown Prince's arrival from afar

185
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,500
is already an honor for our Eastern Lu

186
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,800
I specifically ordered my wife to offer this dance

187
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,800
making our Eastern Wuhou Residence

188
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,066
radiate with splendor

189
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:25,933
Indeed

190
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,633
The Crown Princess is both talented and beautiful

191
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,166
She can be called

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,866
a rare beauty

193
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,466
The Crown Prince did not hesitate

194
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,133
to allow his esteemed wife to dance for us

195
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,166
It was truly a feast for the eyes

196
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:37,866
Indeed

197
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,833
This dance of the Crown Princess

198
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,300
is something we have never seen before

199
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,466
Yes, yes

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,833
Brother

201
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,966
It has been a long time since you last saw your brother and sister-in-law

202
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:57,400
Have you missed them?

203
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,433
This dance by your sister-in-law

204
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,266
The Crown Princess's performance of the Andai dance

205
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,366
Exotic and enchanting

206
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,266
Wild, unrestrained, and swaying with grace

207
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,233
Truly embodying steadiness, lightness, softness, and beauty

208
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:27,900
All in one

209
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,266
It is absolutely marvelous, simply marvelous

210
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,800
To have such a beauty

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
The Crown Prince is truly fortunate

212
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,833
Crown Prince, a toast to you

213
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,233
Thank you for the Crown Prince's offering

214
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,566
The banquet has already begun

215
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,966
Please invite the Crown Princess to take her seat quickly

216
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,366
This Chong Yiwu

217
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,000
Will he really act as we expect?

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,100
The hatred between the brothers

219
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,200
Has left no room for reconciliation

220
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,733
As long as the piece named Chong Yiwu remains

221
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:23,000
He will surely disrupt the Crown Prince's camp and bring them no peace

222
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:25,000
Are you so certain?

223
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:29,833
Of course

224
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,233
The first toast of tonight's banquet

225
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,200
Should naturally be offered to

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,666
General Jiang's

227
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:52,700
But this second cup of wine

228
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,533
shall be offered to

229
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,800
my savior from Chong Yiwu

230
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,133
Crown Prince E Shun

231
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,400
If Chong is not good and causes much disturbance

232
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,733
then there is no need to stand on ceremony

233
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,533
What you all may not know

234
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,566
is that back on my wedding day

235
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,600
my younger brother Chong Yibiao

236
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,966
drew his blade against me

237
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:47,433
Fortunately, my worthy brother E Shun

238
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:48,566
risked his life to save me

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,633
Only then did I, the Crown Prince, escape calamity

240
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:52,966
Could it be

241
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,833
that the scar on E Shun's chest

242
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,700
was inflicted by Brother Chong?

243
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,466
No wonder Brother Chong repeatedly targets him

244
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,366
So this is the cause and effect

245
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,300
Such deep-seated enmity and hatred

246
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,600
How could Brother E endure it?

247
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,166
Worthy brother E Shun

248
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:09,966
please, go ahead

249
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,633
Since the Crown Prince is so nostalgic

250
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,500
I wonder if he still remembers

251
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,500
On the day of the grand wedding

252
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,433
My promise to you

253
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,800
Today, you have made an enemy of Brother Chong

254
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,633
In the future, my Marquis of Nanbo's estate

255
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,400
Will surely, for generations to come

256
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,033
Be your enemy

257
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,900
May I ask, Crown Prince

258
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,566
Is the trade route in Libei still unobstructed?

259
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:47,766
So all these years

260
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,400
It was you who blocked the Libei trade route

261
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,933
It seems my younger brother

262
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,366
Did not strike you hard enough with that blade

263
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,066
Worthy brother E Shun

264
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,666
Still plans so diligently for him even now

265
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,433
I can't help but feel your kindness

266
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,566
Has been mistaken for a dog's liver and lungs

267
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,033
I only do what I wish to do

268
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,033
And fulfill the promises I have made

269
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,566
It has nothing to do with anyone else

270
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,466
As for the Libei trade route

271
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,200
As long as it remains blocked for a single day

272
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,733
I'm afraid you, Crown Prince, will find it difficult to

273
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,233
Truly win the public's
support in Libei, right?

274
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,300
You

275
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,533
are my lifesaver

276
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,666
So why is the heir of Beibo Hou so enraged

277
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,900
Please, return to your seat

278
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:31,800
Wait

279
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,766
So it is Young Master Jiang

280
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,833
You did remind me of one thing

281
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,766
Since you are my lifesaver

282
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,833
I should treat you with the highest etiquette

283
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,266
of our Libei

284
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,300
Attendants

285
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,466
Change the wine vessel

286
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,966
This dragon-tiger wine vessel is too large

287
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,633
I’ve never heard of such a rule

288
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,133
Using such a large wine cup for drinking

289
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,766
Wouldn’t that make one drunk after just one cup?

290
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,466
This is clearly meant to make things difficult

291
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,000
In our libei

292
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,633
when treating honored guests

293
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,566
we always use this dragon-tiger wine vessel

294
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,500
Three cups must be drank to count

295
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,200
Oh no

296
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,166
With this guy’s physical condition

297
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:11,900
How can I drink so much

298
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:16,666
Worthy brother

299
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,333
Please go ahead

300
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,133
How

301
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,166
After taking that stab

302
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,100
Can you not even drink alcohol anymore

303
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,066
I never expected Brother E-Shun

304
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,333
To be quite the drinker

305
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,200
Such a large jug

306
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,266
I might not even be able to finish it all myself

307
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,700
Can Brother E's body handle it

308
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,066
Worthy Brother E-Shun is truly bold and unrestrained

309
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,633
This is the second cup

310
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,400
Please go ahead

311
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:01,433
Wait

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,766
Your Highness

313
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,666
There's no need for that, right

314
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,233
Worthy brother's physique

315
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:26,600
Is quite robust

316
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,400
The last cup

317
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:29,766
Please

318
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:40,966
Wait

319
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,733
Libe's Custom

320
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,133
The third cup can be drunk on someone's behalf

321
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,133
Isn't that right, elder brother

322
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,800
I've also drunk elder brother's wine

323
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
This gratitude

324
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,333
I see he received it too.

325
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,133
That's about enough.

326
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,000
Hold on a moment.

327
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,966
You drank the wine from your elder brother.

328
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,100
But the wine from your sister-in-law

329
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,233
You haven't drunk yet.

330
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,933
Xin'er.

331
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,866
Come and propose a toast to your younger brother.

332
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:51,533
Xin'er.

333
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,966
What are you standing there for?

334
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,900
Hurry up and propose the toast.

335
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,533
Second brother, please.

336
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,333
My dear younger brother.

337
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,933
If you don't drink this cup of wine,

338
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,933
You truly would be letting down your sister-in-law.

339
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,266
After all, over all these years,

340
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,233
She has been

341
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,500
Yearning for you day and night.

342
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,933
Xin'er, offer it to him.

343
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:21,466
Second Young Master.

344
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:22,800
Please.

345
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:32,900
Brother Chong's clothes are all wet.

346
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,433
Hurry back and change.

347
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:35,933
The wine of this family

348
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,566
Can be drunk another day; it's not too late.

349
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,366
Everyone, look here.

350
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,533
Everyone, look.

351
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,600
Everyone, open your eyes wide and look clearly.

352
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,400
What is this?

353
00:21:58,966 --> 00:21:59,633
On this handkerchief,

354
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,033
how could there be Chong Yibiao's name?

355
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,933
Could it be that the uncle and sister-in-law

356
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:03,966
truly have an illicit affair?

357
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,866
How utterly shameless and scandalous!

358
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,300
Indeed.

359
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:06,833
Give it back to me.

360
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:07,700
Give it back to me.

361
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,066
You bitch.

362
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,200
You worthless thing, unfit for any decent occasion.

363
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,266
You keep embarrassing me and making a scene.

364
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:14,866
How can you hit a woman?

365
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:16,500
Prince,

366
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,133
this is a banquet hosted by our Eastern Lu.

367
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:19,966
Treating your wife like this

368
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,966
is hardly appropriate, is it?

369
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:22,666
General Jiang,

370
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,566
disciplining my own wife is a family matter.

371
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,233
If General Jiang insists on interfering,

372
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,133
I'm afraid that wouldn't be very appropriate, would it?

373
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,300
Prince,

374
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
that's not how it is.

375
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,066
Then what is this?

376
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,600
How dare you use such a filthy thing

377
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,266
to dirty my eyes

378
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,366
Don't think that just because you have some looks

379
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:40,633
and married into our Beibo Marquis Manor

380
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:42,366
you can cover up your origins

381
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,633
The number one beauty

382
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,633
is nothing more than

383
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:46,933
a dancer from our Libei Grassland

384
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,066
Indeed

385
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,033
the spawn of a lowly woman

386
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,400
just loves to engage in this kind of

387
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,533
filthy, despicable behavior

388
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,900
Some things, since you can't escape them

389
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:08,600
why keep searching endlessly?

390
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:09,966
For example

391
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,533
you are destined not to marry

392
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,633
the one you love

393
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,266
And another example

394
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,366
you two adulterous dogs

395
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,100
are born lowly scum

396
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:19,933
Enough

397
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:29,166
What

398
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,500
Does it hurt?

399
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,700
I'm hitting my own woman

400
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,366
You bastard, how dare you block my way

401
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,400
Say that again

402
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:40,933
I said you're a bastard

403
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,600
Well hit

404
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,300
Chong Yibiao

405
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:47,466
Stop it

406
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,700
Chong Yibiao

407
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,800
Chong Yibiao, you stop right there

408
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,500
Chong Yibiao

409
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,100
Chong Yibiao

410
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,733
Chong Yibiao

411
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:06,300
Chong Yibiao

412
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:08,166
Stop right there

413
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Good

414
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,266
After waiting so long, you've finally made a move

415
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:15,900
My dear brother

416
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:19,700
Was it a long time ago

417
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:20,566
That you wanted to kill me

418
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
You and that bitch

419
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,600
You both want me dead

420
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:31,666
Once I'm dead

421
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,300
You can ascend to the heir position

422
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,500
Don't think I don't know

423
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,533
You're colluding with her in secret

424
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:42,766
Just to seize power and usurp the throne

425
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,100
Chong Yibiao

426
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:46,466
You, for the sake of power

427
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,866
Constantly plot to harm your own brother

428
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:50,266
Truly worthy of being that vile woman's bastard

429
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,933
Indeed shameless and lowborn, deserving of divine retribution

430
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,200
You shut your mouth

431
00:24:58,866 --> 00:24:59,800
Chong Yibiao

432
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,833
Chong Yibiao, you stop right there

433
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:08,966
You'd like me to shut up

434
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,733
But everyone under heaven knows

435
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:11,833
That mother of yours

436
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:14,200
Was that disgraceful horse groom

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,133
Using those filthy methods

438
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,333
To seduce Father

439
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:18,966
Otherwise, how would a bastard like you come to be

440
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,166
And now

441
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,433
You use those same filthy methods

442
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,766
To flirt with the wind and moon alongside your brother's wife

443
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:25,666
You and your birth mother

444
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,966
Truly share the same bloodline

445
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:28,966
Chong Yibiao

446
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,333
Do you even know

447
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:31,866
That your very existence

448
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,266
Is a stain upon the North Bo Marquis Estate

449
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,000
You

450
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,066
are an unforgivable sin

451
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:40,533
You and that bitch of a mother of yours

452
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:42,266
are both lowly scum

453
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:46,500
Chong Yi Wu

454
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,500
I won't allow you to insult my mother

455
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:52,766
Chong Yi Biao

456
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,066
How could he come here

457
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,133
Such a lowly person

458
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,700
The second son is nothing but

459
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,533
the bastard of a horse groom

460
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,400
What are you trying to do

461
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,700
You rebellious son, are you trying to rebel?

462
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,033
Chong Yi Biao, have you gone mad?

463
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,633
Brother Chong

464
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,033
Don't let them

465
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,200
destroy yourself

466
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,666
You're not worth it

467
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,033
What are you here for?

468
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,733
Regarding today's matter

469
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,600
I hope Brother Chong won't take it to heart

470
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,500
Remember, the grass must bend when the wind blows strong

471
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:44,400
It's not your place to speak.

472
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,733
Uncle Bing has already told me.

473
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:50,866
Brother Chong, you went to see him.

474
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,633
So the words just now.

475
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:55,866
Were spoken on behalf of someone else.

476
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,133
A true friend is hard to find.

477
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,466
It's a pity to betray one.

478
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,300
It's raining.

479
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,333
Brother Chong, rest early.

480
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,333
Spring has already arrived.

481
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,200
Why is it still so cold at night?

482
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,666
The rainy night is damp and chilly.

483
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,033
Young master, you should rest early.

484
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,833
I want to listen to the sound of the rain.

485
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,733
You may leave.

486
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,033
Yes.

487
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,400
May I ask the heir,

488
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Is the trade route in Libei

489
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,733
still unobstructed?

490
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:42,900
In the future, my Nanbo Hou Mansion

491
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:46,366
will surely, for generations to come,

492
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:47,700
be your enemy.

493
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:50,633
For three years,

494
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:52,700
the heir drank bitter medicine

495
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:54,166
and suffered immensely,

496
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,100
barely clinging to life.

497
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:58,733
Now the heir is deficient in both qi and blood.

498
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,266
Constitution yin-cold

499
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,733
Even during the dog days of summer, one must don a great cloak

500
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,066
My house's young master says

501
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,500
Young Master Chong was constrained by others in his youth

502
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,866
Aspirations hard to fulfill

503
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,100
Now that he has left the northern lands

504
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:15,600
The world is vast and open

505
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,033
He only wishes the young master to let loose his hands and feet

506
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,533
And grandly display his great plans

507
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,966
Even though things have come to this

508
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,133
You still honor your word
