1
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:47,433
Today

2
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Thank you for your help, miss

3
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,900
Helping me capture Lord Ningbo and his son

4
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,166
You've really done me a great favor

5
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,166
No

6
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,633
Done Donglu a great favor

7
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,666
Weren't you calling me a scoundrel earlier?

8
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,233
For various reasons

9
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,133
I hope you can understand

10
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:07,933
Li Asi

11
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,400
Get a grip

12
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:10,666
You absolutely don't have any

13
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,900
Filthy thoughts about him

14
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:12,966
Even if you do

15
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,000
It's only to repay his

16
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,100
Life-saving grace

17
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,833
Yes, that's right

18
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:23,966
That's all there is to it

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,933
Then let this young lady

20
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,433
Repay you properly

21
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,600
Great kindness doesn't need words of thanks

22
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:04,600
This is your reward

23
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,833
I've given him everything

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,466
Finally, we're even

25
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,100
It must be that scoundrel

26
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,133
Didn't expect them
to be so grateful.

27
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,133
Could it be stolen?

28
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,066
Wait a moment.

29
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,100
That fool Jiang Wanhuan.

30
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,966
Could it be that he doesn't know

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,233
how valuable that pendant is?

32
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,266
Probably not.

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,733
It looks worthless at a glance.

34
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,100
Finally, we've arrived.

35
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,033
Tomorrow,

36
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,333
the Heir's Camp will commence.

37
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,133
These memorials

38
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:52,900
will be presented to the king by the envoy.

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,066
I wonder if the king, upon seeing these memorials,

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,933
will change his mind—

41
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,766
abandoning the search for the elixir of immortality.

42
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,166
The king's word is final.

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,366
How could it change so easily?

44
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,566
The turmoil stirred up today

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,366
by Marquis Ningbo

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,000
reminds me of

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,300
the tragedy sixteen years ago.

48
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,533
If that's the case,

49
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:16,866
then Anashi ending up like this

50
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,400
is precisely because—

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,800
Elixir of Immortality

52
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,900
Sometimes I truly don't know

53
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,233
Whether this is a sacred treasure that protects the nation

54
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,966
Or an abyss of disaster

55
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,000
Back then, His Majesty also sought the elixir

56
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,400
And established the proton camp

57
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,800
The search for the elixir was unsuccessful

58
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,933
Yet it turned the prosperous Ningzhou

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,533
Into a living hell on earth

60
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:50,833
Even you

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,233
Became a refugee

62
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,200
Now

63
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,433
His Majesty has reopened the camp to seek the elixir once more

64
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,566
What exactly does he intend to do

65
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,166
The thoughts of His Majesty

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,366
Are not for the likes of us to speculate

67
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,066
But everything I say is the truth

68
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,833
Should I treat the tragedy sixteen years ago

69
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,366
As if

70
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,400
Nothing ever happened

71
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,966
Then you should understand even more

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,933
That I have more reason than you

73
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:11,866
To detest that tragedy

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,566
Isn't it so

75
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,300
The same tragedy

76
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:15,866
I certainly do not wish

77
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,100
To see it happen a second time

78
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,200
Even less so at the Dongwu Marquisate

79
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,333
Wuyu

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,233
That is why I requested the King

81
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,033
To station the Heir's Camp in Donglu

82
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,000
Reopening the Heir's Camp

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,533
Was decreed by the King himself

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
There is no room for reversal now

85
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,666
But if it is in Donglu

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,533
There remains a glimmer of hope

87
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:39,833
Donglu has you

88
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,466
Only with you there

89
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:43,333
Will Huan'er be safe

90
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,600
It's just that now

91
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,766
The situation is unclear

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,133
With enemies lurking all around

93
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,100
You still need to be cautious

94
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,400
I only hope

95
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,966
You don't have to shoulder everything alone

96
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,366
I can

97
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,366
Thank you for your kindness, Eldest Young Master

98
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,066
Shi'er and I have been through so much over the years

99
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,433
I'm used to it

100
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:14,866
I just hope

101
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,400
It's getting late

102
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,300
You should head back, First Young Master

103
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,166
If all is well, I won't see you off

104
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,933
Rest early

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,300
By the King's decree

106
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,033
The East Martial Marquis Estate

107
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:54,100
Is commanded to establish the Heir Camp

108
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,033
We hope all heirs entering the camp

109
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,466
With heaven and earth as the forge

110
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,866
Will temper their bodies and bones

111
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
So that in days to come, clad in armor

112
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,533
They may tame wild steeds

113
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,800
Capture their chieftains

114
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,166
And present them at the seven temples

115
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,666
Appointing the Minister Gongsun Wuyu

116
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,633
And the Coiled Serpent General Jiang Wenfeng

117
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,900
As joint supervisors

118
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:19,133
To oversee the Heir Camp together

119
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,900
All heirs must attend the training ground for instructions

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,800
Without fail

121
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,333
Why are there only two of you

122
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,533
Where are the others

123
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,100
Big big big

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,200
Small small small

125
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,733
Big big big

126
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,366
Can't handle it anymore

127
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,533
All in

128
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,266
This is betting on big

129
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,933
Up up up

130
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:51,800
I'll do it

131
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,300
I see

132
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:54,800
If I win

133
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,266
Everyone obediently comes back to class with me

134
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,833
Brother Jiang

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,433
A bit too hasty, aren't you?

136
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
This Heluo gambling wheel

137
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,766
Back in Xichuan

138
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,533
I never lost

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,733
Heluo gambling wheel

140
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,600
The name sounds quite intimidating

141
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:11,533
Scared now?

142
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:12,633
I'm telling you

143
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,033
This Heluo gambling wheel

144
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,133
Is made from the ancient Hetu diagram

145
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,666
Once the dice settle

146
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,166
Then we accept our fate

147
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:20,966
Enough talk

148
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:21,933
You go first

149
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,733
Seeing is believing

150
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,800
Open

151
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,466
Big big big

152
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,033
Small small small

153
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,300
Large Large Large

154
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:32,733
eleven

155
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:33,766
twelve

156
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,866
thirteen

157
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,966
Come on, Brother Xin

158
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,000
No need to rush

159
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,100
There's still fourteen and fifteen

160
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,766
What's there to fear

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,533
For everyone to skip class

162
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,266
Here we go

163
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,533
Little little

164
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,466
Large Large Large

165
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,800
Only eleven

166
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,300
Let's go

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,066
Best of five games

168
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,700
There are still four games left

169
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,466
Again, again

170
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,666
This round, I'll go first

171
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,100
I'll do the opposite

172
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,766
Large Large Large

173
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,033
Little little

174
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,566
fourteen

175
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:04,400
What do you say

176
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,533
Don't rush, don't rush

177
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:07,900
I haven't spun yet

178
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,966
I don't believe you can hit fifteen

179
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,433
Little little

180
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,566
Little little

181
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:19,266
Tai Dian, ah

182
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,933
Blow on it

183
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,666
This round must be won

184
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,533
Big, big, big

185
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,633
Sixteen

186
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,500
Do I still need to spin?

187
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,500
Alright, go back to class

188
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,366
Let's go, go, go

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,133
Class is starting, class is starting

190
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,666
Aren't we all just delivered hostages?

191
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,366
Why even put on a show of attending class?

192
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:41,866
Not so, not so

193
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,200
Didn't you hear what Teacher Gongsun said?

194
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,233
This is the heir camp

195
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,433
Not the hostage camp

196
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,433
Let's go, to class

197
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,300
Wait

198
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,266
Brother Jiang

199
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,066
Do you know what makes my Heluo betting wheel

200
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:53,800
So impressive?

201
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,233
How would I know about your betting wheel?

202
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,266
It doesn't just rely on luck

203
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,566
But also requires skill

204
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,166
You, the esteemed heir of Eastern Lu, ah

205
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:05,933
Why cheat

206
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:06,566
Let me see

207
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,966
You're not at the training ground

208
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,433
What are you doing here

209
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,233
Isn't it Brother Wen Huan and Brother Xin Jia gambling

210
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,066
Why are we being punished just for watching

211
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,366
Punishing me is one thing

212
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,500
He didn't even go, why punish him

213
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,133
Today's punishment

214
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,000
is your first lesson in the Prince's Camp

215
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,133
is to let you know

216
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:21,966
the Prince's Camp

217
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,433
is a unit

218
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,400
we thrive together

219
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,900
we suffer together

220
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,533
if one makes a mistake

221
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,966
all are punished

222
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,266
no one can escape unscathed

223
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,733
just like on the battlefield

224
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,133
is that clear

225
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,500
Yes

226
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:42,600
Louder

227
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,033
Yes

228
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,500
Hold the horse stance

229
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:47,933
Go find General Chen.

230
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,933
Currently in this camp,

231
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,633
there are clothing, food, lodging, daily life, and transportation

232
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,500
five major positions.

233
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,400
They are Quartermaster, Chef Supervisor,

234
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,466
Dormitory Supervisor,

235
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,100
Barracks Supervisor, and Stablemaster.

236
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,333
These five roles require each of you, young masters,

237
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,266
to campaign and take up the responsibilities.

238
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,066
Once you take up the role, you must give it your all.

239
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,933
If any mistakes occur,

240
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,000
the entire camp will be punished.

241
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,000
Brother Jiang,

242
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,433
this is your home, aren't you going to choose one?

243
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:16,366
I really can't.

244
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,233
To be honest,

245
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:18,700
when I was a child, I followed my elder brother

246
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,766
during training in the camp,

247
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,633
I did take on a position once,

248
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,900
and nearly burned down the entire Panchi Military Camp.

249
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,133
Then forget it, forget it.

250
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,066
So for everyone's safety,

251
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,000
let's all actively campaign.

252
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:30,933
Then I'll go first.

253
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,466
Brother Wang.

254
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,366
Alright.

255
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,000
I am Wang Yuanji.

256
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,300
I am running for provision officer.

257
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,500
Back in my hometown, cattle and sheep are everywhere.

258
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,733
There is no delicacy

259
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,600
that hasn't passed through Wang Yuanji's stomach.

260
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:46,533
You don't look the part.

261
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:47,766
This place doesn't seem like it.

262
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,966
But here,

263
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,600
I am Tao Yingzhong.

264
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,433
Since childhood, I have risen at mao hour for morning training.

265
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,333
Rising early and retiring late.

266
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,433
Working from before dawn until after dark.

267
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,533
Though I may lack talent,

268
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,200
I wish to take up the role of dormitory officer.

269
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,300
I am Tai Dian.

270
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,533
Don't be fooled by my appearance as a burly man.

271
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,966
My needlework skills are quite good.

272
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,033
With me here,

273
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,800
I guarantee everyone will have new clothes to wear every day.

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
I am running for barracks officer.

275
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,833
Brothers.

276
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
As long as I get elected today

277
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,366
The drinks at the Crown Prince's camp

278
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:13,966
I, Xin Jia, will cover

279
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:15,266
Good

280
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,966
Wait a moment

281
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,466
Alcohol is prohibited in the army

282
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,300
Yes

283
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,300
Brothers, you all understand

284
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,833
Now, there's one last position left

285
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,566
Which is the horsekeeper chief, overseeing the horses

286
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,600
This horsekeeper chief should definitely go to

287
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,333
Brother Chong from Libei

288
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,766
He knows so much about horses

289
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,566
Go ahead

290
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,100
Go on

291
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:48,400
One

292
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,700
If no one else

293
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,766
is running for it

294
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,433
I'd like to give it a try

295
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,500
This little guy wants to manage the horses

296
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,300
Is he capable?

297
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,133
My name is Yao Shuliang

298
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
My homeland is not far from Eastern Lu City

299
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:01,966
However

300
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,966
This is actually my first time

301
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:03,900
traveling far from home

302
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,833
I am quite timid

303
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,133
But when it comes to dealing with animals

304
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,066
it's still no problem

305
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,800
If everyone doesn't mind

306
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,900
Don't mind, don't mind

307
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,366
The head groom position is yours then

308
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:17,400
Really?

309
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:17,933
It's you

310
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,000
Really, it's you

311
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:23,933
Good, good, good

312
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,966
From this point on

313
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,366
All five positions are filled

314
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,466
All you princes

315
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,066
may return to the barracks to rest

316
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,700
Thank you, General Chen

317
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:35,933
Let's go

318
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,000
I hope everyone

319
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
can get along well

320
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:39,766
with your roommates

321
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,466
Roommates?

322
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,200
Didn't you say one person per room?

323
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,700
It's bad enough that the gambling den was confiscated

324
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,566
but you even sent my servant away

325
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:51,800
Now I have to carry this damn trunk myself

326
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,400
I can put up with this too

327
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,633
You say we are all princes of vassal states.

328
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,833
Yet we have to share a barracks with three others.

329
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:57,600
What gives?

330
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,733
What kind of behavior is this?

331
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,400
Brother Xin Jia,

332
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,166
Keep your voice down.

333
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,900
If someone hears this,

334
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,300
It wouldn't be so good.

335
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,200
What's not good about it?

336
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,600
Back when I was in Western Shu,

337
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:11,900
I always had my own room.

338
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,600
What if they have some

339
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:14,333
bad habits,

340
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,133
like grinding teeth, burping,

341
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,400
farting, or reeking of body odor?

342
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,333
What am I supposed to do then?

343
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,166
How am I supposed to live?

344
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,300
Young Master Xin Jia, you needn't worry about that.

345
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,433
Why?

346
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,366
The young masters entering the barracks this time

347
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,433
are all from noble families.

348
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,233
There won't be any trouble.

349
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,766
Forget it, I won't hold my breath.

350
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:31,666
No matter who I share a room with

351
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,033
Just don't let me run into

352
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,466
that guy who always pulls a long face all day,

353
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,333
Chong Yibiao

354
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,333
and that guy who doesn't say a single word, E Shun

355
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,133
then it'll be fine

356
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,433
Otherwise, before we even reach the capital

357
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:40,533
I'll be bored to death

358
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:41,866
Young Master Xin Jia

359
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm here

360
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,700
Let's go

361
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,833
Heaven bless me

362
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,666
God of Gamblers, favor me

363
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:54,933
Please don't let me

364
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:55,933
run into those two

365
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,000
I beg you, I beg you

366
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,333
You're staying here too?

367
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,433
Let's switch

368
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,633
Are you deliberately trying to make things difficult for me?

369
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,933
That is not my intention

370
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,466
Little Stutterer

371
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,066
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you again?

372
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,000
You

373
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,500
Would you?

374
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,133
Excuse me, is this the Qian Character

375
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,733
This definitely isn't. Excuse me.

376
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,900
Is anyone there?

377
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,200
Is there anyone?

378
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:07,766
Open the door for me.

379
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,833
So this is the Qian Room.

380
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,133
Never thought we'd

381
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,433
actually be rooming together.

382
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,166
Who's rooming with you?

383
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,833
What a donkey face.

384
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,200
Brother E.

385
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,366
Why does he always call you Little Stutterer?

386
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:38,833
Childhood stuff.

387
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,700
Better not to bring it up.

388
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:50,333
Alright then.

389
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,266
A bit dull is a bit dull then.

390
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,266
Since we are here, we might as well settle in.

391
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:56,733
With me here,

392
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:58,300
how could I let you be bored?

393
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,166
Brother Jiang.

394
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:00,166
You're staying here too?

395
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:01,600
Great!

396
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,433
Our barracks

397
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,433
finally have someone interesting.

398
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,066
How about

399
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,633
we sleep in the middle?

400
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,000
Guess that's the only way.

401
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,000
Brother Jiang.

402
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Brother Jiang

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,433
The Most Handsome Man in Eastern Lu

404
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:34,700
You

405
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,500
Did you hear something

406
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,733
What could there be in the middle of the night

407
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:39,833
Sleep

408
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,833
You heard it that time

409
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:03,000
Then

410
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:04,866
Go open the door and check

411
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,066
Why should I go

412
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,733
This is your territory

413
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,766
Even if it's some dirty thing

414
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,866
What if it's an old acquaintance of yours

415
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:18,366
What if that dirty thing is a woman

416
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:19,333
A woman

417
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,200
A beauty

418
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,933
A beauty

419
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,900
Hurry up and go

420
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,633
He didn't say whether it's a man or a woman

421
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,066
Go take a look

422
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:24,533
This is your home

423
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:25,533
Go take a look

424
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,833
No male or female ghosts

425
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:44,566
Can we sleep now

426
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,533
Sleep

427
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,366
Tao Yingzhong

428
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,133
What does that mean

429
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,700
This might be what is known as

430
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:43,333
sleepwalking

431
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,500
These symptoms

432
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
only manifest during sleep

433
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,400
He may walk like an ordinary person

434
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,900
but his consciousness remains in a dream

435
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,733
I don't care if he's dreaming or not

436
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:53,533
Wait a moment

437
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,766
Those afflicted with this condition cannot be awakened

438
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,866
Now, under the rule of the universal sovereign

439
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,166
the King enjoys peace and prosperity

440
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,333
with eight hundred feudal lords paying homage at Mount Shang

441
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,266
divided among the east, west, south, and north

442
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,766
under the jurisdiction of the four great lords

443
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,900
It can be said that the world is at peace

444
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,066
and the people are content with their livelihoods

445
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,066
However

446
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,433
storing grain against famine

447
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,333
Brother Xin Jia

448
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,466
Wake up, wake up, Brother Xin Jia

449
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,433
We're in class, wake up

450
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,633
Don't piss on me

451
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,666
What happened

452
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,300
General

453
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:57,066
You don't know

454
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,700
My eyes that behold beauties

455
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,200
What exactly did you endure last night

456
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:00,933
You

457
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:01,900
Report

458
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,633
Yes, sorry General Jiang

459
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,933
I overslept

460
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,900
Are you all here to attend class

461
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,633
Or are you here to tour my Donglu

462
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Each of you listless

463
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,433
Dejected

464
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,566
Unmotivated

465
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,300
Hurry up and take your seats

466
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,566
Sorry

467
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,366
Xin Jia, you take your seat too

468
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,500
Look at the three of them

469
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,000
Sitting straight

470
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,566
With good attitude

471
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:29,900
Tai Dian

472
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:37,266
Tai Dian

473
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:38,000
Who

474
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,766
Ge- General Jiang

475
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,266
I- I wasn't sleeping

476
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:50,666
Not bad

477
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,133
Continue the class

478
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,066
Brother Tao

479
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:55,766
Today

480
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,166
Help me give to Brother Jiang

481
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,766
You came to my Donglu for training

482
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:00,166
Days to come

483
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,766
Give this to Brother Wen Huan

484
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,166
The safety of the state

485
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,433
Will also rest upon your shoulders

486
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,366
Brother Jiang

487
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,833
Yao Shuliang asked me to give this to you

488
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:11,566
Diligence without slack

489
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,700
Good

490
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:14,800
Yesterday's lecture

491
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,766
We discussed the city defense deployment

492
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,766
What

493
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,900
The warhorses are missing

494
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,566
Jiang Wen Huan

495
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,200
Early this morning

496
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,300
I originally intended

497
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,733
To feed the horses and then go to class

498
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,566
But unexpectedly

499
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:45,033
As soon as I stepped outside

500
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,000
I discovered that the Golden Domain warhorses in the stable

501
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:47,733
Were all gone

502
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,333
I was thinking

503
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,433
These Golden Domain warhorses bestowed by the king

504
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:53,566
I'm afraid

505
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,733
I'm afraid they've truly been stolen by thieves

506
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:58,766
The theft of the Golden Domain warhorses

507
00:23:58,766 --> 00:23:59,466
Is no trivial matter

508
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:00,800
You really

509
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:01,866
have searched everywhere

510
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:02,833
I truly have looked

511
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:04,833
Otherwise, today I wouldn't have

512
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:06,166
arrived at the training ground so late

513
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,100
These horses

514
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,566
are no ordinary warhorses

515
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,833
Each one is a fine steed sent from the capital

516
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,200
They are gifts bestowed by the King himself

517
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,533
If they were truly lost

518
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,000
I fear our entire camp

519
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,966
would suffer the consequences

520
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:19,400
Then

521
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:22,666
what should we do

522
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
It's all my fault

523
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,166
As the head groom

524
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,033
I've implicated everyone

525
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,366
The Prince's camp prospers together

526
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,766
and falls together

527
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:32,900
Although you are the head groom

528
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:33,633
the loss of these warhorses

529
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,666
is not your burden alone

530
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:37,100
Today, the two supervisors

531
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,400
are seeing off the Shangshan messenger

532
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,466
Before night falls

533
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:41,466
We definitely won't make it back to camp

534
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:42,133
If before that happens

535
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,433
We manage to find the warhorses, wouldn't that solve it

536
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:47,066
Really?

537
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,166
Golden Realm warhorses

538
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,966
Bond with their masters and are spiritually attuned

539
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,733
Anyone who can steal them without a sound

540
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,366
Is certainly no ordinary thief

541
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,200
Ordinary methods

542
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,400
Will likely be hard to track them down

543
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,366
But there is one place

544
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
That is sure to have information

545
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:01,766
What place?

546
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,433
Eastern Lu's number one mysterious market

547
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,166
Qiankun Alley

548
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,666
Qiankun Alley

549
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,800
Is Eastern Lu's number one mysterious market

550
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,833
It's said to take in people the world finds hard to tolerate

551
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,766
And sell things hard to find anywhere else

552
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,366
No matter what you're looking for

553
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,366
You can try your luck in this Qiankun Alley

554
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,166
The one who single-handedly established Qiankun Alley

555
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,433
He is a prominent merchant from Eastern Lu.

556
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,200
Old Man Li.

557
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,700
His background is mysterious.

558
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,900
Yet he managed single-handedly over decades

559
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,766
to amass such a vast fortune.

560
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,166
One can imagine

561
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,600
his methods and influence

562
00:25:58,933 --> 00:25:59,866
are anything but simple.

563
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,933
This is Qiankun Alley.

564
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:05,433
Really nice.

565
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,300
Leaving the camp without permission—

566
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,733
is it safe?

567
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,000
That—

568
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,033
I’ve already instructed Yao Shuliang

569
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,033
to relay any news as soon as it arrives.

570
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,500
When did you instruct Yao Shuliang?

571
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,133
How come I didn’t know?

572
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,666
If something goes wrong, do you have a plan?

573
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,666
The waterway behind the alley—

574
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,733
has support from Tai Dian.

575
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:20,500
When did you two become so like-minded

576
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:21,433
and develop such tacit understanding?

577
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:24,933
Wait for me a moment.

578
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:29,666
I never expected Eastern Lu to have

579
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,133
such a place of extreme luxury and extravagance.

580
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,400
This is the auction house

581
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,933
Void Pavilion

582
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,433
What? What kind of place?

583
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:43,800
A place for selling stolen goods

584
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:47,900
You've been here too?

585
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,233
The great name of Qiankun Alley

586
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:52,866
Even though I've long resided in the southern capital

587
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,266
I've heard of it

588
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,133
So I'm the only one who hasn't heard of it

589
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,400
That's right. In Donglu

590
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,800
Thieves transport valuable stolen goods

591
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:02,933
to this place

592
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:04,300
Through the method of auction

593
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,133
to the highest bidder

594
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:08,800
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go

595
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:09,600
Wait a moment

596
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,400
The items sold here are all of unknown origin

597
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,266
It has always been heavily guarded

598
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:15,666
If you're not a regular customer

599
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,833
you can't enter

600
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:20,766
After all that talk, we can't even get in?

601
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:21,633
Well then

602
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:22,666
Let's go back

603
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,666
Hey

604
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
I have another idea

605
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:27,566
What idea?

606
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,433
Xin Jia

607
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Go, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine

608
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,766
Go, go, go

609
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,066
You just said a real man knows when to yield and when to stand firm

610
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,900
How come

611
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,366
I'm the only one yielding

612
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:50,733
You two are still standing firm

613
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:51,533
Auction house

614
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,466
There have always been song and dance performances

615
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:53,700
Disguising as dancing girls

616
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,700
Is naturally the easiest way to slip through

617
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,133
As for me

618
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,633
I'll disguise as a buyer

619
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,266
And coordinate with you from inside and out

620
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,366
Where did you get this

621
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:04,200
Borrowed

622
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,100
Borrowed

623
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,333
Stolen is stolen

624
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:09,566
And you call it borrowed

625
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,566
What about him? Did you steal one for him too

626
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:14,433
No

627
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,500
Then how is he getting in

628
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:26,866
Go

629
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:30,866
Alright

630
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:32,866
One has the means

631
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,700
One is lavish enough

632
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,333
What about me?

633
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,566
I am beautiful

634
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,666
You all, halt

635
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,566
You

636
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:58,433
Go on in

637
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,666
You two gentlemen

638
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,733
You're not regulars at the Void Pavilion, are you

639
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,966
The manager is swamped with myriad affairs daily

640
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,633
It's only natural he doesn't remember this humble one

641
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,500
I see the waist token in your hand

642
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:25,866
Isn't yours either, is it

643
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:26,866
Hand it over, let me take a look

644
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,733
Apologies, apologies

645
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,600
This lowly one has eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai

646
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:41,300
I actually didn't know you two gentlemen

647
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,700
Are esteemed guests invited by the young mistress

648
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:43,900
My discourtesy

649
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:45,966
Gentlemen, please, come inside quickly

650
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:48,500
Who

651
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,933
Young master, please come inside

652
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:08,133
Thank you, thank you all for gracing us with your presence

653
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,566
Our Void Pavilion's auction stage

654
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,633
Next, I am about to present to everyone

655
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,533
Today's finale treasure

656
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,433
From the Golden Domain

657
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,933
Thoroughbred horse

658
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:22,033
Good good

659
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,366
You all look at
this Jinyu's woman

660
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,033
Indeed extraordinary

661
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,900
than our Donglu women

662
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Much taller, oh!

663
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:49,366
This is not a horse thief.

664
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,000
We need to identify
the real sales talent.

665
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,166
Find it.

666
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,333
How much money did you bring?

667
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:54,933
How much do you want?

668
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,466
How about it, everyone?

669
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,766
This treasure

670
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:00,200
is no ordinary item.

671
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:01,666
Today, we

672
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,766
will follow the old rules.

673
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,966
When I strike this copper gong,

674
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,466
it marks the beginning

675
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,100
of today's auction.

676
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:10,733
Starting bid

677
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,333
One hundred cash.

678
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,566
One hundred ten.

679
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:17,933
One hundred ten cash.

680
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,933
One hundred fifty.

681
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,700
One hundred fifty cash.

682
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:21,566
Two hundred.

683
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Three hundred.

684
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,133
Four hundred.

685
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,166
Four hundred cash!

686
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,333
Five hundred.

687
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,733
Five hundred.

688
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:31,666
Good, good, good.

689
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,700
This guest is quite generous!

690
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:36,166
Good.

691
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,733
Five hundred cash once.

692
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:39,666
Five hundred cash.

693
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,600
Twice.

694
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,400
Five hundred.

695
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,066
One thousand.

696
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,933
This young master is quite extravagant

697
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,866
To have such audacity at such a tender age

698
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,966
Who knows

699
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:55,366
Which noble's son he might be

700
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:57,400
One thousand

701
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,266
One thousand coins, everyone

702
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,766
One thousand five hundred

703
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,433
Determined to win, it seems

704
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,500
One thousand five hundred coins

705
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,333
One thousand five hundred and one

706
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,700
One thousand five hundred

707
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:14,966
And one

708
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:18,900
Two thousand

709
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,933
Two thousand coins

710
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,466
Two thousand and one

711
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:23,900
Two thousand five hundred

712
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,633
Add one

713
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,100
Three thousand

714
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,000
Add one

715
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:27,966
Three thousand five hundred

716
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:28,800
Add one

717
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,966
Four thousand

718
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:30,900
Add one

719
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,200
Hey, you keep

720
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,833
Adding one coin at a time

721
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,133
You really are

722
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,566
Five thousand

723
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,133
Five thousand

724
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,100
Everyone, everyone, listen clearly now

725
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:52,733
This one has already reached

726
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:54,200
five thousand coins

727
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,133
How about it

728
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:56,733
Can there be

729
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,200
anyone offering

730
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,433
more than five thousand coins

731
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:00,666
It's time

732
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:02,966
to make your move

733
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,133
Since that's the case

734
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,166
Five thousand coins once

735
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,900
Five thousand coins twice

736
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,600
Good

737
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:14,833
Five thousand coins

738
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:15,766
Wait a moment

739
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,233
These five thousand coins

740
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:21,533
are no small amount

741
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:23,600
If one could truly find

742
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,133
a pure-blood steed from the Golden Domain

743
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:25,833
that would be quite good

744
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,866
But

745
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,466
what if it's not the case

746
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:30,966
This

747
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,066
This guest must be joking

748
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,333
You must know that anything able to ascend

749
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,966
to my auction stage

750
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,766
is a top-tier, premium authentic item

751
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:44,266
How could there possibly be any fakes

752
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:45,366
You're overthinking it

753
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Overthinking it

754
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
But the pure-blooded steed from the Golden Realm

755
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,766
No one has ever seen it

756
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,600
How would anyone know how to verify it

757
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
You can't just say

758
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:57,200
That

759
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,133
Because a tall and sturdy woman from the Golden Realm has arrived

760
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,966
The Golden Realm steed up for bidding must be genuine

761
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,033
Let me tell you

762
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,933
My Void Pavilion

763
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:07,033
Has stood in Qiankun Alley for many years

764
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:10,066
Relying on this genuine quality

765
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:11,766
A promise as weighty as a thousand pieces of gold

766
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,566
Naturally, there can be no fakes

767
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,433
Especially here with us

768
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,700
There has never been

769
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
Before a bidding transaction is completed

770
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,900
Any precedent of inspecting the goods first

771
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,600
As everyone knows

772
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,566
The pure-blooded steeds from the Golden Realm

773
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,166
Are extremely rare in production

774
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,200
And those that come to our Eastern Lu

775
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,933
All are tributes from the capital.

776
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:37,400
You might as well bring the horse out to see.

777
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:39,500
Where did it come from?

778
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,666
Only then can everyone feel at ease.

779
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:43,166
After all,

780
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,333
Five thousand coins,

781
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,000
That's a lot of money.

782
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:49,200
This is no small sum.

783
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,766
Esteemed guest,

784
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,800
That's right.

785
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:56,066
Since I'm paying a high price for the horse,

786
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:57,933
I should naturally take a look at it first.

787
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,433
Hey, horse seller,

788
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,800
Bring the horse out.

789
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:01,766
Let everyone see it.

790
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,400
That's right.

791
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,433
Let everyone see it.

792
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,100
Yes, exactly, let's see.

793
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,500
Bring it out for a look.

794
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,233
Everyone, listen to me.

795
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,866
This is really putting me in a difficult position.

796
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,300
We have rules here, this isn't—

797
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,166
Everyone,

798
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:30,966
There's no need to worry.

799
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:34,133
I swear by the bloodline of my clan.

800
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,366
This horse

801
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,166
is indeed a genuine purebred steed.

802
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:41,333
As for its origin

803
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,700
since this is the Void Pavilion

804
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,366
there are naturally details that cannot be explicitly stated.

805
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:48,266
I ask for your understanding.

806
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:51,433
The Void Pavilion has its own rules

807
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,166
but our money

808
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,600
doesn't grow on trees either.

809
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:55,666
Exactly.

810
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,033
Whether this horse is real or fake

811
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,800
can be determined by bringing it out for inspection.

812
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,066
This young master

813
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:08,333
has been causing a commotion all along.

814
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,033
Could it be that you have some ulterior motive?

815
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,233
I am merely stepping in to uphold justice.

816
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,600
I will naturally disclose the horse's origin to the buyer privately.

817
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:20,600
That has nothing to do with you, does it?

818
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,566
Who knows

819
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,800
if you might go back on your word

820
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,933
take the money and run.

821
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,400
If you have the guts, then show this horse

822
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,433
So everyone can judge for themselves

823
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:33,866
Yes, show it

824
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,033
Who exactly are you

825
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:42,500
Why are you pushing so hard step by step

826
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:48,766
I am

827
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:50,566
The one who's come to take you

828
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,166
Guards, someone come quick

829
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,233
Someone come quickly

830
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,266
Speak, where's the horse

831
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:00,966
Speak

832
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,400
Who dares to cause trouble at the Void Pavilion

833
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,633
Release them at once

834
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:06,466
Let them go

835
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,500
These people are causing trouble

836
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,233
Quick, seize them

837
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:11,300
Who are you all

838
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:12,866
How dare you cause such a ruckus in my Void Pavilion

839
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,700
Cut the nonsense

840
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,366
Hurry up and arrest them first, then we'll talk

841
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,300
Arrest them all

842
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,433
Stop

843
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,066
Young Miss

844
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:25,833
Young Miss
