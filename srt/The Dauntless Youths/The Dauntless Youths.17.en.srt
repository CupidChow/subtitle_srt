1
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,966
The volume

2
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,033
You are a descendant of the Kun family

3
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,233
You must remember

4
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:37,100
-Quick -The Kun army never admits defeat

5
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,200
Bless me

6
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:45,100
Father

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,333
Your Excellency State Preceptor

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,700
The Kun family has been completely besieged and eliminated

9
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,200
Are they all dead?

10
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,200
What about Kun Ze's son and daughter?

11
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:05,533
There is still a young boy

12
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,766
He jumped into the river during the pursuit

13
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,300
Rest assured

14
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,533
He certainly couldn’t have survived

15
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,100
State Preceptor

16
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,266
There is also a little girl here

17
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:25,466
This

18
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,700
Isn’t this Su Ying’s daughter?

19
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,966
The little saintess of the Su family?

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,300
Heaven really helps me

21
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,466
I survived a great disaster

22
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Washed ashore by the river

23
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,000
From then on, I concealed my identity

24
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,533
And was reduced to slavery

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,400
On the day I left Zhongli

26
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,200
I learned that the envoy from Shangshan

27
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,266
Proclaimed to the world

28
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,366
That my father intended to rebel

29
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,766
And killed my mother in the Zhongli palace

30
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,300
Also said he went mad

31
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,066
Killed the entire Kun family

32
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,533
Such crimes brought divine punishment

33
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,700
Turning everyone in the Kun family into monsters

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The Kun clan thus fell into decline

35
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,266
From then on

36
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,800
The Kun army

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,433
Became the shame of Zhongli

38
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,766
With the death of the saintess

39
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:49,333
The You Su clan

40
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,133
Seemed to have vanished as well

41
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,766
You just said

42
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
The You Su clan

43
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,566
Possess illusory powers

44
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:57,533
The saintess lineage

45
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,833
Is bestowed with heavenly illusory forms

46
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:02,466
What does that mean?

47
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,733
The You Su clan

48
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:07,933
Has had since ancient times

49
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,333
The custom of practicing illusion arts

50
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,466
Only

51
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,333
Nowadays, the Su people

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
only know some juggling tricks

53
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,033
Only the Saintess lineage

54
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:17,766
inherits the orthodox tradition

55
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,733
It is said that after the bloodline awakens

56
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,800
they excel greatly in illusion arts

57
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,266
able to bewitch people's minds

58
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,700
and create illusions

59
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:25,733
Su Qingqing possesses this ability

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,500
so why all these years

61
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,900
has she not tried to escape

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,933
She has long been controlled by Xian Xuanji with drugs

63
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,300
unable to use her illusion arts

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,833
Therefore

65
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,233
the only one in this world who can save her

66
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,100
is me

67
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,233
It seems

68
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,366
you have no choice but to take this risk

69
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:48,966
Right

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,966
Have you ever thought

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,700
if we fail

72
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,266
even if it means death

73
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,000
I must go

74
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,433
You are not afraid of death

75
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:03,633
but is Marquis Nanbo afraid

76
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,900
Is Zhen E afraid or not?

77
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,000
If your identity is exposed

78
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,433
How will the Marquis of Nanbo's estate handle itself?

79
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,133
The Marquis of Nanbo's estate is using you

80
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,900
You may not care about their life or death

81
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:15,566
What about the Shizi Camp?

82
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,866
Have you ever considered

83
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:19,366
That your actions

84
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,633
Might implicate the Shizi Camp?

85
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,366
Your Majesty

86
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,700
The secret envoy from Gui Fang

87
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,833
Has sent us a secret letter

88
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,433
Is the heir of the Marquis of Nanbo

89
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,800
Truly, as the secret letter says

90
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,233
Connected to the Kun Family Army from back then?

91
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,133
Zhongli and Nan Du are thousands of miles apart

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,000
We have never heard of any connection between the Kun Family and the Marquis of Nanbo

93
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:45,966
What kind of association could there be?

94
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,833
The information provided by this person

95
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:50,566
Cannot be wrong

96
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,633
What we need to determine now is

97
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,633
This heir of the Marquis of Nanbo

98
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,466
After all, it's the old troops of the Kun family.

99
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,666
Or the son of Kun Ze

100
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,133
One

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,466
Lord E Shun

102
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Has he ever been to Zhongli?

103
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,633
Never.

104
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,200
This matter is suspicious.

105
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,600
We must be cautious.

106
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:14,700
Go.

107
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,566
Summon someone here.

108
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,733
It seems our plan needs to change.

109
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes.

110
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,666
Someone who should have died seven years ago.

111
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:33,500
This time,

112
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,866
We must

113
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,900
Eliminate the root of the problem.

114
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,066
All of this

115
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,366
I have thought about.

116
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,733
I have let all of you down.

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,433
Once,

118
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,466
I had lost

119
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,600
All hope.

120
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,233
Living

121
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,766
For me,

122
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,866
Was a luxury.

123
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Until one day,

124
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,633
I met you at the slave market.

125
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,533
That day, you saved me.

126
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:16,333
He also said that in the future

127
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,600
he would surely train me to become

128
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,433
the fiercest warrior in Donglu

129
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,366
so I would no longer have to kneel in servitude

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,466
At that moment

131
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:24,400
I finally realized

132
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,000
that I myself

133
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,366
had already knelt for far too long

134
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,400
and had long forgotten

135
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,433
how to be

136
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,100
a dignified member of the Kun family

137
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,766
- So - So you deceived us

138
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,533
It wasn’t like that

139
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:39,166
I

140
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,800
I gave you a chance

141
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,200
didn’t I

142
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,300
But you still

143
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,333
chose to go alone

144
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,533
to Zhongli Palace

145
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,366
But Qingqing is my last family

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,333
I promised my father

147
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,233
I would protect her

148
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,600
The one who made that promise to Father

149
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,533
was Kunwu

150
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,233
But who are you now

151
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:13,033
It is E Shun from the Prince's Camp.

152
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,266
He is the little slave

153
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,400
I picked up from the streets

154
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,633
Who exactly are you

155
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:27,433
You're right

156
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,166
Who am I

157
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:34,966
One

158
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,533
E Shun

159
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:41,433
True feelings

160
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,366
Or false pretenses

161
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,600
I can no longer tell myself

162
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,233
Brother Jiang

163
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,466
They have already apologized

164
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:50,866
Besides

165
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:51,933
For such a long time

166
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:52,966
He hasn't done anything

167
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,300
That would betray the Prince's Camp

168
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,933
It must have been forced by circumstances

169
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:56,600
If he had done

170
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,766
Anything to betray the Prince's Camp

171
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,933
Would I have let him live until now

172
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,666
From now on

173
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,800
What should we call you

174
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,433
E Shun

175
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,733
Or Kun

176
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,766
You can call me Kun Wu

177
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,500
E Shun

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,233
From now on

179
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,633
My Crown Prince's Camp

180
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,266
Only the heir of the
Marquis of Nanbo, E Shun

181
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:19,766
There has never been

182
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,066
None have Kunwu

183
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,766
Camp of the Heir
Apparent, heed the command

184
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,500
The sovereign's decree

185
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:32,466
Open the door quickly

186
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,766
What kind of order is being delivered in the middle of the night

187
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:36,800
Could it be that they

188
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,466
Found out E Shun's true
identity, haven't you?

189
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,200
If that is truly the case

190
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,633
Then it has nothing to do with the rest of you

191
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,166
You were deceived by me

192
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,933
I definitely will not drag you down with me

193
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,766
What dragging down or not dragging down

194
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,266
Let me tell you

195
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,900
We can deal with them together

196
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,500
Matters between brothers

197
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:56,633
Can be discussed later

198
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:58,566
Wait a moment

199
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,400
If they really knew

200
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,333
E Shun's identity

201
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,100
They would have barged in long ago

202
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:04,933
The Crown Prince's camp awaits orders.

203
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,133
By the decree of the King

204
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,400
Open the gate quickly

205
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:13,233
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

206
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:15,466
What brings you here so late at night?

207
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,600
What is the matter?

208
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,833
Young master, you're awake so late at night

209
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,766
What are you doing in this courtyard with weapons?

210
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,933
My brother simply enjoys practicing martial arts late at night

211
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,100
Is that not allowed?

212
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,033
Just like how your Kingdom of Zhongli

213
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,466
enjoys delivering decrees in the middle of the night

214
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:28,600
What of it?

215
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,033
Is there a problem?

216
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:30,766
Well, no

217
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,000
You must be joking, young master

218
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,200
What arrangements has the Grand Preceptor made this time?

219
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,166
The King sent me to inform everyone

220
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,033
The Sacred Wedding Ceremony

221
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,333
will be held tomorrow ahead of schedule

222
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,400
I am here under orders to deliver the invitation

223
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,966
Moved forward

224
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,200
Intruders broke into the palace tonight

225
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,466
The King was alarmed

226
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,466
The condition has worsened

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,500
To prevent any complications

228
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,200
We hope all the young masters

229
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:57,766
will be present tomorrow without fail

230
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,900
Withdraw

231
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,700
Your Majesty

232
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,966
The invitation has been delivered

233
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,733
Any findings?

234
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,666
On the Southern Bo Marquis's heir

235
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:34,966
There was indeed a scent of blood

236
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,866
I boldly speculate

237
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,066
that the one who stormed the palace tonight

238
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:38,800
must be him

239
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:42,666
It seems

240
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,433
this remnant of the Kun family

241
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,333
has grown ambitious

242
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,933
Unexpectedly, he has transformed

243
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,200
into the esteemed Southern Bo Marquis's heir

244
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,400
Good

245
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,166
No matter who you disguise yourself as

246
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:58,866
I

247
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,633
will tear off that mask of yours

248
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,633
At tomorrow's sacred wedding ceremony

249
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Arrange ambushes and archers

250
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
all around

251
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,033
Your Majesty intends to

252
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,066
Like catching a turtle in a jar

253
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
The current evidence is insufficient

254
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,733
It's not advisable to act rashly and alert the enemy

255
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,433
Wait until the Sacred Wedding ceremony tomorrow

256
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,333
If that Lord E Shun does not come

257
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,166
The Sacred Wedding will proceed as scheduled

258
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:38,200
We’ll first eliminate that troublesome Saintess

259
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,433
But if that Lord E Shun dares to come and rescue her

260
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,933
I can expose him on the spot

261
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,533
As the last remnant of the Kun family

262
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,166
And execute him right then and there

263
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,033
Wipe out the Kun family

264
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,800
Completely exterminated

265
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,133
Yes

266
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:40,600
Who

267
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:55,533
How

268
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,666
Planning to stand there like a door god?

269
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:20,900
This cup

270
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:23,633
To you, for time and again

271
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,433
Saving me from dire straits

272
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,233
This cup

273
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,300
To you, for your sincerity

274
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,500
Treating me like a brother

275
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:31,766
This cup

276
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,400
To you, for believing in me

277
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:36,966
And understanding me

278
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,533
Protect me

279
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,433
I was a slave for seven years

280
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:45,766
Treating me as a dignified person

281
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,933
You are the first

282
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:09,600
Between you and me

283
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,900
I owe you a great deal

284
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,733
I have sent a carrier pigeon to Donglu

285
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,366
Explaining my background

286
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,566
All my actions

287
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,333
Stem from personal vengeance

288
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,300
Unrelated to the Shizi Camp

289
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,933
I will definitely not implicate you all

290
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,900
If I can return safely tomorrow

291
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,066
What I owe you

292
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,566
I will slowly repay

293
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
If I do not return

294
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,700
A few cups of plain wine

295
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,466
To express my apology

296
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,466
This stupid pigeon

297
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,566
I plucked its feathers and fed it to the cats

298
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:10,266
Wanting to send a message to Donglu

299
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,900
Without even asking me, the heir of Donglu

300
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,766
Whether I agree or not

301
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:26,500
You know

302
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,700
You can't stop me

303
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,233
Then try stepping out of this room.

304
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:01,866
Sorry.

305
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,466
No matter what.

306
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,466
I cannot let you take the risk.

307
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,300
It's useless.

308
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,333
Brother Jiang's skill in tying people up.

309
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,233
is quite practiced.

310
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:26,866
What time is it?

311
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,300
Don't worry about the time.

312
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,233
Just stay put.

313
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:31,166
Brother Jiang said.

314
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,633
As long as you can stay put for a day.

315
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,900
Both the heir's camp and you.

316
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,633
can be kept safe.

317
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:44,766
Let me go.

318
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,033
Don't waste your energy.

319
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,233
Brother when.

320
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,400
Young Master Chong.

321
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,166
Second Young Master Chong.

322
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,466
My life or death.

323
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,666
you certainly wouldn't care about.

324
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,400
Letting me go.

325
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,833
won't do you any harm.

326
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:57,933
Brother Chong.

327
00:18:59,066 --> 00:18:59,966
If his identity is exposed.

328
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,266
it would mean annihilation for the clan in the Southern Capital.

329
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,266
Help him

330
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,300
Is to help your brother

331
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,233
I don't care if you live or die

332
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,066
But if you die

333
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,233
That person won't survive either

334
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:22,666
Where is Jiang WenHuan

335
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,100
Where is Jiang WenHuan

336
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,133
Jiang WenHuan

337
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,366
Jiang WenHuan

338
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,633
The medicine in the bottle

339
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,100
Is the antidote I extracted yesterday

340
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,033
From your medicinal dregs

341
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,600
This medicine is brewed

342
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Send it to the Holy Maiden

343
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,033
But time is limited

344
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,033
The antidote made by my sister Yi Yao

345
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:13,933
Can only sustain you

346
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,033
For half the time it takes an incense stick to burn during spellcasting

347
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,066
After half an incense stick, your energy will be exhausted

348
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,233
Last night I already scouted the altar

349
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:21,866
From the alley entrance to the altar

350
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:22,533
Is a total of fifty steps

351
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,200
I will be among the crowd

352
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,033
Creating chaos

353
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,033
To divert the priest's attention

354
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,400
Retreat to the end of the alley

355
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,300
As long as you can use illusion techniques

356
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,366
To make everyone lose their senses

357
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:31,933
For the time it takes half an incense stick to burn

358
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,333
Someone will naturally come to take you away

359
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Brother Xin Jia

360
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,533
You must release me

361
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:43,700
Before Brother Jiang left

362
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,533
He repeatedly urged and said

363
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,800
-Just cannot -Jiang Wenhuan wants to rescue them himself

364
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,066
I'll untie you first

365
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,333
Wait a moment

366
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,933
Brother Chong is right at the door

367
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,533
Later, act according to my signal

368
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,066
It begins

369
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:04,866
Her time of death has come

370
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,900
No matter how you scheme

371
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,900
Anything you do now is futile

372
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:13,933
Fate

373
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,433
Cannot be changed

374
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,233
Go back

375
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Brother Chong, don’t be impulsive

376
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:41,766
Your matter

377
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,666
Will naturally be handled by Jiang Wenhuan’s planning

378
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:46,900
Go back

379
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,033
Don't think I don't dare to kill you

380
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,533
Precisely because of this

381
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,833
I cannot let him take the risk for me

382
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,933
Can't be bothered to waste words on you

383
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,066
We are all brothers here

384
00:21:59,366 --> 00:21:59,933
Brother Chong

385
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:00,900
Brother E Shun

386
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:02,266
How about

387
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:03,333
You go back first

388
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,966
Run quickly

389
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,066
I will be there soon

390
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:08,333
Let go

391
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:09,566
You let go

392
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:14,433
Let go

393
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,766
Xin Jia, you

394
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:19,700
Let go

395
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:22,333
Only the great God

396
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,766
bestow favor upon the common people, sincerely I pray

397
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,400
Admiring the sage virtue of heaven

398
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,033
The saintly maiden is without blemish, worthy to match that heaven

399
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:33,700
Jiang Wen Huan

400
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,966
Offers sacrifice to her sacred bones

401
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:37,233
Why have you come

402
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,100
Reverently accepting heaven's decree

403
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:43,300
Why did you take the risk to save people for me

404
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,500
For them to go is to seek death innocently

405
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,433
I am the leader
of the heir's camp

406
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,233
I promised to protect you all

407
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,500
and return unscathed

408
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:55,300
A promise must be kept

409
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,833
Heaven bestows grace upon the people below

410
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,966
Your Majesty

411
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,200
Has anyone arrived

412
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,333
Not yet seen

413
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,666
Worthy to match that heaven

414
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:25,733
Pass down the order

415
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,866
The Sacred Nuptials shall commence early

416
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,933
May the spirits enjoy this offering

417
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:46,633
What time is it

418
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:47,466
Oh no

419
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:49,133
Could the ceremony have started early

420
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:57,933
Make way

421
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:04,833
Make way

422
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,633
Make way

423
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,500
Qingqing

424
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:16,433
Brother

425
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:18,833
Young Master Jiang

426
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:27,866
What's going on

427
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,733
What happened

428
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
What occurred

429
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:31,433
Why has everyone fainted

430
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,966
I don't know

431
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,366
Look quickly

432
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,833
The Saintly Maiden has ascended to heaven, the Saintly Maiden has ascended to heaven

433
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,633
Quick, quick, kneel and pray for blessings

434
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:42,466
The Saintly Maiden ascends, Heaven protects Zhongli

435
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,633
Where is Qingqing?

436
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:47,833
Don't panic yet.

437
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:49,633
There is still one person who can save her.

438
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:59,466
The saintess ascends to heaven, heaven protects Zhongli.

439
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,666
The saintess ascends to heaven.

440
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,766
The saintess ascends to heaven, heaven protects Zhongli.

441
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,100
Ascend to what heaven?

442
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,000
Everyone, snap out of it.

443
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,433
Issue a city-wide warrant for that fake heir apparent and the saintess.

444
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,266
Dig three feet into the ground.

445
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,266
But you must find them and bring them back to me.

446
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,333
Alive or dead.

447
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,633
Yes.

448
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,866
Impersonating the heir apparent, abducting the saintess.

449
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:40,700
ku ku ku .

450
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,233
This time, you will not escape my grasp.

451
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,733
Su Qingqing's fate has changed.

452
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:57,866
How could that be?

453
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,866
Fate.

454
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:01,900
Can it truly be changed?

455
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,500
Stop!

456
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:07,733
After her!

457
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:08,766
Don't let her get away!

458
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:13,566
Stop!

459
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,000
Fake.

460
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:35,766
Sister Yiyao.

461
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,300
How is it you?

462
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,166
you

463
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:50,866
Yiyao little sister

464
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:52,133
Are you okay?

465
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,833
It was you who saved the saint.

466
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:01,833
What about the little saintess?

467
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,200
Hey you guys

468
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,066
Go over there and take a look

469
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:14,866
Search over here

470
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,566
You few

471
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Come with me this way

472
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,066
is

473
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,100
Strange

474
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:37,000
He was right here
just a moment ago.

475
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,866
I see a figure there!

476
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,233
green

477
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Kunwu gege

478
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,033
Are you okay

479
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,766
I'm fine

480
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:06,666
Go

481
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:13,433
You go first

482
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:14,366
I'll lure them away

483
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:15,233
What about you

484
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:15,666
Don't worry

485
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,800
It's easier for one person than for three

486
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,466
to shake them off

487
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:18,800
Later

488
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,166
we'll meet outside the city

489
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,233
But

490
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:21,833
No buts

491
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,700
After all

492
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:25,400
this is someone you must protect

493
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,266
no matter what

494
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:29,866
Isn't it

495
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:33,800
Go check that alley over there

496
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,533
Yes

497
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,166
Hurry up

498
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,133
Thank you

499
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,366
See you soon

500
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,533
Over here

501
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,200
Is it you

502
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,200
So it is because of you

503
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:56,600
Who are you

504
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:13,666
You

505
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,666
are my destined one

506
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,000
You

507
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,866
You are my destined person.

508
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,733
What is a destined person.

509
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,000
This point.

510
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:33,866
Should be told by you.

511
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,366
Who exactly are you.

512
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,833
Why can't I see your fate clearly.

513
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:38,200
I don't know.

514
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,566
And why can you change the future.

515
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,166
I don't know.

516
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
What is a destined person.

517
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,066
Young Master Jiang.

518
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,966
I wonder how Young Master Jiang's injuries are.

519
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,766
Although Young Master Jiang was not fundamentally harmed.

520
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,400
He still needs to rest and recover properly.

521
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:25,700
I am injured.

522
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,833
And is unable to perform formal greetings.

523
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,900
I hope the State Preceptor will understand.

524
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,266
Young Master Jiang is injured.

525
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,133
Naturally, there's no need to worry about these formalities.

526
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,700
However.

527
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,100
There is one thing I do not understand.

528
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,100
Young Master Jiang was perfectly fine.

529
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,300
How did you end up near the sacrificial platform?

530
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,166
Being hurt by someone

531
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:51,933
At that time

532
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,900
I saw the holy maiden being kidnapped

533
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:55,900
I originally intended to step forward

534
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,233
to capture that villain

535
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,466
But unexpectedly

536
00:32:58,733 --> 00:32:59,466
my skills were inferior

537
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
and I ended up being injured by them instead

538
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
However

539
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,966
fortunately, the chaste one appeared in time

540
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,166
scaring those people away

541
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,433
and saving me, Jiang

542
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,266
Here, I, Jiang, must also express gratitude

543
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:11,633
for the chaste one's life-saving grace

544
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:18,066
I wonder

545
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,900
how I should repay the chaste one

546
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:23,833
This subordinate's actions

547
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,433
merely follow the master's orders

548
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,933
If you wish to express thanks, Lord Jiang

549
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,933
then thank the Grand Preceptor

550
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,533
Lord Jiang is an envoy of Mount Shang

551
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:38,800
Ensuring your safety

552
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,633
is my duty

553
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,166
Lord jiang

554
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,933
there is no need to stand on ceremony

555
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,200
Since that is the case

556
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,300
That Young Master Jiang

557
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,033
should focus on recovering from his injuries

558
00:33:58,266 --> 00:33:58,866
Remember

559
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:00,766
those who stabbed you today

560
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,766
were two villains who abducted the Holy Maiden

561
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,633
Is this chaste one friend or foe?

562
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,166
Could it be that she stabbed me

563
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,400
truly to clear my suspicion?

564
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,333
We've arrived

565
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,066
The carriage arranged by Young Master Jiang

566
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:20,700
is right there

567
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,300
Good

568
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,666
This is the direction away from Zhongli

569
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,100
Where are we going?

570
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,833
Where is Brother Jiang?

571
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:43,166
Qingqing

572
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,266
You're hiding something from me

573
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:49,866
I'm sorry

574
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:51,933
Brothers Konu

575
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,066
What do you mean?

576
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:01,666
This

577
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,600
was given to me by Young Master Jiang to pass to you

578
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,000
By the time you see this letter

579
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,100
you should have accomplished your wish

580
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:15,500
rescuing the Holy Maiden

581
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,900
Since that is the case

582
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:18,733
Please leave Zhongli quickly

583
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,466
to avoid further trouble

584
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:22,533
Between you and me

585
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,200
there is no need for debt or obligation

586
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,166
The road ahead is long

587
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,933
take care of yourself

588
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,533
In this life, to have known you

589
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:31,966
is my great fortune

590
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,933
How much for this little slave

591
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,133
This young master will take them

592
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,200
Fifty coins

593
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:48,733
This kid really isn't cheap

594
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,266
E'shun

595
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:11,866
Take care

596
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,033
So

597
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,966
from the very beginning

598
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:23,833
he never intended to let me stay

599
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:28,200
That's right

600
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,500
Staying behind

601
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,866
would only hold everyone back

602
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,233
Well then

603
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,400
still leaving?
