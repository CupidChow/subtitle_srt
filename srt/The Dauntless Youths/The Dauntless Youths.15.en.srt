1
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:48,800
Little girl

2
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,433
What brings you here

3
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,700
Come

4
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,333
Little girl

5
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,166
Have some soup

6
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:00,533
Brother Jiang

7
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,200
Who is this

8
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:05,466
I forgot to introduce everyone

9
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,900
This is my sister Jiang Yiyao

10
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,666
The witch doctor of Donglu City

11
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,300
Everyone, take the antidote

12
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,500
In one hour

13
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,866
You'll be able to move freely

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,866
I never expected

15
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,433
Brother Jiang to have a fairy-like sister skilled in medicine

16
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,633
And knowledgeable about herbs

17
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Such good fortune

18
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:28,633
Thank you, little girl

19
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,066
If you hadn't come

20
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,266
Your brothers might have ended up

21
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,500
In this wild, desolate wilderness

22
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:34,733
But

23
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,633
Weren't you traveling around the mountains

24
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,966
With your master

25
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,000
What brings you here

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Big brother sent me

27
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,000
What does that mean

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Are you saying big brother asked you

29
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:49,800
To be the traveling army doctor

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
No

31
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,833
The journey is long

32
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:54,933
Fortune and misfortune are unpredictable

33
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:55,733
It's too dangerous

34
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,500
Precisely because it's dangerous

35
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,033
Big brother needs me even more

36
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:00,733
Isn't that right

37
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,333
Besides

38
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,300
With big brother protecting me

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,433
Nothing will happen

40
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,466
Moreover, I'm already here

41
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,000
Going back alone now

42
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,366
Wouldn't that be even more dangerous

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
Alright

44
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,433
Since that's the case

45
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,433
Then you'll come with us

46
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,266
If these ruffians bully you

47
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,500
Tell your brother anytime

48
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,066
Brother Jiang

49
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,166
What are you saying

50
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,966
Sister Yiyao is beautiful and kind-hearted

51
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,733
We'd dote on her too much to even think of bullying her

52
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,600
Still bullying her, aren't you?

53
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,566
Right

54
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,333
Exactly

55
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:40,133
Sister Yi Yao

56
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,433
How old are you this year?

57
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,266
Do you have a sweetheart?

58
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,233
What do you think of me, Brother Xin Jia?

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,733
Stop talking nonsense

60
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,400
Does this mean I have a big forehead?

61
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,866
It's a sign of good fortune

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,033
I'm talking about you

63
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,633
Your forehead is shrouded in dark energy

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,466
Kidney deficiency

65
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,000
I never expected this, never expected

66
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,133
Impossible, you must be mistaken

67
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,033
Take another look

68
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:10,800
By the way

69
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,366
My sister

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,066
though extremely clever

71
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,266
when she was young

72
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,466
due to an accident

73
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,066
became deaf

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
and also lost her ability to speak

75
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,133
If anyone wants to talk to her

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,233
please speak slowly

77
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,600
she can read lips

78
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,366
Can communicate with everyone

79
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,900
This time, little sister Yiyao

80
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,233
will come along with us

81
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,533
Please take good care of her

82
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,666
Of course

83
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,266
Yeah

84
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:33,933
In the future

85
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,200
We'll need little sister to look after us

86
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:36,533
Brother Jiang's sister

87
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:37,433
is our sister

88
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:43,800
Watch out

89
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:55,700
Brother Chong

90
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,333
You've been bitten by a snake

91
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,100
Brother Chong, are you okay?

92
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,033
This needs to be treated quickly

93
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:01,900
Otherwise, you might lose an arm

94
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:02,266
Brother Chong

95
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:02,966
Step aside

96
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:06,966
What are you doing?

97
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,466
I'm helping you treat the wound

98
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,900
Brother Chong

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,300
My sister is highly skilled in medicine

100
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:14,000
It's fine

101
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:16,800
Go ahead

102
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,366
Maybe bite on this

103
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,366
Hang in there, Brother Chong

104
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:50,933
Little girl, is everything okay now?

105
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:53,800
Alright

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,066
It's getting late

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,866
Everyone should head back and rest now

108
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:05,800
Thanks

109
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:10,166
No problem

110
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,466
Not sleeping in the middle of the night

111
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,133
Admiring the moon, huh

112
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,900
Brother Jiang

113
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,900
What's wrong? Something on your mind?

114
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,300
No

115
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,333
I just feel

116
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,433
This miasma is rather suspicious

117
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,100
Indeed

118
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,100
In this remote wilderness

119
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,366
How could there be such thick miasma?

120
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,233
How did you know this miasma is toxic?

121
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:22,700
There's some in the southern capital too

122
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,766
Did some research before coming to Zhongli

123
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,033
So I happened to know

124
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:32,733
I see

125
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:33,766
However

126
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,933
This miasma

127
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,200
Though unique to Zhongli

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,066
Miasma usually appears in

129
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,566
Deep mountains and dense forests

130
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,466
It shouldn't be appearing here

131
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,100
And this venomous snake

132
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,400
Snakes are clearly afraid of fire

133
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,333
So how did it get here

134
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,500
It seems that this journey

135
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,566
We are already being watched

136
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,600
In any case

137
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,900
Once we enter Zhongli

138
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,333
Trouble arises

139
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:08,133
No

140
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,800
Once the clue to the elixir of immortality emerged

141
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,033
The storm of trouble began

142
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,933
It suddenly occurs to me

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,433
That worried look on your face

144
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,233
Is increasingly resembling my dog Da Huang
fighting for food

145
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,033
Quite similar

146
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,366
Alright

147
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,133
Stop frowning all the time

148
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,133
No matter what dangers Zhongli holds

149
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,166
We'll face them together

150
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,100
What is there to fear

151
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:51,800
Aren't you sleepy

152
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,766
Not really

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,366
Not really

154
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,533
Then don't sleep

155
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,533
Keep watch with me tonight

156
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:05,066
Let's go

157
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,833
Go go go

158
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,000
Then I'll take the first half of the night, you take the second

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,233
Let's not split it into shifts

160
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,300
We'll keep watch together, it's safer

161
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:17,533
Everyone, look

162
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,433
This is Zhongli City

163
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,033
Truly, seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times

164
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,566
Qingqing

165
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,733
Brother will go lure the bad guys away

166
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:33,966
You wait here for me

167
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,600
Brother, don't go

168
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:36,600
Don't worry

169
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,666
Brother will definitely come back for you

170
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,900
The volume

171
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,233
You are a descendant of the Kun family

172
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,200
You must remember

173
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,533
The Kun Family Army never admits defeat

174
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,200
Father, what's wrong with you

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,833
Father, father

176
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,666
It's Qingqing, father

177
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Go

178
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,500
Hurry, hurry, quickly

179
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,733
It's right ahead

180
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:30,433
Go take a look

181
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,700
What's going on? Why so excited

182
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:34,966
It's a big deal

183
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:37,800
This uncle

184
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,466
What's happening ahead?

185
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:40,633
Why such a hurry?

186
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,433
You all aren't locals, are you?

187
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:44,100
Today is a great day for my Zhongli Kingdom—

188
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,933
the descent of the Holy Maiden.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,700
Hurry along.

190
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47,733
If you miss the auspicious hour, you won't get to see it.

191
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:50,300
Holy Maiden.

192
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,533
Coming early today is not as good as coming
at the right time.

193
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:52,800
Let's go quickly.

194
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,400
Quick, quick, quick.

195
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,633
How could I miss this excitement?

196
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,700
Hurry up!

197
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:58,466
Let's see the Holy Maiden.

198
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,133
Where is she?

199
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,200
Has she come out yet?

200
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,500
Wasn't it said there would be a Holy Maiden?

201
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,933
Where is the Holy Maiden?

202
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,933
Look quickly.

203
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,066
Could there really be a Holy Maiden in this world?

204
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,533
Holy Maiden, Holy Maiden, Holy Maiden.

205
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,633
Qingqing.

206
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:08,933
The rain has stopped.

207
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:10,766
Bring out the kingdom lord's flowers.

208
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,166
We've been standing here for half a shichen already.

209
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,700
When will King Zhongli see us?

210
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,833
The shichen is almost over.

211
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:28,866
May I ask your esteemed ruler,

212
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:29,933
has he not yet begun court deliberations?

213
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,266
When does your ruler hold council?

214
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,900
How dare we presume to comment?

215
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,033
We beg the young masters to be a little patient.

216
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,200
Remain calm, do not be impatient.

217
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,133
This King Zhongli certainly has a lofty air.

218
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,033
He's clearly not putting our envoys' camp

219
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:44,866
in his eyes at all.

220
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,333
Although our envoys' camp

221
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,066
is just starting out,

222
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,533
we still represent His Majesty after all.

223
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,800
For King Zhongli to be so negligent,

224
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:56,033
it's hard to tell

225
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:56,966
whether it's intentional or not.

226
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:58,466
But Zhongli is nothing more than

227
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,966
a small, remote state.

228
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,366
Even with a hundred times the daring,

229
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,733
they wouldn't dare show defiance toward Shangshan.

230
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:03,833
But I've heard

231
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,333
That King Zhongli is incompetent and foolish

232
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,566
All state affairs are controlled by the State Preceptor

233
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,466
It seems

234
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,533
These rumors are not unfounded

235
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,900
What kind of cursed flower is this

236
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:26,933
Such bad luck

237
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,500
Such an exquisite flower

238
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,933
How could you bear to treat it like this, young master

239
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,200
This little flower

240
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,500
Only pricked you once

241
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,633
It doesn't deserve to die for that

242
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,100
However

243
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:10,633
Since you've harmed it

244
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,633
Then you must die

245
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:18,700
Guards

246
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,000
Let him go, let him go

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,133
Kill all of them

248
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,566
Stop

249
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,233
This is an envoy from Mount Shang

250
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,333
They are all heirs of feudal lords

251
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,266
They did not intend to offend Your Majesty

252
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,566
We beg the King

253
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,433
For forgiveness

254
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
State Preceptor

255
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,966
They have destroyed my Midnight Glow

256
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:55,933
You must decide for this prince

257
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,833
Your Majesty, please return to the hall to change attire and discuss matters

258
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,966
This is

259
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,666
The King of Zhongli

260
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,066
Everyone, please proceed

261
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,933
Just now, we were unaware of Your Majesty's arrival

262
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,966
We have been rather disrespectful

263
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,266
We hope for Your Majesty's forgiveness

264
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,933
The Prince's Camp

265
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,133
Representing Mount Shang

266
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,433
It is Zhongli’s failure to properly welcome you

267
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,666
That led to this misunderstanding

268
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,100
Everyone need not take it to heart

269
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,000
Acting as if the Kingdom of Zhongli were his

270
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,533
Enough

271
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:00,966
Then

272
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,233
Thank you, State Preceptor

273
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,200
And Your Majesty’s magnanimity

274
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:07,666
The Prince’s Camp has come this time

275
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,433
As stated in the official letter

276
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:10,866
To seek the elixir of immortality

277
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
For the king

278
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,766
We are newcomers here

279
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,433
And hope

280
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,800
For the understanding of everyone in Zhongli

281
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,200
Give us a hand

282
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:21,266
Rest assured, Prince

283
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:23,500
All of Zhongli

284
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,033
will fully cooperate

285
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,766
However, this matter is of great importance

286
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,600
and we have no leads whatsoever

287
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,133
Since you have come from afar

288
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,866
why not stay at the posthouse for now

289
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,466
Once we find any clues

290
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
we will inform you immediately

291
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,000
Well then

292
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,566
I leave it to you, State Preceptor

293
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,266
I am weary

294
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
Such a minor matter

295
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
State Preceptor

296
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,933
you may handle it yourself

297
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:18,333
This must be

298
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,933
the Prince of Nandu

299
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,666
Lord E Shun, correct

300
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,933
Lord E Shun

301
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,400
have you ever been to Zhongli before

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Never

303
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,433
Zhongli

304
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,300
though remote and secluded

305
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,733
cannot compare to the prosperity of Nandu

306
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,733
but it boasts beautiful landscapes and simple, honest folk

307
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,100
Young Master Eshun.

308
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,800
You might as well take a look around.

309
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,700
In that case, we

310
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,933
shall take our leave first.

311
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,266
What a streak of bad luck.

312
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:04,266
Running into such a bastard.

313
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,500
This young master is just unlucky.

314
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,000
Spouting nonsense.

315
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,233
Did I say something wrong?

316
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,800
We are all heirs of feudal lords.

317
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,033
What kind of scene haven't we seen in our daily lives?

318
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,066
Have any of you seen something like this?

319
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:14,866
Let me tell you.

320
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,433
If Zhongli Kingdom is left in his hands,

321
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,900
it's bound to be ruined sooner or later.

322
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,766
Brother Xin.

323
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,166
We haven't even left the palace yet.

324
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:21,500
You should say less.

325
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,733
Fine, I won't say anymore then.

326
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:23,766
We came all the way to Zhongli.

327
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:24,766
Haven't seen many beauties.

328
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,266
And almost lost our lives here.

329
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,833
Don't you think so?

330
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,433
Speak of the devil, and she shall appear.

331
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,966
Isn't this today's Holy Maiden?

332
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,266
Quick, make way for the beauty.

333
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,000
Go, go, go.

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

335
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:12,800
Quick, quick, quick.

336
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,133
Gentlemen, please hold your steps.

337
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,333
Young master, you come from a distinguished family.

338
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,266
A peerless hero.

339
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,033
Why trouble

340
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,600
a mere woman like me.

341
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,000
Miss.

342
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,366
You've lost something.

343
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:30,866
I didn't take it.

344
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:31,866
If you don't believe me,

345
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,466
you can search me.

346
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,200
This handkerchief

347
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,866
was embroidered by my own hands.

348
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,666
Hence, I treasure it greatly.

349
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,933
I hope you will return it, young master.

350
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,566
Thank you for returning it, young master.

351
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
Aren't you going to thank me?

352
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,300
I let you off easily,

353
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,666
missing a chance to get close to the beauty.

354
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,000
Go.

355
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:23,800
Faster.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,433
Let's go.

357
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,333
I'm tired.

358
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,233
Have them all step back.

359
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:39,800
Yes.

360
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,300
Qingqing, your brother gave this to you.

361
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,900
Do you like it?

362
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,966
Could it really be him?

363
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,266
It seems the news from Nandu is true.

364
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,433
Brother Jiang, the post station has arrived.

365
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,000
What are you all doing?

366
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,600
What’s going on?

367
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,700
I am under the State Preceptor’s orders.

368
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:29,000
To protect all the heirs here.

369
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,633
We are all martial arts-trained men.

370
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,900
We don’t need your protection.

371
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,300
The State Preceptor said,

372
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,533
The heirs are of noble and precious status.

373
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,733
They must not suffer any mishaps in Zhongli.

374
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,766
Otherwise, we cannot answer to Shangshan.

375
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,533
Heavy troop surveillance.

376
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,433
I wonder if the State Preceptor’s intention is

377
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,300
to protect or to monitor?

378
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,166
Withdraw.

379
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:08,133
Brother Huang.

380
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,466
Brother Jiang.

381
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,866
The Zhongli soldiers at the entrance.

382
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,966
Did you see them?

383
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:12,866
We saw them.

384
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,000
Standing there like door gods.

385
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:15,900
But don't worry.

386
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,166
We've already driven them away.

387
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,633
However, they probably haven't gone far.

388
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,300
They're setting up formations around us.

389
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,066
Just shifting from overt to covert.

390
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,033
We, the emissaries of Shangshan,

391
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,600
What are Zhongli's true intentions?

392
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:27,500
Earlier in the main hall,

393
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,966
the state preceptor still acted courteous and friendly,

394
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:30,066
promising full support.

395
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,533
What a performance.

396
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:36,966
The state preceptor said

397
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,966
there are no leads on the search for the medicine,

398
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,300
and that they'd inform us once there's news.

399
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,966
In short,

400
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,400
everything about Zhongli is just too strange.

401
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:44,666
For this journey,

402
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,700
everyone should stay extra vigilant.

403
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:49,700
Brother Xin Jia,

404
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,333
your neck—

405
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,300
what happened to it?

406
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,700
Since you asked about it

407
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,333
I must tell you about it

408
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:57,566
Today I really

409
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,300
walked through the gates of hell

410
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,566
Isn't that right, Brother Chong? You tell him

411
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,666
Never mind if you won't say it

412
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,100
At that time, Brother E Shun saw it

413
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,633
I was standing outside the great hall

414
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,700
I was simply dashingly handsome

415
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,700
Isn't that right? Look

416
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:13,766
Even the number one warrior of the Libei Grasslands

417
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:14,700
was pinned down and beaten

418
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:15,466
I'll tell you in detail later

419
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,533
Brother Jiang, these two won't say it

420
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:18,633
Can you tell us?

421
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,900
Look, this

422
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:20,600
Look

423
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,200
Come and tell us about it

424
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:22,900
When it comes to this

425
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,833
all three of them are embarrassed

426
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:26,200
E Shun

427
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:31,400
toward that Saintess Zhongli

428
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,866
who would have thought someone so unearthly

429
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,033
Prince of Southern Capital

430
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,200
There will come a day when you fall at the skirt of a beauty

431
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,266
It's just casually talking to someone

432
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,100
And you've already lost your composure

433
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,500
If you've taken a liking to them

434
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,166
Just say the word, brother will help you

435
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:31,066
Manifest are the spirits, awe-inspiring from above

436
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,666
With reverent prayers and offerings, I present my sacrifices

437
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,433
For what I seek

438
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,500
I humbly ask the higher gods

439
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:37,933
Where is my brother?

440
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,000
What is this?

441
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,233
I have never seen it before

442
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:53,533
Who is outside?

443
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:54,233
Someone is coming

444
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,733
Saintess, be careful

445
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,300
Linges

446
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:01,466
Linges

447
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:10,233
Linges

448
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:13,733
Kan represents water, Li represents fire

449
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:16,900
Water and fire complement each other

450
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,733
Diviner

451
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,033
You must go save Ling'er quickly

452
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:20,266
It should be the person you've been waiting for all these years

453
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:21,000
Finally returned

454
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,300
Ling'er has fallen into the Divination Altar.

455
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,266
Quick, save her.

456
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,100
It's no use.

457
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,533
Once one enters the Divination Altar,

458
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:28,600
They offer their life to the spirits and gods.

459
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:30,966
No one can save her.

460
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,433
Tonight, I cast the six lines of the hexagram.

461
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:33,733
I knew you would come.

462
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:35,766
I also knew she would die.

463
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:37,333
Dying here and now,

464
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,266
Is simply her fate.

465
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,900
You cannot save her.

466
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,333
Nor can I.

467
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:42,833
Diviner.

468
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,033
Do you truly believe in fate so firmly?

469
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:46,633
The will of heaven is hard to defy.

470
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,166
The Saintess should understand this better than I.

471
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:51,933
If that is the case,

472
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,566
Then what about me?

473
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,766
I was supposed to be a dead man,

474
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,600
Yet I have lived until today.

475
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,000
Can the Diviner calculate,

476
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,166
When I will meet my end?

477
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:08,133
Soon.

478
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:10,700
Go back.

479
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,466
State Preceptor...

480
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,033
The Divination Altar over there—

481
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,100
It has been handled.

482
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,000
The Holy Maiden has returned to her bedchamber.

483
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,233
What was the outcome of her divination?

484
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,133
That person should have returned by now.

485
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
What is meant to come

486
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,433
has finally arrived.

487
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,333
By the way

488
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,233
How is the selection of the next Holy Maiden progressing?

489
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,966
The Suying lineage now has only Su Qingqing left.

490
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:56,566
If she dies

491
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:58,033
there will be no one left to succeed.

492
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:00,400
For the sake of this title of Holy Maiden

493
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I have already let those who should have died

494
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,033
live for far too long.

495
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,066
Pass down the order

496
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,566
Begin preparations for the Sacred Marriage.

497
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,533
But the Sacred Marriage is no small matter.

498
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,000
A perfectly sound reason is necessary

499
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,266
to make the people believe it.

500
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:15,900
A perfectly sound reason?

501
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,833
What could be easier?

502
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,366
Recently, the King’s health has been poor,

503
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,500
has it not?

504
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,266
Su Qingqing knows too much

505
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,000
Now if that person returns

506
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Su Qingqing's death

507
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,700
will surely lure them out

508
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,400
allowing us to eliminate the root of the problem

509
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,000
Guxi

510
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:42,733
You have always excelled in the secrets of divination

511
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,166
and are my trusted right hand

512
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,300
That is why I overruled all opposition

513
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
and entrusted the Divination Platform to you

514
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,366
If I achieve great success in the future

515
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,533
the position of State Preceptor of Zhongli

516
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,166
will be yours

517
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,833
I will not fail the State Preceptor's nurturing grace

518
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:22,100
These past few days

519
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:22,966
every brick in Zhongli City

520
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:24,233
I have investigated thoroughly

521
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,566
But nothing could be found at all

522
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,333
Tell me, this elixir of immortality

523
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,366
is it truly reliable?

524
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,300
With all these people following behind

525
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,133
how could we possibly investigate?

526
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:36,700
Yeah right, and not even
switching to another person

527
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,233
I'm sick of seeing these few people.

528
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,666
How about a change of pace.

529
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,333
What kind of change.

530
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:53,800
What kind of change.

531
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:57,400
Stop right there.

532
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:57,900
After them.

533
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:58,833
Stop.

534
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,566
Don't chase the three of them, just chase me.

535
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:05,666
You really think I'm an easy target, huh.

536
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:08,966
No more bets.

537
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:10,366
Big.

538
00:30:10,366 --> 00:30:11,400
Big.

539
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:12,300
Coming through, make way.

540
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:12,766
Small.

541
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:13,866
I bet on big.

542
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,233
Where did the person go.

543
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:18,133
Hurry up.

544
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:18,833
Let's go.

545
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,833
Trying to mess with me.

546
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,100
You're still a bit too green.

547
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,833
Why is it you.

548
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:57,100
Young master.

549
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,233
My skills are mediocre.

550
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,866
I truly can't fix this chain.

551
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,700
You have to fix it even if you can't.

552
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,066
Do you actually want to get it fixed or not.

553
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,166
Stop following me.

554
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:45,966
Or you'll be split open.

555
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:47,566
Then it wouldn't be a bell

556
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,066
Big big

557
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,733
Small small small

558
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,600
Sorry about that, brothers

559
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,233
I yield to you

560
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,633
Isn't this just too much luck

561
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:58,666
Exactly

562
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,600
Brother

563
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:00,500
Interested in betting something big

564
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,266
What kind of big bet, tell me more

565
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,233
There's a big game in the west

566
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,066
We'll bet on whether the Sacred Marriage in Zhongli City

567
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:08,000
Can proceed smoothly or not

568
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:09,933
What thing

569
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:11,300
Sacred Marriage

570
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,000
Shook off

571
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,966
Followed us for these days

572
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,000
Yet without any discretion

573
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,866
This State Preceptor truly holds great power

574
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,000
I heard this State Preceptor

575
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,100
Is from Shang Mountain

576
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,666
But now he wants to dissuade us from seeking medicine

577
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,366
Really don't know what kind of scheme

578
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:24,400
He has in mind

579
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,233
Everyone, go take a look

580
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,733
It seems they’re going to hold the Sacred Marriage ceremony

581
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:30,733
What is this

582
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,600
That’s what it says here

583
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:42,933
Zhongli has been suffering from annual floods

584
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,233
Our ruler is seriously ill again

585
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:45,166
The state preceptor has ordered

586
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,066
In three days, the Holy Maiden will perform the Sacred Marriage

587
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,500
To appease the heavens and bring blessings upon Zhongli

588
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,500
This Sacred Marriage

589
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,766
How many years has it been since it was last held

590
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:54,633
Indeed

591
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:56,700
It must have been several decades

592
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,300
But ever since the Kun and Su families

593
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,333
Is this topic allowed to be brought up

594
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,666
Sir

595
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,966
What does this Sacred Marriage refer to

596
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,133
Who in Zhongli doesn’t know about the Sacred Marriage

597
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,700
The Sacred Marriage, well, naturally

598
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,566
E Shun, where are you going

599
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,000
What Sacred Marriage

600
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,033
It’s actually human sacrifice

601
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,500
What

602
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:16,800
Say it again

603
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,533
It's human sacrifice

604
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:31,233
So what

605
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:32,933
So what

606
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,133
Did you find any clues

607
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:41,666
No clues

608
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,800
Being able to shake off those scouts

609
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,733
is already considered

610
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,633
quite clever of this young master

611
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,366
Stubborn mule, do you have any clues

612
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:48,466
I heard

613
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:49,900
three days later

614
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,366
the Saintess of Zhongli City will hold a sacred marriage

615
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,233
You heard about it too

616
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,533
You heard about it too

617
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,166
Nonsense

618
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,266
Everyone on the street is talking about it

619
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,333
It seems this sacred marriage

620
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,000
for the people of Zhongli

621
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:03,933
is truly a major event that everyone discusses

622
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
Brother Chong, Brother Xinjia

623
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,800
what exactly is this sacred marriage

624
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:08,900
This sacred marriage

625
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,800
originates from the lineage of the Zhongli Saintess

626
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:12,400
It is an important ritual

627
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
in the Kingdom of Zhongli since ancient times

628
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,200
Its importance lies in eight words

629
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:16,900
Clear water reflects the heart

630
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,300
The sun and moon can bear witness

631
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,733
Do you know what it means?

632
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,066
This "clear water" refers to that mercury

633
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,200
Brother E'Shun

634
00:36:28,866 --> 00:36:30,566
The so-called Sacred Marriage Ritual

635
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,033
is actually the use of mercury

636
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,700
to make the Holy Maiden die in agony

637
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,933
thus preserving an incorruptible body

638
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:36,800
to offer to the heavens

639
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,533
This is simply inhumane

640
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,100
The Holy Maiden's clan

641
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,833
actually treats

642
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,966
the flesh and blood of their own kin this way

643
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:43,966
But it is said that this ritual

644
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:44,866
was abolished by the Holy Maiden's clan

645
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,333
decades ago

646
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,233
Now that it has reappeared in the world

647
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,500
all the common people are speculating

648
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,566
whether it can proceed smoothly

649
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,633
Brother Jiang, any clues?

650
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,100
Have you seen E Shun?

651
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:58,766
No, what's wrong with you guys?
