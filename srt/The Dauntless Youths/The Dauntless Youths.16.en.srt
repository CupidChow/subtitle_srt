1
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,033
I, a dying person,

2
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,666
still trouble the State Preceptor to send people

3
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,000
to watch over me day and night.

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,433
Saintess, it's time to take your medicine.

5
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,333
I won't drink it.

6
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:41,500
Fine, don't drink it then.

7
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:43,800
How have you been serving the Saintess?

8
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,066
Drag them out.

9
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:46,066
Execute all of them by caning.

10
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,733
Spare us, please!

11
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:48,600
Sister, have mercy!

12
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,100
Saintess, we beg for your mercy, Saintess, show us kindness!

13
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,133
I'll drink it.

14
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,566
Good, you all watch over the Saintess and let her rest.

15
00:02:59,133 --> 00:02:59,466
You—

16
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,300
There's poison in this medicine.

17
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,966
I didn't do it.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,333
This medicine was prepared by the State Preceptor himself.

19
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,433
It has nothing to do with me.

20
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,633
Guards!

21
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:11,733
I—

22
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,633
I want to confront the State Preceptor.

23
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:14,766
Guards!

24
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,566
The Saintess wishes to see the State Preceptor.

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,266
Go and report it.

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,233
Saintess, be careful.

27
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,166
Wait a moment.

28
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,966
I don't seem to be in as much pain now.

29
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:33,033
I'm tired and want to go back to rest.

30
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,133
You all can guard outside.

31
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,000
That won't do.

32
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,200
How can the Saintess

33
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,266
be left without anyone to attend to her?

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,933
The Sacred Marriage is in three days.

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,833
If anything really happens to me,

36
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,033
Auntie,

37
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,500
can you bear the responsibility?

38
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,933
Then we will guard outside the door.

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,966
May the Saintess rest peacefully.

40
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:01,800
No one is here now.

41
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:03,633
You can come out.

42
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,100
Brother.

43
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,900
Brother.

44
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:22,600
Qingqing, come quickly.

45
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,900
Qingqing.

46
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,233
It's me.

47
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:01,566
I've returned.

48
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,200
Brothers at NWU.

49
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:19,900
All these years,

51
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,233
you've suffered.

52
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,666
Brother, you've lost weight.

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
Your features have matured.

54
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,633
And you've grown taller.

55
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,900
Seven years.

56
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:38,966
Of course.

57
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,100
But last time in the palace

58
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,366
I still recognized you at a glance

59
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,266
I knew

60
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:48,800
It was my brother coming back

61
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:54,500
By the way

62
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,800
This is the only thing Father left behind

63
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,966
when he passed away

64
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:01,866
Keep it safe

65
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:28,966
What did they give you to drink?

66
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:32,800
Nothing much

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,900
Just something to suppress my illusion magic

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,266
As for me

69
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm no longer the helpless Qingqing

70
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,700
from childhood

71
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:52,666
All these years

72
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,566
There was no news from you

73
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,700
I thought you were long gone

74
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,866
Until those people from the Southern Capital found me

75
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,800
Told me to wait for you patiently

76
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:03,933
Seven years

77
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
And I can still see you alive and well, brother

78
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,466
I have no regrets either.

79
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,166
You can rest assured.

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,266
About the sacred wedding.

81
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:12,833
I know everything.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,866
No matter what.

83
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,600
I won't let you go to your death.

84
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:18,833
Brothers at NWU.

85
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,166
For you to come and go alone.

86
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,100
is already difficult enough.

87
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:23,900
If you also have to bring me along.

88
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm afraid neither of us will make it out.

89
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,233
Our Kun family.

90
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,900
cannot be left with no one left.

91
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:43,000
State Preceptor, may you have boundless fortune.

92
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,066
State Preceptor, may you have boundless fortune.

93
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,866
State Preceptor, what brings you here so late at night?

94
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,666
What is the matter?

95
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,833
I heard that the Holy Maiden.

96
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:07,600
suddenly felt unwell tonight.

97
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,300
It's just a minor ailment.

98
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,200
Thank you for your concern, State Preceptor.

99
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,000
Before the sacred wedding.

100
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,866
I hope the Holy Maiden.

101
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,666
takes great care of her health.

102
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:22,566
State Preceptor, you jest.

103
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,833
You have people guarding me day and night.

104
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,466
Naturally, it will be foolproof.

105
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,266
Saintess, here

106
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,466
There are guests coming.

107
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,833
How could I possibly have guests?

108
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,333
Naturally, it's just me alone.

109
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,400
Is that so?

110
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:46,600
Someone's coming.

111
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:52,700
Halt.

112
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,033
Quickly.

113
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,366
Halt.

114
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,133
Don't run.

115
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:00,500
Halt.

116
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,100
Hurry, go.

117
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:31,433
Quick, pick it up.

118
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:40,266
Go.

119
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:45,466
Go.

120
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,166
Where is the person?

121
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:58,566
Reporting to the State Preceptor.

122
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,500
The person got away.

123
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,866
A bunch of useless fools.

124
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:13,566
What about the medicine chest?

125
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:26,766
Do you have something you want to ask me?

126
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,300
You must have already guessed.

127
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,366
I am not E Shun, the Prince of Nanbo.

128
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,666
But the little slave you saved

129
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,600
on the streets of Donglu.

130
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,566
At that time,

131
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,466
I promised to wait for you on the street.

132
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:10,966
I never expected

133
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,633
Kidnapped by the people from the South Sea Marquis residence

134
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:19,600
Thus taking over his identity

135
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:20,700
Formerly

136
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,566
Went to Eastern Lu to fight beasts

137
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,133
But never expected

138
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,100
To encounter you again

139
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:32,966
All along

140
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,166
I've wanted countless times to confess to you

141
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,233
But I couldn't

142
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Because I must fulfill my mission

143
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:45,400
Only by doing so

144
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,400
Can I have a chance to return to my homeland

145
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,266
And find my only family in this world

146
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,766
Who is the Saintess of Zhongli

147
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Su Qingqing

148
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:10,900
Brother Jiang

149
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:13,566
I'm sorry

150
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,966
I deceived you

151
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,533
Why

152
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,466
Why

153
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,633
Since I didn't ask

154
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,866
Why must you say it

155
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,533
All along you've been flawless and meticulous

156
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,500
Why now reveal everything

157
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,733
Why not continue the deception

158
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,466
Do you know what it means

159
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:56,500
to have spoken those words just now

160
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,333
I know

161
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,600
Brother Jiang has always

162
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,300
seen me as a close friend

163
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,366
and treated me like a brother

164
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:24,633
But now

165
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,433
I cannot

166
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:28,866
nor do I wish

167
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,533
to tell you another lie

168
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:33,866
Brother Jiang

169
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:35,466
Brother

170
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:37,700
Close friend

171
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:44,233
Someone like you

172
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,500
how dare you

173
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,600
What audacity

174
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,266
to dare call me brother

175
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,000
Brother Jiang

176
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,300
Do not forget

177
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:56,966
you are no longer

178
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,133
E Shun, heir to the Marquis of Nanbo

179
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,833
You are merely a lowly servant

180
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,333
I picked up from the streets

181
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:02,866
Wanting to be my brother

182
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:04,800
You are not qualified

183
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:41,900
I, Kunwu, a lowly servant

184
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,566
am aware that I am unworthy of Young Master Jiang's deep affection

185
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,766
If I am fortunate enough to save Qingqing

186
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:49,866
and return safely

187
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:51,766
then

188
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,233
whether you wish to kill or slice me up

189
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,400
I will accept any punishment

190
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,900
How dare you

191
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
You impersonated the heir

192
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,066
which has already implicated my Heir's Camp

193
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,233
Now you still want to meddle in the affairs of Zhongli Kingdom

194
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,733
As long as I, Jiang Wenjuan, am here

195
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:08,933
you can forget about it

196
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,133
I will not reveal my identity

197
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,033
If anything unexpected happens

198
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,100
I will absolutely not implicate the Heir's Camp

199
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,366
At this point

200
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,700
how can I trust you

201
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,866
Why should I believe you

202
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,500
You have infiltrated the Heir's Camp for so long

203
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:29,466
What else have you done

204
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:30,766
that has wronged the Heir's Camp

205
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:31,766
I have not

206
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,033
The matter of the Guifang person and the Gaomei Sacrifice.

207
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,266
Is it all related to you?

208
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,133
It's not me.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you don't believe me,

210
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,200
then just kill me now.

211
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,733
After all, this life of mine

212
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,133
was ultimately saved by you.

213
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:46,900
Kill me.

214
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,833
ku ku ku .

215
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,366
So this is your real name.

216
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,900
We've spent days and nights together,
fighting side by side.

217
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,066
Actually, I always felt you were hiding something.

218
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,400
But if you didn't bring it up, I wouldn't ask.

219
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,033
I thought,

220
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,100
if I treated you with sincerity,

221
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,233
sooner or later,

222
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,766
you would also be willing to be honest with me.

223
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,700
I considered you

224
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,733
a confidant I could entrust my life to.

225
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,700
But from start to finish,

226
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,800
I didn't even know your real name.

227
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,566
Laughable. Truly laughable.

228
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,733
I told you before,

229
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,233
as long as you trust me.

230
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,633
Tell me the truth.

231
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,566
Even if it's a mountain of blades and a sea of flames, a dragon's den and a tiger's lair

232
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
I am willing to charge through it all with you

233
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:25,766
But why do you

234
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,200
Because I am unwilling

235
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,900
The two of us

236
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,666
Are as different as heaven and earth

237
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,900
We should never have crossed paths to begin with

238
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,366
I am someone who

239
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,300
Clings to life only to avenge a sea of blood and deep hatred

240
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,100
A mountain of blades and a sea of flames

241
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,333
A dragon's den and a tiger's lair

242
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,866
These are things I should charge through alone

243
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,166
They have nothing to do with you

244
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:57,933
The promising heir of Eastern Lu

245
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,233
I don't care about your so-called sea of blood and deep hatred

246
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,100
Or your bullshit about clinging to life

247
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,033
For whom you live

248
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:04,866
For whom you die

249
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,933
Only I can decide that

250
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:09,300
Little slave

251
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,800
I bought your life

252
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:16,500
Only I can decide

253
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:17,400
How should you live

254
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:18,200
For whom do you live

255
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:20,866
Now

256
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,600
I want you to live for yourself

257
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:34,866
Do you understand

258
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,000
Interesting

259
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,733
Never thought that guy's stand-in

260
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:53,933
Has another identity

261
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,733
Brother Chong, wait for me

262
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,333
Brother Jiang, Brother E Shun

263
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:00,133
What happened

264
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,200
Nothing too serious

265
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,433
A few days of rest and it'll be fine

266
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:16,000
Speak

267
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,066
If you don't make things clear

268
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,300
You won't leave this door today

269
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,200
You acting alone recklessly

270
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,900
Will only drag all of us down

271
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,600
You can't stop me

272
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,666
Then give it a try

273
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:38,733
Brother Chong's fine blade

274
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:39,666
Everyone has seen it

275
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,766
No need to appreciate it under the lamp

276
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,100
No

277
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,533
This gentleman

278
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:52,900
We are brothers, after all.

279
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:54,866
Could it be that I can't even hear

280
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:55,466
a few honest words from you?

281
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:56,900
Brother

282
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,600
You are too naive.

283
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,733
Will you stop stirring up trouble?

284
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,733
Let him finish speaking first.

285
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:09,133
Esteemed sir,

286
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,833
I am not like those two fools.

287
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,000
I know you are unwilling to speak the truth

288
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,733
because you are afraid of implicating us.

289
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:15,566
But now we are

290
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,666
grasshoppers tied to the same rope.

291
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,100
If you don't tell the truth,

292
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,233
it will only leave us completely in the dark.

293
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:21,133
Hidden arrows are hard to guard against.

294
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,700
Speak up.

295
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,466
My original name is Kunwu,

296
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,700
a native of the Zhongli Kingdom.

297
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,366
I am the only son of Kun Ze,

298
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,500
Zhongli's First-Rank Loyal and Martial General.

299
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,466
Our Kun family

300
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,066
has been a military lineage for generations,

301
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,300
commanding the Kun Family Army of Zhongli.

302
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:04,600
This bronze piece

303
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,300
This is the emblem of my Kun Family Army.

304
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,066
My mother, Su Ying,

305
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,033
was the Holy Maiden of You Su from Zhongli,

306
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,500
holding a revered status.

307
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,266
Had nothing changed,

308
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,066
I would have inherited my father's position

309
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,300
as the Loyal and Martial General,

310
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,866
guarding the capital,

311
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,866
protecting the royal family.

312
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,166
My sister, Su Qingqing,

313
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
inheriting our mother's bloodline,

314
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,000
was destined to become the new Holy Maiden of the You Su clan.

315
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,133
However,

316
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:35,766
seven years ago,

317
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,866
the Zhongli royal family went to Shang Mountain for an audience,

318
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,366
returning only after several months.

319
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,066
When they came back,

320
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,833
the royal carriages

321
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,400
were escorted by the iron cavalry of Shang Mountain.

322
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:48,433
On New Year's Eve,

323
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,300
my father was ordered to enter the palace to welcome the monarch.

324
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,433
Little did anyone expect that everything

325
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:57,066
would change because of this.

326
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:20,133
Your humble general.

327
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:22,166
Welcome, Lord of the State

328
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,200
The Lord of the State is granted an audience with the King

329
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:28,366
You have only returned today

330
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:30,033
The journey must have been exhausting

331
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,433
I wonder why the Lord of the State urgently summoned this general

332
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:34,300
What is the matter

333
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,500
Who are you

334
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,200
Where is the Lord of the State

335
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,700
General, I'm not sure if

336
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,000
Remain calm

337
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,066
I am an envoy from Shangshan

338
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,600
Xian Xuanji

339
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,166
By the King's decree

340
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,000
There is a secret edict

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,600
To be proclaimed first

342
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,733
Presenting the will of the King of Shang

343
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
The Lord of the State of Zhongli

344
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,400
Has committed treason

345
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,200
Using the opportunity of the audience

346
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:15,266
Attempted assassination

347
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:17,100
And was executed on the spot

348
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,466
However, the King, with a heart embracing the world

349
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,633
Compassionate toward all subjects

350
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:25,266
Has decided to let bygones be bygones

351
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,166
And change the Zhongli Fang State

352
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,166
Into a vassal state

353
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:29,600
From this day forward

354
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,133
Xian Xuanji served as the Imperial Preceptor.

355
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,000
Assisting the young ruler Zhongli Yuan.

356
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:35,533
Zhongli

357
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:37,100
Every spring and autumn

358
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:38,600
They would pay tribute to Shang Mountain

359
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,166
To show their loyalty.

360
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,466
Not only that

361
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
General, I'm not sure if

362
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,866
Must also hand over his military authority

363
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,966
And swear by himself

364
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,533
To remain loyal to Shang Mountain until death.

365
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,900
Quite a temper

366
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:18,700
Mother

367
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,433
You are sending orders to Sujia Village

368
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,066
What happened?

369
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:25,866
Nothing

370
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:26,700
Just as a precaution.

371
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,700
Your father has been away for a long time

372
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,266
I will go to the palace to look for him.

373
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:31,533
You two stay home and behave.

374
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,633
Mother

375
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:38,366
Then when will you be back?

376
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:39,966
Qingqing

377
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:41,500
Do you remember

378
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,400
What is the destiny of the holy maiden of the Yousu clan?

379
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:44,566
I remember.

380
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,766
The You Su clan bears the power of illusion.

381
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:49,266
The lineage of the holy maiden is blessed by heaven with an illusion form.

382
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:50,633
We must use this illusion form and power.

383
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,166
To protect the peace of Zhongli.

384
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,866
If we fail to guard the illusion form,

385
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:54,766
What should we do?

386
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:01,233
What should we do?

387
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,900
Speak quickly!

388
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,133
Mother.

389
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,233
Don't scare Qingqing.

390
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:07,766
Don't expect your brother to plead for you.

391
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:08,800
Your brother has his own mission.

392
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,733
We, the holy maidens of the Su family,

393
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,966
Have our own destiny ordained by heaven.

394
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:13,200
Regardless of life or death,

395
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
We must never forget it for a moment. Speak quickly!

396
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,633
If we cannot guard the illusion form,

397
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,933
We should be consumed by raging flames,

398
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,033
Offering our flesh as a sacrifice to heaven and earth.

399
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:23,733
Mother.

400
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:24,933
What does she mean by that?

401
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:26,766
How could you teach Qingqing

402
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,166
To swear such an unlucky vow?

403
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,266
She carries the bloodline of the Su Clan Saintess

404
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,933
This is our destiny

405
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,466
Mother never wished for such an oath

406
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:38,500
to one day come to pass

407
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,300
Let's go

408
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,200
We're going back inside to eat

409
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:56,266
The volume

410
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,700
You must take good care of your little sister

411
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:01,300
Yes, Mother

412
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,233
Perhaps today Mother was overthinking things

413
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:05,666
Mother is going to pick up your father

414
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:06,700
Alright

415
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,500
Go eat now

416
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,666
Let's go

417
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:11,633
Time to eat

418
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,500
Can we go any faster?

419
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,700
But unexpectedly

420
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,966
after my mother left the Kun residence

421
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,566
on her way to the Zhongli royal palace

422
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,733
she was ambushed

423
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,200
The Kun family army escorting my mother

424
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:34,000
all died in battle

425
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,733
And my mother

426
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:36,766
was taken captive by them

427
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:37,833
Step back

428
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:39,833
Young Lord

429
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,533
Xian Xuanji

430
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,400
Where is my Zhongli, the Young Lord?

431
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:18,633
And then?

432
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,566
What did General Kun see in the bedchamber?

433
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,733
The events of that day

434
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:25,066
I only heard about it later

435
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,933
From the soldiers who escaped from the palace that day

436
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,300
But at that time, they were outside the bedchamber

437
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,066
No one knew what my father saw in the bedchamber

438
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,566
What he saw

439
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,133
What he did

440
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,700
They said

441
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,066
When they pushed open the bedchamber

442
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:42,466
They only saw

443
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,300
What did they see? Tell me!

444
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,300
They saw

445
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,400
My mother's body

446
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:57,366
Lying in my father's arms

447
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:01,933
My mother's head

448
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,700
Had already been severed by my father

449
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:16,400
This

450
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,500
Perhaps

451
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,000
Could there be some misunderstanding in all this?

452
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:26,566
Perhaps someone is framing them

453
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,933
My father and mother

454
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,633
Shared a bond stronger than gold

455
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:33,266
A match made in heaven

456
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,366
There is definitely something strange about this

457
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:36,933
Then

458
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,400
Did you ever see General Kun again later

459
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,700
Did you ask him about it

460
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,933
That day

461
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,733
I stayed at home with my younger sister

462
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:49,100
Filled with anticipation

463
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:51,000
For Father and Mother to return and celebrate New Year's Eve together

464
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,100
But who could have predicted that the events of that night

465
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,600
Would turn the Kun residence

466
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,933
Into a living hell

467
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,366
Run quickly

468
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,533
No!

469
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:15,800
Hurry, go

470
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,333
Father, Father

471
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,200
Father, Father

472
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:22,100
Father, Father

473
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:25,100
Father, where are you

474
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:25,800
Father

475
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,600
Help, Father

476
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,466
Father

477
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,300
Bolt the door

478
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,900
Qingqing, hurry, go

479
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,433
Father,Father

480
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,833
What's happening outside

481
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,300
What's wrong with Uncle Lin and the others

482
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:40,833
What

483
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:42,900
General Lin has also become like this

484
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,033
Doesn't that mean my Kun family army is letting

485
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,233
Aye, where's Mother

486
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,200
Where is Mother

487
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:53,366
Qingqing

488
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:55,933
It was me

489
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,200
Who personally sent your mother away

490
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:07,733
Aye, what's wrong with you

491
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,566
Father,Father

492
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,133
Father

493
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,600
Father, what's wrong with you, Father

494
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,266
This is Qingqing, Father

495
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,266
This is Qingqing

496
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:19,933
Father

497
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,166
Father

498
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,266
Father

499
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:29,733
Ying Mei

500
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:32,266
Father

501
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm sorry

502
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,533
I can't do it

503
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,233
Father

504
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,200
Father,Father

505
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,500
Go

506
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:55,700
My child

507
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,466
No matter what happens

508
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,266
None of you come out

509
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:02,133
Did you hear

510
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:04,900
Father

511
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:08,466
My son

512
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,600
You are a descendant of the Kun family

513
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:12,000
You must remember

514
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,633
The Kun Family Army

515
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,333
Never admits defeat

516
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,466
Survive

517
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,466
Protect Qingqing well

518
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,066
Go in

519
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:42,200
Father, father, father

520
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,666
Zhongli has no master

521
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:47,200
The Kun family has committed treason

522
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:48,800
Divine punishment is imminent

523
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,000
The entire clan turns into demons

524
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,266
Assassinate the holy maiden

525
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:53,833
Slaughter close relatives

526
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:55,000
Transmit

527
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,000
The monarch's handwritten decree

528
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,366
The Kun clan

529
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,066
Their crimes are unforgivable

530
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:01,733
Exterminate

531
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,333
The entire family

532
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,833
My Kun Family Army

533
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,666
Never admits defeat

534
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,200
All soldiers, heed the order

535
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,266
Follow me into the residence

536
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,733
Search for the remaining rebels of the Kun family

537
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:30,900
Quick, go search quickly

538
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,600
Yes

539
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:33,133
Both of you, go over there

540
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,266
Yes

541
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,233
Search carefully

542
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:36,900
Brother

543
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,166
I'm scared

544
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:40,633
Don't be afraid

545
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,533
Search thoroughly for me

546
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,333
Your brother is here

547
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,166
By the State Preceptor's order

548
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,400
Not even a single fly is to be let through

549
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:46,366
Yes

550
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,866
Everyone, keep your eyes wide open and search carefully

551
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:48,433
Yes

552
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,166
The volume

553
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,833
You must take good care of your sister

554
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,866
My child, survive

555
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,900
Protect Qingqing well

556
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:58,666
Qingqing

557
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,800
Brother will go lure the bad guys away

558
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,066
Wait for me here

559
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,700
Brother, don't go

560
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:03,700
Don't worry

561
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,733
Brother will definitely come back for you

562
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,066
You must protect yourself

563
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:08,533
Remember

564
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,433
No matter what happens outside

565
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,300
You must protect yourself

566
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,233
Don't make a sound

567
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,333
Wait here for your brother to return

568
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:24,866
Brother

569
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,033
You bunch of scoundrels

570
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:32,933
Give me back my Dad

571
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:34,400
Stop

572
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:36,166
Chase

573
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,600
Chase

574
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:39,766
Stop

575
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,366
