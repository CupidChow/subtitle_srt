1
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,633
You are not him

2
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,633
Who are you exactly

3
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:50,666
Are you alright

4
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,400
What is this about

5
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,466
Why are you suddenly so worked up about this

6
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:56,600
Enough

7
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:57,766
How is it

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,533
Brother E Shun, are you injured

9
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,133
Are you okay

10
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:00,833
How is it

11
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,200
Only he has this scar

12
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:04,766
How do you have it

13
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,300
Let's go

14
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,800
I'll take you back to change your clothes first

15
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,233
Have some medicine first

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,700
Thank you

17
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:39,733
That scar

18
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,100
Why is it so deep

19
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,000
If you want to be exactly like me

20
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,533
There is one more thing you need to do

21
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,500
Thank you

22
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,400
What Brother Jiang wants to ask

23
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,100
is not just this, is it

24
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,000
What exactly do you want to say

25
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,433
These past few days

26
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,166
Brother Jiang has been testing me

27
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,166
Actually

28
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,100
Brother Jiang is not wrong to think so

29
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother Chong and I

30
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,500
are indeed deeply connected

31
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,333
But

32
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,166
we also have past grievances and enmity

33
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,333
Many years ago

34
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,300
the battle for the first warrior of the grasslands was about to begin

35
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,133
I was ordered to escort the merchant group to Libei

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Before setting off

37
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,800
I heard that the second young master of the North Bo Hou Mansion, Chong

38
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,133
was brave and skilled in battle

39
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,066
with unparalleled intelligence

40
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,566
a rare young hero of the time

41
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,633
so I wanted to take this opportunity

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,933
to befriend him

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,433
Such impressive skills

44
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,833
as expected of the second young master Chong

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,633
I've long heard of you

46
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,200
Tell me

47
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,866
what underhanded methods did you use

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,300
to make the son of the South Bo Hou

49
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
appoint you as this year's reception envoy

50
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,033
for the Southern Capital merchant group

51
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,733
Appointed for you.

52
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,566
I don't know any Southern Capital's heir

53
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,966
Nor do I know any merchant guild

54
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,433
You're still lying

55
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,433
Over the years

56
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:09,533
The Southern Capital Merchant Guild

57
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,566
Has always been managed by me

58
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:11,500
When did it ever fall to a

59
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,400
Lowly bastard like you

60
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:15,833
You shut your mouth

61
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,200
Fine

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,233
In front of Father

63
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:20,566
You dare show no respect for your elders

64
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,333
I think you won’t know your place

65
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,133
Until you’ve tasted some hardship

66
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:24,833
Stop it

67
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,133
Father, look at him

68
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:30,333
Father

69
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:31,866
Believe me

70
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,000
Father

71
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,800
Do you know why you’re being beaten?

72
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:45,500
I don’t know, Father

73
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:46,800
Let me tell you

74
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,566
On this Libei grassland

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,633
Though you bear the surname Chong

76
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,866
But always remember

77
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,400
Some things

78
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,266
Should fight

79
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,500
There are some things

80
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,400
that should not be contended

81
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,733
Always be clear

82
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,833
about your own status

83
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,500
Do you understand

84
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,333
Do you understand

85
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,466
I wonder what status Second Young Master Chong

86
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,333
needs to understand about himself

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,466
Is it the reception envoy of my Southern Capital Merchant Group

88
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:22,866
Rise, you unfilial son

89
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,166
E Shun, heir of the Marquis of Nanbo

90
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,433
pays respects to Uncle

91
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,566
Nephew, you have traveled from afar

92
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:43,700
and I did not come to greet you

93
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:44,766
My apologies

94
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,000
Uncle

95
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,166
Without Second Young Master Chong's permission

96
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,466
I appointed him as

97
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,200
the reception envoy of my Southern Capital Merchant Group

98
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,800
Such a rash move

99
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,600
seems to have caused

100
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,766
quite a bit of trouble for Second Young Master Chong

101
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,666
However

102
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,933
my residence of the Marquis of Nanbo

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
has never been concerned with social status

104
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,700
No matter who Second Young Master Chong

105
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,100
is in the Libei Grasslands

106
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,966
or what status he holds

107
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,133
the position of Reception Envoy

108
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:11,833
for our Southern Capital Merchants Guild

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,466
must be filled by Second Young Master Chong

110
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:15,800
Father

111
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,066
Second Young Master Chong

112
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:18,300
what do you think

113
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,533
Father

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,233
I am indeed forgetful

115
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,533
and often fail to remember my status

116
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,366
but I disdain even more to compete for the role

117
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,033
of Reception Envoy for the Southern Capital Merchants Guild

118
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,733
because I only need to remember

119
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:42,233
that I am Chong Yibiao of the Libei Grasslands

120
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,466
Forgive me, Father

121
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,566
I take my leave first

122
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,966
Truly an ill-mannered bastard

123
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,433
What exactly do you want

124
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,266
Just because I refused

125
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,733
your Southern Capital assignment

126
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,133
Do you really think

127
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,100
I only want you

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,566
to be my reception envoy from the Southern Capital?

129
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:46,700
I

130
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:47,700
merely wish to

131
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,566
befriend you

132
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,366
The way Your Highness makes friends

133
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,866
is truly unique

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,366
Do you really think

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,433
I was the one who brought you here?

136
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,800
If not, then who?

137
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,266
Your Highness

138
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,600
Is Your Highness asleep?

139
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,600
It's so late

140
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,200
Does Young Master Chong have business?

141
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,733
I was patrolling the camp in secret earlier

142
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,066
and noticed intruders

143
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,166
I was concerned it might disturb Your Highness's rest

144
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,233
so I came to check

145
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,166
Intruders

146
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:37,666
I haven't seen any

147
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,066
but you all

148
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,133
have disturbed my peaceful sleep

149
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,600
If Young Master Chong is still uneasy

150
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,166
you may enter my tent

151
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,333
and search it

152
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:54,866
That won't be necessary.

153
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,100
Sorry to disturb you, Your Highness.

154
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,166
Let's go.

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,066
I found you knocked out in the stables.

156
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,200
So I rescued you and hid you in my tent.

157
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,966
I didn't expect your brother to still be so relentless.

158
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,133
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,633
I misunderstood you.

160
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,133
You brothers are quite interesting.

161
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,400
Arguing during the day is one thing,

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,666
but at night,

163
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,000
you actually want to resort to violence.

164
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,433
I tied you up

165
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,833
because I was afraid you might act impulsively upon waking.

166
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,200
Thank you for saving me, Your Highness.

167
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:38,433
However, the family matters of our Chong family

168
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,366
are not for an outsider like you

169
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,666
to comment on.

170
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:43,700
I didn't expect

171
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,233
that Brother Chong would be

172
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,466
so fierce and tough with me,

173
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,600
yet so willing to compromise and yield

174
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,600
when facing his father and brother.

175
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:51,800
What do you mean by that?

176
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,266
I mean

177
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,400
The legendary Second Young Master of the Chong family

178
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,366
But you're just a weak, easy-to-bully

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,933
submissive waste anyway

180
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,900
Meddling in others' business

181
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,566
Right

182
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,300
The wild wolf of Libei

183
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,100
Should at least have this kind of attitude

184
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,233
You keep provoking me in every way

185
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,300
What exactly do you want

186
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,000
I've said it

187
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,300
I just want to befriend

188
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,466
Brother Chong

189
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,600
How about it

190
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:23,266
Think it over

191
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,833
The heir of Nandu is so noble

192
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,066
How could someone like me

193
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,800
with an unclear background, be your friend

194
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,000
What kind of background you have

195
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,933
It seems the Second Young Master of the Chong family

196
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,933
cares more about it than others do

197
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,400
Shut your mouth

198
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,300
They snatched your duty today

199
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:51,666
hurt your people

200
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,766
What will you do in the days to come

201
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,566
Will you always remain subservient to that incompetent fool

202
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,333
I have long heard of the Second Young Master of the Chong Family from Libei

203
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:00,900
Renowned for both literary and martial prowess

204
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,266
Bold and courageous

205
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,433
I have long held deep admiration for you

206
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,733
Never did I expect that upon meeting you this time

207
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,433
You have already tamed wolves into dogs

208
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,166
Shut your mouth

209
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,366
I warn you

210
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,766
My affairs

211
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,000
Are none of your concern

212
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,033
Don’t cause me trouble

213
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:31,866
Brother Chong

214
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,333
You and I are the same kind of people

215
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,900
Why would you willingly break your own fangs

216
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,733
We are not the same

217
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,033
Then, the competition for the title of

218
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,466
First Warrior of the Grasslands tomorrow

219
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,933
Do you not plan to participate either

220
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:09,633
Warrior, warrior, warrior

221
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,800
Aren’t you curious, Young Master

222
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,900
About this battle of warriors

223
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,233
Who will ultimately win?

224
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,066
This year, Brother Chong is competing.

225
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,366
What suspense is there about the winner?

226
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:23,933
It's getting late.

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,633
It's time to prepare

228
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,966
congratulatory gifts for Brother Chong.

229
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:30,966
Warrior, warrior, warrior.

230
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,766
This represents the First Warrior's

231
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Blade of the Valiant.

232
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:58,966
It belongs to you now.

233
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:00,566
Take it.

234
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,266
Thank you, Father.

235
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,666
Rise.

236
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,566
I truly never expected

237
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,400
that the First Warrior would be you.

238
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,366
However,

239
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,933
this year, Libe advocates frugality.

240
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,466
Our Marquis' residence,

241
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:23,300
naturally, must take the lead.

242
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,233
I'm afraid

243
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,133
it would be inappropriate to invite singing, dancing, or music

244
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,133
to celebrate for my brother.

245
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,766
It's fine.

246
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,133
Libe advocates frugality,

247
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,266
but in Nando, we have no such rules.

248
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,933
Second Young Master Chong.

249
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:40,466
Joyfully obtaining the title of Libei's First Warrior

250
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,700
How could there not be good wine and meat?

251
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:43,666
Brother Chong

252
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,466
Today is your big day

253
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,300
This humble gift

254
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,366
is presented by my younger brother

255
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,166
Wishing Brother Chong

256
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
the libei manor

257
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,066
vast skies and broad lands

258
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,266
to roam freely and joyfully

259
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:55,700
This

260
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,133
bronze jade-hilted dagger

261
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,766
is an extremely rare treasure!

262
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,700
Indeed

263
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,800
not to mention in Libei

264
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,233
even in the capital

265
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,433
it is exceptionally rare

266
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:05,166
Yes

267
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,800
Young Master E Shun, this gift

268
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,366
is far too precious, isn't it?

269
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,733
Indeed

270
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,266
Brother Chong

271
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:30,666
Today's banquet

272
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,300
is specially arranged for you

273
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,233
Tonight, everyone should drink to your heart's content

274
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,400
my Southern Capital fine brew is inexhaustible

275
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,666
Excellent

276
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,166
How about it, Brother Chong

277
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:46,900
Are you satisfied

278
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,333
You're satisfied

279
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,600
You're satisfied

280
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,433
Stop jumping

281
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,000
Everyone, stop for me

282
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,966
Stop

283
00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,200
This is the Northern Li Royal Tent

284
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:00,633
This is no place for your mischief

285
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:02,266
Everyone, get out for me

286
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:03,200
Get out

287
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,066
Father, look at them

288
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,933
A Biao

289
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,533
Have your friends

290
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Take their precious gifts

291
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:12,333
And leave

292
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,666
Their kindness

293
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,266
We in Northern Li

294
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:16,933
Appreciate it in our hearts

295
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,066
Father

296
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:23,633
These wines, meats, songs, and dances

297
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,233
Were specially prepared by the Young Master for your son

298
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,333
To celebrate as Northern Li's First Warrior

299
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,633
It's hard to refuse a friend's earnest hospitality

300
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,766
And your son didn't want to spoil the mood

301
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,300
Besides

302
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,700
This is not our

303
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,000
Libei's way of treating guests, is it?

304
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:37,766
You

305
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:39,166
Second Young Master Chong

306
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,600
Since you and I are close friends

307
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,066
Then this cup of wine

308
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,433
Can be enjoyed anywhere

309
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:46,966
Moreover

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,166
Uncle is absolutely right

311
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,933
How could this small royal tent

312
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,566
Ever contain

313
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,266
The profound bond between you and me?

314
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,400
Come

315
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,433
Let's go outside

316
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,333
And drink to our heart's content

317
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,133
Come

318
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:04,200
Out

319
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,133
Everyone, get out

320
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,333
Brother Chong, look

321
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,833
Away from this small royal tent

322
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
The world outside

323
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:19,933
Is vast

324
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:22,933
Come

325
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:41,600
Brother Chong

326
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,466
You've gained both fame and fortune

327
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,666
Why sigh in despair?

328
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,700
What use is fame and fortune?

329
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,433
In this vast libei

330
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:52,600
And who else

331
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:53,766
is truly happy for me

332
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,200
The wine of Libei

333
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,866
is truly strong

334
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,500
What are you doing

335
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:15,700
Brother Chong, look

336
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,233
Such strong wine

337
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,133
even if it's poured into the fire

338
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,433
if it wishes

339
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,666
it can burn this entire grassland

340
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,733
to ashes

341
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:36,966
In my eyes

342
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,500
Brother Chong

343
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:41,200
is the strongest wine

344
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,533
on this Libei grassland

345
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,500
Even if everyone in the world

346
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:46,400
is prejudiced against you

347
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,000
it still cannot diminish even a bit

348
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,733
of your strength as the number one warrior of the grassland

349
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:51,600
Because this

350
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,300
is something you seized yourself

351
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,100
No one can change it

352
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,333
not even your father or brothers

353
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,700
Besides

354
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:07,733
I, E Shun, am your friend

355
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:08,633
Between heaven and earth.

356
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,200
There's only this one person.

357
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:11,933
Could it possibly go wrong?

358
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,266
What?

359
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,400
I treat you as a friend.

360
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
What do you mean by this?

361
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,000
Is this?

362
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,233
Acknowledging me as your friend?

363
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,933
Earlier in the royal tent.

364
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,933
I forgot to say.

365
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:37,366
Tonight's wine.

366
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,900
I only drink for friends.

367
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:42,466
Good.

368
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,933
Cheers.

369
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:45,433
Cheers.

370
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,166
What?

371
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,966
How come it's... it's gone?

372
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:13,266
You're drunk.

373
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,133
I'm not...

374
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,800
Not drunk.

375
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,166
It's your horses'...

376
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,266
Moustache.

377
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,800
Too strong.

378
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:31,966
Never expected.

379
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,500
The dignified hereditary prince of Nanbo.

380
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,533
When drunk.

381
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:39,633
Turns out to be a little stammerer.

382
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,266
You... non-

383
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,033
Nonsense.

384
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,600
You're the...

385
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,733
Stamens.

386
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,266
Knot

387
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:48,900
Stutter

388
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,666
Since then

389
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,700
Brother Chong and I have become kindred spirits

390
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,833
Galloping through the rivers and lakes on the Libei grasslands

391
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,066
Living a life of unrestrained joy

392
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
The so-called bright moon and gentle breeze encircling the lakeside

393
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,233
A time of transcendent freedom and ease

394
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,766
Is simply nothing more than this

395
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,700
Brother Chong, do you see it

396
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,400
I see it

397
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,033
If I keep practicing like this

398
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,300
Will I be able to surpass you

399
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,366
You're still far from it

400
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,966
What

401
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,233
Afraid that teaching the apprentice too well

402
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,200
Might starve the master to death

403
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,133
In Libei, my horse is like my own two feet

404
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,000
In the Southern Capital, you ride in a sedan chair when you go out

405
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,733
There's no need to compare in the first place

406
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,933
But I still prefer Libei

407
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:17,466
Where the sky is high and the earth is vast

408
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,400
Free and unconstrained

409
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,000
Never thought the Southern Capital's young master

410
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,200
I actually like this desolate Libei grassland.

411
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,366
Although the Southern Capital is exquisite and prosperous,

412
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,933
it feels more like an exquisite birdcage,

413
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,933
making it hard to breathe.

414
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,533
Speaking of this Libei grassland,

415
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,666
it is boundless and vast.

416
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,466
Brother Chong, why do you

417
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,666
insist on drawing a prison around yourself?

418
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:44,800
Let's go.

419
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,666
Let's compete again.

420
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:50,266
Alright.

421
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:51,066
Bring it on.

422
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:51,800
Who's afraid of who?

423
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:01,433
Let's go.

424
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:18,066
Not long after,

425
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,900
Brother E returned to the Southern Capital.

426
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,900
By the time we met again,

427
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,566
three years had already passed.

428
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Bullseye!

429
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,466
The eldest young master is truly impressive.

430
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,100
So impressive.

431
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:35,833
Truly remarkable, eldest young master.

432
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,900
Look quickly.

433
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,766
It's the second young master Chong's arrow.

434
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,533
It's second young master Chong's arrow.

435
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:46,866
Look quickly.

436
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,800
Second Young Master Chong has arrived

437
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,033
Look, look

438
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,366
That is Second Young Master Chong

439
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,733
He truly has an extraordinary demeanor

440
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,166
Clearly a dragon among men at first glance

441
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,966
Worthy of being the first beauty of our grasslands

442
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,233
The warrior that even Lianxin sister has taken a liking to

443
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,066
Isn't that right

444
00:23:58,066 --> 00:23:59,433
They really are a perfect match

445
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:00,566
That Eldest Young Master Chong

446
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,466
Did he shoot an empty arrow just now

447
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,966
Showboating

448
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,633
I concede, elder brother

449
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,533
Truly worthy of being the first warrior of the grasslands

450
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,400
You two are so well-matched

451
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:18,433
He's really too handsome

452
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:21,300
A toad lusting after a swan's flesh

453
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,166
Young master

454
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,200
Second Young Master Chong

455
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,866
Second Young Master Chong

456
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,700
Greetings, young master

457
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,233
Second Young Master Chong

458
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,000
Second Young Master Chong

459
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,600
Greetings, Second Young Master Chong

460
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,633
Why are you back so early today?

461
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,833
Have all the horses on the pasture been fed?

462
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:46,733
Yes.

463
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,933
I wanted to return early to watch you shoot the eagle.

464
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:52,166
Unfortunately, I still missed it.

465
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:56,800
Here.

466
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,000
This black eagle is for you.

467
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:58,700
Really?

468
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,400
Thank you.

469
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,333
Thank you, Second Young Master Chong.

470
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,233
Rest assured.

471
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,100
I will diligently practice riding and archery from now on.

472
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,466
One day.

473
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,433
I will also shoot an eagle.

474
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:07,566
And give it to you in return.

475
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:09,866
Good.

476
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,266
I'll be waiting for you.

477
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:17,700
Second Young Master.

478
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:18,933
Your letter has arrived.

479
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,133
To my esteemed Brother Chong,

480
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,033
I hope this letter finds you well.

481
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,933
The nights in the southern capital are deep,

482
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,400
and the February air is slightly cool.

483
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:31,866
From afar, I have heard

484
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,100
that in recent years you have been galloping across the grasslands of Libei,

485
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,933
gaining the respect of countless people.

486
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,900
You must be delighted.

487
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
Very proud of it.

488
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,633
For three years

489
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:42,766
I have stood in the Southern Capital

490
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,566
The equestrian skills taught by Brother Chong

491
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:45,966
Diligently studied and rigorously practiced

492
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:48,100
Have now been completely mastered

493
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:50,266
When I return to Libei

494
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,900
I will definitely compete with you, brother

495
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,466
To see who is superior

496
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:57,866
Good

497
00:25:58,966 --> 00:25:59,866
I'll be waiting for you

498
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,233
Brother Chong

499
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:12,166
Have you been waiting long?

500
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:14,566
What brings you here?

501
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,233
To marry the foremost beauty of the grasslands

502
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:19,200
Such a major event

503
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,500
And you didn’t immediately

504
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,766
Inform an old friend like me

505
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,066
Why did you come so suddenly this time?

506
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,633
I missed Brother Chong

507
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,433
Felt like coming

508
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,300
So I came

509
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:48,866
Of course

510
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,766
Also to pay a visit to

511
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:50,800
My future sister-in-law

512
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,266
I hear she’s the foremost beauty of the grasslands

513
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,766
Brother Chong is truly blessed
with romantic fortune indeed.

514
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:57,166
It seems

515
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,866
you really like

516
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,966
my future sister-in-law

517
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,900
It's not about liking or not liking

518
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:05,966
It's just the custom of our Libei

519
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:08,333
To become the prairie's first warrior

520
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:09,500
naturally means wedding

521
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,766
the prairie's first beauty, that's all

522
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:13,566
Well then

523
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,200
in any case

524
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,566
congratulations on your years of effort

525
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,666
finally bearing fruit

526
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Not only have you established

527
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,366
your own prestige on the prairie

528
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,000
but you've also proven to the world

529
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,566
your exceptional, one-in-a-hundred strength

530
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:26,066
I also wish that one day

531
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:28,900
you may soon take residence in the North Bo Marquis's Estate

532
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:35,733
I hope so

533
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,033
Brother Chong, don’t think I’m joking

534
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,500
As long as we support each other

535
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,333
and advance hand in hand

536
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:47,966
we will surely become

537
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,433
A feudal lord dominating both the north and the south.

538
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:52,333
Good.

539
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,400
Thank you, Father, for granting your permission.

540
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,233
What are you doing?

541
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:35,566
Why?

542
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Why must I not only yield the position of heir?

543
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,933
But even my own woman?

544
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,000
Must I also give her up?

545
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:43,766
I refuse to accept this.

546
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,033
What is it that you refuse to accept?

547
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:51,533
I have told you before.

548
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,566
What kind of person you are?

549
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,433
Determines what kind of actions you must take.

550
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,033
That First Beauty of the Libei Grasslands?

551
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,700
Is meant to marry the heir who will succeed as the Beibo Marquis.

552
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,100
You must understand.

553
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,800
The title of Beibo Marquis?

554
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,966
Will never?

555
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,700
Be inherited by a lowly son.

556
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:11,733
To carry on.

557
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,533
Father’s meaning?

558
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,433
I understand.

559
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,100
You come back here!

560
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:24,933
What kind of attitude is this from this beast?

561
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,533
That look in his eyes just now—

562
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,366
He completely disregards you, Father.

563
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,033
I think he's trying to rebel.

564
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:33,566
Father.

565
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
What about the marriage between your child and Lady Helian Xin?

566
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,100
Worthless.

567
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,533
You can't even handle a mere woman.

568
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,600
What kind of behavior is this?

569
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,200
In the future.

570
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,433
The authority over Libei.

571
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:45,766
How could I possibly entrust it to you?

572
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:47,300
I am incompetent.

573
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,100
I know I was wrong.

574
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,200
I am incompetent, I know I was wrong.

575
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,133
What's the use of just admitting your mistakes?

576
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,400
Now, your younger brother.

577
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,066
Not only is his influence growing.

578
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:55,866
But also.

579
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:57,100
The forces of the Marquis of Nanbo.

580
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,166
Are supporting him from behind.

581
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,100
If you.

582
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,466
Do not improve.

583
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:03,933
I'm afraid even as your father.

584
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:06,866
I may not be able to protect you.

585
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,133
I understand.

586
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,200
I will definitely work twice as hard from now on.

587
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,400
Absolutely not.

588
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,833
Let that beast steal the spotlight.

589
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:15,766
Betray Father's expectations.

590
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:26,466
Brother Chong.

591
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,733
Brother Chong.

592
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,033
I heard.

593
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:30,633
The Northern Bo Marquis has decided.

594
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,500
To marry the most beautiful woman of the grasslands to the heir.

595
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,333
The most beautiful woman of the grasslands.

596
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,333
Shouldn't she wed the greatest warrior of the grasslands.

597
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,633
Second Young Master Chong?

598
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,166
How can they still snatch her away?

599
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,133
Who says otherwise?

600
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,800
Brother Chong.

601
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,700
Do you know what place this is?

602
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:50,766
I do not.

603
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,533
This is where my mother is buried.

604
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,033
How could it be?

605
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:00,900
Indeed.

606
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,633
The wife of the esteemed Northern Bo Marquis.

607
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,166
The birth mother of the Chong family's Second Young Master.

608
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,966
How could she be so carelessly.

609
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,266
Buried in such a place?

610
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,533
You must have heard long ago.

611
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,033
I, Chong Yibiao.

612
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,700
is the illegitimate child of the Northern Earl

613
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,366
My mother

614
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:24,300
was merely

615
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,766
a lowly slave never granted citizenship

616
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,433
Back then, as a humble slave, she

617
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:32,100
encountered the drunken heir of the Northern Earl

618
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,166
who is now the current Northern Earl

619
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,433
The heir had a night of recklessness

620
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,133
The slave dared not resist

621
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:40,700
Thus, I was conceived

622
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,400
My mother’s status was too shameful to be exposed

623
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,233
But to preserve a bloodline of the Chong family

624
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:51,066
she could only be hidden away by the Northern Earl

625
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,133
She lived in constant fear

626
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,233
her health deteriorating day by day

627
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:57,933
Finally

628
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,600
on the night she gave birth to me

629
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,333
she died from a difficult delivery

630
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:08,500
Blood

631
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:09,733
It’s terrible

632
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:10,733
The lady is hemorrhaging

633
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:12,300
What lady? Don’t speak nonsense

634
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,000
They could have saved her

635
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,233
My child

636
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,500
But the laughable thing is

637
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,833
the entire Beibo Marquis Manor

638
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,800
did not have a single person who wanted to spare this life

639
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,066
They were even rejoicing

640
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:27,000
that my A'niang's death

641
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:28,833
dissipated the gloom hanging over

642
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,566
the Chong family's reputation

643
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,333
And the only one left, me

644
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:36,166
also constantly reminds the world

645
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,533
that the noble bloodline of the Chong family

646
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,700
is tainted by a lowly stain

647
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,933
Brother Chong

648
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,200
the deceased are already gone

649
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:10,933
you should let it go too

650
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,233
I want to let go

651
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,333
but they just won't allow me to

652
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,866
My very existence

653
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,233
is a sin

654
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,000
Since that's the case

655
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,233
rather than gaining nothing

656
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,533
I might as well abandon everything

657
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:33,900
and want nothing at all

658
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:41,266
Brother Chong

659
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,433
I never expected Brother Chong's life story

660
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:22,500
to be so full of hardships

661
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
But

662
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,366
if it really is as you say

663
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,133
and you had such a bond with Brother E Shun

664
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,366
how did it end up like this

665
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,800
You two don't seem like friends

666
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:40,366
more like enemies

667
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:42,766
Enemies

668
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,366
He and I are indeed enemies

669
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:52,233
Was the scar on his chest really cut by you

670
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,100
I saw he was quite badly injured

671
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,833
No

672
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:58,600
Stubborn mule

673
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,066
How much do you hate him

674
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,200
to hurt him like that

675
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,133
I guess you could call it hate
