1
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,466
Was that scar on his chest really cut by you?

2
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,433
I see he was badly injured.

3
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,200
How much do you hate him?

4
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,366
To hurt someone like that.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,433
I suppose it's hatred.

6
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:50,700
Come and take a look.

7
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,200
Come quick and see!

8
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,400
Over there, over there.

9
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,133
Quick, quick, quick.

10
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:54,900
Come quick, come quick.

11
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:57,533
Go, go, go.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,533
Come.

13
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,033
Look quickly.

14
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:05,866
So beautiful.

15
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:06,933
Such beautiful gesang flowers.

16
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,000
This is too beautiful.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,900
So pretty.

18
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,200
What pretty gesang flowers.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,666
So beautiful.

20
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,000
When did it become so beautiful here?

21
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,366
I remember it was originally a patch of wasteland.

22
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,666
It truly resembles the holy light of the Tengri God.

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,733
The holy light has manifested.

24
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,700
The holy light has manifested.

25
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,333
Such a wondrous place.

26
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,133
How could it be evil?

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
And where is the sin?

28
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:14,466
Beautiful, right?

29
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:15,733
A gift for you.

30
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,300
The holy light of the Tengri God.

31
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,766
How dare you.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Your Highness.

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
The matter you entrusted has been handled.

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,766
Today is the wedding day.

35
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,266
Don’t bring that thing in here.

36
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,000
Bad luck.

37
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,400
There’s more.

38
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,633
It’s just that.

39
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,200
While carrying out the task.

40
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,366
A little brat.

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,100
Desperately protected that field of gesang flowers.

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,933
One of our brothers slipped up.

43
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,033
And ended up killing him.

44
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,166
Dead is dead.

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Such a trivial matter.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,300
You can handle it yourself.

47
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,666
Enough, don’t bother me, all of you get out.

48
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,966
Get out, get out.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,633
Yes.

50
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,233
Today

51
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,733
The things you snatched from Brother Chong

52
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,033
I will help him take back every single one in the future

53
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,666
Today, you have made an enemy of Brother Chong

54
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,200
In the future, my Nanbo Marquis Manor

55
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,966
will also surely, for generations to come

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,666
be your enemy

57
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,700
Heir

58
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
We have a long future ahead of us

59
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,566
Not good, not good

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,900
The second young master has gone mad

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,633
What have you done to him again

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,200
Rebellious son

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,833
Are you trying to rebel?

64
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,700
North Earl

65
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,900
Your son stole my woman

66
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,600
seized my throne

67
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,766
and hunted me down to the last man—that would have been enough

68
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,733
But what he should never, ever have done

69
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,266
was use his filthy hands to trample upon

70
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,000
my mother's resting place

71
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,266
and not even spare

72
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,066
an innocent child

73
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,233
Father

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,833
Do you know

75
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,966
That child once promised me

76
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:25,566
That when he grew up

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,266
He would personally shoot down a black eagle

78
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,500
And return it to me

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Unfortunately, he no longer has

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Such an opportunity

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,733
Father

82
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,966
You ask me if I intend to rebel

83
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:39,666
That's right

84
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,333
Today, I will start this rebellion

85
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,533
And let you also taste

86
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,033
What it feels like to lose a son

87
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,333
No

88
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:48,733
How dare you

89
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,600
You beast

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,333
Chong Yibiao, have you gone mad

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,566
What are you trying to do

92
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,066
Don't come any closer

93
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:17,500
Someone, help

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,900
Stop him, stop him for me

95
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,633
Brother Chong

96
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,833
What did you say

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,033
Why are you also taking their side

98
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:02,766
After that

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,333
I was severely injured and fell into a coma

100
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,600
I was sent back to the Southern Capital for treatment

101
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
I barely managed to survive

102
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,100
but was left with lifelong health issues

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,666
From then on

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,766
I had no further contact with Brother Chong

105
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,100
until we reunited at the Crown Prince's camp

106
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,366
If that day

107
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,133
I hadn't taken that blow for him

108
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,500
he would forever bear the guilt of fratricide

109
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,800
And now, having ended up in this state

110
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,233
I've never once felt regret

111
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,600
It's just that between Brother Chong and me

112
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,466
things can never return to how they were before

113
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,400
I still have one question

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,066
Then why

115
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,533
did your horsemanship suddenly improve so dramatically

116
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,200
And why

117
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,000
don’t you understand Brother Chong’s combat techniques

118
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:54,533
And why

119
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,333
after my serious illness

120
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,466
my martial skills are nowhere near what they used to be

121
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,866
I wished to employ my previous martial arts techniques

122
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,666
Yet found myself powerless to do so

123
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,166
My father, seeing my frail condition

124
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,466
Feared I might fall victim to harm in the future

125
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,833
So he sought out the most renowned masters across the land

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,700
To teach me the arts of horsemanship and archery

127
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:29,633
So that

128
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,533
So that in critical moments

129
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,600
I might use them to preserve my life

130
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,433
I never expected

131
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,266
That you and Brother Chong

132
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:43,700
Would have such a reaction

133
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,133
My apologies

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,700
Just now

135
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,433
I was too aggressive

136
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,933
The heir is concerned about Eastern Lu

137
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:13,466
Being suspicious of me

138
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,600
Is entirely understandable

139
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,533
Brother Chong tested me with his move

140
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,166
You observing calmly was only natural

141
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,000
I have nothing more to say

142
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:24,633
You

143
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,733
You knew all along

144
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,500
But I am very curious

145
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,333
Young Master Jiang

146
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,833
When did you start to suspect me

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,766
Was it when we called each other brothers

148
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,633
When we drank and conversed merrily

149
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,300
Or when you said

150
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,300
We would share hardships together

151
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:51,766
And entrust life and death to each other

152
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,600
You already had a testing heart toward me

153
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,500
No

154
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,300
I truly considered you a friend then

155
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,133
I'll do it myself

156
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,000
All this time

157
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,333
I also regarded you as a close friend

158
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,833
Treating you with sincerity

159
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,066
But never did I expect

160
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,166
Enough

161
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,100
Perhaps

162
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
It is heaven's will

163
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,266
Young Master Jiang

164
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,466
Thank you for your care during this time

165
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,500
I am now

166
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,800
Ailing and broken

167
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,333
Mentally and physically exhausted

168
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,233
I truly do not wish to have

169
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,266
Any more entanglements with others

170
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,100
I suppose I am free from desires

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,133
Then there would be no worry of gain or loss

172
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,033
The pain of heartbreak

173
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:20,633
Young Master Jiang

174
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,366
Between you and me

175
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:23,500
In the future, it's better to

176
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,266
What future? There is no future

177
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,666
Nonsense

178
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,500
I don’t want to hear a single word

179
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,033
Focus on recovering from your illness

180
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:30,533
I’ll take my leave first

181
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,700
Brother Jiang

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,933
I’m sorry

183
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,333
Even if suspicions are temporarily dispelled

184
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,233
It is not a long-term solution

185
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,566
Young Master

186
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,133
You must keep your distance from the Jiang Heir

187
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,300
This is for your own good

188
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,766
And for his good as well

189
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,866
You and my young master had an agreement beforehand

190
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:33,933
My young master

191
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,566
Will also do everything possible to search for your sister

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,733
Brother Jiang

193
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,933
If it weren’t for you repeatedly saving me from dangerous situations

194
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,033
I might have already lost my life

195
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,000
If not for my fate being as it is

196
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,933
Perhaps we have long been life-and-death close friends.

197
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,100
After all, I owe you.

198
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,166
Jiang Wenhuan.

199
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,066
How

200
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,800
To tip off that kid E Shun?

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,433
Young master.

202
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,933
Young Master Chong, what is the meaning of this?

203
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,633
My family's heir

204
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,900
Is currently in Donglu.

205
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,566
This old man has matters

206
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,133
To report in person.

207
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,666
Why the need for carrier pigeons?

208
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:15,733
The person in the camp

209
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,133
Is a fake.

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,333
Young Master Chong's words are strange.

211
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,066
I actually don't quite understand.

212
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,900
Yesterday he revealed his scar.

213
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,366
For a moment, I was somewhat intimidated.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,233
But upon careful thought

215
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,633
Scars can be faked.

216
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,166
That kid's superb horsemanship

217
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,333
How to explain that?

218
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,566
Most importantly

219
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,266
That kid can pretend all he wants, but he's not him.

220
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,300
He always puts people in awkward situations.

221
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,300
Wagging his tail with a smug look on his face.

222
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,133
But that kid.

223
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,533
Doesn’t have his nasty habit of scheming against others.

224
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,366
Young Master Chong.

225
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Truly is the one in this world.

226
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,366
Who knows my heir best.

227
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,733
He’s far away in the Southern Capital.

228
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,600
Yet still stirring up trouble in Eastern Lu.

229
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,733
What are his intentions?

230
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,366
Assuming a false identity, deceiving the monarch and defying authority.

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,033
What a grave crime this is.

232
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
Is he tired of living?

233
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,633
The reason my heir.

234
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,333
Couldn’t come to the heir’s camp.

235
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,300
Others may not know.

236
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,400
But doesn’t Young Master Chong know it well himself?

237
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,133
What does that mean?

238
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,333
Ever since that incident three years ago.

239
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,100
My heir’s.

240
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,866
Health has been deteriorating.

241
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,033
He had been bedridden for a long time

242
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,033
Only recently has he shown slight improvement

243
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,100
Let alone coming to the Crown Prince's camp

244
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,000
To undergo that rigorous training

245
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,866
Even just the journey of a thousand miles

246
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,700
To Donglu alone

247
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,966
Is something his current physical condition cannot endure

248
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:49,300
If he is so useless

249
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,766
He could simply submit a memorial explaining his inability to come

250
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:54,566
Why resort to such underhanded tricks of substitution

251
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,533
If the Nanbo Marquis estate

252
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,033
Submits a memorial about this matter

253
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,100
Wouldn't it be announcing to the world

254
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,966
That the sole heir of Nandu

255
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,100
Is already a dying man

256
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:06,533
At that time

257
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,733
How would the King treat Nandu

258
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Would the feudal lords

259
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,966
Covet Nandu as well

260
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,900
A dying man

261
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,066
Back then

262
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,366
How severe exactly

263
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,533
Were my Crown Prince's injuries

264
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,000
Does Young Master Chong not know?

265
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:20,566
Whether he can fully recover

266
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:21,933
When he can fully recover

267
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:22,966
Who

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
can say for sure

269
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,433
If the young master

270
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,566
still cherishes even a fraction of our past friendship

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,433
I beg you to

272
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:31,633
consider it carefully for my young master

273
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,366
Do not report this matter

274
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:34,466
Otherwise

275
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:36,700
the heir will find it extremely difficult to escape unscathed

276
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,100
Has the letter I sent to Eastern Lu

277
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,366
arrived?

278
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,066
It was sent some days ago

279
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,566
Uncle Bing must have received it by now

280
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:52,600
But young master

281
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,700
are you sure you want to tell the truth

282
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,566
to that person?

283
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,766
It has been so long

284
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,500
If we continue to hide it

285
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,666
I'm afraid it will be impossible to keep it secret any longer

286
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,000
Will he help then?

287
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:14,933
I don't know

288
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
This is something my heir

289
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,500
entrusted this old man to deliver to you, young master

290
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Wildflowers of the north to comfort your heart.

291
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:45,966
Gesang flowers.

292
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:02,533
What does he want me to do.

293
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,100
Our heir has no demands

294
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,366
of you, young master.

295
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,500
Our heir says:

296
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,400
In his youth, Young Master Chong was constrained by others,

297
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,066
unable to fulfill his lofty ambitions.

298
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,533
Now that he has left the northern lands,

299
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:18,700
the world lies open before him.

300
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,333
He only wishes for you, young master,

301
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,433
to act freely

302
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,566
and achieve great deeds.

303
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,500
Other unrelated matters

304
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
need not trouble you, young master.

305
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,233
He merely asks of you

306
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,833
to keep it confidential.

307
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,033
This is nothing more than

308
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,066
an old man’s selfish wish.

309
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,433
He dare not pressure you, young master.

310
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,666
Everything

311
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,533
is for you to decide, young master.

312
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,366
Young master,

313
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,166
for three years,

314
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,866
the heir has drunk bitter medicine

315
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,166
and endured great suffering.

316
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,033
Only then was his life spared

317
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,033
But all medicines have some toxicity

318
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,433
Now the heir suffers from dual deficiency of qi and blood

319
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,266
His constitution is cold and Yin-dominated

320
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,200
Even during the dog days of summer

321
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,266
He must wear a heavy cloak

322
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:10,766
I've never been sensitive to cold since childhood

323
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,400
The weather in your northern lands

324
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:13,233
I can endure it

325
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,200
He wasn't like this before

326
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,933
Young master

327
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,433
My heir's secrets

328
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,633
You

329
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,700
Are none of my concern

330
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,900
This old man

331
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,833
On behalf of my heir

332
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,800
Thanks the young master

333
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,900
It's just morning training

334
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,700
Why are you primping like a bride preparing for her wedding

335
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
All dressed up

336
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,966
Step aside

337
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,200
You rough fellow

338
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,166
Wouldn't understand the troubles of a handsome youth like me

339
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,833
You say the dog days haven't started yet

340
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,100
But the weather is already so unbearably hot

341
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:08,166
If this continues

342
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,500
Basking under this scorching sun every day

343
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,933
Lifting sandbags, carrying heavy stones

344
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:11,833
I'm telling you

345
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:13,100
My jade-like complexion

346
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,533
Will sooner or later turn into charcoal

347
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,800
Brother Eshun had a relapse yesterday

348
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,700
It's only right that he rests today

349
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,600
But why is Brother Chong nowhere to be seen?

350
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,533
Yesterday, he

351
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,200
Drank my treasured fine wine

352
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,433
A full ten jars of white liquor

353
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:28,133
Ten bottles

354
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,166
No wonder he can't get up

355
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,966
Brother Jiang

356
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:33,566
Why do you look so troubled?

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,700
Brother Taidian

358
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:36,900
Have you ever offended

359
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,166
Someone especially important to you

360
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,700
Like a friend or a family member?

361
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,366
Well, there was one instance

362
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:43,733
It's actually quite amusing to recall

363
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:44,700
At home, they once

364
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,900
Arranged a match for me and a distant cousin

365
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,933
Tried to set us up

366
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,900
During a banquet, my cousin performed a dance.

367
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,233
I just said one thing:

368
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,700
"Cousin, you've gained weight."

369
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,000
She started crying right then and there.

370
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,466
And then she never spoke to me again.

371
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:56,366
So how did you end up

372
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:57,633
begging for her forgiveness?

373
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:58,466
Forgiveness for what?

374
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,366
She really had gained weight.

375
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,500
I wasn't wrong.

376
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,800
Besides,

377
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,033
a true man in this world

378
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,100
should have lofty ambitions.

379
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,566
Brother Taidian, you truly have a broad and open mind.

380
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,966
I am truly impressed.

381
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,566
Brother Eshun, what brings you here?

382
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,233
Eshun.

383
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,300
Eshun.

384
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:24,833
How are you doing?

385
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,733
Your health...

386
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm mostly fine now.

387
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,866
I can train with everyone.

388
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,666
Don't push yourself if you're physically weak.

389
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,933
Overexerting yourself is no joke.

390
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:33,200
Come on, I'll take you back.

391
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,933
- I'll get you a hand warmer when we go back - No need

392
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,966
Isn't that A'Sì?

393
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:45,533
Brother Jiang

394
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,333
A'sì

395
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:56,866
What are you here for?

396
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:58,033
A'sì

397
00:21:58,933 --> 00:21:59,766
Looking for Brother Jiang again?

398
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,500
Who's looking for him?

399
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:02,700
Him

400
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,133
What are you looking for?

401
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Nothing

402
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,266
Nothing

403
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,633
You, the daughter of the wealthiest family in Donglu

404
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,433
How do you have the leisure

405
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:12,733
To come spy on us?

406
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,733
Who's spying on you?

407
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,366
If not spying

408
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Then you're here openly

409
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,166
Well, what are you here for?

410
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,800
Is that even a question?

411
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,733
She must be here for you

412
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,500
Who said I'm here for him?

413
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,000
I—I'm here to find

414
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:35,400
Find him

415
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:39,933
I

416
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,200
A'sì

417
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,366
I have already dismissed everyone else

418
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,266
You can rest assured

419
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,566
If there is anything, look for our family's E Shun

420
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,266
Feel free to speak directly

421
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,433
Then everyone else has left

422
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,566
Why are you still here

423
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,433
Miss a si

424
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,066
You came specifically to the camp to find me today

425
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:11,233
You must have something important to tell me

426
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,133
Feel free to speak directly

427
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,066
Young Master E Shun

428
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:16,600
I

429
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,633
I

430
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,300
You, you—what are you trying to say?

431
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:28,866
Say it

432
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:31,666
Young Master E Shun

433
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:32,566
Marry me

434
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,433
Brother

435
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:41,166
When did this

436
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,066
Romantic debt come about?

437
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:43,800
I don't have one

438
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,666
It's not a real marriage

439
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,666
It's to deceive my father

440
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:51,066
You mean

441
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,966
To have E Shun

442
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,100
Pretend to be your beloved

443
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,566
Go back to the Li Mansion with you

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,033
So that your father can rest assured

445
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
And stop pressuring you to get married

446
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,000
That's right

447
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,100
That's exactly what I mean

448
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,433
Then I don't understand

449
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:04,733
Why

450
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,466
Did you have to choose our E Shun

451
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,766
Naturally, it's because Young Master E Shun

452
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:11,633
Is well-versed in both literary and martial arts

453
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,233
And pleases my father

454
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,166
Well

455
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,433
That is indeed true

456
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,666
Young Master E Shun

457
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,000
I know this matter

458
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,233
Is somewhat imposing

459
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,533
If it makes you feel inconvenienced

460
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,500
Convenient, convenient

461
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,633
How could it be inconvenient

462
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,400
Right, E Shun?

463
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,833
Convenient, it's settled then

464
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:32,900
When

465
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,200
Are we going back to the mansion to meet the
father-in-law?

466
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:35,933
Father-in-law

467
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:36,600
Yes

468
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:37,500
Let's meet quickly, hurry up.

469
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,666
Really?

470
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,833
Really

471
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,100
We'll proceed tomorrow

472
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,100
I will naturally make all the arrangements

473
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
Waiting for Lord E Shun to arrive

474
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,333
Lord E Shun's great kindness

475
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:45,666
A Si will surely repay it in the future

476
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,000
Then I'll take my leave first

477
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,766
Goodbye

478
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,200
Miss a si

479
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:51,700
Actually, I

480
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,766
are well-matched

481
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,166
Go

482
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,166
And you are

483
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:06,866
We've come to keep the appointment

484
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:09,400
Look

485
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,466
What are you here to mess up?

486
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:12,333
What are these two birds for?

487
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,666
What do you know?

488
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:14,866
Wild geese convey feelings

489
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,200
It is a tradition of weddings in Eastern Lu

490
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Such an occasion

491
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,066
How could it be without them?

492
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:20,533
These are wild geese

493
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:22,400
This

494
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:24,966
Aren't they all the same?

495
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,433
This domestic goose is the same

496
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,466
I think you're just here to cause trouble

497
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,466
Whether it's a wild goose or a domestic goose

498
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,200
As long as our dashing and elegant

499
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,766
Prince E Shun stands there

500
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,933
He can make Elder Li's eyes light up

501
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,600
Don't mind him

502
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,800
Today, Prince E Shun

503
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:40,966
Just needs to be my cover

504
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,300
I'll take care of everything

505
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,266
Please

506
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:51,766
Elder Li

507
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,066
Father

508
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,500
This is the one your daughter has set her heart on

509
00:25:58,866 --> 00:25:59,800
Prince E Shun

510
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,733
Your junior, E Shun, pays his respects to Elder Li

511
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:03,600
Prince E Shun

512
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,766
Please take a seat

513
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,200
Father

514
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,266
If you keep staring at him like that

515
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,733
He’ll be so embarrassed

516
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:37,766
That day

517
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,633
At the prince’s camp

518
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,600
I already noticed Prince E Shun’s extraordinary bearing

519
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,766
It’s just that he was too shy at the time

520
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,833
Girl.

521
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,500
This time, you.

522
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,400
have the same vision

523
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:51,533
as your dad.

524
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:55,066
As for the matchmaker's matter,

525
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,600
since that's the case,

526
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,300
there's no need to complicate things further.

527
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,633
Thank you, Dad.

528
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:13,966
Since

529
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,300
you and Si'er are so compatible,

530
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,866
please accept the marriage proposal.

531
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:19,766
Today,

532
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
we should also set the date for the wedding.

533
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,466
The wedding?

534
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,633
What does that have to do with you?

535
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,000
No, Dad,

536
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:29,166
this is only his first visit.

537
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,733
How can we set the date already?

538
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,366
Things aren't even settled yet.

539
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:35,733
Your Highness,

540
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,600
- Please accept the proposal. - Go on.

541
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,300
Think of something, quick.

542
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,333
What can I do?

543
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:44,466
Your Highness E Shun, please.

544
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:51,900
Dad,

545
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:53,933
you're too impatient.

546
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,833
How can I not be anxious about your marriage?

547
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,133
-We've only just met - Brother Jiang

548
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,466
-It's too rushed - Brother Jiang

549
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:00,366
We haven't even

550
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,533
gotten to know each other yet

551
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:02,733
You're forcing me into this

552
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:03,433
Father

553
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,266
Elder Li

554
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,600
You can't do this

555
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:10,466
What are you doing

556
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:11,000
Elder Li

557
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:11,833
What are you doing

558
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,233
Actually

559
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:15,200
Actually

560
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,800
I've fallen in love with Lady Asi

561
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,800
If in this lifetime

562
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,600
I cannot marry Lady Asi as my wife

563
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:25,633
For the rest of my life

564
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,033
I will die a horrible death

565
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:28,200
Someone come

566
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:29,366
Throw him out for me

567
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,166
This marriage, I

568
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,000
Elder Li

569
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,400
Throw him out

570
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,300
Elder Li

571
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Get out

572
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:34,833
Elder Li

573
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,766
Throw him out

574
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,466
Alright, we're at the door, we're at the door

575
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,400
Alright, alright

576
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,100
Putting in so much effort

577
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:48,900
Miss but

578
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:50,333
Just now, Elder Li

579
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,700
Must have discovered our trick

580
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,066
I'm afraid in the future

581
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,833
He might still give you a hard time

582
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,966
After all the commotion we caused

583
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,100
My father probably won't

584
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,833
Want to talk to me for a while

585
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:58,400
It's fine

586
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,566
So what

587
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,833
If it weren't for me today

588
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:01,833
You two

589
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:03,366
Would have been sent to the bridal chamber, right

590
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
That kind of joke is not to be made

591
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,200
Since that's the case

592
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,966
Today, I

593
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,333
Was both called a street ruffian

594
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,300
And went through the effort of acting to help out

595
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,166
No matter how you look at it, you should show some appreciation, right

596
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,033
Fine

597
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,633
To express gratitude

598
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,966
Lord E'Shun stepped in to help.

599
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,433
Tonight's wine at Chanxi Lou

600
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:21,066
Is on me

601
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,333
How generous

602
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:23,766
Let's go drink

603
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,066
Come on

604
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,966
Come on

605
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,666
Miss A'Sì

606
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,300
Today's matters are settled

607
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:32,700
I should return to camp now

608
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,833
That won't do

609
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:34,733
I haven't thanked you yet

610
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,966
I didn't want to come today

611
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,133
But Lord Jiang knew what was important

612
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,633
And asked me to help

613
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,533
If thanks are due

614
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:43,300
Thank him instead

615
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:44,733
What

616
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,866
Now you won't even

617
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Have a drink with me?

618
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,700
Such fuss from a grown man

619
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,833
It's just a drink

620
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
This young lady's wine

621
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,766
Let's see who dares refuse to drink

622
00:29:59,366 --> 00:29:59,833
Come on

623
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:00,633
Let's go drink

624
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,933
Do you know

625
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:15,400
Why my father

626
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Are you forcing me into marriage?

627
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:17,600
Why?

628
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,400
He's afraid that one day

629
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,233
if he passes away

630
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
the monsters and demons in Qiankun Alley

631
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,733
will bully me

632
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:28,900
That's why he wants to

633
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,333
entrust me to someone soon

634
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,533
so he can rest easy

635
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,000
That guy today

636
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,166
acted cold and indifferent toward me

637
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:43,866
yet for Asi's sake

638
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,033
he was willing to step in and help

639
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,133
That's not quite right

640
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,733
Then I think

641
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,966
Old Li's idea is actually correct

642
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,333
They say a melon forced off the vine isn't sweet

643
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:00,800
But if you pick it yourself

644
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,166
don't you think it tastes good?

645
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,800
What do you mean by that?

646
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,933
Could it be that you'll never

647
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,033
get married in your entire life?

648
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,733
If you meet someone who truly captures your heart

649
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,766
and you still refuse to marry

650
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,033
what kind of "capturing your heart" is that?

651
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,400
What kind of joke is this

652
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,400
What joke

653
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,133
If there wasn't any

654
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:17,633
Why did you repeatedly

655
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,466
Come to the Prince's camp

656
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,033
If you didn't have any

657
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:22,400
Why did you coincidentally

658
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:23,366
Run into it then

659
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,666
Who repeatedly came to the Prince's camp

660
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:28,633
You're being wishful

661
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,833
What wishful thinking

662
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,333
This is the fact

663
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:32,933
Miss

664
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,333
Just look

665
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,966
At this big melon of ours

666
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:39,166
Sweet, plump, and guaranteed to satisfy

667
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,366
How great

668
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,733
Are you talking about E Shun

669
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:49,933
Yeah

670
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:51,933
Don't you think the two of you

671
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:52,966
Are a perfect match

672
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,333
Then aren't you and I a perfect match too

673
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:00,700
You

674
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,500
Drink, drink

675
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,766
I didn't say anything

676
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,466
You didn't hear anything, drink

677
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:17,633
Lady Asi has had too much to drink

678
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,033
We should take her back

679
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,266
I haven't finished this wine yet

680
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,866
If you're still not satisfied

681
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,533
Just continue

682
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:26,733
I'll take her away first

683
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,333
Everyone's gone
