1
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:34,266
Damn it

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the wolf smoke signal from the Guifang

3
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,600
They are preparing to attack the city

4
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,400
Brother Chong just asked

5
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,000
If we should wait a bit

6
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:50,733
I thought

7
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,433
It wouldn't hurt to wait

8
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,233
It seems capturing Donglu City is just around the corner

9
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:08,166
General

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,700
What's the situation

11
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,633
We've fallen into a trap

12
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,033
That brat actually dared to deceive us

13
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,666
What should we do now

14
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:19,533
Retreat

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,033
Damn it, it's the Donglu Army

16
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:27,933
Retreat that way

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:28,900
Charge

18
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,300
This is bad, General

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,333
The Donglu Army is here too

20
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,800
General, we're surrounded

21
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,400
General Jiang's arrival

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,833
Is truly timely

23
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:49,833
General Bogu

24
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,133
The surroundings are already occupied by my Donglu Army

25
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,033
Surrender your troops without resistance

26
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,866
All warfare is based on deception

27
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,033
To have been tripped up by

28
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,233
a few young brats

29
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,900
was my carelessness

30
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,100
But to admit defeat

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,133
is probably still a bit premature

32
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,666
My Guifang elite troops are already outside the city

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,566
fully prepared for battle

34
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,066
As long as they receive my signal

35
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,100
even if your military defenses and layout

36
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,966
are extremely tight

37
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,533
it will still be a life-and-death battle

38
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,366
Who loses and who wins

39
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,200
is still unknown

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,500
Guards

41
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:27,866
Bring them in

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,433
General

43
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,033
Our side was ineffective

44
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,066
and was ambushed from behind by the Eastern Lu army

45
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,033
Five thousand elite troops

46
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,633
suffered heavy losses

47
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,666
How could this happen

48
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,133
General Bogu

49
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,566
Using troops with clever adaptability

50
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,100
is truly the way of a general, right?

51
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,966
All generals of Guifang, heed my command

52
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,533
Kill them

53
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,566
Kill

54
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,233
It seems the Gui Fang army has retreated

55
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,100
Our Donglu City has narrowly avoided disaster

56
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,100
Brother Jiang, why do you say that

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,833
These

58
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,800
are the signals of our Donglu repelling the enemy

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,233
It must have been our master and elder brother

60
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,300
who resolved the siege for us

61
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:17,800
What

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,200
Wasn't in vain, was it, Brother Chong

63
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:23,366
So what

64
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,133
Brother Chong means

65
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,666
No matter what

66
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,933
we must capture Yao Shuliang and bring him back to camp

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,533
Exactly

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,566
Then this is going to be troublesome

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,866
That fellow Yao Shuliang

70
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,366
I am determined to release him

71
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,300
Then just try it

72
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,066
Stop arguing, stop arguing

73
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,566
Let's talk this over properly

74
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,333
Brother Jiang

75
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,166
Release him, we will definitely release him

76
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,333
Rest assured

77
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,633
Then you decide whether to release him or not

78
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,200
Okay or not?

79
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,066
I don't care anymore.

80
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:13,666
What's so hard about this?

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,866
Since we can't argue out a result,

82
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,566
Why not let the heavens

83
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,233
Bear the blame?

84
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,800
If he draws white,

85
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Then let him go.

86
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,133
If he draws black,

87
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,066
Take him back.

88
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,100
Life and death are fated, wealth and honor are in heaven's hands.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,633
What do you all think?

90
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,600
I think your idea

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,666
Is brilliant.

92
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:39,766
Brother Chong,

93
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:40,833
We’ve already gambled once

94
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,666
With the Guifang people.

95
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,566
One more time won’t hurt.

96
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:43,533
Exactly.

97
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,633
You’ve been arguing for ages with no outcome.

98
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,266
Why not take a gamble?

99
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,300
Then it’s up to the heavens

100
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,433
Whether Brother Yao leaves or not.

101
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,033
Might as well give it a try.

102
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,166
What do you think, Brother Chong?

103
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,600
Don’t tell me you’re afraid to bet?

104
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,500
Cut the reverse psychology.

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,633
What do I have to fear?

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,166
I've won.

107
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,033
Brother Yao can leave now.

108
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:47,666
Brother Chong.

109
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,600
Heaven's will is thus.

110
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,000
Gambling debts must be paid.

111
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,000
Let him go.

112
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,466
Everyone.

113
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:54,800
Today's actions.

114
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:55,800
Be it punishment or fault.

115
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:56,966
I, Jiang Wenjuan.

116
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:57,933
Will bear it all.

117
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,033
Go now.

118
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,166
Miss but.

119
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,000
Impressive skills.

120
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,266
It seems my reign as the Gambling King...

121
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,700
What are you saying, Lord Xinjia?

122
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,166
This humble woman doesn't understand.

123
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:12,500
Don't understand?

124
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,800
Then forget it.

125
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:25,833
This is the pass token.

126
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,000
Go quickly and return soon.

127
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,533
Brothers all.

128
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,466
I, Yao Shuliang, owe you all today.

129
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,133
In the future, I will surely repay with my life.

130
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:05,000
Take care.

131
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,533
Take care.

132
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,400
Go quickly and return soon.

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Take care.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,066
Leave.

135
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,333
Kneel down.

136
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,733
You people of Donglu.

137
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,000
Truly full of cunning schemes.

138
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,333
To actually use a fake city defense map as bait.

139
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,600
Making our Guifang forces fall right into the trap.

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,233
Who else can we blame for weaving our own cocoon?

141
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,900
Even if you succeed this time.

142
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,166
And obtain the city defense map.

143
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,566
You still won’t be able to invade Donglu even slightly.

144
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Victory and defeat are already decided.

145
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,266
The cause and effect of success or failure.

146
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,700
Naturally, it’s all for the general to explain.

147
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,633
General Bogu believes that.

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,900
My Donglu.

149
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,300
Relies solely on this city defense layout.

150
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,000
To stand firm in this crucial border region.

151
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,600
If not?

152
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:56,766
That’s right.

153
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,433
This city defense layout.

154
00:08:58,433 --> 00:08:59,733
Based on the River-Luo diagram.

155
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,000
Is indeed a key tool for Donglu’s defense.

156
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:03,833
But my Donglu city

157
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,800
Standing firm at the border for a century

158
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,733
Relies on countless warriors of Donglu who march fearlessly toward death

159
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,400
And stand united as one

160
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,766
This is the true key

161
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,600
To Donglu City's defense

162
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,100
Unfortunately

163
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,333
Your Guifang will never achieve this

164
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,033
However, there is one thing this general still does not understand

165
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,433
And would like to ask the general to answer

166
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:24,733
Guifang borders Donglu

167
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,200
And indeed has launched frequent raids and invasions over the years

168
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,233
This time, you went to great lengths

169
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,933
Setting up layers of traps

170
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:30,933
Even attempting

171
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,233
To disturb the peace of our heir's camp

172
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,100
This truly does not seem

173
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,000
Like Guifang's usual methods

174
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:37,700
What do you mean

175
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:41,100
Could it be that behind General Bogu

176
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:43,166
There is another mastermind guiding you

177
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:45,100
You

178
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:48,333
Who are you

179
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:49,266
After them

180
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,133
After them

181
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,266
Quick, hurry, go

182
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
The mastermind behind this

183
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,633
is full of tricks

184
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,333
It seems this matter is not simple

185
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:10,700
Damn it

186
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:11,266
Huan'er

187
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:05,333
How strange

188
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,333
We clearly took this path last night

189
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,666
Why is it that today

190
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,533
we've circled back again

191
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:18,766
Look

192
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,100
This stone tablet wasn't here

193
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,066
when we went up the mountain

194
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,966
What do you think this is

195
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:33,700
Wait

196
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,033
What is this

197
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,366
Everyone, be careful

198
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,066
Take cover in the woods

199
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,000
Tao Yingzhong

200
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,766
Brother E, catch it

201
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,933
Stay hidden

202
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:31,800
There's no one here either

203
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,100
Where did the arrow come from

204
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:36,266
Could it be

205
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,100
this is what our master called

206
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,233
the art of Qimen Dunjia

207
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,166
What is it

208
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,233
Qimen Dunjia

209
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,766
It is an ancient art of war

210
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,333
Mostly used for troop deployment and formation

211
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,233
It is mainly divided into eight gates

212
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,200
Namely

213
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Rest, Life, Injury, Obstruction

214
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,633
Appearance, Death, Fear, Opening

215
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:55,733
If one mistakenly enters

216
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,133
it will trigger hidden arrow mechanisms

217
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:00,066
resulting in either death or injury

218
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,466
Who on earth set up such a formation

219
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,133
to capture us

220
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:04,933
Could it be the Guifang people

221
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:06,833
Not sure

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,466
But

223
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:10,800
the stone tablet we just saw

224
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,466
should represent one of the directions

225
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:15,833
Each direction represents a gate

226
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:19,400
Only by finding the Life Gate

227
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,400
can we break the formation and escape

228
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,966
Can you break this formation

229
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,200
Brother Jiang, how confident are you

230
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,933
Not even ten percent

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,500
We're done for

232
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,266
Brother Chong

233
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,033
Today, the two of us

234
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,233
are destined to live and die together.

235
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,933
So can we find the Gate of Life?

236
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,300
It's worth a try.

237
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:55,700
This is the hour of the Rabbit.

238
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:57,233
The sun rises in the east.

239
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,833
The eastern Zhen sector is where the Gate of Injury lies.

240
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,566
This is the Gate of Injury.

241
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,600
Look quickly, there's a stone tablet to the east.

242
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,433
The northern Kan sector

243
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,466
is where the Gate of Rest resides.

244
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,066
There must be a mechanism.

245
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:14,833
Indeed, it is so.

246
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,366
This is the Gate of Rest.

247
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,466
The arrow rain came from this direction.

248
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,066
The Gate of Life belongs to earth.

249
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,033
It lies in the northeastern Gen sector.

250
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,866
The stone tablet of the Gate of Life

251
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,366
should be between the two.

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
I can't see anything clearly.

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,300
The fog is getting thicker.

254
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,000
Look,

255
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,166
there is another stone tablet.

256
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,200
That's right.

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,866
Between the two.

258
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,233
That is the gate of life

259
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,266
Excellent

260
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
As expected of Brother Jiang

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,466
Form the array

262
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:57,900
Let's break the gate together

263
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,566
Why do arrows come flying as soon as we get here

264
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,200
Could it be that the method to break the gate is wrong

265
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,500
Brother Jiang, think of another plan

266
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,200
It seems we cannot break the array from the inside

267
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,700
If not from the inside

268
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:26,833
Then what about from the outside

269
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:29,766
Right

270
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,266
If someone could break the array from the outside

271
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,466
It might be resolved

272
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,300
A whistle

273
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,500
Why is there a whistle here

274
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
My Eastern Lu army

275
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Uses whistles as signals

276
00:15:58,766 --> 00:15:59,300
One whistle

277
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,033
Means alert

278
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:03,200
Two whistles

279
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,000
Means take cover

280
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,900
Could it be that Brother Jiang and the others are in trouble

281
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,400
Three whistles

282
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,433
Through mountains of blades and seas of fire

283
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:11,800
We will not betray our brothers

284
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:20,966
What should we do

285
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:22,933
Our homeland is in danger

286
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,566
But Brother Jiang and them

287
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,733
I can't just stand by and watch them die

288
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,566
Father, mother

289
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,400
What should I do

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,733
Hyah

291
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:44,800
Hyah

292
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:50,666
Hyah

293
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,600
The arrow rain is too fierce, we can't hold on much longer

294
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:15,833
It's him

295
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Brother Yao doesn't understand battle formations

296
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,366
I'll use the whistle as a signal

297
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:26,466
I'm inside, he's outside

298
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,833
Breaking through the life gate together with him

299
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,233
This whistle sound

300
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:32,833
One long, two short

301
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,533
Means due north

302
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,066
Hyah

303
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,000
Two long, three short

304
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:43,366
Is to charge and break the formation

305
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,566
Kill

306
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:09,400
The fog has cleared

307
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,133
The arrow rain has stopped

308
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:10,866
That means

309
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:11,933
The formation has been broken

310
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:17,066
We're saved

311
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,466
Great

312
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,266
Not bad, little crybaby

313
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,900
Pretty reliable in critical moments

314
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:28,000
Exactly

315
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
I can't believe you really came back

316
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:30,533
Well done

317
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:31,333
This time, it's all thanks to you

318
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,233
Thank you

319
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,033
Little crybaby

320
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,933
What's wrong

321
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:41,400
Little crybaby, little crybaby

322
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,200
How did this happen

323
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,100
When breaking the formation

324
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,600
We can't stop

325
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,000
If anything goes wrong

326
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:00,966
All our efforts will be wasted

327
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:11,100
Giddy-up

328
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:14,633
How could this happen

329
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,366
Little crybaby

330
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,533
You're so timid

331
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:18,166
And your martial arts aren't strong

332
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:19,533
What were you trying to prove by playing the hero

333
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,433
I'm sorry

334
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,700
I didn't expect this either

335
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:33,633
I've brought disaster upon everyone

336
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,500
Brother Jiang

337
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,133
I must return to my homeland

338
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,800
My father and mother

339
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:53,500
They are both trapped in Yao Country

340
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58,800
Promise me

341
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,433
Take me back

342
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,366
To my homeland

343
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:04,300
Alright

344
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,233
I promise you

345
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,300
Send you back

346
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,600
To relieve your motherland

347
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,033
Through mountains of blades and seas of fire

348
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,033
Will not fail

349
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:19,233
Brother

350
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,533
Hood

351
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,900
Through mountains of blades and seas of fire

352
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,800
Will not fail our brotherhood

353
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:36,600
Mother

354
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,033
Your son

355
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,933
Is unfilial

356
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,200
Little crybaby

357
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:45,366
Brother Yao

358
00:21:59,366 --> 00:21:59,866
Your humble general

359
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:02,266
Jiang Wenjuan

360
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,733
Requests to go into battle

361
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,933
To proceed to Yao Country

362
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,433
To relieve Marquis Yao Bo

363
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,200
Your humble general E Shun

364
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,466
Requests to go into battle

365
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:27,033
Xin Jia

366
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,366
Requests to go into battle

367
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,500
Tao Yingzhong

368
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,100
Wang Yuanji

369
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,833
Su Yuanxiao

370
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,066
Tai Dian

371
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:36,500
Requests to go into battle

372
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:46,700
Chong Yibiao

373
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,200
What about you

374
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:08,733
Do you all know

375
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:10,533
The King has ordered

376
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,200
Garrisons everywhere

377
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,366
No orders

378
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:15,666
Do not send troops without authorization

379
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,700
If you leave the camp to fight

380
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,600
This violates military regulations

381
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,066
But today

382
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:42,766
You are not just

383
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:44,100
soldiers of my heir's camp

384
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,433
But also Yao Shuliang's

385
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,700
sworn brothers

386
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,566
This battle

387
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,166
You are breaking the siege for a brother

388
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,633
It has nothing to do

389
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,166
with my Eastern Lu army

390
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,833
Whether you live or die

391
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:09,866
each follows their own fate

392
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,966
Thank you, General Jiang, for your support

393
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,800
We thank General Jiang for your support

394
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:21,066
All rise

395
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,133
Huan'er

396
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,466
Be careful on this journey

397
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:31,533
Return safely

398
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,733
Set off

399
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,466
My father and mother

400
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,700
are both trapped in Yao Country

401
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:52,466
Promise me

402
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:57,033
Take me back to my motherland

403
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,066
Through fire and water

404
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:12,133
I won't fail you

405
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:14,600
brother

406
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:16,233
Brother

407
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:35,966
Kill

408
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,433
Father and Mother

409
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:16,900
I hope this letter finds you well

410
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:20,866
Since March of this spring

411
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,500
I have been away from home for several months now

412
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,233
During this time

413
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:27,633
I have missed you dearly

414
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,566
I am doing well in Donglu

415
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:32,866
Please do not worry about me

416
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,033
I have always been timid

417
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,466
and have few close friends by my side

418
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,833
When I learned that I would be going to Donglu alone

419
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,166
it felt like venturing alone into the dark bamboo grove

420
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:46,000
My heart was filled with anxiety

421
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,266
I could not rest peacefully

422
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,566
and lay awake at night

423
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:52,033
The road ahead is long

424
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:53,966
For a time

425
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,300
I was at a loss about where to go

426
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,733
However, the brothers in the camp

427
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,333
have treated me very well

428
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,100
like true siblings

429
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,300
I am deeply grateful

430
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:12,900
Brother Xin Jia is cheerful and outgoing

431
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,200
and very amusing

432
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,933
From the very beginning of entering the camp, I felt an immense sense of familiarity.

433
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,733
Brother E Shun is not one for many words.

434
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,600
Yet he is meticulous and attentive to the finest details.

435
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,366
I deeply admire him.

436
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,033
Though Brother Chong has a cold, icy demeanor,

437
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,900
he is extraordinarily brave,

438
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,800
with a heart burning like fire.

439
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:31,633
And then there is Brother Jiang,

440
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,400
who dares to act and take responsibility,

441
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:34,600
marching to the beat of his own drum.

442
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:36,900
Time and again, he has helped me out of difficult situations.

443
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,066
I am profoundly grateful.

444
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:41,333
The brothers in the camp

445
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,600
are all exceptionally skilled

446
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,000
and of outstanding character.

447
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,400
Fighting alongside them

448
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,866
has benefited me greatly.

449
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:49,966
I believe

450
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,833
that when the day comes for me to return to my hometown,

451
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,800
the Liang'er standing before Father and Mother

452
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,266
will no longer be the timid boy of the past,

453
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:57,433
but rather a true,

454
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:00,133
upright and honorable man of Shangshan.

455
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,633
Though this letter is short, its meaning runs deep.

456
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:05,300
I have so much more to say

457
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,566
I only hope that one day

458
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,266
my son can return to his hometown in glory

459
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:10,966
and fulfill his filial duties once more

460
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:12,933
to his father and mother

461
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:14,500
and his younger sister

462
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,566
so we may reunite soon

463
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,200
therefore

464
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,400
I only pray for your good health

465
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,900
Yao Shuliang respectfully reports

466
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:26,600
Thank you, young heroes

467
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,200
In this life of my son

468
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,733
to have been able to fight alongside heroes like you

469
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,866
he can die without regrets

470
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,566
Liangs

471
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,200
I am the one who caused his death

472
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
I should not have let him return

473
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:21,766
If you hadn't let him return

474
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,700
he might now

475
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,233
already be in the land of Yao

476
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,733
together with his family

477
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,133
eating the meals his mother cooked

478
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:33,966
chatting about daily life with his loved ones

479
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,133
But guess what

480
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,400
would he still remember

481
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:43,800
Dead on the desolate mountains of Eastern Lu

482
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,833
Dozens of brothers

483
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,200
For the rest of his life

484
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:53,500
Will there ever be a moment

485
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:54,766
When he does not question himself

486
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,566
I could have saved them

487
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,400
Why didn't I

488
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,066
Life and death are both hard

489
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,333
But sometimes

490
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:12,800
Living

491
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:15,966
Is harder than dying

492
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:20,866
When those close to you

493
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,600
All die before your eyes

494
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,466
And you are powerless to do anything

495
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,000
You can only, in countless

496
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Days and nights of cowardly clinging to life

497
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,800
Constantly recall their faces

498
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:43,633
You must remember

499
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:45,600
The Kun Family Army

500
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:46,700
Never admits defeat

501
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:53,400
Kne

502
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:56,633
Survive

503
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,133
When those smiling faces

504
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,700
Always appear one by one

505
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,933
Before your eyes

506
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,966
Leaving you with no escape for even a moment

507
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:07,600
Not a moment to forget

508
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,100
Vast as the world is

509
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,733
You have nowhere to go

510
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,733
No home to return to

511
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,800
You say

512
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:25,000
Is living alone like this

513
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:27,733
Good

514
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,033
Brother E

515
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:38,866
Having known you for so long

516
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,400
I suddenly feel

517
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,900
As if I myself

518
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,033
Don’t really know you that well

519
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:51,866
Is that so

520
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:56,700
At the very beginning

521
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:58,633
I thought

522
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,900
You were a noble scion from the prosperous southern capital

523
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,000
But later I discovered

524
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,633
Though you were raised in privilege

525
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,266
You have depth and breadth in your heart

526
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,166
Your heart holds the world

527
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,133
Earning admiration

528
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:21,566
But lately I feel

529
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,733
The you I know

530
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,433
Seems not to be the real you

531
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,400
You come from an eminent family

532
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:37,500
poised and dignified

533
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,600
Extraordinary talent

534
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:39,966
But at the same time

535
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:41,166
Possesses a worldly wisdom

536
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,500
rarely seen among nobles

537
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:43,400
Vast knowledge and experience

538
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:45,566
As if

539
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,766
You've been through years of hardship in this world

540
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:48,200
Brother E

541
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:50,533
You are truly the most contradictory

542
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,133
And the most exceptional

543
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:53,866
I have ever met

544
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,366
Sometimes I even wonder

545
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:05,200
Are you really just the heir of the Southern Bo Marquis?

546
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,666
The heir of Donglu City

547
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,566
Alert and clever

548
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,700
Remember, you must not reveal your identity

549
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,000
Otherwise

550
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:21,300
Neither of us will escape disaster

551
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:26,300
Brother Jiang, you flatter me

552
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,400
Not at all

553
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,400
It's just that every word I say

554
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:35,700
Comes from the heart

555
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,500
Without any falsehood

556
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,933
What about you

557
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:46,633
Have you ever lied to me?

558
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,100
Brother Jiang

559
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,566
You

560
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:01,966
Just kidding

561
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,333
As if you'd dare

562
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,500
Hope I'm overthinking it

563
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,133
Crown Prince

564
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:24,733
Xiao Ding

565
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:26,866
Xiao Ding

566
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,266
Crown Prince

567
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,333
You urgently called me over

568
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,633
Is there any shortage in the camp

569
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:31,800
Xiao Ding

570
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,833
Do you still remember that little slave

571
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:33,800
I saved last time

572
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,733
at the slave market

573
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,566
Seem to recall

574
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:37,566
But didn't that guy

575
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:38,633
run away later

576
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:39,700
Right

577
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,333
Investigate this for me

578
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:42,666
Find out where he is now

579
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,833
Okay

580
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:00,833
Notice anything unusual

581
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,000
This arrow is a tiger-tooth barbed arrow

582
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:04,733
specially made by the Guifang Kingdom

583
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,333
The barbs are coated with poison

584
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,633
If injured by it

585
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:08,800
there's no saving them

586
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:09,800
Seems like

587
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,900
The person who shot
and killed General Bo Gu.

588
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,133
And that day in the woods

589
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,166
The people who attacked Huan'er

590
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,033
are very likely the same group

591
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,700
Could it be the Gui Fang forces

592
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,433
Then they are fighting among themselves

593
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:23,800
I've heard

594
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,866
that over the years

595
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,066
within Gui Fang, there have always been

596
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,566
two factions in constant conflict

597
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:30,333
The military officials behind General Bogu

598
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,333
took advantage of the chaos to rise

599
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,300
and suppress the older noble faction

600
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,500
But this time

601
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,233
Gui Fang's attack on the city ended in complete defeat

602
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,066
It's likely that the military officials' faction

603
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,866
has now collapsed as well

604
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:42,933
It seems

605
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,500
that we, Donglu, have been used as pawns

606
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:46,766
becoming a sharp sword

607
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,566
for Gui Fang's

608
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,400
noble faction to suppress the military officials

609
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:51,666
You mean

610
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,733
General Bogu

611
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:54,900
Also being used by others

612
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,700
Can utilize General Bo Gu

613
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:58,833
Bordering Eastern Lu

614
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:00,966
Crushed the military officials' faction

615
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,200
And took the opportunity to suppress our Eastern Lu

616
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:04,933
Collaborated with Marquis Ningbo to do it

617
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:05,933
The heir's camp is in turmoil

618
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,566
It seems this person who can

619
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:09,833
Wield great influence among the Guifang nobility

620
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,666
Is quite remarkable

621
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,633
Have you heard

622
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,200
In the past two years

623
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,866
Has any rising star in Guifang

624
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:23,933
Emerging prominently?

625
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,033
Not at all

626
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,733
How about the Eastern Martial Marquis's residence?

627
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:35,300
Rest assured, young master

628
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,633
The military officials' faction in Guifang

629
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,800
Has already taken the blame for us

630
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,600
The eastern side

631
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,666
Will not investigate further

632
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,033
That's good

633
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,133
Soon after

634
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:53,233
The Crown Prince's camp
ought to become lively!
