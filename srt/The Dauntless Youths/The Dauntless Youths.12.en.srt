1
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,333
Brother Jiang

2
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,766
I've looked three times already

3
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,066
There's nothing

4
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,466
Can't find it

5
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,633
Then try a different method and look again

6
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:52,733
Take it

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,333
Keep your eyes peeled

8
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,166
Look carefully one more time

9
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,200
That's not right

10
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,666
I've been searching all along

11
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,166
What are you doing?

12
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,366
Look here

13
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,133
If you can find the evidence and save your Brother Chong

14
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:14,566
Tell me

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,266
Wouldn't he be

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,333
Overwhelmed with gratitude to his lifesaver?

17
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,100
Prostrate himself in admiration

18
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,866
And then pledge unwavering loyalty

19
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:22,800
Follow you to the death

20
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,233
Let me tell you

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,833
Making Brother Chong your subordinate

22
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,533
This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm giving it to you

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,433
Pretty generous, right?

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,633
What took you so long?

26
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:44,766
How much have you had to drink?

27
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,133
Alright, alright, stop counting

28
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,200
You should hurry back and rest.

29
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,366
No need

30
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,933
And yet you still show off despite your poor alcohol tolerance

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,200
Found it

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,866
Found what?

33
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,000
Making a fuss over nothing

34
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,133
Brother Jiang, look

35
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,700
It really is a night-luminescent pearl

36
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,300
Not bad, Brother Xin

37
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,966
Quite skilled

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
This time, I must make that stubborn mule

39
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,233
Invite me for a drink at Chanjie Pavilion

40
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,266
And make him call me "big brother"

41
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,966
In front of all the beauties

42
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:22,733
Wait

43
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:24,533
Look

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,133
What is this?

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,600
The mark of Qiankun Alley

46
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,666
Backyard footprints

47
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,833
Clearly, the limp is on the left foot

48
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,733
So why did the steward injure his right foot?

49
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,233
What exactly is wrong with Father?

50
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:14,900
Master

51
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,700
This month's account books are all prepared

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,833
Wait here for me

53
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:58,533
Strange

54
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,133
Father clearly entered this place

55
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,966
This hidden room

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,300
I actually never knew about it

57
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,866
What exactly did Father hide here

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,666
Could it be

59
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,033
It really is related to that murder case

60
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,066
This is

61
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,100
The item has been obtained

62
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,066
This is the contract

63
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,000
Signed with the Old Marquis back then

64
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,233
As you wished

65
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,166
I have already taken Chong Yiwu's life for you

66
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,466
What more do you want

67
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:50,566
Young Master

68
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,166
So trusting

69
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,533
That I will definitely help you to the end

70
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,266
Just a contract

71
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,600
Burning it

72
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,633
Is my sincerity to Elder Li

73
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:01,800
However

74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,866
Even if this contract is gone

75
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,433
The events of sixteen years ago

76
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,766
Elder Li must still remember

77
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,600
If this major endeavor fails

78
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,866
I dare assure that Elder Li and your esteemed daughter

79
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,566
would also find it difficult to escape unscathed

80
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,100
What do you intend to do

81
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,133
Chong Yi Wu's death was merely a prelude

82
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,833
The real spectacle

83
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,100
must await Elder Li

84
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,266
to lend me further assistance

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,900
So Father

86
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,266
has silently done so much for me all along

87
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,766
Father

88
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,166
I sincerely believe you cannot be the murderer

89
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,800
This time I will definitely protect you

90
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:27,733
Father

91
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,266
That bead I gifted you a few days ago

92
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:32,033
are you still wearing it

93
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,900
What's the matter

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,133
I asked Yi'er to help me craft some

95
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,066
new jewelry pieces

96
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,266
I thought if you liked that bead

97
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,066
I'd have someone purchase another strand for you

98
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,233
Look

99
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,433
This is Si'er's gift for Father

100
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,866
Dad naturally has to carry it with him.

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,066
But one string is enough.

102
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,333
You.

103
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,033
Still, choose the ones you like.

104
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
You, pick out more jewelry.

105
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,400
Dress yourself up nicely.

106
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,700
In the future.

107
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,733
Only then can you find an ideal husband.

108
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:12,866
Dad.

109
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:13,933
How many times have I said it.

110
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,833
I don't want to get married.

111
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,166
You.

112
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,866
It's not that you don't want to get married.

113
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,366
You just don't want to marry.

114
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,366
Anyone other than Jiang WenHuan.

115
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:21,866
Right.

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Dad.

117
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,166
Why are you bringing him up again.

118
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,466
Girl.

119
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,633
With those little thoughts of yours.

120
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,766
You think you can hide them from Dad.

121
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,566
How many times has Dad told you.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,666
Don't get involved with the Jiang family.

123
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,733
You just never listen.

124
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,133
Why

125
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,766
Exactly why has it always been

126
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,366
that Father has been so afraid

127
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,600
of me having contact with Jiang Wenxuan

128
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,733
afraid of me having any connection with the Marquis of Dongwu's residence

129
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:53,833
Could it be

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,800
that our Qiankun Lane

131
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,500
has some wrongdoing

132
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,700
toward the Marquis of Dongwu's residence

133
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,133
Nonsense

134
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:01,866
Then what else could it be

135
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,100
I truly cannot understand

136
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,133
why Father dislikes Jiang Wenxuan so much

137
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,933
And also

138
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,933
I have always wanted to inherit

139
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,633
the Qiankun Lane that Father built with his own hands

140
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,566
to share your burdens

141
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,166
But you have never allowed me

142
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,666
to get involved in the affairs of Qiankun Lane

143
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,533
Could it be that Qiankun Lane is really involved in

144
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,233
some shady dealings behind the scenes

145
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,233
Li Asi

146
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,300
Are your wings grown hard now

147
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,233
Daring to question your father

148
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,866
My wings are not grown hard

149
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,500
I just hope Father can give me a

150
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
reasonable explanation

151
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,700
There's nothing to explain

152
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,733
In short, from now on

153
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,466
You are not allowed to see that Jiang Wenjuan again

154
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,366
And the matter of Qiankun Alley

155
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,433
is none of your business either

156
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:51,633
Father

157
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,200
Si'er is truly worried about you

158
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,400
General

159
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:00,633
The Marquis of Beibo has sent a letter

160
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:10,366
How is it

161
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,100
Did the Marquis of Beibo give us a hard time

162
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,966
The Marquis of Beibo is actually willing to extend the deadline

163
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,933
allowing us to uncover the truth

164
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,933
If it really was Chong Yibiao's doing

165
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,166
then we can send him back to Libei

166
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:36,833
General

167
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,500
Is there anything else amiss

168
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:39,900
Forget it

169
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,600
Since the person died in our Donglu

170
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,066
We are duty-bound

171
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,066
and must uncover the truth as soon as possible

172
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,866
to deliver justice to North Bo Hou

173
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:51,866
Should tonight's Gaomei Sacrifice be

174
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:52,500
postponed

175
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,300
No

176
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,400
The case must be investigated

177
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,266
and the Gaomei Sacrifice must proceed

178
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,533
Yes, I obey your order

179
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,700
What exactly has made you so anxious

180
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
After we parted at Qiankun Alley that day

181
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,066
I and E Shun

182
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,566
searched everywhere for the limping man

183
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,333
but found no results

184
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,166
It seems as if someone is deliberately hiding it

185
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,200
I wonder

186
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,666
if you have any information

187
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,533
Didn't I already say

188
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,433
I checked all the cripples in Qiankun Alley

189
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:26,966
and found no clues

190
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,400
What

191
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,400
don't you believe me

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,733
Of course not.

193
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,366
The words of Miss Asi

194
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,600
We naturally believe

195
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:46,466
This

196
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,566
Have you ever seen it

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,833
Where did you get it

198
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,100
Chong Yiwu's bedroom

199
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,366
This is a pearl from our Li Manor

200
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,600
Real

201
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,300
Fake

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,900
Miss but

203
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,566
What do you mean by this

204
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,266
Look at this pearl

205
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,233
Although it bears the seal of our Li Manor

206
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,266
The craftsmanship of the engraving is too crude

207
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,233
It is clearly a shoddy imitation

208
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,433
It lacks the refinement of our Li Manor

209
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,000
Miss Asi's words

210
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,333
Suggest that someone

211
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,233
Like forging the Blade of the Brave

212
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,233
Has forged your Li Manor's night pearl

213
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,566
Attempting to frame Li Manor

214
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,666
For the murder of the North Bo侯's heir

215
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,500
Lord E Shun is indeed reasonable

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,100
Our Li Manor is a tall tree that catches the wind

217
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:39,333
It's hardly surprising that we'd be framed

218
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,366
Besides

219
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,500
They were even able to forge the Hero's Blade

220
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,966
Let alone a mere seal

221
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,900
But rest assured

222
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,400
Since these vile scoundrels

223
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,000
Have thrown dirty water at our Qiankun Alley

224
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,333
And, whether as

225
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,966
Will definitely help you get to the bottom of this

226
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,633
And clear the name of our Li Manor

227
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,500
Then we'll trouble you with this

228
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:02,600
I'll take my leave first

229
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,066
You also sense something's off, don't you

230
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,566
In that case

231
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,433
We'll have to personally pay a visit to the Li Manor

232
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,966
Although the Li Manor's warehouse is valuable

233
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
The number of guards watching over it

234
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,433
Seems a bit excessive, doesn't it

235
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:44,600
Heavily guarded

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,633
There must be something fishy going on

237
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,166
Then you guess what
they're guarding?

238
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:50,166
Hasn't Brother Jiang
already thought of a plan?

239
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,100
Want to go and take a look?

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,233
You really know me.

241
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,566
Let's blend into the guards' ranks

242
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,933
Act in secret

243
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:05,433
Go to the storeroom entrance to investigate

244
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:18,800
Master

245
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:23,233
What is it

246
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,600
There is an urgent letter from outside the residence

247
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,466
It concerns matters related to the Marquis Dongwu's household

248
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:27,866
Give it to me

249
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,966
What major event is so urgent

250
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,066
That they risked coming to deliver the message

251
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,133
The Marquis Beibo actually made a deal

252
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,033
With Jiang Wenfeng

253
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,466
It seems the young master miscalculated

254
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,666
You, Jiang Wanhuan

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,700
Let's see if you can investigate quickly

256
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,300
Or if I act faster

257
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,266
Elder Li, have everyone proceed as planned

258
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,500
Tonight's Gaomei Sacrifice

259
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
I will make all of you

260
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,133
Bury with my late father, the Marquis

261
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:25,433
Stop him

262
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,366
Speak, who sent you

263
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:39,933
Brother Chong, you saw it

264
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,866
He bit his tongue and killed himself.

265
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:41,600
It wasn't me who killed him.

266
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,433
Jiang Wenhuàn really called it.

267
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,200
Brother Jiang truly has foresight.

268
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,100
It seems

269
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,700
Jiang Wenhuàn is getting closer and closer to the truth.

270
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,266
What does he want us to do next?

271
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,133
He said to rendezvous at the festival.

272
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:00,033
Let's go.

273
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:08,600
How could it possibly be him?

274
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,800
What has he been scheming for all this time?

275
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,166
If Ziyu really isn't dead,

276
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,366
then this must be for revenge.

277
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:17,600
No.

278
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,400
Tonight is the Gaomei Festival.

279
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:20,866
I have to go back.

280
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:21,933
I need to inform my elder brother about this immediately.

281
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,966
Let's go.

282
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,033
What?

283
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,733
It's been many days since we last met.

284
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,366
Brother Jiang, are you in such a hurry to leave?

285
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:36,566
Little Ziyu.

286
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,166
Long time no see.

287
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,733
To think the mastermind behind all this

288
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:41,866
It's actually you.

289
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,866
I advise you to quit while you're ahead.

290
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:46,833
Since you've narrowly escaped death,

291
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,566
why walk right into the trap?

292
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,500
Jiang Wen-huan.

293
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,633
You still look down on others so much.

294
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
But now, I, Ning Ziyu,

295
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:57,966
am no longer

296
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,633
that indecisive coward.

297
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,933
And you lot who caused my father's death—

298
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,200
the chief culprits—

299
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:04,333
tonight,

300
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,800
will surely die by my hand,

301
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,166
and pay with your lives for my father.

302
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:17,733
Jiang Wen-huan.

303
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,100
Do you really think you can come and go as you please

304
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,300
in my Li Manor?

305
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,533
Jiang Wen-huan.

306
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,400
Think back to when you captured my father—

307
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
so brave and heroic.

308
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:32,966
I bet you never thought

309
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,433
you'd end up in my hands one day.

310
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,533
Brother E.

311
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:40,800
Do you still remember?

312
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,633
Do you remember what I said to you at the Colosseum?

313
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,633
As expected

314
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,233
This kid

315
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,766
Wicked and foolish

316
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,566
This behavior will never change

317
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,466
Jiang WenHuan

318
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you think you can still

319
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,266
escape by running your mouth?

320
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,633
Since today

321
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,833
you've delivered yourself right into my hands

322
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,966
then I certainly can’t refuse your kindness

323
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,266
Elder Li

324
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,133
I’ll trouble you with this

325
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,733
Guards

326
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,466
Chop him up

327
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,333
Stop

328
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,133
Put the blade down

329
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,900
Say

330
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,333
Let them go

331
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,266
Or I’ll die right before your eyes

332
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:41,866
Elder Li

333
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,600
Don’t forget the agreement between us

334
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,833
If you show mercy today

335
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,233
you will destroy everything in Qiankun Alley

336
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,166
Say

337
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,033
Do you know what you're doing?

338
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,900
Take the young lady away for me

339
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:14,966
Elder Li

340
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
I, Jiang Wenhuan

341
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,433
am, after all, the heir of the Eastern Martial Marquis

342
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,900
Today

343
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,600
if anything happens to me at your Li residence

344
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,066
my eldest brother will surely investigate it thoroughly

345
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,200
Neither you nor Qiankun Alley

346
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,700
will get away with it

347
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,266
Shut your mouth

348
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,833
Which ear of yours heard me say

349
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,866
I would kill you at the Li residence

350
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:43,433
Take him away

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,466
Go, go

352
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,166
Elder Li is indeed a seasoned player

353
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,900
acting with such swift decisiveness

354
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,333
Heir, rest assured

355
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,133
The Gaomei Sacrifice那边 has already been prepared

356
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,100
You go ahead

357
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,600
I will follow shortly

358
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,933
You're late

359
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,066
Young master, do you really trust that Elder Li

360
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
will carry out the lethal strike?

361
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,000
Honored envoy, you're teaching me how to do things again

362
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:46,066
I just want to remind the Crown Prince.

363
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,033
This matter is of great importance.

364
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:49,600
It cannot tolerate the slightest mistake.

365
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,500
I personally watched the body burn.

366
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,066
Are you doubting me, esteemed envoy?

367
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,566
Or do you think I'm incompetent?

368
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
Jiang Wenxuan and the others see me as incompetent.

369
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:09,200
But even you Guifang barbarians

370
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,066
dare to look down on me?

371
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,033
There's no need for anger, Crown Prince.

372
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,766
You and I

373
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,366
are ultimately on the same boat.

374
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,366
That's a nice way to put it.

375
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,033
You and I simply have our own agendas.

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
You Guifang people have gone to great lengths

377
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:29,766
to help me seek revenge,

378
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,700
but it's all because you're after the so-called elixir of immortality.

379
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,533
Let me tell you,

380
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,300
if we fail to avenge my father this time,

381
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,066
you can forget about obtaining

382
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,566
that so-called elixir of immortality.

383
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,766
Let me be the blade of you Guifang people.

384
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,833
Do not forget your status.

385
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,800
It seems the Ning family

386
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
will truly have no successor.

387
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,500
General Jiang, we shall take our leave first.

388
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:04,800
- Farewell. - Farewell.

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,733
General, it is time to set off.

390
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:13,966
That brat

391
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,300
has still not been found?

392
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:17,933
I have already given the order.

393
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
If the heir is spotted,

394
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,066
report to the general immediately.

395
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:23,666
Rest assured.

396
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,900
I have ordered the heir’s camp personnel

397
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,000
to remain at the camp

398
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,700
as a precaution.

399
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:29,466
Eldest Young Master,

400
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,866
if we do not set off soon, it will be too late.

401
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:33,800
The matter of Chong Yiwu

402
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,233
has already caused panic among the people.

403
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:37,866
Tonight’s ceremony

404
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:40,466
must not have any further mishaps.

405
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,766
Set off.

406
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Heavenly Mandate Blue Bird.

407
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,000
Descended to become a minister.

408
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,566
Cycle and begin again.

409
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:35,633
Life goes on endlessly.

410
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Generation after generation without cease.

411
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,666
The Gao Mei Sacrifice Ceremony.

412
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,066
Begin.

413
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:16,433
Why has the fire gone out?

414
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,533
My head is so dizzy.

415
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,733
Wuyu, are you alright?

416
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,600
As expected of the master of Qiankun Lane.

417
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,566
To actually poison the Eastern Lu army.

418
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,933
Young master, since you had me administer the poison.

419
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,900
Then why

420
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,166
not simply poison them to death?

421
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:19,133
Wouldn't that settle it once and for all?

422
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,666
Dying so easily.

423
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,133
Wouldn't that be letting them off too lightly?

424
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
This drug only temporarily knocks them out.

425
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,166
They will wake up again shortly.

426
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,133
I want them to watch in the sea of fire

427
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,033
as the people they care about

428
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:37,333
die one by one before they do.

429
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:40,866
Is the oil all prepared?

430
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,633
It is prepared.

431
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:22,200
I declare

432
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,000
The ceremony officially begins

433
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,133
Who is it

434
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,333
Kid yu

435
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:44,100
We meet again

436
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:47,400
Jiang Wenhuan

437
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:48,933
Why aren't you dead

438
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,266
If it weren't for Miss A Si's help

439
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:53,233
I would have really fallen into your hands this time

440
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:55,966
Come out quickly and save people

441
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:05,866
Want to save people

442
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:07,366
Not that easy

443
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:17,633
What have you done

444
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:18,633
If I didn't have a backup plan

445
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,100
How would I dare to come this far

446
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:21,800
Ning Ziyu, you're crazy

447
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:22,966
If this place collapses

448
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,266
None of us will be able to escape

449
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:25,500
Tonight

450
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,166
I will perish together with all of you

451
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:33,433
Father

452
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:34,733
The stone statue is about to fall, come quickly

453
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:35,333
Say

454
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,666
Be careful

455
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:45,900
Old Li, what are you doing

456
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,066
Young Master Ning

457
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:49,433
A Si is my only daughter

458
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:50,666
I absolutely cannot let anything happen to her

459
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,233
Brother Jiang, come quickly and help

460
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:53,833
It's too dangerous here

461
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,133
Let's move everyone out first

462
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:57,466
I'll go over there

463
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,666
I have already repaid the favor I owed Marquis Ningbo

464
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,800
Now you want to harm my daughter

465
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,233
Absolutely not

466
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,566
You old thing actually went back on your word

467
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:10,966
Stop it, Young Master Ning

468
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Since that's the case

469
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:16,766
Then we'll die together

470
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,633
Ning Ziyu, you're insane

471
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:21,566
Father

472
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:26,600
Be careful

473
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,733
Si's, Run Quickly

474
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:30,566
Father

475
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,500
Don't even think about harming my Si'er

476
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,200
Damn it, this place is going to collapse, save them quickly

477
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:38,300
Father

478
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,866
You betrayed me

479
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,366
Do you think the East Martial Marquis's estate will let you off?

480
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,166
Don't forget the origin of your Qiankun Alley

481
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,033
You have no chance, Ning Ziyu

482
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:52,466
Si'er, run quickly, it's dangerous

483
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,433
Father

484
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:55,700
My leg

485
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,066
Hurry, go

486
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:58,666
Father

487
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,000
This place is about to collapse

488
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,866
Even if I die

489
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,833
I will drag you all down with me

490
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,233
Someone, come quickly

491
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,000
Quick, get everyone out

492
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,666
There's still someone under the rocks

493
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:20,966
Hurry, save them

494
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,400
Come on, save them

495
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:25,000
Quick

496
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:25,500
Quick

497
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,233
Father

498
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,866
Father

499
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,166
Go, carry him out

500
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,200
Father

501
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,600
Father

502
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:43,233
Quick

503
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:43,733
Over here

504
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,233
Father

505
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,266
Father, answer me

506
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,166
There's another one trapped here

507
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,866
Father

508
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:52,500
Father

509
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,133
Father

510
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,400
Father

511
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,766
Father

512
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:03,100
Father

513
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,033
Father

514
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:06,200
Say

515
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,166
Father

516
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,633
Why haven't you left yet

517
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,033
Go quickly

518
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,433
Don't worry, Father

519
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,133
I'll save you right away

520
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,666
Don't mind me, say

521
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,800
Go quickly

522
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,066
It's too dangerous here

523
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,133
- The cave is about to collapse  - I won't leave

524
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,800
If we go, we go together

525
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,733
Father

526
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,300
Grab this whip

527
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,833
Grab this whip

528
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,033
I'll pull you out

529
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,066
Hold on tight

530
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Hold on

531
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,466
This is

532
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,133
This year brought a bountiful harvest

533
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:03,100
Obtained a brocade wedding dress

534
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,566
Left for SIs

535
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:07,433
Went south for business

536
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,433
Obtained a mandarin duck gilt dragon-phoenix quilt

537
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Left for SIs

538
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,266
Went north to deliver goods

539
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,233
Obtain a bright pearl
and phoenix crown

540
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:17,833
Leave for SIs

541
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:20,466
Crossing west to Shenchuan

542
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,300
Deyi Phoenix-patterned
women's shoes

543
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:23,666
Leave to SIs

544
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,866
It turns out that Dad has
taken care of everything for me.

545
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:52,933
Dad

546
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:54,300
Grab my hand

547
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,300
Say

548
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,333
Grab my hand

549
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:58,533
Don't mind your dad.

550
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,066
You should leave quickly!

551
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,333
Dad

552
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:03,600
Hurry up

553
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:04,333
Sister

554
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,833
I'm not leaving.

555
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,733
Die with Father.

556
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,000
Here is going to collapse.

557
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,600
Dad

558
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,000
Li Asi

559
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:17,566
Dad can't go out anymore.

560
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,066
From now on, Dad can no
longer take care of you.

561
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
Remember

562
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,233
No matter what

563
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:25,666
Must go on living

564
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,633
Dad, you pull my hand

565
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,100
You're holding my hand.

566
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,433
Jiang WenHuan

567
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,166
What are you standing there for?

568
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,300
Drag A-Si out of here

569
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,466
Father

570
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,566
Father

571
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,500
What I owe East Lu

572
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,733
I will repay with this life

573
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,600
Si-er knows nothing

Jiang Wenhuan
