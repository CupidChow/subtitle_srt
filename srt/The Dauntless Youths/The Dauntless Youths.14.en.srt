1
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,100
Elixir of Immortality

2
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,933
How could Zhongli possess the Elixir of Immortality?

3
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:42,600
How is that impossible?

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,733
Why are you still awake?

5
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,666
Aren't you also still awake?

6
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,066
Can't sleep.

7
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,266
Why?

8
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,733
I'm thinking about the search for the elixir.

9
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,533
Right.

10
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:01,566
You just said

11
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,533
Zhongli couldn't possibly have the Elixir of Immortality.

12
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,133
Why?

13
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:06,966
Have you been to Zhongli?

14
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,866
Zhongli is very far from our Southern Capital.

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,400
Naturally, I haven't been there.

16
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,500
Haven't been there, huh.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,766
I was just thinking

18
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,300
This Zhongli

19
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,166
only submitted to Shangshan a little over ten years ago.

20
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,000
And this Elixir of Immortality

21
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,000
is said to date back to the Sheng'an era.

22
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,133
Why would the Sheng'an ancestors

23
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,000
hide the sacred relic of Shangshan

24
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,733
in a remote, barbaric land beyond civilization?

25
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,400
I realize

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,533
You have a habit.

27
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:45,833
When others feel guilty,

28
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,966
they tend to glance around nervously.

29
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:48,466
But not you.

30
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:49,733
You prefer

31
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,200
to stare intently at people.

32
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,500
Do I?

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,366
Yes.

34
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,666
But it's okay.

35
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,733
If you say you haven't been there,

36
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,533
then you haven't been there.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,266
Whatever you say,

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,700
I'll believe it.

39
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:09,400
It's just that

40
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:11,666
you need to remember this:

41
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,833
If you have something on your mind,

42
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:15,933
don't hide it from me.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,566
No matter what you want to do,

44
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,466
I'll do everything to help you.

45
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:23,966
Don't forget,

46
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,433
between brothers,

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,333
if there are secrets,

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,533
we deserve to be struck by lightning.

49
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,266
Alright.

50
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:41,900
That's more like it.

51
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,266
You are my best brother, Jiang WenHuan.

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,300
I've got your back

53
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,500
How about that

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,400
Happy or not

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,733
We're about to leave Donglu soon

56
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:51,833
You can still have my back

57
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,866
No matter where we go

58
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,166
As long as I, Jiang Wenhuàn, am here

59
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:55,866
I can always have your back

60
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah, right

61
00:03:59,166 --> 00:03:59,666
By the way

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,600
A Si's horsewhip

63
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,666
Shouldn't you return it to her

64
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,266
Tomorrow, then

65
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,100
I should at least let her know, right

66
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,400
Alright

67
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:22,966
This whip

68
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,333
Was made for me by my father with his own hands back then

69
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:26,700
I never expected

70
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,800
It could come back to me again

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,433
Thank you

72
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,966
The whip cord was badly damaged by the fire

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,666
Although I tried my best to repair it

74
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm afraid

75
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,066
It still can't compare to Old Man Li's craftsmanship

76
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:36,800
No

77
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,100
You did a great job fixing it

78
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,100
I really like

79
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:46,833
I'm sorry

80
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,966
It was my fault that Li Mansion wronged Donglu City

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,366
I didn't know

82
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,133
It turns out that Qiankun Alley

83
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,966
has always been connected to Ningzhou

84
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:03,700
I

85
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,800
The grudges of the previous generation

86
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,033
should not be borne by you

87
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:14,900
So

88
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:16,600
I have decided to return to Ningzhou

89
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
to investigate and get to the bottom of it

90
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:19,900
Ningzhou

91
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:22,900
Before my father passed away

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,966
he left me a letter

93
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,866
The letter mentioned my origins

94
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:30,766
You are from Ningzhou

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,266
Ningzhou

96
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,766
Tushan Village

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,100
is the place where sixteen years ago

98
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,100
the king sent people to search for

99
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
the nation-protecting sacred treasure

100
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,200
Ningzhou has the elixir of immortality

101
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,900
But today we received a royal order

102
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,266
saying we are to go to Zhongli to search

103
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:50,833
Zhongli

104
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,033
That's right.

105
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
This elixir of immortality

106
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,433
Is it in Ningzhou

107
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,366
Or in Zhongli

108
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,800
No matter where this elixir of immortality truly lies

109
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,266
What it brings

110
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,500
Is always storms of blood

111
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,066
Although sixteen years ago

112
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,533
I once narrowly escaped death

113
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:14,600
Amidst the great chaos

114
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,133
I could never truly escape

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,433
The shadow it cast over me

116
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,100
So I’ve decided to go back and see for myself

117
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,333
To uncover the truth

118
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,466
This would at least be worthy

119
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:24,866
Of the care the Li Manor

120
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:25,866
Has received from Donglu over the years

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,333
I never expected

122
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,433
You to have such insight

123
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,266
After just a few days apart

124
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
I must view you in a new light

125
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:36,700
This young lady

126
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:37,800
Is someone destined for great things

127
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,833
Look

128
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,166
How beautiful

129
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:02,033
You like this

130
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:04,833
You wait a moment

131
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:09,566
Wait a moment

132
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,766
Wait, wait, wait

133
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,900
I'll take this

134
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:32,533
Keep the change

135
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,466
Thanks a lot

136
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:39,233
And you are

137
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:46,600
And you are

138
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:58,733
Where is everyone

139
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,000
Left so soon

140
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:05,933
Didn't even have time

141
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,233
To say "see you again"

142
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,233
Take care

143
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,666
In previous years, after the Gaomei Festival

144
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,766
The ritual site

145
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,433
Would open to all the citizens

146
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,300
For prayers and worship

147
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,300
Pilgrims streamed in endlessly

148
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,033
The scent of offerings and incense

149
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,866
Could spread halfway through the city

150
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,833
Now

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If only I had realized sooner

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
That Zi Yu was the one scheming behind the scenes

153
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,233
Things wouldn't have turned out like this

154
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,766
Elder Brother

155
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:28,600
I've let you down

156
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,000
I have also let down my parents.

157
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:32,566
Do you still remember

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,533
During every ancestral worship ceremony

159
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,233
Father would stand here

160
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,133
And say something to us

161
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,500
Of course I remember

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,733
For centuries

163
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:43,166
The descendants of the Jiang military family

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,166
Have vowed to protect the world as their duty

165
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,066
Yes

166
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:47,600
Father also said

167
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:50,166
The Jiang family guards Eastern Lu

168
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,500
Not for power

169
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:52,600
Nor greedy for wealth

170
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,466
And without fear of life or death

171
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,400
In life

172
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,533
We use our flesh and blood

173
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
To protect our homeland

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,466
In death

175
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,933
We use our loyal souls

176
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,166
To bless the people of the city

177
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,666
Although the ceremony was destroyed

178
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,466
The loyal souls of the Jiang family

179
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,933
Will undoubtedly, as always,

180
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:12,966
Guard Eastern Lu City

181
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,900
And bless its people

182
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
And blessings to you

183
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:24,900
Your journey this time

184
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,266
I have prayed for you

185
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,133
You are of our Jiang family this generation

186
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,033
The sole successor

187
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,066
The ancestors

188
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:33,766
Will surely protect you

189
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,966
I am not the only child of the Jiang family

190
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,233
The only heir of the Jiang family

191
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:40,766
Is only you, eldest brother

192
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,500
You

193
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,066
Eldest brother wants to scold me again

194
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,000
Your younger brother is going on a long journey today

195
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,366
Otherwise, save this beating

196
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:48,800
For the day when we two brothers

197
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,700
Meet again

198
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,766
I promise you, eldest brother

199
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,966
This time

200
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,400
I will definitely find the elixir of immortality

201
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,433
To bring merit to Shangshan

202
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,433
Rebuild the ancestral temple of Donglu

203
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,200
And have the plaque of generations of achievements

204
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:09,833
Hung once more upon

205
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,466
The lintel of the Marquis of Dongwu's residence

206
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,933
Do you still remember

207
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,233
When Father passed us the long halberd.

208
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
Did he ever say anything.

209
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,100
You remember.

210
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:37,366
Our Jiang family's long halberd.

211
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,800
Can sever the heads of enemy invaders.

212
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,266
Can seal the throats of treacherous villains.

213
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,233
That's right.

214
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,366
The Jiang family's long halberd.

215
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,000
Is the king of all weapons.

216
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,166
Wielding the halberd to charge into battle formations.

217
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,333
One can stand against a hundred.

218
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,033
A single darting dragon strike, capable of piercing through heaven and earth.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,933
But do you know.

220
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,166
What our Jiang family's ancestral temple has relied upon for centuries.

221
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:53,900
Has never been solely.

222
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,933
This peerless halberd technique.

223
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,466
But rather the courage of generations of Jiang ancestors.

224
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,700
Who dared to seek life through death.

225
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,766
And their loyalty, pouring out their livers and gallbladders.

226
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,300
For hundreds of years.

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,066
The descendants of our Jiang clan.

228
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,466
Women have been heroines.

229
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,800
Men have been valiant sons.

230
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,266
They spent their entire lives.

231
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,066
Fighting north and south.

232
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,000
Bathing in blood to slay enemies

233
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,366
Even after dying on the battlefield

234
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:19,633
Vanished without a trace

235
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:21,666
Only these very

236
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
Battered and scarred halberds remain

237
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,000
Preserved in the ancestral temple

238
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,100
Barely retaining

239
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,633
The final fervor of glory

240
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,500
Now

241
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,766
The Jiang family's martyrs are gone

242
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,333
But their heroic spirits live on forever

243
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,300
Take this

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,933
From now on

245
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,333
You are a true warrior of the Jiang family

246
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:53,733
You must know good from evil

247
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:54,966
Distinguish right from wrong

248
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,133
Hold fast to your principles

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,233
The generations of heroic spirits of the Jiang family

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,433
Will surely aid you to be invincible in battle

251
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,333
And unstoppable in conquest

252
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,233
Achieve what you wish to accomplish

253
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,366
Protect those you wish to guard

254
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,866
Most importantly

255
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,933
You brat

256
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,100
Come back to me safely.

257
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,266
Let's go

258
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,566
I'll see you off to the city gate

259
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,100
Big Bro

260
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,800
Wait for me a moment

261
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,333
You brat

262
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,533
This journey to seek medicine

263
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,333
Its outcome, good or ill, is uncertain

264
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,233
The so-called nation-protecting sacred treasure

265
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,333
Is also elusive and intangible

266
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,533
You must be cautious in every matter

267
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,466
Alright, I understand it all

268
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,400
I will surely remember Big Bro's advice

269
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:23,800
All of you

270
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:25,500
Are the elite soldiers and fine generals

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,300
Selected by me and General Jiang

272
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,833
On this journey south

273
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,766
You represent the entire Heir's Camp

274
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:31,733
Remember

275
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,166
The path may be long, but you have companions

276
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:36,100
If the heart is steadfast, then there is nothing to fear

277
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,233
Throughout this journey

278
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,133
No matter what difficulties you encounter

279
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,033
As long as you stand united as one

280
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,666
You will be able to charge forward fearlessly

281
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,700
Master Gongsun and General Jiang

282
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:52,566
Rest assured.

283
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,033
We were all trained by the two of you personally.

284
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,666
We will definitely not disgrace the honor of Donglu.

285
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:57,600
Jiang Wen Huan.

286
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,166
Jiang Wen Huan is here.

287
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Today.

288
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,500
You will lead the team out.

289
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:04,900
In the future.

290
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,800
You must lead the team back.

291
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,166
Not a single one can be missing.

292
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,466
This general obeys the command.

293
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,766
We go together today.

294
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,433
We will definitely return together in the future.

295
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:15,200
We go together today.

296
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,866
We return together in the future.

297
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,866
Alright.

298
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:19,400
Let's set off.

299
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:22,600
Huan'er.

300
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,366
Master.

301
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:29,200
There is something.

302
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,933
I need to remind you.

303
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,233
This journey is fraught with countless difficulties and dangers.

304
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,133
Fortune and misfortune are unpredictable.

305
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,533
Remember to know when to stop.

306
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,033
Do not get bogged down too deeply.

307
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,266
Master.

308
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:41,933
What do you mean?

309
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,966
Do not forget the lesson of Marquis Ningbo

310
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:46,800
The wrath of the capital

311
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,100
is not something a regional lord can withstand

312
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,266
You must remember

313
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,000
Behind you

314
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,966
lies the entirety of Eastern Lu

315
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,300
Go now

316
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,666
Set forth

317
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,266
Once you pass this point

318
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,100
you will have exited the gates of Eastern Lu

319
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,766
Go ahead

320
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,533
Look

321
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:25,100
what is that

322
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Be there or be square

323
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,500
Until we meet again

324
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,800
Every time I have a cup of herbal tea at your place

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,633
no matter how tangled my official duties may be

326
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,200
I can always sort them out with full attention

327
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,800
Since you enjoy it so much, young master

328
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,533
before I return to the capital

329
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,433
I will prepare more dried herbs for you

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,333
During your busy days with official matters

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,466
just have your servant brew a pot for you

332
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,700
But I

333
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,466
I only want to drink what you brew.

334
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're getting ready to leave too.

335
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't worry.

336
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,366
Once I return to the capital,

337
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:20,300
I will petition the king

338
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:21,866
to mobilize the Tao Tie Army

339
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,366
to ensure the children's safety.

340
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,233
The capital isn't like Donglu—it's damp, cold, and rainy.

341
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Take this.

342
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It'll come in handy.

343
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,766
In the blink of an eye,

344
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,500
Anashi has grown so big.

345
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,233
Do you still remember

346
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,733
the first time we met?

347
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,633
I'm leaving.

348
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,033
When will you return to Donglu again?

349
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,366
What I meant to say is,

350
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,700
if you're gone for too long,

351
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,600
Anashi's medicine might run out.

352
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,233
I'll bring some more then.

353
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Thank you.

354
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:24,800
No need to worry.

355
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,933
I...

356
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,066
When the hibiscus flowers bloom,

357
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,033
we will meet again.

358
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,366
Has actually budded in early autumn

359
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,100
This year's weather is colder than in previous years.

360
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,800
But this hibiscus that blooms in late autumn

361
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,233
Don't be afraid

362
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:21,566
I am Jiang Wenfeng

363
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:22,766
Just eighteen years of age

364
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,100
A native of Eastern Lu

365
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:25,366
From a military household

366
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Orphaned since childhood

367
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,300
Fortunately gained the appreciation of the Marquis of Eastern Lu

368
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,733
Became his adopted son

369
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,600
Now in the army

370
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,000
Serving Eastern Lu

371
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,400
Eldest Young Master

372
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,066
You should meet him

373
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,900
Haven't you seen someone in their twenties

374
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,366
Still not married?

375
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,366
Great General

376
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,166
It is time to marry

377
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I only wish to marry the one

378
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,800
I most adore

379
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,200
Sir, sir, wait a moment

380
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
General

381
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,033
Why have you come?

382
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,733
Sir

383
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:11,800
How exactly do you view me?

384
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,700
General

385
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,266
You are my savior

386
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,900
This humble official, in this lifetime

387
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,200
has no way to repay you

388
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,933
Stop the carriage

389
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,266
Stop the carriage quickly

390
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,666
Two years ago, the eastern border was in great turmoil

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,866
I fought fiercely with the Gui faction for three days and fell into a trap

392
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:55,833
Do you know what

393
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:56,733
I was thinking in that moment

394
00:23:58,266 --> 00:23:59,633
Father has Wen Huan and Yi Yao to bring him joy and comfort

395
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,666
I wasn’t worried about that

396
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,933
I was thinking if I died

397
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,866
would you be sad

398
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,033
would you forget me

399
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:07,200
would you marry someone else

400
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,200
I didn’t want you to forget me

401
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,533
So I mustered the last bit of my strength

402
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:13,600
and crawled out of the trap

403
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,266
escaping death by a hair's breadth

404
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,266
I am Jiang Wenfeng

405
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,300
thirty-two years old, a native of Donglu

406
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,866
from a military household

407
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,600
adopted son of the Marquis of Dongwu's household

408
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,400
Now I serve in the military for Eastern Lu

409
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,500
I have not yet married

410
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,500
Only because I am waiting for someone

411
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:34,700
I want an eight-carriage sedan

412
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,900
A proper, formal wedding to bring her home

413
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,366
Love her

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,800
Protect her

415
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,900
And together with her, take good care of her child

416
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,000
Admire the spring flowers and autumn moon together

417
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,233
Endure the scorching summers and harsh winters together

418
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:49,633
Until our hair turns white for all eternity

419
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,033
Actually, you don’t need to rush to give me an answer

420
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:06,200
But I have already made up my mind

421
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,933
No matter what you are going to do now

422
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,066
No matter where you are going

423
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,000
I, Jiang Wenfeng

424
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,400
Will never give up

425
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,300
General

426
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:15,200
I never expected

427
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,133
That this trip to the heir’s camp

428
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
Of all things, it's going to Zhongli.

429
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,133
This old servant is worried

430
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,200
Once Young Master Kunwu enters Zhongli

431
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,100
then he will learn of his sister's whereabouts

432
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,633
Young Master

433
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,400
what are your plans

434
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
since that is the case

435
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,133
send someone to inform his sister

436
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,333
the news of her elder brother's return

437
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,533
relay it to her

438
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,233
so that they may reunite sooner

439
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,666
if these two were to meet

440
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,433
this old servant worries it may expose your identity

441
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,066
now, the Southern Capital is thriving and prosperous

442
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:53,400
if the young master's frailty

443
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,866
and the search for a substitute were exposed

444
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,166
the surrounding feudal states watching like tigers eyeing their prey

445
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,933
would surely seize the opportunity to invade

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,533
by then, the Southern Capital would be in grave danger

447
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:05,300
Uncle Bing's concerns are valid

448
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,266
but he has helped me through this ordeal

449
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,933
and I am already indebted to him

450
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,566
now, fate has brought him back to Zhongli

451
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,000
even if I tried to stop him

452
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,533
I might not necessarily succeed

453
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,566
Why not just do him a favor at little cost

454
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,466
and let him meet his only remaining family member

455
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:27,800
That would also

456
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,400
fulfill the promise I made to him

457
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,633
Your servant understands

458
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,366
In your last secret report, you mentioned

459
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,700
that behind this incident

460
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,400
there seems to be Guifang involvement

461
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,100
Have you found any clues?

462
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:42,966
None at all

463
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,533
This person’s movements are quite elusive

464
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
The people we sent out

465
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,933
either lost track of him or went missing

466
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:50,800
This person

467
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,266
operates between Guifang

468
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,866
Ningzhou and Donglu

469
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:56,633
What kind of game is he playing?

470
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,933
What kind of game?

471
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,033
The kind where trouble is brewing

472
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,733
Since he is from Guifang

473
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,800
it makes sense to start the investigation from the Guifang kingdom

474
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,666
Have our undercover agents in Guifang

475
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,933
conduct a thorough investigation

476
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:10,466
Yes

477
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,833
I always feel

478
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,600
This journey to Zhongli

479
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,533
Will not be simple

480
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:48,466
Do you see it

481
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:51,233
When the qilin fights, the sun and moon are eclipsed

482
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,833
When the whale dies, the comet emerges

483
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,400
The stars

484
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,400
Are heaven's appointed times

485
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,033
The comet

486
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:03,600
Is heaven's warning

487
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,433
This is a caution from the heavens

488
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,100
Has anything significant happened recently in Zhongli

489
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,733
The Shangshan Sect's heir camp has come to Zhongli

490
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,566
Seeking the elixir of immortality

491
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,000
What is destined to come

492
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,433
Will eventually come

493
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,366
However, Gu Xian

494
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,500
The earlier astrological prophecy

495
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,933
You missed the latter part

496
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,200
I ask the State Preceptor for guidance

497
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,833
When the silkworm spits silk, the merchant's string breaks

498
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,766
When the star falls, the Bohai Sea bursts

499
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,800
Heir camp

500
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Whether fate allows them to reach Zhongli

501
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,133
Is still unknown

502
00:30:57,933 --> 00:30:59,233
After crossing one more mountain

503
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,400
Tomorrow, we should be able to reach Zhongli.

504
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,300
I've heard that although Zhongli is tucked away in a remote corner,

505
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,166
it is a land of abundance.

506
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,500
With vast expanses of fertile fields and rich farmland,

507
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,966
and an endless supply of silk from mulberry trees.

508
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,366
Isn't that right?

509
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,533
Otherwise, why would our Shangshan have gone to such great lengths

510
00:31:11,566 --> 00:31:12,766
years ago

511
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:14,000
to bring it under our control?

512
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:15,766
But do you know

513
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,500
why Zhongli is so prosperous?

514
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:19,266
Why?

515
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,000
They say that in the state of Zhongli, the granaries are full,

516
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,866
and the people are well-clothed and well-fed.

517
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:24,566
The locals place great faith in witchcraft,

518
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,633
believing it is heaven's blessing

519
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:28,266
that has made Zhongli so wealthy.

520
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,733
But precisely because of this,

521
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:31,233
although Zhongli has a ruler,

522
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,133
it is, in fact, a state governed by the royal sorcerer.

523
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,766
Rumors say that sorcerer possesses boundless magical power,

524
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,833
capable of ascending to the heavens and descending to the earth.

525
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:38,233
Many years ago

526
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,733
Grand General Zhongli Kunze raised an army in rebellion

527
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,433
It was the Imperial Preceptor

528
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:45,766
Who used magical power to subdue the thousands of troops and horses

529
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,266
Actually

530
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,833
What

531
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,300
What's wrong, E Shun

532
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,600
You've heard of Zhongli too

533
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,700
Before setting out

534
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,433
I did some research

535
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,133
Then tell us about it too

536
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,033
I've heard

537
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,033
That on the land of Zhongli

538
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,433
There is a river that runs through it all

539
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,500
Called Ten Miles of Dazzling Lights

540
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,433
The river water ripples gently

541
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,833
Fish swim in

542
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,033
When dusk arrives

543
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:23,633
The remaining sunlight spills onto the river surface

544
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:26,566
The water glistens and shimmers

545
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,266
My son

546
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,866
Over there

547
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,600
Father, caught it

548
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,400
Well done, my son

549
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,933
We'll have your mother cook it when we go back tonight

550
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:45,333
Okay

551
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,833
Looks delicious

552
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
And then?

553
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,433
That's all there is.

554
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,300
I don't know much about the rest.

555
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,633
After all that's been said,

556
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,266
none of you have touched on the key point.

557
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,633
What key point?

558
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,833
The beauties, of course.

559
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,366
Really.

560
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,400
Legend has it that the Zhongli Kingdom is filled with stunning women.

561
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:25,633
This time, I, the Young Master of Xichuan, am making a comeback,

562
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,400
and I must return with a beauty in my arms.

563
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
What do you say, Brother Chong?

564
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:31,866
How about

565
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:33,633
when we get there, I take you for a stroll through the red-light district?

566
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,833
Not going.

567
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:36,300
Brother Chong,

568
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,233
how can you be so clueless about romance?

569
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:40,933
You don't go near women.

570
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,200
Could it be

571
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,466
that our Brother Chong

572
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,633
has some unspeakable secret?

573
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,833
Right? Did you hear that?

574
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,333
Come here.

575
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:58,866
Have any of you ever seen Brother Chong touch a woman?

576
00:33:59,133 --> 00:33:59,600
No.

577
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,500
You come here.

578
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,400
No wonder that person.

579
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,466
When they danced this for you.

580
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
You had no reaction.

581
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:06,200
Is it true, Brother Chong?

582
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:07,733
Really never seen Brother Chong touch a woman.

583
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:08,800
You shut up.

584
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:10,066
Brother Chong.

585
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,700
Brother Chong, teach him a lesson.

586
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,066
Teach him a lesson.

587
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:15,800
Three.

588
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,700
I give up, I give up, I give up.

589
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Go over.

590
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,733
I'll make you talk nonsense.

591
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:24,200
Will you keep talking or not?

592
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,033
Sit down.

593
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:27,233
Will you keep talking or not?

594
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:27,833
Sit, sit, sit.

595
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,633
Brother Chong, take it easy.

596
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:30,933
I won't say anymore, I won't say anymore.

597
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,400
Where did this miasma come from?

598
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:35,900
Was I wrong or not?

599
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,100
Was I wrong or not?

600
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:43,466
Everyone, cover your nose and mouth quickly.

601
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,466
The miasma is highly toxic.

602
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,266
Quick, use your clothing to cover your nose and mouth.

603
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,500
Just squat down first.

604
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,366
It's too late. Hurry up and go.
