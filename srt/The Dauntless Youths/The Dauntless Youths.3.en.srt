1
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:03,800
Thank you

2
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,500
Go quickly, go quickly, go quickly

3
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,600
Everyone, be careful

4
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,533
What are you all standing around for?

5
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,400
Hurry up and get on with it

6
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:48,733
Oh no

7
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,166
With just the three of them, can they manage?

8
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,800
Brother Jiang, I'm here

9
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Monster

10
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,300
Look at me

11
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:04,933
Monster

12
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,500
Come on, look at me

13
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,566
You damn bastard

14
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,200
If you have the guts, look at Lord Xin here

15
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:09,666
Come on

16
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,566
I... I warn you

17
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:14,300
Don't come any closer

18
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:15,800
Never thought you, this monster

19
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,733
Would be so obedient at a critical moment

20
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,666
I warn you, don’t come any closer

21
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:55,666
Ziyu

22
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:57,533
Father

23
00:03:59,266 --> 00:03:59,933
Get up, child

24
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,333
Are you alright?

25
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:03,466
I'm fine, Father

26
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,366
But, Father

27
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,433
Why did you call me out in such a hurry?

28
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,133
What for?

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,700
Yu'er

30
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,166
You don’t need to ask about this matter

31
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:11,200
Nor should you get involved

32
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,133
My lord, something has happened

33
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,933
The young masters used some kind of strategy

34
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,066
And have already defeated that evil creature

35
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,033
So quickly?

36
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:21,266
Come with me, son

37
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,066
This bronze token

38
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,133
Doesn’t seem to be from the East Martial Marquis’s estate

39
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,566
This pattern

40
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,166
Could it be that the people in the carriage

41
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,066
Are really connected to this evil creature?

42
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:30,633
Brother Tao

43
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,166
Brother Jiang

44
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,833
How are you both?

45
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,400
With them here, we won’t die

46
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:34,733
What about the monster?

47
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
It must have been killed by my sword, of course

48
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:37,933
Really?

49
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,066
How are things outside?

50
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,866
General Jiang is still evacuating the civilians

51
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:43,600
Everyone else is here

52
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:45,366
Go

53
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:46,633
We're going back to help my brother

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Female flying thief

55
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,733
Why is she here

56
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,233
Bury the fallen noble son with full honors

57
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,300
Take the commoners' bodies

58
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,566
Back to their homes for burial

59
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,966
If there are no family members left

60
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,566
Bury them according to military rites

61
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,100
Yes

62
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,300
Does uttering "bury with full honors"

63
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,300
Allow you to shirk responsibility?

64
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,333
General Jiang, you should explain

65
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,200
Why the monsters appeared here

66
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,100
After all, there are many suspicions about this beast fight

67
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,133
Have you seen Brother Jiang?

68
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,533
Where is he?

69
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,366
Why did we lose track of him right here?

70
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:48,233
Miss

71
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,933
You're looking for me, the Marquis, aren't you?

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,566
Who are you?

73
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,633
Why are you following us?

74
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,933
I should be asking who you are

75
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,666
Daring to publicly release evil creatures

76
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,433
And disrupt our Donglu

77
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:03,900
Quick

78
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,266
Kill her for me

79
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,466
A mighty feudal lord

80
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,633
Openly bullying a young girl

81
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,466
Isn't very appropriate, is it?

82
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,166
Why is it you?

83
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:13,900
Brother Jiang

84
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,300
This young master

85
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,666
Might I ask if you are Nephew Jiang?

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,333
I dare not recklessly claim such relations

87
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,200
Lord Marquis, disrupting the beast fight

88
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,066
Is an act of deceiving the sovereign

89
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,300
Which warrants the execution of your nine clans

90
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,300
You

91
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,533
You refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit

92
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,800
Then I’d like to see

93
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,333
What forfeit drink Lord Marquis offers me

94
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,400
Why is it you again?

95
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,766
So it was also you who stole the imperial decree

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,566
What did I tell you last time?

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,100
If I ever see you again

98
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,733
You won’t keep your hands and feet

99
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,366
This time is just perfect

100
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,966
Take your master along with you

101
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:58,466
Don't move

102
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,900
Or I'll kill her

103
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:04,966
What are you laughing at

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,933
I'm laughing at how stupid you all are, of course

105
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:09,166
Old man

106
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,333
This girl is a petty thief

107
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,600
Do you think I care

108
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,366
about the life or death of a petty thief

109
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,366
Jiang Wenxuan

110
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,833
You vile man

111
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,100
Something as trivial as sesame seeds and mung beans

112
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,300
and you remember it so clearly

113
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,300
Today

114
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,600
even if I end up in the underworld

115
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,200
I will come back for revenge

116
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,733
What good will seeking revenge on me do

117
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,333
It's them who want to kill you

118
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,066
not me

119
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,666
Without you, would they have taken me hostage

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,233
Now you're being unreasonable

121
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Did I ask you to come

122
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,666
Did I tell them to attack you

123
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,033
Was it me who told them to take you hostage?

124
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,966
I don't care, it's because of you.

125
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,200
It really wasn't me.

126
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,233
It was you.

127
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:42,933
It wasn't me.

128
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:43,966
It was you.

129
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:44,733
Be careful.

130
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,100
Are you alright?

131
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,100
Let's go.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,100
This unforeseen incident.

133
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,333
Is truly heartbreaking.

134
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,433
I will definitely get to the bottom of this.

135
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,033
And give everyone an explanation.

136
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,933
I think we should still report to the king.

137
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,300
And ask His Majesty.

138
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,333
To make the decision.

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Right.

140
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:12,700
We will set off for the capital immediately.

141
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,200
To the capital, to seek justice.

142
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:14,766
Wait a moment.

143
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:15,733
Everyone.

144
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:16,866
Calm down.

145
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,666
You all want to seek justice, right?

146
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,766
Then we have no one else to look for.

147
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,633
We must find.

148
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,966
This person who seized the imperial decree.

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,500
And released the monsters—Marquis Ningbo.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,633
What on earth is going on here

151
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Everyone

152
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:30,733
This

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
was found inside

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,266
the crate used to transport that monster

155
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,733
The emblem on it

156
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,100
is the Ning family crest

157
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,200
Isn't that right

158
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:39,900
The Marquis's

159
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,733
What is the meaning of all this

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,733
Marquis Ning, so it really was him

161
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,166
How could it be Marquis Ning

162
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
How is that possible

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Why would he do this

164
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,966
Why

165
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:50,033
Stop asking

166
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,033
So what if this old man did it

167
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,500
The King wants to cut off my descendants

168
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:56,733
What I did

169
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,200
was all to stop the beast fights

170
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,633
and prevent the reopening of the proton camp

171
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,333
What, reopen the proton camp

172
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,033
Ten days ago, this Marquis received a secret report

173
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,633
The day of the War God Festival's beast fights

174
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,566
is when the proton camp reopens

175
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,066
What plans does the Marquis have?

176
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:25,366
Father

177
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,800
Must I really go to the capital like my elder brother

178
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,033
to serve as a proton?

179
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,066
The King has already killed one of my sons

180
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,633
I absolutely cannot let the Ning family

181
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,200
be cut off without descendants

182
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,400
The Marquis is indeed decisive in action

183
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,933
Our Guifang will certainly provide full assistance

184
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,233
to express our sincerity

185
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,166
I will offer our Guifang's secret arts

186
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,866
and await the Marquis's commands

187
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,266
Father

188
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:03,800
Father

189
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,800
All of this is forced upon us by the King

190
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,133
Do not blame this old man

191
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,100
Mount Shang is unkind

192
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,333
The Son of Heaven is without virtue!

193
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,800
Minister Gongsun

194
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,033
Is what Marquis Ningbo said true?

195
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Is the King truly going to reopen the proton camp?

196
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:31,966
The King

197
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,333
Preparing to establish the Heir Camp

198
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,133
Rather than a Hostage Camp

199
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,233
What is the difference between these two

200
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,133
Indeed

201
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,033
Isn't it about being a hostage

202
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:40,800
Exactly

203
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,500
Still hostages, aren't they

204
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,333
Everyone, please let me finish speaking

205
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,833
Recently

206
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,733
The King received divine guidance from heaven

207
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,500
Learning that the elixir of immortality

208
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,566
Has reappeared in the world

209
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,166
And the one who can find it

210
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,066
Is among the heirs of the feudal lords

211
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,500
Therefore, the King

212
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,600
Intends to establish the Heir Camp in Eastern Lu

213
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,000
Merely to search for

214
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,166
The long-lost national treasure of Shang Mountain that protects the country

215
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:02,233
Eastern Lu

216
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,633
You mean the Heir Camp is not in the capital

217
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,900
Correct

218
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:07,433
This is the King's royal edict

219
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,733
The heirs of the feudal lords may examine it

220
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:10,266
This

221
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
It truly is so

222
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,166
So it is said

223
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,800
If the heir's camp is set up in Donglu

224
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,066
Then the lives of the heirs

225
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,100
will be somewhat secured

226
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,166
If we can retrieve the sacred treasure for the king

227
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
Our entire clan will surely be rewarded

228
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,133
Bringing glory to our motherland

229
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,933
This is utterly foolish

230
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,266
How can you believe the nonsense of Old Man Yuanyang

231
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,566
You hypocrites with your false righteousness

232
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:35,900
Every single one of you

233
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,666
Who doesn't harbor grievances against Shang Mountain

234
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,333
I am different from you

235
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,566
I dare to act and take responsibility

236
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,500
Willing to donate my aged body

237
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,000
Risk my life to fight

238
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,300
Resist the unjust and foolish ruler

239
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,000
Marquis Ningbo, you have a silver tongue

240
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,366
It's a pity that with such eloquence

241
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
You don't go to the capital to argue with the king

242
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,966
Instead, you harm the innocent here

243
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:03,166
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse

244
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:05,100
Now, based solely on your speculation

245
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,366
you have caused such great chaos

246
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,766
How are you any different

247
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,400
from the tyrannical and foolish ruler you speak of

248
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,466
The lives of your Ning family are lives

249
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,766
while the lives of others are mere weeds and ants

250
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:16,600
With a narrow mind like yours

251
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,333
so ignorant and petty

252
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,166
you put on an act as if everyone else is corrupt

253
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,333
and you alone are virtuous

254
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,433
When it comes to being a person

255
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,666
being bad is one thing

256
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,300
but what’s worse is being foolish

257
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:26,233
Jiang Wenhuan

258
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,133
Step back

259
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,300
Ning Bohou

260
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,966
You harm the innocent out of personal vendetta

261
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,133
No excuse justifies

262
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,500
your scheming to harm others

263
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,200
Father

264
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,300
Innocent

265
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,333
As long as I can protect my son’s life

266
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:59,766
all of you are expendable

267
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,133
Father

268
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:10,933
Ziyu

269
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,133
All these people are handed over to Father.

270
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:13,966
Let's go quickly.

271
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:14,400
Father.

272
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,766
Ziyu.

273
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,166
Heaven wants to destroy me.

274
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:33,900
My son is innocent!

275
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,100
It is the negligence of our Dongwu Marquis Estate.

276
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,566
Come back to the city with me first.

277
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:35,933
Wait a moment.

278
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,500
If I had uncovered the truth earlier.

279
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,466
If I hadn't been so arrogant.

280
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,200
If before the beast fight.

281
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,500
I had promptly shared the clues with Big Brother.

282
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,533
All of this.

283
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,266
Would it have been different?

284
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,133
This subordinate general, Jiang Wenfeng, has failed in his duties.

285
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,800
Above, I have failed the King's grace.

286
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,333
Below, I have shamed the Jiang family ancestors.

287
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I am willing to accept punishment.

288
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:02,066
Stop!

289
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,033
Halt!

290
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,066
Big Brother.

291
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,033
I am the heir of the Dongwu Marquis.

292
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,333
The one who should be punished is me.

293
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:09,300
Are you deaf?

294
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:10,700
Try laying another hand on my brother!

295
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:11,966
I am the eldest son

296
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,800
Eldest brother, hit me

297
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,000
Get out

298
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,933
You have no right to speak here

299
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:19,500
Let go of me

300
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Let go of me

301
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,433
Stop making a scene

302
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:26,666
By the king's order

303
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,300
Although the beast fight was initiated by Ning Bohou's rebellion

304
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,066
the Dongwu Hou Mansion is also guilty of negligence

305
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,800
This time, not only will your eldest brother be punished

306
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,300
but the imperially bestowed plaque will also be revoked

307
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,666
as a disciplinary measure

308
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,366
This is already a result of leniency beyond the law

309
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,233
in consideration of the Jiang family's illustrious military achievements by their ancestors

310
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,033
Harming the innocent

311
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,066
Disgrace

312
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,966
Bringing shame upon the ancestors

313
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,366
Disgrace

314
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,433
The glory of the Jiang family

315
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,933
The heroes of Donglu

316
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,833
Will you one day become one of these

317
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,366
As your teacher, I do not know

318
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,400
But there is one thing

319
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,533
I, your master, am very certain

320
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,300
Since the day I met both of you brothers

321
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:08,700
You

322
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:11,733
have been your elder brother's pride

323
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
I will go prepare some ointment

324
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,233
bandages

325
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:28,866
for elder brother

326
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,400
I also ask Master

327
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,066
to take good care of elder brother

328
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,233
Please rise quickly

329
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,400
I also ask Master to relay a message to elder brother for me

330
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,733
I will definitely not let him down

331
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:33,033
I never expected things to turn out like this

332
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,333
The Ning family has actually been wiped out just like that

333
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,900
The incident was sudden, and not something either of us wished for

334
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,933
I've troubled you

335
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:47,866
It's no trouble at all

336
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,200
Many matters

337
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,000
have been handled through your efforts

338
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,633
Thank you for helping me apply the medicine

339
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,533
Both my and Shi'er's lives were saved by you

340
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,166
Yet you're being so polite with me

341
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:05,900
This

342
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,833
It was Huan'er who asked me to give this to you

343
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:11,366
This is

344
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:12,766
This is from Huan'er

345
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:13,866
Taken from

346
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,133
that mysterious person who snatched the imperial decree

347
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,833
This object is made from

348
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,966
copper ore unique to Guifang

349
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,400
The State of Guifang

350
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,000
That’s right

351
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,100
The monster that appeared earlier

352
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,900
in the arena

353
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,200
If I recall correctly

354
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,966
should also be crafted through Guifang’s secret arts

355
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:30,200
the Kui Corpse

356
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,400
Never expected Marquis Ningbo to join forces with Guifang

357
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,266
Guifang is a state surrounding Donglu

358
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:39,166
not yet subjugated to Shangshan

359
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,033
Due to territorial disputes with Donglu

360
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,200
they have been engaged in war for years

361
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:44,700
But sixteen years ago

362
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,800
after the great upheaval in Ningzhou

363
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:48,333
Guifang quieted down for many years

364
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,066
Now they are stirring up trouble again.

365
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,000
Perhaps they learned that I, Donglu,

366
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,933
am about to establish the Heir Camp.

367
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,700
However, Guifang

368
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,566
has always been skilled in witchcraft and mysterious practices.

369
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,233
So it is not surprising

370
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,433
that Kuibashi is associated with them.

371
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,000
The establishment of the Heir Camp in Donglu

372
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,133
will likely bring many troubles in the future.

373
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,333
The camp begins tomorrow.

374
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,100
We can only wait and see how things unfold.

375
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,466
Protect Donglu.

376
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:18,866
Protect the children.

377
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:21,666
Alright, no need to see me off.

378
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,233
Go back.

379
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:25,666
Don’t worry, Father.

380
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,933
Mother, your health is not well.

381
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,233
Please return to your room.

382
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,766
My child, I cannot stop worrying about you.

383
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,666
Brother,

384
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,466
this is for you.

385
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,333
May it keep you safe in Donglu.

386
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:47,033
Mother’s health is not well.

387
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,800
You must take care of her on my behalf.

388
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,200
Be more filial, you know?

389
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:50,966
I'm leaving, Father.

390
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,300
Alright, take care, child.

391
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,033
Go back now.

392
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,366
Take good care of yourself.

393
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,133
Don’t worry about me.

394
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,633
Mind your health.

395
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:00,566
What are you looking at?

396
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,133
Isn’t it true that no one from North Bo Marquis Manor came?

397
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,333
Jealous?

398
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,366
No one came from Xichuan either.

399
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,133
It seems we are both unfortunate souls.

400
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,633
From now on in the Heir's Camp,

401
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,000
we’ll have to keep each other warm.

402
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:20,966
Let go.

403
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,766
Walking around with a long face all day.

404
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,000
Brother Chong,

405
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:38,466
we’ll keep each other warm.

406
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,200
After entering the camp,

407
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,433
this old servant will no longer be able

408
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:57,933
to stay by your side at all times.

409
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,566
Your Heir made a deal with me:

410
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,233
as long as I fight beasts for him,

411
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,533
he will help me find my sister.

412
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,766
You need not worry, young master.

413
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,100
As long as the young master

414
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,533
Stay put in this heir camp.

415
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,300
One day, the wish will be fulfilled.

416
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,700
The matter of the Crown Prince's camp.

417
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:18,966
He hadn't mentioned it before.

418
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,900
Bringing it up now.

419
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,766
Shouldn't be too late.

420
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:24,866
What if

421
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,400
I don't want to agree?

422
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,033
Do you think, sir,

423
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,200
you still have a choice?

424
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,666
You are a smart man, sir.

425
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,333
You should understand.

426
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,966
This bait-and-switch scheme.

427
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Once it begins.

428
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,166
There's no turning back.

429
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:49,200
Otherwise, if the truth comes out.

430
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:51,466
For you, for my master.

431
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,166
It would be a dead end.

432
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:00,333
My sister.

433
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,066
How is she now?

434
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,433
Alive or dead?

435
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,566
Your sister is still alive.

436
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:10,833
But.

437
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,300
Sometimes living.

438
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,833
Is more painful than death.

439
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:17,733
Don't worry, sir.

440
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,600
As long as you fulfill the agreement.

441
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:21,100
The master

442
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:25,000
I will definitely help the young master rescue your sister

443
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,733
My son

444
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:35,666
Live on

445
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:36,766
Protect Qingqing well

446
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:51,733
Father

447
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,000
Father

448
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,333
Father

449
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:02,466
Father

450
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,600
Father

451
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:04,933
Alright

452
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:06,600
I promise you

453
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:12,166
Dahuang

454
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,566
Come, drink with me

455
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:27,833
Let's go

456
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:28,766
Go

457
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,133
Go

458
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:34,266
Why did you drink so much?

459
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,000
Didn't drink much

460
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,466
Over here

461
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:47,366
Over here

462
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,700
You have a sip too

463
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,200
Brother Jiang

464
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,366
Drink less

465
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:23,633
I'm drunk

466
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:26,466
Being drunk is good

467
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:27,966
Drunk

468
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,400
Then I won't have to regret anymore

469
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,100
What happened in the arena

470
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,000
Was all an accident

471
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,366
Not your fault

472
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,133
I know

473
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,266
Everyone says that

474
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,700
Not my fault

475
00:27:58,966 --> 00:27:59,866
But do you know

476
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,200
I, of the esteemed Dongwu Hou Mansion

477
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,466
the heir Jiang Wenjuan

478
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,666
could not save my beloved dog Da Huang

479
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:12,766
could not stop the schemes of Ning Bo Hou

480
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,933
In the end

481
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,266
it was my elder brother who took the punishment for me

482
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:20,600
Tell me

483
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,333
isn't it ridiculous

484
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:25,566
Tonight

485
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,566
everyone is bidding farewell to their families

486
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,433
I too must bid farewell to someone

487
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,366
Who

488
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:33,100
Myself

489
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:34,600
You

490
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,400
From now on

491
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:40,700
I, Jiang Wenjuan

492
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,866
can no longer act recklessly

493
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,900
can no longer be ignorant of my own limits

494
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,766
and even more, cannot fail to understand my elder brother's苦心 (good intentions)

495
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,466
I must bid farewell

496
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,800
to that guilt-ridden

497
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:54,966
and helpless

498
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,366
incompetent self

499
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,433
Well then

500
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:11,300
And toast

501
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,366
to the incompetent self

502
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:23,166
River lanterns for sale

503
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:25,633
Selling river lanterns

504
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:27,933
Wait for me for a moment

505
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,766
Selling river lanterns

506
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:32,600
Uncle

507
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:34,433
Do you want a river lantern?

508
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:34,900
Two river lanterns

509
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:37,466
Here

510
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:41,166
Selling river lanterns

511
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,133
River lanterns

512
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,733
In the Southern Capital

513
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,666
If a loved one has passed away

514
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:19,766
Everyone uses river lanterns

515
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:20,766
To mourn and express grief

516
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:23,500
Life is short and unpredictable

517
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,333
The river flows endlessly

518
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,233
People hope that these waters,

519
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:28,633
whose final destination is unknown,

520
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,333
Can carry their prayers and sorrows

521
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,600
To accompany their loved ones

522
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:36,666
On their final journey

523
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:40,633
Then, Brother E, for whom is this lantern

524
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:42,333
Being released?

525
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:47,366
For

526
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:49,766
Those who continue to live

527
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
One lantern to honor the living

528
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,200
One lantern to solace the deceased

529
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:02,666
Very well

530
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,500
Prince's Camp

531
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,533
The camp will be established tomorrow in Donglu

532
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,800
What do you plan to do

533
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,000
It seems Brother Jiang already has plans

534
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,200
That's right

535
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,866
The Crown Prince's camp is being established

536
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,733
It's opened to seek the elixir of immortality for the king

537
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,633
If we successfully obtain the elixir

538
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,133
When the time comes

539
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,966
I will restore the Jiang family's glory

540
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:39,033
And have that plaque

541
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,100
Representing the Jiang family's generations of merit

542
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,233
Hang once more above the lintel of our house

543
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:46,766
Furthermore

544
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:48,966
I will make my eldest brother

545
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,000
Rightfully and legitimately

546
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,700
Become the master of the Eastern Martial Marquis's residence

547
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,500
Brother Jiang has quite a few

548
00:31:58,433 --> 00:31:59,100
Aspirations

549
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,066
What about you

550
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,566
Do you want to achieve great deeds and establish a career

551
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,300
Serve your motherland

552
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:07,800
Lead troops into battle

553
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:09,300
Or

554
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:10,066
I think

555
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:12,700
I want to survive

556
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:14,933
Survive

557
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:16,933
Okay

558
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,400
Then let's toast to us in the Prince's camp

559
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:21,366
Survive

560
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,133
Okay

561
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,266
You've all drunk me dry

562
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,266
This way

563
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,766
It's this way

564
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:54,933
Are you sure

565
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:55,633
I'm sure

566
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:57,933
Brother E Shun

567
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,666
If you ask me, the drinking capacity of you Southern Capital folks

568
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:01,933
Is nothing special

569
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,900
Naturally, it can't compare to Brother Jiang's massive capacity

570
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:06,433
Brother Jiang

571
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:09,633
It's fine

572
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,333
What is it

573
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,866
Be careful

574
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:19,400
You see

575
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:20,966
You and I

576
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,866
Have met a few times

577
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,733
A chance encounter

578
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:26,433
In a critical moment

579
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,633
You could disregard life and death

580
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,533
Step forward bravely

581
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,200
But honestly

582
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,866
I never expected that in the arena today

583
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,066
It would be you coming to save me

584
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,033
Didn't Brother Jiang say

585
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,366
Do I resemble your childhood friend?

586
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,400
Are you referring to Big Yellow?

587
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,566
I'll call you Big Yellow.

588
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,333
Do you dare to answer?

589
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:07,766
Big Yellow.

590
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:09,766
Big Yellow, Big Yellow.

591
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:13,133
Friends helping each other out

592
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,133
is only natural.

593
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,566
Could it be

594
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,066
Brother Jiang

595
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:18,766
has never

596
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,000
saved a stranger before?

597
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,133
But it's alright.

598
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:26,933
Tomorrow

599
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,166
I'll take you home.

600
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,366
Home.

601
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:39,600
Whiteheads As New.

602
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:41,533
Covered Chariots As Old.

603
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:43,866
A chance encounter.

604
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,566
can also be considered a life-and-death bond.

605
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:53,000
However

606
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,766
today, no matter what, you saved me.

607
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,466
From this moment on, you are my, Jiang Wen Huan's,

608
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,033
sworn brother.

609
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:05,800
I am deeply honored.

610
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,400
Choosing a day is not as good as meeting the day.

611
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:09,633
Just take advantage of the beautiful scenery.

612
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,333
Let's swear brotherhood.

613
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,533
Swear

614
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:14,866
Brotherhood

615
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:16,366
Yeah.

616
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,666
Swear brotherhood.

617
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,766
Perfect to fill Big Yellow's spot in our family.

618
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,733
You're drunk.

619
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:27,933
No.

620
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:31,466
I'm not drunk.

621
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,433
You, if you collapse here again.

622
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:34,933
I'm leaving, okay?

623
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:37,166
Don't go.

624
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:37,866
I'm leaving, okay?

625
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:38,366
Don't go.

626
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:38,966
I'm leaving, okay?

627
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,633
Don't go.

628
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:41,100
Don't go.

629
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,133
Big Yellow.

630
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:43,933
Don't go, ah.

631
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,900
Dad.

632
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,366
Learned to run away from marriage.

633
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,433
And even懂得d how to steal in public.

634
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:33,366
Leaving aside the matter of running away from marriage for now.

635
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,266
I've only been gone for a few days.

636
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,966
You've actually become so audacious.

637
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,666
To provoke the Marquis of Dongwu's estate.

638
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:39,933
You've got a death wish, you.

639
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:41,133
Today

640
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,300
I need to discipline you properly

641
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,600
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll turn the world upside down in the future

642
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,900
Li Laowu

643
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:50,766
Go ahead, hit me

644
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:52,733
Go ahead, hit me

645
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,400
All of you, leave us

646
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,300
Yes

647
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,800
How could I bear to hit you, my child

648
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:07,700
But with that dog-like temper of yours

649
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:09,133
Look

650
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:09,933
See how frightened they are

651
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,533
Everything I do is for your own good

652
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,633
If anything were to happen to you in the future

653
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,366
How would I

654
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:23,833
Go on living

655
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:26,800
Father

656
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,633
I've told you many times

657
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:30,366
I don't want to get married

658
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,400
In the future, I still want to enter Qiankun Alley

659
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,633
And become your right-hand man

660
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:36,033
I've also told you many times

661
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,166
Qiankun Alley

662
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,866
Has its own ways and purposes

663
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,166
Do not bring this up again in the future

664
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:43,733
Dad.

665
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,766
And also.

666
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,466
In the future, matters of the East Martial侯侯 Residence.

667
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:51,666
You are not to interfere.

668
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:52,666
Why.

669
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:56,000
Those heirs are not so simple.

670
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,033
From now on.

671
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,333
You should spend less time mixing with them.

672
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:01,300
Silly girl.

673
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,233
How is it.

674
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,466
It's Young Master Ning.

675
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:29,600
Is he still breathing.

676
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:30,566
Still alive.

677
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:31,533
Take him away.

678
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,900
This kid really has nine lives.

679
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,466
The master will surely be satisfied.
