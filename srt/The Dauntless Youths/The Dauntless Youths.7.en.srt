1
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:38,466
Xiao Ding

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,666
Did you find out?

3
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:41,700
No

4
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,266
They said he's missing

5
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:44,600
Missing

6
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:45,100
Mm-hmm

7
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:46,566
Last seen

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,666
At the slave market

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,500
We met again

10
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,700
That slave trader at the time

11
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,700
I heard that slave trader

12
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,000
Kept chasing and beating that little slave

13
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
After walking out of the alley

14
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,233
That little slave vanished without a trace

15
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:57,466
Later

16
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:59,000
That slave trader also searched for a long time

17
00:01:59,033 --> 00:01:59,966
But simply couldn't find him

18
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,366
You tell me, in broad daylight

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
Could he just disappear into thin air?

20
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,533
Vanish into thin air

21
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:21,500
Brother E

22
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,300
Could you do me the honor?

23
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:25,900
It's nothing

24
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:27,966
Taking you somewhere

25
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:29,200
Let's go, back to pack up

26
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,433
You know me

27
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,566
I don't want to owe you

28
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:44,566
Brother Jiang

29
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,400
I don't want

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
To owe you

31
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,166
Brother Jiang, why did you bring me here?

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,700
What

33
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,000
Brother E

34
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,500
Haven't even been to the slave market?

35
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:24,666
I've been to one in the southern capital

36
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,733
Doesn't compare to Donglu in scale

37
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:27,800
Of course

38
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,300
Donglu's custom of keeping slaves

39
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,366
Is second only to the capital

40
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,500
-Keep moving -These children

41
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,200
Also from good families

42
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,166
The unpredictability of life

43
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:39,366
Reduced to slavery

44
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,066
Keep moving

45
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,433
So young

46
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:46,933
Truly pitiful

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,733
Some children

48
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,233
Are bought by proper buyers

49
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,533
If the master is kind

50
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:54,933
They get enough to eat and wear

51
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,133
But some children

52
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,033
Aren't so lucky

53
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,466
Brother E, there's something you don't know.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,266
Some unscrupulous slave traders

55
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,600
specialize in buying good-looking children.

56
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,133
They raise them until their teens

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,433
and sell them to noble families with particular tastes.

58
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:12,966
These children suffer all kinds of abuse,

59
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,800
enduring a fate worse than death.

60
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,133
There are also clever children

61
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:17,933
who learn right from wrong

62
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,633
and sense when things take a bad turn.

63
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,266
Some try to escape,

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,966
but most

65
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,333
are caught and brought back,

66
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:24,966
only to be severely beaten.

67
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,066
Young Master Jiang,

68
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,466
you've arrived.

69
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,200
Take a look at these newly arrived slaves—

70
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,033
see if any catch your eye.

71
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,400
Let me have a look.

72
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:41,166
There are

73
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,866
I need you to remember one thing.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
You have been practicing for many days here,

75
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,533
imitating my demeanor, voice,

76
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:49,666
and behavior.

77
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,033
The servants can hardly tell us apart

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,233
Others

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
would find it even harder to notice

80
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,600
If I go in your stead

81
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,366
and if

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,200
I am recognized

83
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,766
remember not to expose your identity

84
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:06,700
Otherwise

85
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,566
neither of us can escape calamity

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,433
Brother E

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,966
What's wrong

88
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:20,600
You look so pale

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,100
Are you perhaps unwell

90
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,600
It is I

91
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:27,833
who am poorly informed

92
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,233
Seeing such a situation

93
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,566
I truly cannot bear it

94
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,066
Snake ointment

95
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,066
Snake ointment for sale

96
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:44,666
This is snake ointment

97
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,433
After boiling and air-drying

98
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,400
it turns crimson

99
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,300
So by its color and scent

100
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,900
we can track that person's escape route

101
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,100
Elder Li

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
How long have you been in the timber business

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,333
With Nasty

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,533
My elder brother said

105
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,766
Old Li has been doing timber business with the south

106
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,500
Did you know

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,833
anything about it

108
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,000
The affairs within the residence

109
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,733
are mostly handled by His Lordship's trusted aides

110
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,200
I have been ill for a long time

111
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,500
and know very little

112
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,400
I see

113
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,466
By the way

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,800
do you still remember what I

115
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,900
told you before

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,833
I picked up a little slave

117
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:37,300
who later ran away

118
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,633
This is the place where I first saw him

119
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:43,200
Revisiting the old place

120
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:44,800
I wanted to see

121
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,033
if there was a chance

122
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,866
to meet him again

123
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,533
You dog

124
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,300
How dare you hide

125
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,233
You dog, I’ll beat you to death

126
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,233
I told you not to hide

127
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,100
Hide again

128
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,433
See if I don’t kill you today

129
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:08,866
I'll beat you to death

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,700
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

131
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,333
Let go, let go

132
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:14,900
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,333
It's you again

134
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,233
Born to be a lowly slave

135
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,800
Who let you have such bad luck, kid

136
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,800
Acting recklessly every time

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,133
And yet I manage to catch you every time

138
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,000
Last time

139
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,166
It was from this guy's hands

140
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,433
That I rescued that little slave

141
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,333
Last time

142
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,200
I already taught him a lesson

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,700
Never expected this kid

144
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,000
Still shows no remorse

145
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,100
Committing violence in public

146
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,300
I know

147
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,133
I know, be gentle

148
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:44,933
Tell me

149
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,566
How should I deal with him

150
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,066
This gentleman

151
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,366
Is the Prince from the Southern Capital

152
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,700
An honored guest of our Eastern Lu

153
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,733
You actually dared to disturb our guest

154
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:02,800
Then let the guest decide

155
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,000
how to punish me

156
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,566
This humble one was wrong

157
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:08,600
Please spare this humble one

158
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,066
I'll restrain myself more in the future

159
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,166
And may this

160
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:18,633
this

161
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,466
why

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,333
what are you staring at

163
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:25,466
Young Master Jiang

164
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,366
this noble young master

165
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:28,566
looks somewhat familiar

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,733
familiar

167
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:51,700
have you been to the slave market in the southern capital

168
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,133
Yes, I have been there

169
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,966
This humble one travels all around and often goes there

170
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,233
That must be it

171
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,500
Perhaps we crossed paths there

172
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,266
I remember now

173
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,633
I remember now

174
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,833
It was back in the southern capital

175
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,500
that I saw you

176
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,833
Look at my poor memory

177
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,033
Upon closer look

178
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,866
This humble heir also thinks

179
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:17,800
you look somewhat familiar

180
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,066
Young Master Jiang

181
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,000
I still have business to attend to

182
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,033
I must take my leave now

183
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:29,966
Excuse me

184
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,433
Get up, get up now

185
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:32,433
Go

186
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,233
Move

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,866
Stop right there

188
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,400
Miss, stop running

189
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,366
Stop chasing me

190
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Miss

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,266
I won't marry

192
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,066
- Miss - Stop

193
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,800
Miss

194
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,600
Come down quickly

195
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,066
Come down quickly, miss

196
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,233
It's dangerous, miss

197
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,333
Stop chasing me

198
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,066
Miss, please come down quickly, miss

199
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:02,466
Dangerous

200
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:02,800
Don't come any closer

201
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,266
If you take another step, I'll jump

202
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:05,200
But

203
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:06,600
Hurry up and come down

204
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,966
Have you not embarrassed yourself enough?

205
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,166
This scene

206
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:11,566
It feels like yesterday repeating itself

207
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,866
It seems Miss Asi

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,900
is being forced into marriage again

209
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,233
You heartless father.

210
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,133
Time and again you force me

211
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,233
to marry some inexplicable man

212
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,166
You're not even ashamed

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,966
Why should I be afraid

214
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,033
I'm heartless?

215
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,066
The ones I found for you

216
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,166
are all from noble families

217
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
well-off households

218
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,933
How are they inexplicable?

219
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,800
You picked them, you go marry them

220
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll only marry who I choose

221
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:32,800
You, an inexperienced

222
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,700
young girl

223
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,366
what good choices can you make?

224
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,866
For your lifelong affair

225
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,066
your father

226
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,166
I've offended all the matchmakers in Eastern Lu

227
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,100
Come now

228
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,066
Tie up the young lady

229
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,000
and escort her back to the manor

230
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,933
You dare!

231
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,500
You want me to marry right now, is that it?

232
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,366
Fine

233
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,333
I'll marry

234
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,233
Who dares to marry this young lady

235
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,100
All of you, come out

236
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:52,566
Dare to marry me

237
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:53,100
Come out

238
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,233
Come on

239
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,100
I’ve never seen such a fierce young lady

240
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,266
How is it you?

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,266
You’ve got some skills

242
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:14,766
How did you end up here?

243
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,033
That

244
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:18,700
It’s all a misunderstanding

245
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,733
You all carry on with your business

246
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,166
Farewell, farewell, farewell

247
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:23,566
Halt

248
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,433
They’re the ones

249
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:32,000
This is absurd

250
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:33,666
How can one woman serve two husbands?

251
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,000
What are you standing around for?

252
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,100
Tie the young lady up

253
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:36,766
Take her back to the manor

254
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:37,233
Yes

255
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,466
Hold on, hold on, hold on

256
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,300
Don’t be in such a hurry

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,066
Elder Li

258
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,166
We’re all one family

259
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,233
Calm down

260
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:48,766
Who’s one family with you?

261
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:51,700
Who knows

262
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:53,233
Since we’re all here already

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,900
You pick one.

264
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,266
Flippant words.

265
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:56,900
Shameless.

266
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,700
How are you fit to be Eastern Lu's Crown Prince?

267
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,066
Jiang Wen Huan.

268
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,300
That bastard Crown Prince.

269
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,466
Who else could it be but him?

270
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:05,600
What a pity.

271
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,466
All the careful nurturing by the eldest young master Jiang.

272
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:08,233
Indeed.

273
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,133
I am E Shun from the Marquis of Nanbo's residence, a junior.

274
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,133
I pay my respects to Elder Li.

275
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,033
I should not be discussing right and wrong with a senior.

276
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,800
But given the current situation,

277
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,133
I have a few heartfelt words.

278
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,966
I hope Elder Li will lend an ear to them, even if just casually.

279
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,966
Looking at this Southern Crown Prince,

280
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,733
he seems like someone who understands etiquette.

281
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:33,633
Please speak.

282
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,966
Although I, a junior, and Lady Asi

283
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,100
have only met a few times,

284
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
I know that her martial arts are exceptional,

285
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,166
her strategies are numerous,

286
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:42,666
and her beauty is unparalleled.

287
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:43,866
Grace and charm in every glance.

288
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,600
Even more rare is a heroic spirit.

289
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,966
That even men find hard to match.

290
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,000
It shows.

291
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,100
That Elder Li's nurturing of Miss Asu.

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,633
Must have been wholehearted.

293
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,700
Giving his all.

294
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,466
One can imagine Elder Li repeatedly.

295
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,766
Selecting husbands for Miss Asu.

296
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:59,800
Surely all were worthy and good matches.

297
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,766
As the saying goes, parents who love their children.

298
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,033
Plan for their future.

299
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,400
But Miss Asu repeatedly fled from marriage.

300
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,333
It must not be that she is ungrateful.

301
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:09,200
But rather.

302
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
She refuses to be confined to a small room.

303
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,366
Wishing to emulate Leizu and Fu Zi.

304
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,700
Such heroic women.

305
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,033
To carve out her own grand future.

306
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,966
So a woman like Miss Asu.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,933
Of such caliber.

308
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,433
How could an ordinary man be worthy of her?

309
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:26,700
As the heir said.

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,533
I

311
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,200
What should I do

312
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,000
Miss Asi is no ordinary woman

313
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:33,966
So how can we treat her with ordinary rules

314
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,166
Why don't the two of you discuss it at length

315
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,166
Let Miss Asi

316
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,766
Neither lose her lofty aspirations

317
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:40,366
Nor fail to find a kindred spirit

318
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,500
To walk hand in hand through this life

319
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,600
Wouldn't that be a perfect solution for both

320
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,066
Well said

321
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,800
What a fine notion of a kindred spirit

322
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,100
May I ask, young master

323
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,400
Then where should my Asi go to find

324
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,666
Such a kindred spirit

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,733
What a coincidence

326
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,700
Recently at the heir camp

327
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,266
They are holding the heir assessments

328
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,700
At that time

329
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,966
All the young masters will surely showcase their talents

330
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,233
With exceptional grace and prowess

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,466
Old Li might as well go take a look then

332
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:14,266
The heir camp

333
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,266
Very well

334
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,200
They are all heirs of the feudal lords

335
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,800
And barely worthy
of my family's A-Si.

336
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:21,766
Good

337
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,900
I, the old man, will soon
depart for the Crown Prince's camp.

338
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,600
Choosing a husband for Asi

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Father

340
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:30,566
Master

341
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,033
What about the young lady's marriage proposal

342
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,433
Is it still happening or not

343
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,066
Happen? What do you mean happen?

344
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,600
Quickly bring her back to the residence

345
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,066
Remove all that messy stuff on her head

346
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,500
It's irritating just to look at

347
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,633
Thank you

348
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,300
Father, wait for me

349
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,266
Disperse, disperse, disperse

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Well done, you rascal

351
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,166
Silver-tongued, aren't you?

352
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:03,800
Xiao Ding

353
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,200
Master

354
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,900
Where is he?

355
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,233
He's here, inside the room

356
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,900
I truly have never seen

357
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,366
that Southern Capital heir apparent

358
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:13,666
Since you haven't seen him

359
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,800
why did you lie

360
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,533
when you saw us?

361
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:18,966
Think carefully

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,700
Speak properly

363
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:20,900
I

364
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,100
Both of you are heir apparents

365
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,033
important figures

366
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,966
How could I afford to offend?

367
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,000
That person also said

368
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,866
We seem to have met in the Southern Capital

369
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:32,933
The steps were laid right before me

370
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,700
I couldn't refuse to step down

371
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,466
Otherwise, it would be too ungrateful

372
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,433
So

373
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:38,733
You were just trying to please

374
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:39,700
the Marquis of Nanbo's heir

375
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Then when you said he looked familiar back then

376
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,533
that was also fake

377
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,600
That's not the case

378
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,500
I truly felt like I had seen him before

379
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,533
But I just couldn't recall it

380
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,300
Truly have met

381
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:53,466
Truly have met

382
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:05,766
Heir E Shun

383
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,766
I've been searching for you for so long

384
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,133
Elder Li

385
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:13,300
This Elder Li

386
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,600
What is he looking for Brother E Shun for?

387
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,866
To recruit a son-in-law, of course

388
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,500
This old man is a rough fellow

389
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,600
not one to beat around the bush

390
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,166
If I have something to say, I'll say it directly

391
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:23,266
Please, go ahead

392
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,300
E State's Heir

393
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,866
How old is he

394
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,100
Is he married yet

395
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:31,700
It's like this

396
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,200
My girl

397
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,533
And the heir

398
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:35,733
Are about the same age

399
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:36,833
They already know each other

400
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,200
And she's quite fond of him

401
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:39,733
This

402
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,500
Is a match made in heaven

403
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,966
Elder Li

404
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,833
Heir, no need to worry

405
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,000
The dowry won't be an issue

406
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,133
Although I'm not from a noble family

407
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,133
In the Eastern Lu region

408
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,266
I am considered quite wealthy

409
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,300
In the future, if there are children

410
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,266
Including all food, clothing, housing, and expenses

411
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,633
Will all be taken care of by me, their grandfather

412
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:03,633
Elder Li

413
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,133
I understand what you mean

414
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:06,700
But right now

415
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:07,966
I am in the heir's camp

416
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,033
Not a free man

417
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,066
For one, the battlefield is dangerous

418
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,900
Blades and arrows have no eyes

419
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
Secondly, to serve the country

420
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,000
It's hard to attend to personal matters

421
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,033
A lifelong event

422
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,166
Should not be handled carelessly

423
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,133
Do not delay Miss Asi

424
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,566
That makes sense too

425
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:28,533
Alright

426
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,166
Since you cannot make the decision

427
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,666
Then

428
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,266
I will go speak with the Marquis of Nanbo

429
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,133
Just in time

430
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,900
After finishing the business here in a few days

431
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:40,266
I need to go to Nandu to restock

432
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:41,633
Visit the Marquis of Nanbo

433
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,900
And discuss this matter with him

434
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,566
I know you are young and shy

435
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,600
These matters

436
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,233
Leave them to us elders to handle

437
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,133
But, Elder Li

438
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,033
It's getting late

439
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,500
I must take my leave now

440
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:57,933
Your Highness

441
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,800
Think it over carefully

442
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,166
Elder Li

443
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,233
Elder Li

444
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:11,100
What is it

445
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,466
Have you made up your mind so quickly

446
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:15,766
No.

447
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:21,933
Elder Li.

448
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:24,766
Our Hou Mansion

449
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,233
and your timber business

450
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,700
when did it start operating?

451
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,033
Timber business

452
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,433
I have never done

453
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:35,366
timber business with Nanbo Hou Mansion

454
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:36,833
However

455
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,300
silk and spices

456
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,066
those we did have

457
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,033
Never once

458
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:41,866
had any timber-related business

459
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,166
This timber business

460
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,566
has always been an official trade

461
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,600
managed by Dongwu Hou Mansion

462
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:56,566
Our Qiankun Alley

463
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,800
would hardly

464
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:59,566
compete with official trade, would we?

465
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:01,833
Take care, Young Master.

466
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,333
So today

467
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,933
he was deliberately testing me

468
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,800
My elder brother said

469
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:22,800
Elder Li and the southern regions

470
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,033
have always been engaged in the timber business

471
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:25,866
I never expected

472
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,266
It's the Southern Capital.

473
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,300
Everyone,

474
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,066
The Crown Prince's Camp assessment competition is about to begin.

475
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:43,466
Our Donglu military camp

476
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,433
has, over the years,

477
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,333
always prepared a celebratory competition

478
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:47,766
to mark the occasion.

479
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,400
This year's competition

480
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,200
is not only

481
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,700
a test of everyone's abilities,

482
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,266
but also an opportunity to select

483
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,500
a group of elite soldiers and capable generals
from among you

484
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,333
to form a powerful team

485
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,700
to seek the elixir of immortality

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
for the King and for Mount Shang.

487
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,066
Master Gongsun,

488
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:06,866
wasn't it said that the sacred national treasure,

489
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:07,600
the elixir of immortality,

490
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,033
has been missing since the founding of the nation?

491
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,066
Where are we supposed to find it?

492
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,166
The elixir of immortality

493
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,433
is the sacred national treasure of Mount Shang,

494
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,400
lost for many years.

495
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,066
But the King has already divined its location.

496
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,966
The one who can find the elixir of immortality

497
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,866
is an extraordinary person

498
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,633
among you

499
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,600
Therefore

500
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,133
this great responsibility falls upon

501
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,233
the Crown Prince's camp

502
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,566
Your success or failure

503
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,866
does not only represent yourselves

504
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:32,466
but also represents

505
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,566
your motherlands behind you

506
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,766
This is a rare opportunity

507
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:38,200
Jiang Wenhuan

508
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,000
Chong Yibiao

509
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:40,300
Step forward

510
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:44,300
From today onward

511
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,633
each of you will lead a team

512
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,633
to participate in the assessment competition

513
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,266
We will surely live up to the King's expectations

514
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,333
Thank you for the King's great favor

515
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:57,466
As the saying goes

516
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,900
A hero deserves a fine steed

517
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,766
For tomorrow's equestrian assessment

518
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,833
how could my horse, Xin Jia's,

519
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,566
be just ordinary among the horses

520
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,233
Brother Xin Jia, don't just focus on—

521
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,233
This is my treasured steed now.

522
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,200
You bear the heavy responsibility of

523
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,033
checking the saddle and horseshoes.

524
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,466
Rest assured.

525
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,400
This horse—

526
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:16,766
Could you feed it a bit more?

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,166
Look how skinny it has become.

528
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,733
No problem, no problem.

529
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:19,366
Whose horse is this?

530
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,100
How come

531
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,366
it looks so listless?

532
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:24,333
Your horse looks quite unique.

533
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,666
Little cow-patterned one.

534
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:30,633
Whose horse is this?

535
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:31,533
Why is it out?

536
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:33,300
Get back inside.

537
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,833
What kind of shabby little horse is this?

538
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,700
So ugly.

539
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,633
Whoever owns a horse should keep an eye on it.

540
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:40,866
This is Brother Jiang's horse.

541
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,300
Yes.

542
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:44,266
This horse has a dragon-like head with bulging eyes,

543
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:45,300
a straight spine and a large belly—

544
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,100
now that’s what you call a fine horse.

545
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,600
Brother Eshun’s horse here,

546
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:50,700
not quite up to par.

547
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,300
Let me take a look.

548
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:52,600
This horse

549
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,533
This horse

550
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,500
Neck defect

551
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,366
The head lacks nobility and height

552
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,166
It really isn't very good

553
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,500
You didn't get him a better horse?

554
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
Brother E Shun said

555
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
He isn't skilled in horsemanship

556
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,733
No need to waste a good horse

557
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:06,166
I remember now

558
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,433
When I was in the south

559
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,366
I had long heard that Brother E Shun's equestrian skills

560
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:10,900
Were far inferior to his literary and martial talents

561
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,166
So dashing and heroic

562
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,066
That is true

563
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:16,766
After all, the way of horsemanship

564
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,466
Requires natural talent

565
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,833
Someone like me

566
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,033
Who is both skilled in riding

567
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,033
And understands horses

568
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:23,333
How many can there be?

569
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:25,500
How is the horse selection going?

570
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,900
Brother Jiang, you're here

571
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,566
Brother Jiang

572
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,000
We were just saying

573
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,233
Brother E Shun isn't good with horses

574
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,700
What should we do today?

575
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,000
You are not skilled in horsemanship

576
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,533
Originally, your horsemanship was clumsy

577
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,133
Now, frail and sickly

578
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,333
You are even more out of practice

579
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
That little slave back then

580
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,966
Indeed had good horsemanship

581
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:47,700
It seems

582
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,400
The answer can only be found on the racetrack

583
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,000
The first round of the assessment competition

584
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,533
Equestrian event

585
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,833
Begins now

586
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:16,666
First round of the competition

587
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,400
E Shun

588
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:19,700
Wang Yuanji

589
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,000
Charge, Brother Wang

590
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,833
Brother Wang must win

591
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:28,666
Charge

592
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,933
Charge, Brother Wang

593
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,000
Charge

594
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,933
Go, charge

595
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:32,566
Must win, charge

596
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,200
Charge, Brother Wang

597
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,066
Brother Wang must win

598
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,366
E Shun

599
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:43,800
The race begins

600
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,133
Hurry, hurry, hurry, Brother E Shun

601
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,066
Charge

602
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:01,233
Charge

603
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,266
Brother E Shun, hurry

604
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,533
This E Shun is really not skilled in horsemanship.

605
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,500
First round

606
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:11,833
Team Chong wins

607
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:13,800
Brother E Shun

608
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,133
Your horsemanship is lacking

609
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:16,966
I'll teach you later

610
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:19,133
Second match

611
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,133
Xin Jia

612
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,766
Su Yuanxiao

613
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:25,366
Wait for me to return victorious

614
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,233
Brother Xin will surely win

615
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:26,866
Brother Xin will surely win

616
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,066
Sure victory

617
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,433
Brother Xin Jia, charge

618
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,933
He's passing, he's passing

619
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:39,966
He's passing, he's passing

620
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,366
What a fast horse

621
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:44,300
Brother Xin Jia

622
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:45,833
Beautiful

623
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,133
Brother Xin, your horsemanship has improved

624
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:52,900
Their horsemanship is still far from good

625
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:55,633
They still need proper training

626
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:58,900
Tai Dian, charge

627
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,333
Chase them

628
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:08,633
Quick

629
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:09,500
Quick

630
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,233
Good

631
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,100
Both teams are tied in score

632
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,266
The next match will decide the winner

633
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,333
Chong Yibiao Jiang Wenhuàn

634
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,166
Representing the final evaluation of the two teams

635
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,366
-Brother Chong, charge!  -Brother Jiang, charge!

636
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:32,200
Brother Chong is from Libei, how could he possibly lose

637
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,633
Brother Jiang, outrun him

638
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:34,266
Charge! Brother Jiang

639
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:34,933
Take first place home

640
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:35,633
Brother Jiang

641
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,300
Bring back first place

642
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,433
Take first

643
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,866
Brother Chong has won a victory today

644
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,200
He is sure to take the top prize

645
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,733
Brother Jiang, charge!

646
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:43,866
Brother Jiang, charge!

647
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,166
Must win, must win

648
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,666
Brother Chong

649
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,833
Charge!

650
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,466
Charge!

651
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,466
Brother Chong must win

652
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:00,600
The race begins

653
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:05,566
Brother Jiang, charge!

654
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,133
Brother Chong, charge!

655
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,366
Brother Chong, Brother Chong

656
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,133
Brother Jiang, charge!

657
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,366
Charge!

658
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,300
The two are neck and neck

659
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:30,400
I never expected Brother Jiang's horsemanship

660
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,200
to be on par with Brother Chong's

661
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:33,666
Brother Yuanji

662
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:35,866
don't forget the bet we made at the stables

663
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:36,966
if we win

664
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,266
you'll have to wash our socks for a month

665
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,266
how stinky would that be

666
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,066
Brother Chong is the number one warrior of the grasslands

667
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:45,566
how could he possibly lose

668
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:46,966
come on, Brother Yuanji

669
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,600
look at Brother Jiang's posture

670
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:50,366
I think your Brother Chong

671
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,966
won't gain any advantage

672
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,666
the gap is too small

673
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:57,466
before reaching the finish line

674
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,766
there's no telling who will win or lose

675
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,166
it'll probably be decided in the final lap

676
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,966
the final lap

677
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,733
he passed, he passed, Brother Jiang passed him

678
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,433
Brother Jiang, charge!

679
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,133
Brother Chong

680
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,100
as long as Brother Jiang leads in the final lap

681
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:25,966
Victory is assured

682
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,233
We've won, we've won

683
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,600
Brother Jiang is about to cross the finish line

684
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:37,700
Brother Jiang is sure to win

685
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,833
Cannot lose

686
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,066
Brother Jiang

687
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,033
Brother Jiang

688
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,700
Brother Jiang

689
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,366
Brother Jiang

690
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:03,266
Your injury

691
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:03,933
I'm fine

692
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,066
How can you compete with such an injury?

693
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,833
Injured like this

694
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,533
If you fall again

695
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,500
It could be dangerous

696
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,333
But Brother Jiang refuses to admit defeat

697
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:17,100
He insists on competing

698
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,233
The gift

699
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,866
There's one more thing you must firmly remember

700
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,500
In horsemanship

701
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:33,266
You absolutely must not surpass Chong Yibiao

702
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,266
Once he sees through it

703
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,866
Both you and I will face eternal doom

704
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,766
This plan of substitution

705
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:45,566
Once it begins

706
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,766
There's no turning back

707
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:06,266
Wait

708
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:07,600
Brother Jiang

709
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:08,966
I'm here

710
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,066
What's E Shun doing

711
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,266
What's going on, what did he go do

712
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,666
Brother E Shun's horsemanship isn't great

713
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:20,700
Isn't this admitting defeat

714
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,200
Caught up, caught up

715
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
E Shun's horsemanship is actually this impressive

716
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,500
Didn't expect that

717
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,233
Only a little bit left

718
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:49,100
About to catch up immediately

719
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:51,366
Am I seeing this right

720
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:52,766
Brother E Shun is running so fast

721
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,333
Brother E Shun, charge

722
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,133
Could he really be that little slave

723
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,400
Team Jiang wins

724
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:33,533
Brother Jiang

725
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:34,233
Won

726
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,933
You've been leaving camp at night a lot recently

727
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,933
What have you been going out to do

728
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,266
Brother Chong

729
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:22,133
What could I possibly go out to do

730
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,100
It's just that Little Ding made some tasty treats

731
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,666
Just went out to grab a snack, that's all

732
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,100
Today at the racetrack

733
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,733
That kid

734
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:31,500
Impossible to win against me

735
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,633
You mean

736
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:37,266
E Moment

737
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,733
Kunwu Young Nobleman

738
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,466
Your actions today

739
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,300
That's really inappropriate!

740
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,133
Brother Jiang

741
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:54,466
I don't want to hide it from him

742
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:58,633
Could it be that the young master has
forgotten our household's crown prince?

743
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,566
Instructions for
you before departure?

744
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,533
Young Master Chong the Second has
quite a history with our house's heir.

745
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,100
Nowadays

746
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,633
I'm afraid Second Young Master Chong
has already seen through the loophole.

747
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,466
He must have started to suspect your identity

748
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:19,533
How is his horsemanship

749
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,133
No one understands better than I do

750
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:25,366
Brother Chong hasn't seen him for many years

751
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,266
It's not surprising

752
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,166
that his horsemanship has improved

753
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,266
Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses

754
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,200
Wanting to surpass oneself

755
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,400
is not something that can be done

756
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,633
just by saying it

757
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,500
What do you mean

758
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,533
by what Brother Chong is saying now

759
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,100
I thought you were a smart person

760
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,633
You should understand what I mean

761
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:56,800
In short

762
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,300
whether my suspicions are true or false

763
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,800
will be revealed once tested later

764
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:04,800
You mean

765
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,733
you're going to test him in tomorrow's combat tournament

766
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:09,366
I came to find you

767
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:11,400
to tell you

768
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,800
to stay out of this matter

769
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,300
If Second Young Master Chong tests you

770
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,166
Young Master, please remember the countermeasures

771
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:33,133
But

772
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,866
even if suspicions are temporarily dispelled

773
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,600
it is not a long-term solution

774
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:38,800
Young Master Kunwu

775
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:39,700
must still

776
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,333
keep some distance from Heir Jiang

777
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,633
This is for your own good

778
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:45,366
and for his as well

779
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,566
Do not forget

780
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:52,766
after all

781
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:53,933
you and he

782
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,200
are not the same kind of people

783
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:00,900
Uncle Bing's words today

784
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,700
I will keep them in mind

785
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,133
Tao Yingzhong drops the wooden stake

786
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,666
Wang Yuanji wins

787
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,700
Combat assessment match

788
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,133
Jiang Chong

789
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,700
The two teams are tied

790
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:39,066
Decisive round

791
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,300
Chong Yibiao

792
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,333
E Shun

793
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,933
Stutterer

794
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:09,000
Your horsemanship has improved quite a bit

795
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,200
You flatter me

796
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,166
It seems the Wild Goose Crosses Cold Pond technique I taught you

797
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,700
You have mastered it thoroughly.

798
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:22,266
Brother Chong, I concede.

799
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:24,566
What a pity.

800
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,200
The move "Wild Geese Crossing the Cold Pond"

801
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,266
I never taught you.

802
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:41,700
How?

803
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:42,966
Not dodging this time?

804
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:44,166
Dodge?

805
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:46,666
Would dodging even work?

806
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:47,800
Fine.

807
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,466
Then I'll fight properly this time.

808
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Him winning yesterday

809
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,033
Was just his luck.

810
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,700
Today might not be the same.

811
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,466
Brother Yuanji,

812
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,700
Could you not speak so absolutely?

813
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:05,666
Didn't you make enough of a fool of yourself yesterday?

814
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,166
I see this stubborn mule

815
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,733
Seems a bit unsettled today.

816
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:19,300
Are you saying

817
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,833
You'll test him in tomorrow's martial arts tournament?

818
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,233
I once taught him to gallop across the grasslands,

819
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,833
And he once showed me

820
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:25,966
A martial arts manual.

821
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,166
Tomorrow

822
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,866
I deliberately revealed this technique

823
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:30,133
to let him attack

824
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,300
If he understands

825
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,100
then it should be fine

826
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,300
But

827
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,266
if he doesn't understand

828
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,233
won

829
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,100
Brother Yuanji

830
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:52,933
I've said it all

831
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:54,433
Don't speak too absolutely

832
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:54,700
right

833
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,166
How is this possible

834
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:57,800
Today's combat competition

835
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,000
the winner is

836
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:01,100
Team Jiang Wenhuan

837
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:02,800
won

838
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,633
won won

839
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,100
Stop

840
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,166
Who are you

841
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,700
You're not him

842
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,600
Who exactly are you
