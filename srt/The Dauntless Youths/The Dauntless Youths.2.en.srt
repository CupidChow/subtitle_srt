1
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,466
Prince Kunwu

2
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,333
Ahead lies the boundary stele of Donglu City

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,233
Halt the carriage

4
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:03,033
Prince Kunwu

5
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:03,700
After entering the city

6
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,866
You must remember your identity

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,500
From now on

8
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,366
You are the Hereditary Prince of the Nanbo Marquis Estate

9
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:11,600
E Shun

10
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,800
I wish to discuss a deal with you

11
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,066
What deal?

12
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,200
Ten days from now

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
I need you to campaign on my behalf

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,033
Head to Donglu City

15
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,466
For beast combat

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,233
You are ill

17
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,933
I too once rode horses and drew bows

18
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,233
Full of vigor and vitality

19
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,300
But now

20
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,366
My bones are as frail as autumn, of little use anymore

21
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,466
The southern capital is prosperous

22
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,566
Content to secure a corner of the land

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,633
If the Hereditary Prince fails

24
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,033
The entire southern border

25
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,066
Will surely divide and devour the southern capital

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,466
That is why I risked seeking you out

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,366
To employ this scheme of passing off the false as genuine

28
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:10,700
Why should I help you?

29
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,533
An exchange made with life

30
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,766
I will naturally repay you with a life

31
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:17,666
Did you know

32
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,066
Your younger sister is still alive

33
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:22,033
What did you say?

34
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,266
Your younger sister

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,066
Is likely

36
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,133
Your only family left in this world

37
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,066
You have clung to life all these years

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,166
Was it not to return to your homeland

39
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,166
And see your loved ones again?

40
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:39,833
What exactly

41
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:42,900
Do you know?

42
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,166
What I know

43
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,333
You must already understand in your heart

44
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,533
So in this world

45
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,100
Only I can help you

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,666
And you

47
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,433
Can only trust me

48
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:21,866
Enter the city

49
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,900
The Hereditary Prince enters the city

50
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,300
Make way, all idlers

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,500
Prince Chong

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,600
It is my fault

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
I bumped into your carriage

54
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:47,766
This is a small token of my sincerity

55
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,333
Please do me the honor of accepting it

56
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:58,866
Who is this person

57
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,233
Chong Yibiao

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,666
He is the number one warrior of our northern grasslands

59
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,233
The second son of the Northern Bo Marquis

60
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,733
The son of the Northern Bo Marquis

61
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:06,966
Young Master Chong

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,733
It was my fault

63
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,666
Please honor me by accepting it

64
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,633
Young Master Ning

65
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,666
You really are stubborn

66
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,733
I’ve watched you apologizing here for a long time

67
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,766
What about the one inside

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,833
Yet he pays no attention

69
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:22,966
Haven’t you considered

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,366
What if he’s deaf

71
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:25,900
Who is this

72
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:26,466
Stop talking

73
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:27,666
So unafraid of death

74
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,433
Even if he isn’t deaf

75
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,300
He’s just a son born of a concubine

76
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,266
The second son

77
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,566
What, looking for a fight

78
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,600
What did you just say

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,100
I

80
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:00,833
I

81
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,866
I told you to say it again

82
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,533
I— I was wrong

83
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,666
You're talking nonsense

84
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,400
Pulling a long face like that, you think I'm really
scared of you?

85
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:25,400
Young master

86
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,433
Thank you for your help just now, young master

87
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,266
I am Ning Ziyu from Ningzhou

88
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,100
May I ask your name, young master?

89
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,000
No need for formalities

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,733
I am xin jia

91
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:33,466
I come from Xichuan

92
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,566
So it's Young Master Xin Jia from Xichuan

93
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:36,333
I am honored to meet you

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me tell you

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I, Xin Jia, in my daily life

96
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,500
what I despise the most are those

97
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,533
who, just because they have a bit of skill,

98
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,733
look down on others like dogs eyeing humans

99
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,766
Today can't really be considered helping you out

100
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:44,866
Just venting some anger, that's all

101
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,900
Young Master Xin Jia

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,833
Meeting by chance is fate.

103
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,466
Today, you chivalrously helped me.

104
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,400
I must invite you, young master,

105
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,366
to treat you to a fine meal with good wine.

106
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,766
Keep it.

107
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:54,833
I have it here.

108
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:55,500
Let's go.

109
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:56,633
Alright.

110
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,266
What fun places are there in Eastern Lu?

111
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,233
I am also new to Eastern Lu.

112
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,466
I don't know any good spots yet.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,233
Fine, let's sit here then.

114
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:22,666
Let me tell you,

115
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,966
today's meal must be on...

116
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,433
I...

117
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,900
Never mind, I'll treat.

118
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,766
Innkeeper, the bill.

119
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:32,566
Right away.

120
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:33,866
Isn't that my money pouch?

121
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,566
Stop her!

122
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:40,533
Trying to run?

123
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,666
A bride not marrying but becoming a thief.

124
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,500
When did Eastern Lu's morals decline to this extent?

125
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,666
Brother Jiang.

126
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,533
Let me see which one...

127
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,633
It's a young lady.

128
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,333
Still a bride

129
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:55,766
Did it hurt

130
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,800
Brother Jiang, you should be gentle with her

131
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,033
Whose side are you on

132
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:04,900
Don't run

133
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,833
A few lousy coins

134
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,833
Is it worth it

135
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,100
Where is everyone

136
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,833
Carriage

137
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,066
Don't make a sound

138
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,600
Or I'll cut you down

139
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:55,266
Where is everyone

140
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,333
Ran pretty fast

141
00:08:59,333 --> 00:08:59,833
Miss

142
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:00,733
This

143
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,133
Can't kill anyone

144
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,466
Better give it back to me

145
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,700
Want this, huh

146
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,166
Lure away that heir who's dressed like a gentleman but behaves like a dog

147
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:15,266
Then I'll return it to you

148
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,800
Why is it him

149
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,566
Is anyone in the carriage

150
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,566
Have you seen a little thief disguised as a bride

151
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:29,266
Passing by here

152
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,400
But I still have something

153
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:37,800
To give to someone

154
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,866
It's the heir of Donglu City

155
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,433
Jiang Wenhuàn?

156
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,800
But I must remind you

157
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,833
The heir of Donglu City

158
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,633
is astute and clever.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,733
Be sure not to expose your identity.

160
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,066
Otherwise,

161
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,533
both you and I will be doomed.

162
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,433
I am the heir of Nanbo Marquis,

163
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:27,800
E Shun.

164
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,766
Have you seen

165
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,333
— Greetings, Young Master Jiang.

166
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,000
You...

167
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:37,100
know me?

168
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:45,966
Young Master Jiang

169
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,900
wears a coiling dragon emblem,

170
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,233
with an impressive demeanor,

171
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,166
and an extraordinary presence.

172
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,633
Surely,

173
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,233
you must be the heir of Dongwu Marquis,

174
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:53,900
Jiang Wenhuàn.

175
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,300
You truly are observant.

176
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,266
By the way,

177
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:00,000
I am pursuing

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
a petty thief disguised as a bride.

179
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,900
Have you seen any suspicious individuals?

180
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:04,066
Yes.

181
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:06,700
Where did they go?

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,666
He went that way

183
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:12,966
Thank you

184
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,100
Actually

185
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,066
Chasing after a petty thief isn't urgent

186
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,266
Since Young Master E Shun has come from afar

187
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,666
I should fulfill my duty as a host

188
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,100
How about

189
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,466
I personally escort you to the post station

190
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,700
But inside the carriage

191
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,000
it seems there is someone accompanying Young Master
E Shun

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,566
I wonder

193
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,566
if there is a seat for me, Jiang

194
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:07,633
Young Master Jiang

195
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,800
I am traveling alone to Eastern Lu

196
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:10,900
Inside the carriage

197
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,233
is merely a stray cat I just rescued

198
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,600
Young Master E Shun, how kind-hearted indeed

199
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:23,866
But such beasts are hard to tame

200
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:24,766
Be careful that after saving it

201
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,533
you end up getting hurt by it instead

202
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,466
Since I stepped in to save it

203
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,233
I will certainly take responsibility to the end

204
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,033
Moreover

205
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
stray cats are perceptive by nature

206
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,566
Will repay kindness with gratitude

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,733
Alright

208
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,433
Then I ask Young Master E'Shun

209
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,200
To take care of yourself

210
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,500
Young Master E'Shun

211
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,433
Why must you be so persistent

212
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,866
When one promises something to another

213
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,533
One should do everything in their power

214
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:15,466
Fine, fine

215
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,266
Stop pestering me endlessly

216
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,000
It's just stealing your money pouch

217
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,666
Here, take it back

218
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,533
You stole something and still want to leave

219
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,666
I've already returned everything to you

220
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,466
What right do you have to arrest me

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,033
Looking at you, dressed in gold and silver

222
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:32,933
I'm afraid those are stolen too

223
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,366
Even stealing from a bride

224
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,800
Be careful not to ruin your luck in the future

225
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,300
You

226
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,733
Meddling in others' business

227
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,133
Don't run

228
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,533
Lend me your cloth bag for a moment

229
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,466
That's not a cloth bag

230
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,033
This bride is really having a rough time

231
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:09,500
Sorry about that

232
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,700
The heir of the Dongwu Marquis Estate, Jiang Wenhuàn,
is it?

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,833
Alright.

234
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,733
You just wait.

235
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,033
Let me wipe that for you.

236
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:16,900
No need.

237
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,933
Young Master E Shun has just arrived in Donglu.

238
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:30,633
I hope you’ll pardon the impropriety.

239
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,233
Young Master Jiang is upholding justice.

240
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,600
It is I who have caused Young Master Jiang trouble.

241
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:36,566
A hero saving a beauty, I see.

242
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:37,466
I understand, I understand.

243
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,666
If that is the case,

244
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,200
then I shall take my leave first.

245
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,266
There is one more thing I wish to ask you, young master.

246
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,966
What is it?

247
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,433
The two of us—

248
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,666
have we met before?

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
I have long been plagued by illness

250
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,500
and have not ventured far from home for quite some time.

251
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,966
Then I must have misremembered, misremembered.

252
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:04,100
In that case, I shall take my leave.

253
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,766
Young master.

254
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,066
Everything has been settled.

255
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,166
Return to the post station as soon as possible.

256
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,833
Prepare for tonight’s banquet.

257
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,766
Wait

258
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,500
Sorry, Young Master Jiang

259
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,633
This petty thief

260
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,633
Wearing gold and silver yet still stealing things

261
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,566
Truly baffling

262
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,233
Forget it

263
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,733
Better focus on the real task

264
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:50,500
Where are my things

265
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,033
Where is that half copper strip

266
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,500
Jiang Wen Huan, the heir of the East Martial Marquis Estate, right

267
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,266
I'll wipe it for you

268
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,866
No need

269
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:01,700
Could it have been

270
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,133
Swiped by that female thief

271
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,566
Take this

272
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,433
See how much it's worth

273
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,233
Trying to fob me off like a beggar

274
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,766
Just a broken copper strip

275
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:22,266
Think it's too little

276
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,466
You can refuse it

277
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:26,833
I'll give you one more chance

278
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:27,900
Think again

279
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,300
May I ask which hero you are

280
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:36,900
Miss

281
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,966
What is the most important thing in doing business

282
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,066
Is integrity

283
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,700
What is the most important thing in Qiankun Alley?

284
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:46,533
It's fairness.

285
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,233
Don't you dare take advantage of my father's absence

286
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,133
to start cheating and swindling,

287
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,500
tarnishing my Li family's reputation,

288
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,966
and making our peers look down on us.

289
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,066
Young Mistress,

290
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,200
our Qiankun Alley is an underground black market.

291
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,033
So what if it's a black market?

292
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,700
Even thieves have honor.

293
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,700
Do you understand?

294
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,866
Young Mistress, you've been missing for days

295
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:08,866
since the day you ran away from the marriage.

296
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,300
Now you suddenly show up here.

297
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:10,800
Is it for—

298
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,833
Don’t tell my father I was here.

299
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,966
Yes, Young Mistress.

300
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:15,966
You may leave.

301
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:27,866
Help me look into this.

302
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,033
This is—

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,733
something belonging to Jiang Wanhuan, the son of the Eastern Martial Marquis.

304
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:33,333
I’m afraid—

305
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,566
Afraid of what?

306
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:36,200
Don’t say it’s just a son of a marquis—

307
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,400
even his father—

308
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,500
Even here, you have to give our Li Family some respect.

309
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,866
Take a look quickly.

310
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,400
What on earth could Jiang Wanhuan treasure so much?

311
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,000
This thing is only half of it.

312
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,300
This pattern on it—

313
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,066
I happened to see it just a few days ago.

314
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,500
Where did you see it?

315
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,966
Young lady, you might not know this, but

316
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:57,233
recently, someone

317
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:58,533
smuggled a batch of goods from the Guifang Kingdom

318
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,200
to Qiankun Alley.

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,166
Among them was a black box

320
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,433
with a similar pattern on it.

321
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,800
I heard

322
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,933
they deliberately waited until the dead of night

323
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,533
to transport it into the city.

324
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,533
The copper carving on the box

325
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,466
is exactly the same as that copper strip.

326
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,800
You're something, Jiang Wanhuan.

327
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,433
I knew it!

328
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,666
Well-mannered on the surface, yet up to no good.

329
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,666
Where is that thing now?

330
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,500
Still in the alley

331
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,633
Heaven really helps
this young lady!

332
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,633
Go check quickly

333
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,100
Inside the box printed
with this pattern"

334
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,433
What exactly is installed inside

335
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,200
What do you mean "what"

336
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:43,433
And also

337
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,133
Don't you dare tell my father

338
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,466
Otherwise I'll

339
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,833
I understand

340
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:50,933
I will definitely do as you say

341
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,666
Accusing me of stealing chickens and dogs

342
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,833
I really want to see how you, the son of the Eastern Martial Marquis

343
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,100
are involved with the smuggled goods

344
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,133
from the Guifang Kingdom

345
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,233
It looks like this, right

346
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,266
It's all because of that female thief

347
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:25,633
Master

348
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,033
The night banquet to welcome the sons from various regions

349
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:27,900
is about to begin

350
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
The eldest young master asks you to change into
court attire

351
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,666
and host tonight's banquet

352
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm not going

353
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:33,366
Let my elder brother go himself

354
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,500
If you don't go, young master

355
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,800
I won't be able to account for it

356
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,800
Please just change into it

357
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,233
Young master, you

358
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,266
Xiao Ding

359
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,333
Look at you

360
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:50,466
Being careless all day long

361
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,633
This really isn't my fault

362
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,666
It seems I can only report back to Big Brother

363
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,333
This robe can't be worn anymore

364
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,566
Wearing a dirty robe to host the banquet

365
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,866
Wouldn't that be too improper?

366
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,466
So

367
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,233
You now have a reason

368
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,066
To explain things to Big Brother, right?

369
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,033
Master

370
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,866
But there is another set of court robes

371
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:16,133
Also

372
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
Gone, gone, gone

373
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,133
Tonight, a banquet is held in my city of Donglu

374
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,533
To express our heartfelt sentiments

375
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,233
In welcoming you young masters who have
come from afar

376
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,700
We hope that all of you

377
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,666
At tomorrow's War God Ceremony beast-fighting arena

378
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,133
Will behead the beasts

379
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Courageously take the top honors

380
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,033
And seize

381
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,700
The title of Gluttonous War God

382
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,933
Thank you, General Panchi

383
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,300
We will certainly live up to expectations

384
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,800
Battle in the beast arena

385
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,266
Tonight's night banquet

386
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:02,300
Everyone may choose their own opponents for sparring

387
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:04,233
To warm up for tomorrow's beast-fighting competition

388
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,200
It can also add to the excitement of tonight's banquet

389
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:11,600
Let's begin

390
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,600
Speaking of fighting competitions

391
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,033
Our Young Master E Shun from the Southern Capital

392
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,166
Is among the very best

393
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,700
Is that so

394
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
You mean the only son of the Marquis of Nanbo

395
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,666
E Shun

396
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,366
I have also heard of him

397
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
Why hasn't the heir of the Marquis of Nanbo arrived yet?

398
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,233
On such an important occasion

399
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,333
It's inappropriate for him to be the only one late

400
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,866
Currently, the Marquis of Nanbo is highly favored in the capital

401
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,366
And extremely wealthy

402
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,933
Naturally, the heir of the Marquis of Nanbo

403
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,800
Is a bit arrogant

404
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,933
Good

405
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:49,600
He's here, he's here

406
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
I've been waiting for you for a long time

407
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,500
Tonight's match

408
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:51,766
I choose him

409
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:05,866
E Shun

410
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,033
That donkey-face really knows how to pick his opponents

411
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,466
I think tonight

412
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,066
The Prince of Nanbo

413
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:26,966
is in trouble

414
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,133
Little stutterer

415
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,933
You actually dare to come up here

416
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,700
Since you're new to Donglu

417
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,800
There's bound to be someone who gives you a hard time

418
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,700
This person and I

419
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,366
have some history from our youth

420
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,500
Be careful to avoid him

421
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:42,433
Just show weakness

422
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,200
But

423
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,533
what if it's unavoidable?

424
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,866
That donkey-face is really going all out with his dark tricks

425
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:02,900
This isn't a competition at all

426
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,333
This is clearly an attempt to kill him

427
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:12,666
Step in

428
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,833
This

429
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,400
These two actually knew each other before

430
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,233
Even if they knew each other, it shouldn't be like this

431
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:19,866
Could it be that

432
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:20,800
the Prince of Nanbo

433
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,866
Snatch this donkey-faced beauty away from me.

434
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,233
The enmity between these two runs deep.

435
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,033
So ruthless in their actions.

436
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,333
Why aren't you making a move?

437
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Looking down on me?

438
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,533
Brother Chong's martial arts skills are unparalleled.

439
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:41,800
Whether you make a move or not.

440
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,333
What difference does it make?

441
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,066
Fine.

442
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,233
If this continues, someone will be beaten to death.

443
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,033
Just having some fun.

444
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,266
Brother Chong, why take it so seriously?

445
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:04,966
Let go of me.

446
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,700
Everyone, stop this at once.

447
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,066
This match is merely for entertainment.

448
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:10,333
Jiang WenHuan.

449
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:11,700
Do not be rude.

450
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:18,300
Get up.

451
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:21,866
Waste.

452
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,866
Are you alright?

453
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,600
It's nothing, thank you.

454
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:29,033
Huan'er.

455
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,166
Take Young Master E Shun.

456
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,066
To the mansion to apply medicine.

457
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:34,333
Let's go.

458
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,266
Tonight in the arena.

459
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,200
Thanks to Young Master Jiang for saving me.

460
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
E Shun is extremely grateful

461
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:04,066
I finally know

462
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:05,766
why you look familiar

463
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,000
You really resemble a friend from my childhood

464
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,033
Dahuang

465
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:13,166
Dahuang

466
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,033
Does it look like him? See

467
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,066
A dog

468
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,500
I'm not insulting you

469
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:22,533
Don't misunderstand

470
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:24,366
I just think

471
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,533
your eyes

472
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,533
are indeed quite similar to his

473
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:31,866
No wonder I felt so close to you

474
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:32,766
the moment I saw you

475
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:34,400
This

476
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:36,566
Does it look similar?

477
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:39,933
Actually, Dahuang

478
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,833
was my only friend in childhood

479
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,933
When I was young

480
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:45,466
my parents were always away at war

481
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,200
and my eldest brother was busy with matters in Donglu
all day

482
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:49,766
So in the mansion

483
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:51,866
I was all alone

484
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,866
But fortunately

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,533
I had Dahuang

486
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,366
Now, Da Huang is

487
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:03,500
dead

488
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:07,400
Sorry

489
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,133
It's alright

490
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:09,833
Da Huang

491
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,533
died saving me

492
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,866
Once

493
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:16,933
I sneaked out with it

494
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:17,800
to play in the river

495
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
But that day

496
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:21,466
the current was too strong

497
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,800
I lost my footing accidentally

498
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:25,666
and fell into the river

499
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,433
It desperately bit the corner of my clothes

500
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
trying to pull me back

501
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,933
In the end

502
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,133
I was pulled ashore

503
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:36,666
but it

504
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:39,700
was washed away by the river

505
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:42,600
When Da Huang was leaving

506
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,700
it struggled desperately

507
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:46,500
I know

508
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:48,866
it wanted to survive

509
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:50,866
That kind of

510
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,266
stubborn

511
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:54,333
persistent look in its eyes

512
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:55,966
I will never forget for the rest of my life

513
00:27:57,566 --> 00:27:58,266
And this kind of look

514
00:27:59,166 --> 00:27:59,966
I have seen it three times

515
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,800
The first time was Dahuang

516
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:03,966
The second time

517
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,700
was a little slave

518
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,000
The third time is you

519
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,633
So, the moment I saw you

520
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,166
it reminded me of Dahuang

521
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,766
That's why I stepped in to help

522
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:20,366
Fortunately

523
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:21,866
the injuries aren't too severe

524
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:23,500
It shouldn't be a big issue

525
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:24,766
But tomorrow

526
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:26,666
you really shouldn't push yourself so hard

527
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:28,866
Thank you

528
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,333
Young Master Jiang

529
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,500
What is this you're drawing

530
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:48,433
This thing

531
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,266
is a weird contraption

532
00:28:50,866 --> 00:28:52,266
I originally wanted to figure out

533
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,966
what this thing is used for

534
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,233
But unexpectedly

535
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,100
it was stolen by that female thief today

536
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:58,266
So I just relied on my memory

537
00:28:58,833 --> 00:28:59,766
and casually sketched a few lines

538
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,833
But I feel like

539
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:04,333
The more I draw, the more something feels off

540
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:11,400
It's this

541
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,233
Young Master Jiang, look

542
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:23,766
This thing

543
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,700
is long and slender in shape

544
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,866
with serrated teeth at the end

545
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:26,900
It actually resembles

546
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,533
a key

547
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,266
A key

548
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,633
A key

549
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,233
Be careful, don’t be discovered

550
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:55,966
S- shopkeeper

551
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,833
W- what are we looking for

552
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,466
Didn’t the young lady say

553
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,733
we’re investigating smuggled goods

554
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,633
transported from the Guifang Kingdom

555
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:04,333
Search carefully

556
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,066
Shopkeeper, I found it

557
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,133
See what’s inside

558
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:30,000
W- what’s locked in here

559
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What is it

560
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,733
It’s a human

561
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,233
A human

562
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:33,966
Not a human

563
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,133
Explain clearly—what exactly is locked inside

564
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,966
It’s a human

565
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,000
but also not a human

566
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:48,833
In our Southern Capital

567
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,366
There are often events of beasts fighting each other

568
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,466
People, in order to win

569
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,400
the victory of the competition

570
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,700
often search from various places

571
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:54,833
for the most ferocious beasts

572
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,700
to participate in the beast fights

573
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,533
As for those vendors

574
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,466
they use this specially made locking mechanism

575
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,633
to restrain the beasts

576
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:01,733
preventing the beasts from harming people

577
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,833
Master

578
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,700
Old Xiao from the slave market sent a message

579
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,066
saying the pattern on the copper strip

580
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
has been identified as belonging to which fang-state

581
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,466
It is said to be Gui Fang

582
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,733
which has long been at war with our Eastern Lu

583
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:12,566
Gui Fang

584
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,033
Since the locking mechanism of this key

585
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,066
is specially made for beasts

586
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,700
it must be related to tomorrow's

587
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,000
beast fight competition

588
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,233
The mastermind behind this is also connected to the state of Gui Fang

589
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,466
Involved.

590
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,233
Then I must make early preparations.

591
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,233
To guard against unforeseen circumstances.

592
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,400
I, young master, am eager to see.

593
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,366
What tricks they can play.

594
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,366
I heard that this year's Beast Fight.

595
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,133
Has drawn the princes from all the feudal states.

596
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,066
Yes.

597
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,766
It seems the princes from the southern capital and West River's marquisates.

598
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:51,766
Have also come.

599
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,233
In that case.

600
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:55,733
This year's Beast Fight is bound to be exceptionally thrilling.

601
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:56,066
Indeed.

602
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,166
The prince from West River is truly handsome.

603
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:14,000
Our prince Jiang from East Lu is not bad either.

604
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,900
Exactly.

605
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,733
I wonder which prince will ultimately.

606
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,633
Claim the title of the Gluttonous War God.

607
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,666
Which prince is this?

608
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:22,900
He also looks exceptionally dignified.

609
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,633
War God Fu Zi.

610
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:41,033
Beloved by all living beings.

611
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,500
How great is our lineage.

612
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,833
Forever thus

613
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,133
Be brave, be a warrior

614
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,066
Chase beasts, pursue pheasants

615
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,366
Be brave, be a warrior

616
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,100
Chase beasts, pursue pheasants

617
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,066
Long sword, curved bow

618
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,400
The azure dragon bound by it

619
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,466
Long sword, curved bow

620
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,100
The azure dragon bound by it

621
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,733
According to

622
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,233
The War God Festival's beast-fighting tradition

623
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:02,733
The first to sever the beast's head

624
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,400
Shall be the War God Festival

625
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,066
Rewarded by the king

626
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,766
Glory for the motherland

627
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,366
I declare

628
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:13,166
The beast-fighting competition begins now

629
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,600
Yier

630
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:55,633
Miss

631
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,900
Maybe I should be the one to deliver the grass

632
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:58,133
If anything were to happen to you

633
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:58,700
At the master's place

634
00:33:59,233 --> 00:33:59,866
Enough

635
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,400
Don't use my father to pressure me

636
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:03,766
Are you sure

637
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:05,000
This black box containing evil objects

638
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,133
Was delivered to this stable

639
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:10,033
Last night I already sent someone to keep watch.

640
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:10,900
No mistake.

641
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:12,533
Good.

642
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:14,866
Then in a moment.

643
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,000
You help me distract that manager.

644
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,066
This young lady wants to personally investigate.

645
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,666
The Dongwu Marquis Estate.

646
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,900
To find out what fishy business is going on.

647
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:23,966
Where is the person delivering the horse fodder?

648
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,666
Where did he go?

649
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:30,133
The one delivering horse fodder, right?

650
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:31,300
Yes, yes, yes.

651
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,000
This way, this way.

652
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,433
Sir.

653
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,200
Sir, sir.

654
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,233
Let me help you up.

655
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:40,733
How could you be so careless?

656
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,500
My fault, my fault.

657
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,033
Take it slow.

658
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:44,433
Be careful.

659
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:46,600
Why look back for no reason?

660
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I deserve to die, I deserve to die.

661
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,666
So much horse fodder.

662
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:53,033
And all of it is inferior quality.

663
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:54,966
To feed to the warhorses.

664
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:56,666
Not even afraid of giving the warhorse a stomachache.

665
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,966
Truly black-hearted and black-faced.

666
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,266
War God.

667
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,900
Gluttonous War God.

668
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,500
Gluttonous War God.

669
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,200
Gluttonous War God.

670
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,166
Is that it?

671
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,866
Brother Chong is the number one warrior of the prairie.

672
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,266
A mere wolf.

673
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:48,366
Is nothing to him at all.

674
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,966
This black box must be what Yi'er was talking about.

675
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,300
As expected, it was delivered to this stable.

676
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:04,466
Gluttonous War God.

677
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,300
Gluttonous War God.

678
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,433
Gluttonous War God.

679
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,733
Gluttonous War God.

680
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,333
What's going on?

681
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,366
What is this?

682
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:17,500
What's that sound?

683
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,700
Such a large box.

684
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:22,866
But what about the evil thing inside?

685
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,433
Where did it go?

686
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,366
What's happening?

687
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,400
Wasn't the fight over?

688
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,300
Why is it here again?

689
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,066
What is this thing? So terrifying.

690
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,833
What kind of monster is this?

691
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:52,033
Where did it come from?

692
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:54,166
General, I don't know either.

693
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,333
Everyone, be careful.

694
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,066
Run!

695
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,933
Quickly.

696
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:14,766
Hurry, go.

697
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:15,633
Get out, fast.

698
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:22,433
Everyone, retreat.

699
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:31,866
Reporting to the General.

700
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,133
The gate has been jammed by traitors.

701
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,266
I'm afraid it will be difficult to open for a while.

702
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,833
Let's go, we need to evacuate the civilians first.

703
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:47,333
No, we must lure this monster away first.

704
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,933
I'll go lure the monster.

705
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,900
You all go evacuate the civilians.

706
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:54,733
Come on, come.

707
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,700
Come here, you ugly freak.

708
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:04,266
Come at me, you little punk.

709
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,100
We need to speed up and get the civilians to evacuate.

710
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,466
Otherwise, if something happens to the monster,

711
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,333
we'll definitely be in trouble.

712
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,966
But, can Brother Jiang hold out?

713
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:15,033
I can't help with this either

714
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:15,666
I can leave too

715
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,033
We're here

716
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:34,700
This is the place

717
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,066
Come on, come on
