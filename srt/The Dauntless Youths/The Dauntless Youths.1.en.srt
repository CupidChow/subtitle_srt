1
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,559
The Heaven and Earth

2
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,719
give birth to water

3
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,039
and complete it.

4
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,199
The Earth and Heaven

5
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,160
give birth to fire and complete it.

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
The Heaven and Earth

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,159
give birth to wood and complete it.

8
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,920
The mountains and rivers are connected.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
The past is easy to know,

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,799
but the future is hard to predict.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,399
The Emperor Star rises,

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,200
and the Purple Star falls.

13
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,560
The Book of Burial.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,600
What does it mean?

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Your Majesty,

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,920
this hexagram

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,880
signifies great misfortune.

18
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,759
Why haven't we found

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,039
the elixir

20
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,960
of immortality yet?

21
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,840
It's a relic from ancient times,

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,600
said to

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,159
transform mortal flesh

24
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,400
into eternal skin.

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,040
To find the elixir,

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,040
we must seek the destined one

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,920
among the princes.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,000
The princes?

29
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,239
Do you really want me

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,200
to reopen

31
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,879
the Camp of Princes?

32
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,120
Your Majesty,

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,280
I think

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,519
you're seriously ill.

35
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,920
If we

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,599
detain the princes as hostages,

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,040
the other states may rebel.

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
So, how do you

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,079
find the elixir?

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,680
The annual

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,120
War God's Beast-fighting is coming.

42
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,359
At that time, the princes will gather in Donglu.

43
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,519
Why not use this opportunity to select

44
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,120
the bravest prince to find the medicine?

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,920
Good.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,519
Let's use the name of beast fighting

47
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,680
to form a prince army

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,719
to find the elixir for me.

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,439
Only success

50
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,919
is allowed.

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
Fish swallow the hook for bait.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,080
People fall into the trap for greed.

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,800
Yuan Yang,

54
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,280
your desire for immortality

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,520
will eventually cut off your trade.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,521
For a hundred years.

57
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,320
General,

58
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:13,841
there's no decree

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,800
on the east or west side.

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
The decree for the War God's beast

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,281
is about to enter the city.

62
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:19,600
Where's the prince?

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,961
Why haven't you found him yet?

64
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
General,

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,161
I've searched all of Donglu,

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,441
but haven't found the prince.

67
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:27,600
The War God's beast

68
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,001
is a major event in Donglu City.

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
As the heir to the Dongwu Marquisate,

70
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,040
he should have been present.

71
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,480
This is sheer nonsense!

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,320
He's always

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
causing trouble,

74
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,560
but disappears when it matters.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,721
You brat!

76
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:49,440
Here he comes.

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
General, the messenger has arrived.

78
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,761
We should go meet him.

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Here comes the imperial edict!

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
This time, I'll find

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,081
I'll make him pay!

82
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,600
That little brat!

83
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,081
That little brat!

84
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,761
With his parents away,

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
he's been acting out all day.

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,081
I'm like a father now.

87
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,321
This time, I'll teach him

88
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,161
what Jiang family discipline is.

89
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,680
Same old lines.

90
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,281
You're so boring at your age.

91
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:43,800
You might end up a bachelor.

92
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,120
Forget it.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm not waiting.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,480
Send word to all,

95
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,641
put the city on alert,

96
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:50,761
and prepare to receive the Shangshan envoys.

97
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,841
With your support,

99
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,321
I've conquered enemies in the north and south,

100
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,800
and brought peace to all corners of the world.

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,281
Do not forget the deeds of the God of War.

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
The dukes and princes hold beast-fighting ceremonies in his honor.

103
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,641
Today, the Dongwu Marquisate

104
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:58,841
is ordered to hold the God of War Beast-fighting Ceremony,

105
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:00,680
to display the might of Shangshan,

106
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,281
and to instill fear across the world.

107
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,201
the imperial edict.

108
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:15,881
I, Jiang Wenfeng,

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,161
accept the edict.

110
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:24,920
There are assassins!

111
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,440
Protect the messenger!

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,881
How dare you, rebels,

113
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,161
to seize the imperial edict openly!

114
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,641
Chase them down!

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,401
We must retrieve the edict!

116
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,120
General,

117
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,841
they have accomplices.

118
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:14,401
It's him!

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,641
Split up and chase them!

120
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,841
Stop! Don't run!

121
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:36,920
Stop! Stop right there!

122
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,161
Isn't that Mr Jiang?

123
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,600
Yeah, it's him!

124
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,480
He's truly the troublemaker of Donglu.

125
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:22,720
He's always causing trouble.

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,840
The slave has escaped! Chase him down!

127
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
The masked slave!

128
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,840
Catch him!

129
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,281
Hurry! Don't let him get away!

130
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,481
Mr Jiang, here to catch thieves again?

131
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:43,960
I'm on duty.

132
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,001
Move aside!

133
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,560
Mr Jiang, how many slaves did I leave for you?

134
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:16,440
Another slave escaped. Catch him.

135
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,800
Why are you running around?

136
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,241
You are...

137
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,521
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:30,560
I recognized the wrong person.

139
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,761
Found him.

140
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,761
The slave is here.

141
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,401
Arrest him.

142
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,560
Mr Jiang,

143
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,521
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I recognized the wrong person.

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
You dirty thing!

146
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,601
You can run pretty fast, huh?

147
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,200
Let's see where you run today.

148
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,080
Take him away.

149
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,281
Go.

150
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:19,241
You want to run?

151
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,040
You want to run?

152
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,121
You dirty thing, you want to run?

153
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,241
How dare you!

154
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,121
Come here!

155
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,481
For such a piece of trash,

156
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,560
you've defied me several times

157
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,401
and caused me trouble.

158
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,281
Do you believe I'll kill you?

159
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,680
Give it back to me!

160
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:40,601
How dare you ask me?

161
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:43,281
Fine.

162
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,161
Go get it.

163
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,401
I said go get it?

164
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,881
Go get it?

165
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:54,560
You really went?

166
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,521
How dare you?

167
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:57,601
Come here. Be honest.

168
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:58,960
Get up.

169
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,161
I said go get it?

170
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,080
This servant is too bold.

171
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,121
I said go get it?

172
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,080
He might be beaten to death on the street.

173
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,241
I told you to take it.

174
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,761
This kind of despicable thing

175
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:06,401
is nothing but a coward.

176
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,881
Yes.

177
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:09,800
This is the runaway slave I just caught.

178
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,720
I won't let you go.

179
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,241
You're in such a bad shape.

180
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:15,680
You really go...

181
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,361
Come back.

182
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,361
Prince Jiang.

183
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:05,560
Why would he save a slave?

184
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:06,761
Pick it up.

185
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,601
Why are you still standing there?

186
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,481
It's so dangerous.

187
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
What if the prince gets hurt?

188
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:40,680
Stop looking. Disperse.

189
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,040
Disperse.

190
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
Luckily, I'm lucky.

191
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,121
If I hadn't mistaken you for someone else,

192
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,920
they wouldn't have caught you.

193
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,680
We're even now.

194
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,200
He really ran away.

195
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,440
You saved me.

196
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,481
How can I repay you?

197
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,920
How?

198
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,881
With my life.

199
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:08,121
Mr Jiang,

200
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:11,361
are you okay?

201
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,761
How much is this slave?

202
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:15,761
I'll buy him.

203
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:18,920
He?

204
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:33,641
Fifty coins.

205
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,800
How's he doing?

206
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,121
Don't worry, General.

207
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,161
The messenger just fainted

208
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:38,960
because of excessive blood loss.

209
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:40,521
He'll recover in a few days.

210
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,241
That's good.

211
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,361
The messenger was attacked.

212
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,001
It's a big deal.

213
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:45,521
Take good care of him.

214
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,761
Yes, sir.

215
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:51,361
Parents journeyed to West Xia.

216
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:52,161
They entrusted me with the safety of

217
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,720
the East Lu and that brat.

218
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,281
I can't let anything happen to them.

219
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:58,401
General, don't worry.

220
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:00,241
Report!

221
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,241
General,

222
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:02,001
we found him.

223
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,521
We found him?

224
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:04,401
I heard you bought a slave.

225
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,560
What?

226
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,481
General.

227
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,161
Stand up.

228
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,920
General,

229
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,720
we searched the whole city,

230
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,121
but we didn't find that thief.

231
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:31,920
But...

232
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,840
But what?

233
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,401
When we searched

234
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,361
the slave market,

235
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,001
The Prince was there too.

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
And he was chasing that thief.

237
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
I think

238
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:46,960
the thief the Prince was chasing

239
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,440
might be the one who stole the imperial edict.

240
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,521
It's the brat again.

241
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,281
Send the order

242
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
to block the whole city of Donglu.

243
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,680
Bring the prince and the imperial edict

244
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:58,920
back to me.

245
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,361
Yes.

246
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,241
This brat is really expensive.

247
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,161
Has the person you are looking for

248
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,161
passed here?

249
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:16,680
Yes.

250
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,521
This is snake ointment.

251
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,361
After boiling and drying,

252
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,800
it will turn crimson.

253
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,241
So according to the color and smell,

254
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,840
we can find the escape route.

255
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,040
Good for you.

256
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,761
I didn't waste my money.

257
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,761
You smell like a snake.

258
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,241
It's disgusting.

259
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,080
Let's go to the dungeon.

260
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,440
I'll invite you to take a bath.

261
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,521
This guy is very bold.

262
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,960
He dares to get something from the fire.

263
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,241
I advise you not to bother him.

264
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,920
It's better to follow me.

265
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,241
You still want to fight?

266
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,800
Originally,

267
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:07,401
I only want your left hand.

268
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,001
Since you can run so fast,

269
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:21,761
I'd better break your legs.

270
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,481
Don't come here.

271
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,720
What are you doing?

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,440
Are you okay?

273
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:52,121
Get up.

274
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:06,680
Split up and chase.

275
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:56,480
How did you ride the horse?

276
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,000
You want to run?

277
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,920
Tell me.

278
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,760
The War God's Fight

279
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,200
is just an ordinary competition.

280
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,200
Why did you rob the imperial edict?

281
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,361
Why did you tear it up

282
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,041
on the spot?

283
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,480
Who is your master?

284
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,561
You're a rabbit, so you can run so fast.

285
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:18,841
If I catch you again,

286
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,520
I'll take your hands and legs.

287
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,401
What is this?

288
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,881
What is this?

289
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,440
Why is it only half?

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,720
Forget it.

291
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,280
Let's talk about it when we get back.

292
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,520
Don't say

293
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,760
You, the little slave,

294
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,561
have quite a few skills.

295
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:48,960
You are so smart and capable.

296
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,480
Why did the slave dealer beat you?

297
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:58,680
Because of this.

298
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,680
Let me have a look.

299
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,480
Don't touch it.

300
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,920
It's a treasure.

301
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:06,960
But do you know that

302
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,000
I've paid for you.

303
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,200
Not to mention your things,

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,561
even you are mine.

305
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,401
Give it to me.

306
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:28,041
It's a military card.

307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,841
Are you

308
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:39,720
a deserter?

309
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,280
Once on the battlefield,

310
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:46,641
never retreat.

311
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:47,920
I didn't expect a slave

312
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,081
to be so brave.

313
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,601
Fine.

314
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,361
Since the thief has run away,

315
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:11,801
you can go now.

316
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,321
What?

317
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,920
Don't you want to go?

318
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,480
I don't want to owe you.

319
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:21,801
You are really a brave man.

320
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,440
Fine.

321
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,720
Then come back with me.

322
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
With your skills,

323
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,000
in a few days,

324
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,841
I'll turn you into

325
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:31,161
the bravest warrior in Donglu.

326
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,680
Then,

327
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,480
you won't have to be a slave anymore.

328
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,641
Not a slave anymore?

329
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:41,920
My Lord!

330
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,680
My Lord!

331
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,280
Ding!

332
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,361
What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?

333
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:46,200
My Lord!

334
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,841
You'd better go back to the mansion.

335
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,161
The eldest prince has issued an order

336
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,720
to arrest you.

337
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:51,801
What?

338
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,401
You are so angry.

339
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,801
The eldest prince knows that

340
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,200
you bought a slave.

341
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,440
My brother hates slavery the most.

342
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:10,440
No wonder.

343
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,561
Well...

344
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:12,641
I...

345
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:13,841
I have something to do.

346
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm afraid

347
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,440
I can't take you back.

348
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:19,081
But it's okay.

349
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:19,801
You look for

350
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
the clues of the man in black first.

351
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:24,760
Wait for me here tomorrow.

352
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,280
I'll take you home.

353
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:27,480
Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.,

354
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,081
wait for me here.

355
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,321
I'll take you home tomorrow.

356
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:49,841
Ding

357
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,801
How angry

358
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,561
do you think he is?

359
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,280
About...

360
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:01,641
So angry?

361
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:03,000
No.

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,280
I can't just

363
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,841
go back and take a beating.

364
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,161
Since we're already in trouble,

365
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,601
let's make it bigger.

366
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:11,881
My Lord,

367
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:17,280
what are you up to now?

368
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,121
The wanted criminal

369
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:20,081
of the entire city,

370
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,361
Jiang Wenhuan,

371
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,920
has returned to apologize.

372
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,720
Ding,

373
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,161
repeat the exact words

374
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:28,561
to Jianchuan.

375
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,161
Go.

376
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,041
Well.

377
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:34,480
Go, go, go.

378
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,000
Do you

379
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,440
know me?

380
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,680
Yes.

381
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,161
Who am I?

382
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:42,161
Jiang Wenhuan.

383
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,081
Right.

384
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,561
I'm the most handsome man in Donglu.

385
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,480
Today,

386
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:51,321
I'll perform

387
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,960
a magic trick for you.

388
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,480
Jiang Wenhuan.

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,520
Coming.

390
00:23:59,041 --> 00:23:59,680
What's going on?

391
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,041
My Lord,

392
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,041
I intercepted the imperial edict and captured the bandits.

393
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,561
I violated the military regulations.

394
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Please punish me, General Pan Chi.

395
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:08,601
Are you asking for punishment?

396
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:09,601
You're just making a mess.

397
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,720
My Lord,

398
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,321
I'm ready to be punished.

399
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,321
Please punish me.

400
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm willing to be punished.

401
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,480
The troublemaker

402
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,081
is really a troublemaker.

403
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,480
He's not a good child.

404
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,881
Yes.

405
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:22,720
Ding, Ding, come here.

406
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,801
Hurry up.

407
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,720
I've prepared the rattan for you.

408
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,601
There are long ones.

409
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,321
The young master is handsome.

410
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,041
There are short ones.

411
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,720
Why did you raise such a bastard?

412
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:38,760
Yes.

413
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,520
He's just a showoff.

414
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,920
He's just a bastard.

415
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,041
There are thick ones.

416
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:46,720
There are thin ones.

417
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,401
I think

418
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,480
we should choose this one.

419
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:50,881
This one?

420
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,401
Yes.

421
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:54,680
Okay, this one.

422
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,641
It's strong and heavy.

423
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,440
It can definitely

424
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
beat my butt.

425
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:00,720
You bastard.

426
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,601
Go to the ancestral temple for punishment.

427
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
Brother

428
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:05,240
If you want to punish me, just do it here.

429
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,161
Everyone is here.

430
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,561
It's lively, isn't it?

431
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,680
Yes, yes.

432
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,641
I'll say it again.

433
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:11,161
Go in and take the punishment.

434
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,321
Brother

435
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,041
Punish him.

436
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:15,801
Go in and take the punishment.

437
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:17,680
Disperse, disperse, disperse.

438
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,361
Brother

439
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:23,520
Don't be angry, brother.

440
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,161
Be gentle.

441
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:25,801
Brother

442
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,440
Kneel down!

443
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,081
Are you done?

444
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,401
Where's the imperial edict?

445
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,081
Hand it over!

446
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,920
I don't have it.

447
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,680
What do you mean?

448
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,401
The thief

449
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:46,760
destroyed it when he fled.

450
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,480
Destroyed?

451
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,240
I think

452
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:52,720
there's more to this War God Festival.

453
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:54,841
But don't worry,

454
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:56,361
I'll help you find out.

455
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,401
I'll bring the guy who hurt you

456
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:58,280
back to apologize to you.

457
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,401
No.

458
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,641
Why not?

459
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,361
The God of War Sacrifice has not started yet,

460
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:06,480
but I was assassinated.

461
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:07,480
The assassin must have another intention.

462
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,720
Anyway,

463
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
you don't have to deal with this.

464
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:22,920
Kneel down and

465
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:24,641
reflect on yourself.

466
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,401
Go back to the East Hall to eat.

467
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,081
Eat?

468
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,000
In your eyes,

469
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:37,720
I'm really a useless man.

470
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:40,601
What did you say?

471
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,081
I said I'm

472
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,200
a useless man in the Dongwu Marquisate.

473
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,081
You were injured today,

474
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,480
but I couldn't catch that villain

475
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,801
to help you.

476
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,000
How ridiculous it is for me

477
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,401
to be the heir of the Dongwu Marquisate.

478
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,041
Jiang Wenhuan,

479
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,321
what are you talking about?

480
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,601
I said

481
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:02,920
you never treated us

482
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,680
as your real family.

483
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,801
You've always

484
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:11,601
held onto the old feelings

485
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:12,601
of your parents

486
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,161
who saved you from the battlefield.

487
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:17,321
You've served the Jiang family

488
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:18,240
and gone to great lengths

489
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,680
for me, the so-called heir.

490
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,000
You claim to be a son of the Jiang family,

491
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,240
yet you've never

492
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,841
considered yourself as such,

493
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:31,081
nor have you ever

494
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:37,720
seen yourself as my brother,

495
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,520
Jiang Wenhuan.

496
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,801
you always want to protect me,

497
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,480
but you never think

498
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,601
that I also want to protect you.

499
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:01,480
There's danger behind this time's War God Ceremony.

500
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,161
You let it go or not,

501
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:05,841
I will definitely deal with it.

502
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:08,720
How dare you?

503
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:13,920
I dare.

504
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,641
Good.

505
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,200
You dare, right?

506
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,720
Someone,

507
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,561
bring the Jiang family's family law.

508
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:31,960
Admit your mistake now,

509
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:42,520
it's not too late.

510
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:43,480
Do you still want to meddle in other people's affairs?

511
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,440
Yes!

512
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,561
Will you make trouble?

513
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,321
Yes!

514
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,561
Will you do evil?

515
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:55,240
Yes!

516
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,881
As the eldest brother,

517
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:58,280
I'll teach you a lesson

518
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,641
for your father today.

519
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:22,361
You're back.

520
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,401
It's okay.

521
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:25,440
Huan knows he's wrong.

522
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,881
Just let him go this time.

523
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Master,

524
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,440
You're back at last.

525
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,161
My brother is going to kill me.

526
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You deserve it.

527
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,841
You made your brother unhappy again, right?

528
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,200
How is Huan?

529
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:00,881
He's been treated.

530
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:03,000
It's just a skin wound.

531
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:05,760
He'll be fine after a night's rest.

532
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,520
The little brat

533
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
intercepted your letter this morning.

534
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,680
He knew you were coming back,

535
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,121
so he dared to talk back to me.

536
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,321
Tough outside, soft inside.

537
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:16,121
He made a lot of noise

538
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,000
but did little.

539
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:20,520
Huan really meant well.

540
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,480
He didn't mean to

541
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,760
go against you.

542
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,720
He wanted to help you,

543
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,641
the elder brother.

544
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,801
I know all that.

545
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,920
But since I'm the elder brother,

546
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,280
some things

547
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:34,960
should be on me.

548
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,881
By the way,

549
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,081
you came back

550
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
It's about the beast fight, right?

551
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:42,920
What about Anashi?

552
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:43,841
When he entered the mansion,

553
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,801
Ding had already

554
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:46,440
arranged him in the guest room.

555
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,801
Great.

556
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,760
I just have something to give him.

557
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,000
This

558
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,200
is a little horse made by uncle for you.

559
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,000
This year,

560
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
we grow up one year older.

561
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:19,200
Every year on Shier's birthday,

562
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,161
you will prepare a birthday gift for him.

563
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,881
You don't have to do this.

564
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,200
Shi doesn't know about this.

565
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,960
How can it be?

566
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,561
If one day

567
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
he wakes up

568
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,081
and sees these gifts,

569
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,881
he will know

570
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:40,960
we have never forgotten him.

571
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,841
Then I'll thank you

572
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,041
on behalf of Shi.

573
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:53,641
Sorry for my private affairs

574
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:56,361
causing you to worry.

575
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm back to the East Lu

576
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,280
for the Beast-fighting.

577
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:02,401
I guess you've known about it.

578
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:04,081
The envoy who delivered the edict

579
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:05,601
was attacked when entering the city,

580
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,321
and the edict was destroyed.

581
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:08,000
Since the edict has not been delivered,

582
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,680
in theory,

583
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,920
we should return to the capital to receive the edict

584
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:12,801
before holding the War God Festival.

585
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,361
It seems that this year's beast-fighting

586
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:15,480
can't be held as scheduled.

587
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,200
No need.

588
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,000
What do you mean?

589
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,240
The King's handwritten order

590
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:28,760
Sent back to oversee War God Festival.

591
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,440
He also specifically instructed that

592
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,440
no matter what happens,

593
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,801
the beast fight must be held on schedule.

594
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,000
My Lord,

595
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,601
you're awake.

596
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:52,520
My Lord,

597
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:53,641
your wound hasn't healed yet.

598
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,641
Don't move around.

599
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,440
Chengxin,

600
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:05,561
what time is it now?

601
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,641
It's noon.

602
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,401
What's wrong?

603
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:12,561
Noon?

604
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,121
Is he going to die of starvation?

605
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,361
My Lord,

606
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,161
There's another one.

607
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:18,121
Give it to me.

608
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,760
My Lord,

609
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,760
where are you going with all these wounds?

610
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,920
This should be

611
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,081
the other half of that copper strip.

612
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:47,081
I seem to have seen this thing

613
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,920
at the slave market.

614
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:25,121
It's this.

615
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,161
You bastard.

616
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:28,561
You've escaped again, haven't you?

617
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,240
What?

618
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,441
Where is your new master?

619
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:32,561
He's not here.

620
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
Wait.

621
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,481
climbed a new branch,

622
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:40,680
so you don't recognize your father anymore?

623
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:44,921
Get out of the way!

624
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:46,601
Fine.

625
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:49,800
Come here, come here.

626
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,481
Everyone, listen up.

627
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,481
Kneel down.

628
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,641
Kneel down.

629
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,041
Want to leave?

630
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:02,521
Okay.

631
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:03,880
Crawl through this.

632
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,840
Then I'll let you go.

633
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,680
This is too pitiful.

634
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,760
Where?

635
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,161
Let him go.

636
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:12,641
Just let him go.

637
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,441
Crawl.

638
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,481
Crawl over there.

639
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,601
You're born a slave.

640
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,441
You don't have the guts.

641
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,561
You don't deserve it.

642
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:26,001
With your skills,

643
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:27,121
in a few days,

644
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:28,441
I'll turn you

645
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:30,521
into the bravest warrior

646
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:31,081
in Donglu.

647
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,521
You won't

648
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,441
have to kneel and be a slave.

649
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,561
No one

650
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:46,760
is born to be a slave.

651
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,641
What did you say?

652
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,880
How dare you hit me?

653
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:17,561
My name

654
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,280
is Kunwu.

655
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:39,641
Get out of my way.

656
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,720
Sir,

657
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,921
have you seen a slave with a mask?

658
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:43,601
He's gone.

659
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,081
Gone?

660
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:46,360
Where are they?

661
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,121
I don't know.

662
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,561
Where are they?

663
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,360
Over there.

664
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,961
Jiang...

665
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:08,720
Sorry.

666
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:42,320
I mistook you for someone else.

667
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:43,041
You're awake.

668
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,840
Who's there?

669
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,001
You are

670
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
Kunwu?

671
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,121
Why does this man

672
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:48,041
look exactly like me?

673
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,521
Please sit.

674
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:01,760
You and I are indeed very alike.

675
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,760
You look like me.

676
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:06,921
Who are you?

677
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,680
Why did you bring me here?

678
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,840
Kunwu

679
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,441
means a sharp weapon.

680
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,961
Your father must have

681
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:26,880
high expectations for you.

682
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,561
I brought you here
