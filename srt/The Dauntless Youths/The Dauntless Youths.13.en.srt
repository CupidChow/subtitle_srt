1
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,766
How is it

2
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:25,500
Is there still anyone inside

3
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:25,966
Is everyone out

4
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:26,466
Be careful

5
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:32,866
You all find a way

6
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:33,866
Wake the others up

7
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,200
I'll go in and take another look

8
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,700
Alright, be careful

9
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,833
By the way, Brother Chong

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,133
Don't worry

11
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,533
I already sent someone to deliver a message
when we came

12
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:42,900
Reinforcements will be here soon

13
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,600
Good

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,633
Wake up

15
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,300
Xin Jia

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,800
Brother Chong

17
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,333
Quick

18
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,733
What's wrong with Lady Asi

19
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:58,433
It's nothing

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,933
She fainted temporarily

21
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:01,100
Put her down

22
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,466
Is everyone rescued

23
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:05,633
Almost

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,966
But Ziyu hasn't been found

25
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,600
Brother E Shun went back to check

26
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,066
He went back

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,500
Take good care of Asi for me

28
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:15,666
I'm going back to find E Shun

29
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,266
Be careful

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,866
I know

31
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,133
Is there anyone else

32
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,133
Is there anyone else

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,900
None of you are going anywhere

34
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,366
None of you are going anywhere

35
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,200
You let go of me

36
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,000
Let go

37
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,066
Let go of me

38
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,333
Quickly let go of me

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,933
Father

40
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,333
Your son is unfilial

41
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,833
Your son has been wronged

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,533
They all said they would avenge me

43
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,700
But in the end, they all deceived me

44
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,733
Who wants to avenge you

45
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,533
Are you from Guifang

46
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,366
Do not let hatred

47
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:01,366
Lead you to repeat your mistakes

48
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,533
I am not wrong

49
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,900
You are the ones who are wrong

50
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,866
E Shun

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,033
You're out of luck

52
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,133
Today we will

53
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,200
perish together

54
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:22,400
E Shun

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I will never be controlled by you again

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Manipulated

57
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,933
Ziyu did so much

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,900
And even ended up losing his own life

59
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,966
All just for revenge

60
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:05,966
Did you know

61
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,033
That your sister is still alive

62
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,800
You've clung to life all these years

63
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,900
Wasn't it just to return to your homeland

64
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,166
And see your loved ones again

65
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,900
When everything you cherish is taken away

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,133
All that remains

67
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,366
Is revenge

68
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,500
But hatred is like a maze

69
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:39,400
Where it's easy to forget

70
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,933
Where you came from

71
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,266
All of this

72
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,500
Was it really worth it

73
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,066
But in this world

74
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,166
There are too many things not worth it

75
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,700
That we only understand

76
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:06,933
After experiencing them ourselves

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,266
Though Ziyu had ill intentions

78
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,333
He is also pitiable

79
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,200
Let someone send him back to Ningzhou

80
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:24,466
E Shun.

81
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,033
Before.

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
I shouldn't have doubted you.

83
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,333
The world is ever-changing.

84
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,433
To have one confidant in life.

85
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,200
Is enough.

86
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:54,966
Right?

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,366
Let's go.

88
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,000
You have all come from afar.

89
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,033
Yet encountered such a calamity.

90
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,966
It is my failure, Jiang Wenfeng's dereliction of duty.

91
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,933
General Jiang, you are too severe.

92
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,700
That we were able to survive this brush with death.

93
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,033
Was entirely thanks to General Jiang.

94
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,400
Turning the tide.

95
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,433
Indeed.

96
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,433
All the blame for this.

97
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:50,900
Lies with that remnant of the guilty official.

98
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,133
Ning Ziyu, who caused it for revenge.

99
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,366
Your city of Donglu.

100
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:55,833
Has also suffered greatly from it.

101
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,266
Thank you all for your understanding.

102
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,066
Thank you, General Jiang, for investigating on
behalf of Libei.

103
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,100
The killer of my husband.

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,533
And bringing justice for my husband.

105
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,866
You are too kind, Crown Princess.

106
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,666
The two of you have come this time

107
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,033
due to your husband's tragic death in Donglu.

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,566
Donglu is truly remorseful.

109
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,133
We hope Libei can let bygones be bygones

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,633
and maintain the same relationship with Donglu as
in the past.

111
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Rest assured, General.

112
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,966
My father-in-law, Lord Beibo, is already aware

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
of the entire sequence of events.

114
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,566
The grievances of the two young masters

115
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,666
have also been cleared.

116
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,266
My father-in-law specifically instructed

117
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,366
that we must join hands with Donglu in the future

118
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,100
to protect Mount Shang.

119
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,433
Thank you.

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,400
And please accept my condolences, Crown Princess.

121
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,833
Take care, General.

122
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,866
I shall take my leave now.

123
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,233
Take care, Crown Princess.

124
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,400
I never expected

125
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,933
that this year's Gaomei Sacrifice

126
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,133
would be ruined by my own hands.

127
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,366
I have failed Donglu.

128
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,000
Eldest Young Master

129
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
You have done your best

130
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,766
Protected the envoys from all sides

131
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,666
Everyone's safety

132
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,600
Is what matters most

133
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,366
The scouts have sent back word

134
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,466
All these years

135
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,333
Qiankun Alley

136
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,233
Has been colluding with Ningbohou

137
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Selling weapons

138
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:57,933
Trading private armies

139
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,266
Smuggling weapons and harboring private troops

140
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,033
Is a crime punishable by execution of the entire family

141
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,200
This Old Li and Ningbohou

142
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,166
Are neither relatives nor friends

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,033
Why would he risk his life

144
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,166
And work for him?

145
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,933
Perhaps between them

146
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,433
There is some connection we are unaware of

147
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,433
Now those who knew the truth

148
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,333
Are no longer here

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,900
There is much you may never learn

150
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,633
Huan'er said

151
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,500
Before Ning Ziyu died, he mentioned to him

152
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,466
The one helping him seek revenge isn't only Old Li.

153
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,533
Could it be that person

154
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,666
is also like Old Li

155
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,066
an old acquaintance of Marquis Ningbo

156
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:31,966
Who do you think it is

157
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,466
Since the establishment of the Crown Camp (Shizi Camp)

158
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,733
I've had this feeling

159
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,433
that the shadow of the Guifang people

160
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,633
has always been lurking behind the scenes

161
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,733
Are you saying

162
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,200
it's manipulated by Guifang

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,566
I'm not entirely sure either

164
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:54,833
The top priority now

165
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,066
is how you plan to deal with the Li family

166
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,566
According to the laws of Donglu

167
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:01,966
colluding with rebel ministers

168
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:03,166
and killing Chong Yiwu

169
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
warrants execution of the entire family

170
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,100
But Old Li exchanged his life for another

171
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,166
surrendering Qiankun Alley to the public

172
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,366
Confiscate the Li family's properties

173
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,133
to serve as a warning to others

174
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,000
Big Brother

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,433
Is it really necessary to confiscate the Li family's properties?

176
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,500
What brings you here?

177
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,966
General Jiang, if you wish to search and confiscate the Li residence

178
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,766
This general requests orders to proceed

179
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:31,966
You

180
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,166
This general understands

181
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,366
The law is fundamental, there can be no favoritism

182
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,033
But this general is concerned

183
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,833
Concerned about A'Sì, she

184
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:44,933
Go ahead

185
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,166
Take good care of Miss A'Sì

186
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:50,666
Thank you, brother

187
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:55,833
Father

188
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,600
Father can't get out anymore

189
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
What are you still standing there for

190
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,633
Pull A'Sì out

191
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,300
From now on, Father won't be able to take care of you anymore

192
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,400
No matter what you encounter

193
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,600
You must survive

194
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:11,200
Father

195
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:50,833
Where is my father?

196
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,133
Father

197
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,500
Miss

198
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,533
Miss

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
This can't be

200
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,066
He promised to protect me for a lifetime

201
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,433
Miss

202
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,100
Miss

203
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,933
Lí A'Sì receiving orders

204
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,200
This general

205
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:01,966
What has happened

206
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,100
By order of General Panchi

207
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,033
Li Laowu, a merchant from Donglu City

208
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,566
colluded with rebel ministers

209
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,133
and murdered Chong Yiwu, the heir of the Northern Bo Marquis

210
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:11,866
His crime is punishable by death

211
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,366
Considering that in a critical moment

212
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,300
he sacrificed himself to save others

213
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:16,366
but his merits do not outweigh his faults

214
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,933
He is thus taken to Qiankun Alley

215
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,533
and the Li family's property is confiscated

216
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,366
Miss but

217
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,366
take the order

218
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:26,566
But

219
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:31,466
Miss

220
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,033
Let her go

221
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,933
The married say's gift two here Father

222
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,200
Father will naturally carry it with him

223
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,566
But one string is enough

224
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:24,833
You

225
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,333
should choose what you like instead

226
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,066
Father

227
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,933
Let's go home

228
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,166
What is this thing

229
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,133
This strange rock has been excavated

230
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:17,766
Please take a look, General

231
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,266
No worries.

232
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,200
What is this thing

233
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:24,800
How did it emerge from underground

234
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,233
Could this be

235
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,366
the legendary Blood Crystal

236
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Blood Crystal

237
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:37,866
What is a Blood Crystal

238
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,266
Huan'er, it's understandable that you wouldn't know

239
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Legend says this Blood Crystal

240
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,600
has been extinct for a hundred years

241
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,333
No one has seen it

242
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,266
I only know a little about it

243
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,566
from ancient texts

244
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,033
It is said the Blood Crystal originates from Eastern Lu

245
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:50,933
grows in tombs

246
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,166
Its form is crisp and crimson red

247
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,666
It requires irrigation with corpse bones and blood

248
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,966
to condense into a crystal

249
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,000
Hence the name Blood Crystal

250
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,833
Indeed

251
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,433
This stone is harmless to the living

252
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,833
but can ravage the corpse

253
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,066
Therefore, we people of Eastern Lu

254
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
to protect our ancestors' remains

255
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,633
A century ago,

256
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,800
a great fire was used

257
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,100
to completely eradicate this stone.

258
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:16,433
Over the past hundred years,

259
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,066
this event has become a legend.

260
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,066
Never did I expect that during the sacrificial ceremony of my Eastern Lu,

261
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,966
it would reappear.

262
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,766
Never imagined

263
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,066
that in this world,

264
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,900
there would be someone using corpses, bones, and blood

265
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,166
to irrigate and cultivate such a miraculous stone.

266
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,466
The world is vast and full of wonders,

267
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,366
all things interact and counterbalance each other.

268
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:33,533
Naturally,

269
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,200
there are causes and effects beyond our understanding.

270
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,300
Therefore,

271
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,233
it is the corpses of those who died last night

272
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,366
that nurtured the blood crystal seeds,

273
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,466
which is why these blood crystals

274
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,233
broke through the soil and emerged.

275
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,166
Exactly so.

276
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,700
Then

277
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:47,966
what should we do now?

278
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,066
This stone must be eliminated.

279
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:50,333
Why?

280
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,666
Rumors say

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This stone has emerged

282
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,266
Bringing chaos of bows and arrows

283
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:58,566
The plan for now

284
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,066
Is to dig to its roots

285
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,133
And eradicate it completely

286
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,100
Reporting to General Jiang

287
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:05,666
While removing the stone

288
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,466
We discovered this

289
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,033
Could this be

290
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,400
The ancestral edict of Sheng'an

291
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,466
The lords of Eastern Lu shall assist together

292
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,900
To help me achieve an unparalleled undertaking

293
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,100
Yet Heaven may prevail over man

294
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,000
Man may prevail over Heaven

295
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,166
I specifically command the lords of Eastern Lu

296
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
To guard the Blood Crystal Stone for generations

297
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:48,033
This matter is of great importance

298
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,833
Concerning the foundation of the royal enterprise

299
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:51,266
The lords must remember

300
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,433
When the elixir of immortality reappears in the mortal world

301
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,933
It will be the time

302
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,566
For the Blood Crystal Stone to emerge

303
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
If the edict speaks truth

304
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,033
The Blood Crystal Stone has now emerged

305
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,033
Then the elixir of immortality

306
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:02,933
Isn't it also the case that

307
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:05,133
It doesn't say where the elixir of immortality is

308
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:06,466
Not mentioned

309
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:08,533
If Donglu

310
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,033
Was ordered to guard the blood crystal stones for generations

311
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,566
Then why, a hundred years ago,

312
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:14,200
Were they burned to ashes?

313
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:17,766
Perhaps they weren't completely burned

314
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,500
But instead, some powder was left

315
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:22,433
Beneath the ceremonial statue

316
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:23,966
Maybe

317
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,300
This is the best way

318
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,366
To protect the blood crystal stones

319
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,700
Master, you mean

320
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,633
These blood crystal stones

321
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,733
Though nourished by corpses

322
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:34,833
And avoided by ordinary people

323
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,166
Our Donglu ancestors were ordered to protect them

324
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,100
Even if some powder was buried

325
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,033
It wouldn't easily resurface

326
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,700
This way, we both fulfill the royal decree

327
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,833
And guard the crystals

328
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:47,533
Exactly

329
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,300
The ritual ground is a sacred place

330
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,333
No one would commit

331
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:51,466
acts of slaughter there

332
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,400
But what does the elixir of immortality

333
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,500
have to do with bloodstone?

334
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I always feel

335
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
this edict is without head or tail

336
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,333
And it seems to have been torn

337
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,200
I wonder what the other half

338
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,300
might have written

339
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:06,833
Although it's only half

340
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,400
it's still better than nothing

341
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,233
Sixteen years have passed

342
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,900
The elixir of immortality

343
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,333
finally has a new lead

344
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,133
Master, elder brother

345
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,133
Why are you not happy?

346
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,000
We have a clue about the elixir of immortality

347
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,800
Sixteen years ago

348
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,033
Marquis Ningbo nearly faced family ruin and death

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,866
because of searching for the elixir

350
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,000
Say

351
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,733
Your father forged a longevity lock for you

352
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,400
May you live a long life.

353
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,600
Father, I'm hungry.

354
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,233
Hungry.

355
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:10,766
Alright.

356
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:11,966
Alright.

357
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,566
Father will go get you something to eat right now.

358
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,800
Miss.

359
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,866
You haven't eaten anything since you woke up.

360
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,100
I've made some porridge.

361
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,066
Have some.

362
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,966
I won't drink it.

363
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,133
Miss.

364
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,466
You should still eat something.

365
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,066
I'll take my leave now.

366
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,366
I'm sorry, Miss.

367
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,133
I deserve to die.

368
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,033
You may leave.

369
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:34,600
Say.

370
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,166
By the time you read this letter,

371
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,366
I will no longer be by your side.

372
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,800
Some words are difficult to express in person,

373
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,433
so I have written this letter.

374
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:43,966
I hope that one day,

375
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,566
you will come to know your true origins.

376
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Sixteen years ago,

377
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,333
an overnight divination verse from Mount Shang revealed

378
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,833
the long-lost national sacred treasure.

379
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,100
The Elixir of Immortality has

380
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,433
reappeared in Tushan Village,

381
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,966
within the borders of Ningzhou.

382
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,466
Consequently, Shangshan issued

383
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,533
an order, commanding the

384
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,900
Marquis of Ningbo, who governs

385
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:07,233
Ningzhou, to lead troops to

386
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,433
Tushan Village in
search of the elixir.

387
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,366
At that time, I, Li

388
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,600
Laowu, was merely the leader of

389
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,233
a band of roaming bandits.

390
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,300
Usually, I led a group of

391
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,700
brothers to rob noble families

392
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,400
here and there, just to scrape

393
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,333
by. During that period, we

394
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:23,866
encountered pursuing government

395
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,466
soldiers, got separated from my

396
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,633
brothers, and unexpectedly

397
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,000
ended up in Tushan.

398
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,033
With no other
choice, I thought of

399
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:34,600
searching for some gold and

400
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,733
silver in Tushan Village to

401
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,666
ease my urgent needs.

402
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,666
Unexpectedly, I witnessed the

403
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,166
tragic massacre
of the Tushan clan.

404
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,233
"Hand over the sacred

405
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,666
elixir, and this marquis will

406
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:46,400
spare your lives.

407
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,600
" "Tushan has an
ancestral teaching: when the

408
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,400
elixir appears, the human world

409
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,333
falls into chaos.

410
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:51,866
Even if you wipe out
our Tushan lineage,

411
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,166
you will not obtain the elixir.

412
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,100
" "You...

413
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:55,866
say that again." "Report!

414
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,300
A cave has been
discovered on the cliff at

415
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:57,766
the back mountain." "Good! The

416
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:58,466
elixir must be in the cave. You all, go and search. Show no mercy
to the men, women, young, and old of Tushan Village." "Spare us!"

417
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,966
Kill them all!

418
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,233
I never expected

419
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,433
Lord Ning Bo to unleash a massacre

420
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,933
I decided

421
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,966
to sneak down the mountain

422
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,100
before the soldiers noticed me

423
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,900
But just then

424
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,500
I heard the cry of an infant

425
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,700
I intended to abandon the child

426
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:41,900
and flee alone

427
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,533
Yet somehow

428
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,700
I couldn't bring myself to let go of the baby in my arms

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,666
So I had no choice but to carry her

430
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,666
and escape together from Tushan Village

431
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,533
And that infant girl still in swaddling clothes

432
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,066
was you

433
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:57,466
Say

434
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:01,766
At that time

435
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,666
as I looked at you in my embrace

436
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,366
I felt that this might be

437
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,700
the fate bestowed upon me by heaven

438
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,566
So I decided to adopt you

439
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
as my own daughter

440
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,666
so we could keep each other company

441
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,466
I even took my old
lady's childhood name

442
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,166
gave you

443
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,666
Say

444
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,900
I had hoped

445
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,500
you could grow up safe and sound

446
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,800
but never expected

447
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,133
a high fever

448
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:30,833
nearly made your father lose you

449
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:33,300
besides taking medicine on time

450
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,833
we could also have crafted a gold lock

451
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,600
to pray for a long life

452
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,166
if only your father had been more capable back then

453
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,766
I wouldn't have let our Si'er

454
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,033
even a gold lock for blessings

455
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,066
be beyond our means

456
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,133
Noble one, take care

457
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,433
stole my wallet

458
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:04,366
catch him

459
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:07,100
you've got some nerve

460
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,033
daring to steal my wallet

461
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:09,733
I beg you

462
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,833
I beg you

463
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:12,466
I need this money

464
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:13,566
to save my daughter's life

465
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,000
worthless scum

466
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,433
beat him up

467
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:17,766
Noble one, noble one

468
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,466
Hit hard, beat to death.

469
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,266
Stop.

470
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,266
Who are you?

471
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,100
The Marquis.

472
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,333
Leave this person to me.

473
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:33,900
Yes.

474
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,100
Let's go.

475
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:36,800
Li Laowu.

476
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,833
You’ve made this Marquis search for you for a long time.

477
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,566
The things you left behind in Tushan Village.

478
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,033
Do you still remember?

479
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,133
Sir.

480
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:00,733
What is this about?

481
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,233
If you are willing to pledge your loyalty to me.

482
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:06,100
All of this will be yours.

483
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,666
I never expected.

484
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,600
that Marquis Ningbo would track me down.

485
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
using the money pouch I left behind in Tushan Village.

486
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
in my haste.

487
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,266
to find me.

488
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,133
and even use.

489
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,666
my identity as a descendant of Mount Tu.

490
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,100
to threaten me.

491
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,166
into working for him.

492
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,366
to open the underground trade routes in Donglu.

493
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,366
and gather intelligence from all sides.

494
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,000
Furthermore

495
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,666
I still had to use this covert path

496
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,666
To transport weapons and provisions for him

497
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,966
That was the capital offense of harboring a private army

498
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,100
But at the time, your condition

499
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,666
Could no longer be delayed

500
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:39,900
I promised you

501
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,033
Alright

502
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,100
From that day on

503
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,900
I used this money

504
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,266
To establish Qiankun Lane

505
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,500
And secretly trade with Marquis Ningbo

506
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,233
But I always knew

507
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,500
The origin of Qiankun Lane

508
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,533
Would eventually become a hidden danger

509
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:59,033
I just never expected

510
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:00,666
It to come so soon

511
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,866
Ziyu used your background and life

512
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:04,700
As a threat

513
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,266
Forcing me to help him avenge his father

514
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
I knew I had no other choice

515
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,200
The only thing I could do

516
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:12,700
Was to try my best to ensure that you, Si'er

517
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,100
Would not be harmed

518
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,466
Now you know the whole story

519
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,566
I hope you won't blame Father

520
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,400
- for making decisions on your behalf  - Father

521
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,733
How could I blame you

522
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,233
Over the years

523
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,866
The various intricate and bizarre events

524
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:30,266
that occurred within the Shangshan region

525
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,833
After my extensive investigations

526
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,166
and verifications

527
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,766
The origin of all things

528
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,600
seems to point to Tushan Village

529
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,100
and that night of massacre

530
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,400
Tushan Village

531
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,966
Say

532
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,100
You can return to Tushan Village

533
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,300
to investigate the truth behind all this

534
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,133
or you can act as if nothing happened

535
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,000
and live out your life in anonymity

536
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,100
Before

537
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,200
Father always wanted to make decisions for you

538
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,400
But from now on

539
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:58,900
which path to take

540
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,166
what kind of person to be

541
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,533
Only you can decide for yourself

542
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,600
But no matter what choice you make

543
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:08,866
Father hopes you will be happy

544
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:16,600
Father

545
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,966
I know what I must do now

546
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,100
Marquis

547
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,866
Why are you sighing

548
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,500
Who is it

549
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,900
So it was you who saved me

550
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,166
Why did you save me

551
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:14,500
I saved you in order to

552
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,466
Ask the Marquis

553
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,500
If he still remembers a certain person

554
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,833
What person

555
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,433
Marquis

556
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,300
Do you still remember Kuai Ba Shi

557
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,300
Kuai Ba Shi

558
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,266
That evil filth from Gui Fang

559
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,900
What does that have to do with me

560
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,233
That vile evil creature

561
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,666
Doesn't the Marquis find it familiar

562
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:37,500
You

563
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,733
What do you mean

564
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,033
How is it that when it comes to the Marquis

565
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,833
It's always about father and son facing each other without recognition

566
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:49,966
Pity your eldest son

567
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,533
So young

568
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,733
To have died in the capital is one thing

569
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,300
But even to return his soul to his homeland

570
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,033
And rest in peace was not fulfilled

571
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,866
After so many years apart

572
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,833
Meeting his own father

573
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,533
Yet he became what his father called

574
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:04,966
A filthy evil creature

575
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,133
How fate toys with people

576
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:09,733
You

577
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,600
You're lying

578
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:13,966
That day, Marquis

579
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,633
When you saw the corpse puppet

580
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:17,766
Did you notice

581
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,366
The birthmark on its left arm

582
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:31,133
How could this be

583
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,266
How could this be

584
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,900
Who put you up to this

585
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:39,333
Why did you kill my son

586
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,666
The Marquis is old

587
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:43,400
His memory is failing

588
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:45,333
The one who killed your son

589
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,033
Was clearly the King of Shangshan

590
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:49,400
The one who harmed your son

591
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,300
Was you, who failed in refining the medicine

592
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:54,266
However

593
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,500
The greatest pity is

594
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:58,366
that when the Marquis refined the elixir of immortality back then

595
00:31:58,633 --> 00:31:59,866
he actually did not fail

596
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:00,966
You're talking nonsense

597
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,166
I was present throughout the entire process of refining the medicine

598
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,666
That medicine was fake

599
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,933
There simply is no such thing as

600
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:09,400
an elixir of immortality

601
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:12,833
At that time, the elixir of immortality had already been completed

602
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,733
Unfortunately, the Marquis, with his mortal eyes

603
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,900
failed to recognize the advent of the divine medicine

604
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,366
Thus, he lost

605
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,866
a once-in-a-millennium opportunity for wealth and glory

606
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,300
and instead incurred the wrath of Mount Shang

607
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,600
which led to the death of his own son

608
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,533
Shut up, shut up

609
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:31,433
The elixir of immortality was fake

610
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,400
I just

611
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,233
I just told the truth

612
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,033
It wasn't me

613
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:39,700
It wasn't me who caused my son's death

614
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,133
Today

615
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:43,466
is the second young master's birthday, right?

616
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,933
What a pity.

617
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,533
The Marquis has been in this dungeon

618
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,600
for a long time

619
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm afraid you are unaware

620
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:49,766
of the affairs outside

621
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,966
Your son originally escaped disaster

622
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,566
but to avenge you

623
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,333
he lost his life at the Eastern Lu Temple

624
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,266
What a filial child

625
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,866
Such a pity

626
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,533
Who sent you here

627
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,966
Why did you do this

628
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,133
In this lifetime

629
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,666
the grievances between you and me

630
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,466
end here

631
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:26,266
Do you want to know who I am

632
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:34,066
It's actually you

633
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,366
The elixir of immortality has appeared

634
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,233
Reporting to Your Majesty

635
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,200
the Imperial Star has risen

636
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,566
The previous divination

637
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,866
has likely already taken effect

638
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,066
Excellent

639
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:34,400
It has finally appeared

640
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,900
But Minister Gongsun just sent word that

641
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,000
trouble has erupted in the Gui方位

642
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,866
The Gui direction.

643
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:44,966
After years of lonely suffering, the elixir has finally emerged.

644
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:46,666
This is the top priority.

645
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,166
Issue the decree.

646
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,233
Order the Crown Prince's camp.

647
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,200
To immediately leave the city and search for the elixir.

648
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:55,766
The leader of the team.

649
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,866
Jiang yes Huan of the Marquis of Dongwu's Estate.

650
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,200
I do not understand.

651
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,666
Why would such an important task as searching for the elixir.

652
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:08,066
The King actually entrust it to.

653
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,800
Youngsters like Huan'er.

654
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,333
And not allow you or me to escort them.

655
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,900
What exactly is the reason?

656
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,066
Back when the Marquis of Ning Bo searched for the elixir.

657
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:17,133
The King was always wary of him.

658
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,100
Afraid he would monopolize the elixir.

659
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:20,200
And amass military power for himself.

660
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,033
Therefore.

661
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,433
He had the Ningzhou heir killed.

662
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:24,766
Now.

663
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:26,700
The elixir has emerged once again.

664
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:28,466
Do you think.

665
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,966
The King would still trust

666
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:32,133
Ministers like you and me?

667
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:33,933
Only as

668
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,300
the heirs held hostage by the feudal lords

669
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,266
go to seek the elixir

670
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,233
would they care for their mother states

671
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
and dare not embezzle the immortal elixir.

672
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:46,066
Your Majesty

673
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,466
is indeed thoughtful and thorough.

674
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:54,500
Rest assured

675
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,000
I will not let Huan'er come to harm.

676
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,600
It can only be so.

677
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,533
The decree is issued:

678
00:36:17,366 --> 00:36:19,866
We have heard of the heirs in the camp,

679
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,433
thus by the sovereign's command summoned,

680
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:23,166
to save Donglu from peril,

681
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,833
with fortified wine as drink,

682
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:25,766
their courage unmatched in the entire army.

683
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,866
They have also obtained the edict of Emperor Sheng'an,

684
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,133
reclaiming the treasure of our Shangshan—

685
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,233
the honor of the immortal elixir of longevity.

686
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,466
Now,

687
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,966
We specially permit these heirs to serve as envoys of Shangshan,

688
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,066
to journey on Our behalf to the Eastern Barbarians,

689
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,633
to seek the elixir for Us,

690
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,566
and ensure the eternal prosperity of our Shangshan.

691
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,433
Hearken, and give thanks.

692
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,300
Thanks to the King.

693
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,200
Jiang Wen Huan

694
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,633
This journey eastward,

695
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:55,733
By the King’s special decree, you are appointed

696
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:56,666
as the centurion of the Crown Prince’s camp.

697
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,566
Step forward and receive your orders.

698
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,500
This general receives his orders.

699
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:19,800
I have here a roster.

700
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,000
Those whose names are on it

701
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:23,600
shall depart with you.

702
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:32,600
I entrust it to you, Brother Chong.

703
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,266
Master,

704
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:41,333
if we follow what is written in the ancestral decree,

705
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:42,866
the location of the elixir of immortality—

706
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,300
could it be the Eastern Yi?

707
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,166
The decree does not specify clearly.

708
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,700
However, the material of this decree

709
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,266
is a type of leather specially produced

710
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,100
in the Eastern Yi state of Zhongli.

711
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,733
That is to say,

712
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:53,933
based on this clue,

713
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,733
the King has sent you to Zhongli.

714
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:56,866
Zhongli—

715
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:58,700
over ten years ago...

716
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:00,900
The state that has just submitted to our Shangshan

717
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,166
All of this is still just speculation

718
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Huan'er

719
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,000
This trip to Zhongli

720
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,266
Must be extremely cautious

721
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,933
Huan's understanding

722
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,466
Will certainly not fail to live up to Master's expectations

723
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,366
The immortality elixir

724
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,633
How could Zhongli possibly have the immortality elixir
