1
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,900
Arrest them all

2
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,733
Stop

3
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,100
Young Lady

4
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:52,933
You

5
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:54,800
Aren't you

6
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,466
How

7
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,266
Have you forgotten me so quickly

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,233
Bride

9
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,466
This

10
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:33,766
Brother Jiang

11
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
You know the young lady from Qiankun Alley

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,233
Why didn't you say so earlier

13
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:38,666
We're all one family

14
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,833
And yet we've caused such a scene

15
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,466
Enough

16
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,766
I have no relation to her

17
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,566
No relation

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,100
Really?

19
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,833
From what I see, the relationship between you two

20
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:57,000
Is hardly ordinary

21
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:05,866
Miss but

22
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,366
Our visit here this time

23
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,166
Is not meant to cause trouble

24
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,433
But rather for an important matter

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,000
The life-saving grace you showed me before, young master

26
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,366
Asi has always remembered

27
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:16,833
Please speak freely, young master

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,100
Have a seat

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,833
We have come this time

30
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,033
to search for

31
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,400
the lost Golden Domain warhorse

32
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,200
which is

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,766
the purebred steed of our Void Pavilion today

34
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,000
Actually

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,833
finding the horse thieves

36
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,433
is not difficult

37
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,266
Really?

38
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,600
What kind of place is our Qiankun Alley?

39
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Any piece of information in this East Lu City

40
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,033
there is none that Qiankun Alley cannot find

41
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,600
A group of horse thieves

42
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,100
trying to slip away unnoticed from our alley

43
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,433
is absolutely impossible

44
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,166
Are you sure

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
they fled in this direction?

46
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,766
The information from our Qiankun Alley has never been wrong

47
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,833
Have you checked

48
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,133
the entry and exit records of East Lu City today?

49
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,533
I sent Xin Jia back

50
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,166
to check together with Chong Yibiao.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,666
Why didn't Chong Yibiao come today?

52
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,333
Chong Yibiao insisted on investigating alone.

53
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,633
He still hasn't given us any updates.

54
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,300
About that incident at the arena that day.

55
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,533
Thank you.

56
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:38,800
By the way.

57
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,500
This, earlier—

58
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,566
I didn't know it was so precious.

59
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:42,666
Now I know.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,066
I'm returning it to you.

61
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,266
Once something is given away,

62
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,733
there's no sense in taking it back.

63
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,433
Wait.

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,433
There's bloodstains ahead.

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,333
Where is this?

66
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:10,666
This is the back door of my house.

67
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:19,833
Master.

68
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,300
A suspicious person was found outside the back door.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,600
Kill them.

70
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,033
Yes.

71
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,833
Li Laowu.

72
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,800
You still want to kill me?

73
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:29,800
My treasured daughter!

74
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,666
Why did you come back through the back door?

75
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,200
Dad!

76
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,533
Just joking with you.

77
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,333
If anyone dares to touch you,

78
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,266
I will take the lives of their entire family.

79
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,800
Old Li,

80
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,300
Apologies for disturbing you so late at night.

81
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,200
The bloodstains from the horse thief

82
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,066
clearly lead through the back gate of the Li residence.

83
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,533
Such a large area,

84
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:13,333
yet there can’t be no trace at all.

85
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:14,800
Look,

86
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,000
that storage room ahead—

87
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,033
Father,

88
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:35,066
A -i,

89
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,033
all of you,

90
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,300
go quickly and search for the thief’s trail.

91
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,133
It’s all my fault.

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,266
If Father hadn’t tried to save me,

93
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,400
he wouldn’t have been injured by that horse thief.

94
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,700
My apologies, Old Li.

95
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,333
It’s just a minor injury, don’t dwell on it.

96
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,266
It’s just a pity,

97
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,600
that the thief managed to escape.

98
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,900
I have some doubts,

99
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:11,800
as I’ve long heard—

100
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,933
Old Man Li's martial arts are peerless.

101
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,533
How could he be so easily injured by a petty thief?

102
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,566
It wasn't Jiang Wenjuan.

103
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:21,966
What do you mean by that?

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,466
Are you suspecting my father?

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,333
Of colluding with horse thieves?

106
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,366
Just to steal your horses?

107
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,366
No.

108
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,700
When my father was injured by the horse thieves,

109
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,633
I was right there beside him.

110
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,766
Don't measure the stature of a gentleman

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,533
with the mind of a petty man.

112
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,000
Our Li Manor does not welcome someone like you.

113
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,000
Get out.

114
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,133
I just think

115
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:37,966
these horse thieves...

116
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,133
I've caused quite a disturbance today.

117
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,800
I will visit another day to apologize to both of you properly.

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,433
About what just happened,

119
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,366
you also felt that something was off, right?

120
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,366
But if he deliberately lied to you,

121
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,333
what's the use of asking?

122
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,700
Brother E, you're truly unflappable.

123
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,566
Today's events are truly baffling

124
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:09,900
This thief

125
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,200
Clearly knows the Li Manor all too well

126
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,733
The Li family is suspicious

127
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:15,566
But stealing horses from the military camp

128
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,766
Without inside help

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Would be far from easy

130
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:18,900
Are you saying

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,666
Someone collaborated with them from the inside

132
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,200
Our Eastern Lu army has always maintained strict discipline

133
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,766
Could it be someone from the Heir's Camp

134
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,166
That's even more impossible

135
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,666
Hearts are inscrutable

136
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,000
The world is unpredictable

137
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:42,966
Could it really be someone from the Heir's Camp

138
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,166
Are there any clues in the city entry and exit records

139
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,066
The records of city entries and exits over the past six months

140
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:56,766
I've checked them all

141
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:57,866
No suspicious individuals

142
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,900
Brother Jiang

143
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:03,500
Brother Jiang

144
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,033
The horses have been found

145
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,300
Where did you find them

146
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,066
We've been searching all day

147
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,966
Just now when returning to camp

148
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,566
Found it in the nearby woods

149
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,633
Not a single hair out of place

150
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,766
Right in the nearby woods

151
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,366
Then let's hurry and comfort the little crybaby

152
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:25,166
Yao Shuliang

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,100
Has he been in the camp all along?

154
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,733
Report

155
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:39,766
Heir

156
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,733
The Military Defense Department has been robbed

157
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,366
The Donglu City defense map has been stolen

158
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:43,366
What

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,333
Fish soup

160
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,533
Doesn't Father dislike eating fish?

161
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,566
Strange

162
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:38,800
Well, well

163
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,466
We've all been fooled by the little crybaby

164
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,766
Usually, he seems timid and submissive

165
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:44,700
But after all this time

166
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:45,766
Turns out he's an expert at playing tricks

167
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,633
It seems

168
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:48,766
The horse theft was his doing

169
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,700
A deliberate diversion

170
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:50,666
To make us go out

171
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,700
Taking advantage of the camp being empty

172
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,033
So he could steal the map

173
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,133
No wonder when we left the camp

174
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,300
Brother Yao suddenly had a stomachache

175
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,300
and returned to the camp to use the latrine

176
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,466
No wonder

177
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,066
you found the horse on your way back to the camp

178
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,100
Indeed

179
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,500
The warhorse was not his main focus

180
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,166
But I still don’t understand

181
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:08,966
Yao Shuliang

182
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,100
why he would steal the city defense map

183
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,333
He is merely a young master from a small eastern state

184
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:13,933
Without the protection of Eastern Lu

185
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,800
his motherland

186
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,833
would have long been annexed by Guifang

187
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,333
What use

188
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,333
does this city defense map have for him

189
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:19,666
Oh no

190
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:22,933
They are going to launch a sneak attack on Eastern Lu City

191
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,366
Who

192
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:29,466
Guifang

193
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,700
Guifang again

194
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,700
The ones who colluded with Lord Ningbo in the beast fights before

195
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,300
were Guifang

196
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,166
But Brother Jiang

197
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,166
your Eastern Lu

198
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,633
What kind of grudge does he hold against the Gui faction?

199
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,566
Do you all still remember

200
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:46,900
what General Jiang said in class

201
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,266
about the East Lu Army's city defense being different from others?

202
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,833
It was designed according to the River Chart and Luo Writing

203
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,233
with nine on the head and one on the feet

204
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,433
three on the left and seven on the right

205
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:55,100
two and four as shoulders

206
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,300
six and eight as feet, and five in the center

207
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,366
Each straight line adds up

208
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,733
to the River Chart and Luo Writing

209
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,800
Brother Jiang

210
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,100
So your East Lu city defense map

211
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,433
is actually just like my gambling board

212
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,033
except my gambling board

213
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,433
starts from six and ends at five

214
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,866
while this city defense map is the exact opposite

215
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,300
starting from one and ending at nine

216
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,200
Exactly

217
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:11,966
Your gambling board

218
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:12,900
is one of the variations

219
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:13,466
of this River Chart and Luo Writing

220
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
How interesting.

221
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
As long as the city defense of my Donglu army

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,033
remains unbroken for a day

223
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
Guifang

224
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,266
will not gain any advantage for a day

225
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,333
Donglu is a fortress on the eastern border

226
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,700
Guifang has been invading year after year

227
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:27,800
This is hardly surprising

228
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,200
However

229
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,066
Guifang has always acted recklessly

230
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:32,666
attacking whenever they please

231
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,300
This time

232
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,066
they actually demanded the

233
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:36,866
city defense blueprint from the prince's camp lectures

234
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,000
Surely, it is to strike more effectively

235
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,300
If they obtain the city defense blueprint

236
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,766
then

237
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,300
Donglu

238
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,733
Donglu will be in grave danger

239
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,366
Given the circumstances

240
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,800
this is no longer a matter

241
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,900
that concerns you and me

242
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,700
I know

243
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,966
but if we report it rashly

244
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,400
Yao Shuliang will undoubtedly die

245
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,833
undoubtedly die

246
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,233
What does it have to do with me?

247
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:10,466
I only know

248
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,933
that if we do not report it

249
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,833
it will implicate everyone and all of Eastern Lu

250
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:17,500
Eastern Lu is my motherland

251
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,133
I am more anxious than anyone

252
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,566
For a deserter

253
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:22,566
is it worth it?

254
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,800
The current sovereign is suspicious

255
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,133
The matter has not been investigated clearly

256
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,533
yet he is already branded a traitor

257
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,033
What he will sacrifice

258
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,733
will also be his entire family

259
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:35,100
I believe Yao Shuliang

260
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,133
is definitely not such a person

261
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,233
Hypocritical and insincere

262
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,233
The plan for now

263
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,666
is that we must tonight

264
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,733
find Yao Shuliang

265
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,333
Only then can we break this deadlock

266
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:07,400
Stay away from me

267
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,766
Who wants to be with you

268
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:11,666
Let go

269
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,266
Why have these hoofprints disappeared?

270
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,766
Then how do we track them?

271
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:33,566
Over here.

272
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:36,333
How did you know

273
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:41,933
Tonight the dew is heavy in the deep night

274
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,266
All plants are covered with white dew

275
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,366
Only here there is none

276
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Someone must have been here

277
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:50,033
Brother E actually has such skills

278
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,466
Putting on an act

279
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,033
Brother E Shun is what you call accomplished in both literary and martial arts

280
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,000
Wise and resourceful

281
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,366
Can you do it

282
00:14:58,933 --> 00:14:59,833
If you can, then you do it

283
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,666
Fine, you lead the way

284
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,666
Right here

285
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,066
What does this mean

286
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:31,166
Yao Shuliang

287
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:33,800
Wait

288
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,533
Even like this you still want to talk

289
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:50,333
Little crybaby

290
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,966
Wait until I untie the rope for you

291
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:55,333
Then we’ll settle this properly

292
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,133
What is this smell

293
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:11,166
Xin Jia

294
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,033
Damn it

295
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,533
And you are

296
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,800
I told you long ago

297
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:28,966
Stay away from the Marquis’s residence

298
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,400
Father

299
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,033
I told you, but you don't believe me

300
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:34,700
I really just

301
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
wanted to help them out

302
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,366
Anyway

303
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,866
staying away from Jiang WenHuan

304
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,166
means staying away from trouble

305
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,966
Young lady

306
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,833
we found a clue about the horse thief

307
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:46,700
But Young Master Jiang and the others

308
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:48,766
what are they

309
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,933
panicking about

310
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,666
While we were searching

311
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,566
for clues about the horse thief

312
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:52,833
we noticed Young Master Jiang and the others

313
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,500
What Young Master Jiang

314
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,333
We're talking about the thief who hurt Father

315
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:57,700
Right

316
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:58,266
the thief

317
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,733
That group of thieves

318
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:00,933
disappeared outside Fengshan Forest

319
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm afraid that thief

320
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:04,600
is in grave danger

321
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:10,933
General Jiang

322
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:14,833
General

323
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,333
What exactly is going on?

324
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,166
Young Master Jiang and the heirs are missing

325
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:25,966
What

326
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,033
Jiang Wen-huan and the others went to Fengshan Forest

327
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,600
No wonder we've searched everywhere in the city

328
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,366
and couldn't find them

329
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,900
Yes

330
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,400
General Jiang

331
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:34,500
Then what should we do now

332
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,466
General

333
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:40,166
General

334
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,100
What's wrong now

335
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,100
There's trouble at the border

336
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Suspected invasion by the Gui Fang

337
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,200
In that case

338
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:47,833
Lord Gongsun

339
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,000
Generals Chen and Wang

340
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:49,933
Come with me to defend the city and quell the unrest

341
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,500
Tai Dian, at your command

342
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,200
Yes

343
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,766
You four, go to Fengshan Forest

344
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,266
to search for traces of Jiang Wen-huan

345
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,100
If there are any abnormalities, report back promptly

346
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,533
Yes, rest assured, General

347
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,533
Trouble, trouble!

348
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:03,366
Halt

349
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,566
This is a restricted military area, do not barge in

350
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,233
General Jiang

351
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,433
Your family's heir

352
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,966
Jiang Wenhuan is in trouble

353
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,433
If you don't come out soon

354
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,533
Jiang Wenhuan will lose his life

355
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,233
Here

356
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,266
Jiang Wenhuan is in trouble

357
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:19,633
What happened

358
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,533
Jiang Wenhuan is in danger

359
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,800
What should we do

360
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,733
Young Master Jiang

361
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,133
Long time no see, I hope you've been well

362
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,300
Who are you

363
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,500
Why are you pressing so hard step by step

364
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,400
What a clever series of schemes

365
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,533
If I'm not mistaken

366
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,800
Stealing the horses

367
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:52,400
Was just your

368
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,833
Trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain

369
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,700
All to take advantage of the camp's emptiness

370
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,466
So that Yao Shuliang

371
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,033
Could steal the city defense plans

372
00:18:59,066 --> 00:18:59,700
And buy time

373
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,233
Young Master Jiang is indeed clever

374
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,500
I've long heard that East Lu City's

375
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,200
City defense layout is meticulous

376
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,700
If we rashly invade

377
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,133
One wrong move leads to many

378
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,400
Our Gui side has fought against Eastern Lu for years

379
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,233
Naturally, we dare not advance recklessly

380
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,166
You already have the maps in your hands

381
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:22,833
Why go to the extra trouble

382
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,033
Of capturing me and bringing me here

383
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,366
Just based on that coward Yao Shuliang

384
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,233
Who delivered the maps

385
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,833
It's still not enough to be trusted

386
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:34,900
How can we know if it isn't

387
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,833
A smokescreen intentionally released by you

388
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,033
So you went to great lengths

389
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,566
Just to capture me and make me draw maps for you

390
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,433
Not you

391
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,533
But all of you

392
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
Now your companions

393
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,700
Are also imprisoned elsewhere

394
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,200
Drawing maps simultaneously with you

395
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:56,466
If anyone falsifies

396
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,900
And draws something different from the others

397
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,600
They will be executed immediately

398
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,233
But if all of you wish to survive

399
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,466
Then there's only one way

400
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,133
Which is for everyone to draw the real diagram

401
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,300
I advise Young Master Jiang

402
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,966
To stop playing tricks

403
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,533
Your brothers

404
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,533
Have already picked up their brushes

405
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,700
Big brother

406
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,833
I didn't remember anything

407
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:40,933
I was sleeping during class

408
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,400
I never listened at all

409
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,000
If I draw the real diagram

410
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,900
And everyone else draws fake ones?

411
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,066
All four are different

412
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,000
How will you tell them apart?

413
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,466
So, you're hoping

414
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,833
That I entrust my life

415
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,833
To others?

416
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Young Master Jiang, please proceed

417
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,300
What?

418
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,100
Finished so quickly?

419
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,100
Get out

420
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,400
Hurry up and leave

421
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,666
Guards!

422
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,200
They really are all cowards

423
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,466
I see your Eastern Lu

424
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,900
is not so monolithic after all

425
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,900
Never expected that

426
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,300
these five maps

427
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,766
would truly be identical

428
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,100
Good

429
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,400
It seems you heirs of the feudal lords

430
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:44,900
are nothing special

431
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,666
just a bunch of cowardly rats who fear death

432
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,466
With these city defense maps in hand

433
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,066
my Guifang Kingdom’s invasion of Eastern Lu

434
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,066
is imminent

435
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:58,300
Wishful thinking

436
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,800
Don’t celebrate too soon

437
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,500
If you have the guts, fight me one-on-one

438
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,033
Step back

439
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,766
Still talking tough when death is at your door

440
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,200
It seems Eastern Lu truly has no worthy successors

441
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:12,366
The maps

442
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,866
I told you they were all real

443
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:16,733
Now

444
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,166
can you let us go now

445
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:23,633
Let you go

446
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,433
My Guifang’s elite troops

447
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,900
Poised to strike in the eastern Lu territory.

448
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,500
Let you go back.

449
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,866
So you can report to your superiors, is that it?

450
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:35,866
Sir.

451
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:36,533
Sir.

452
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,466
No, I promise.

453
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,800
I definitely won’t cause any trouble.

454
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,066
Definitely won’t cause any trouble.

455
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:42,966
How about…

456
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,866
How about…

457
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,433
You kill them first.

458
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,000
Spare my life alone.

459
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,566
I can show you the way.

460
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:58,600
You little crybaby.

461
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,066
Never thought you’d be so timid.

462
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,400
Yet so vicious at heart.

463
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:03,633
Sir.

464
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,000
I must have been blind.

465
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,566
Earlier I even helped you find your horse.

466
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,700
And now it’s come to this.

467
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,366
Even if I become a ghost.

468
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,066
I’ll drag you down with me.

469
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:14,166
Sir.

470
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,700
Hurry up and kill them.

471
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,166
Sir.

472
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,233
Get out of my way

473
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:27,133
What's going on

474
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,033
This general has no time to spare

475
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:39,833
To deal with you brats

476
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:40,666
Retreat

477
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:41,433
After them

478
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:49,100
Miss but

479
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,266
Are you sure Brother Wen Huan disappeared around here

480
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:54,166
Right at the abandoned temple not far away

481
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:56,566
We owe thanks to Miss Asi for coming to inform us

482
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,000
Brother Wen Huan is truly fortunate to have
such great luck

483
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,433
To have a confidante like Miss Asi

484
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,500
Who says I'm his confidante

485
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,533
I just owed him half a life before

486
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,266
And now I'm returning it to him

487
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,633
Look

488
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,200
Isn't there an abandoned temple up ahead

489
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:21,333
Everyone, search around

490
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,300
Something's wrong

491
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:27,366
That Kuifang person clearly entered this room

492
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,300
How did they vanish in the blink of an eye

493
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,266
They even blocked the door

494
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Bad luck

495
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:39,466
This is a mechanism-filled secret room

496
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,466
Only by finding the hidden mechanisms and secret doors

497
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,300
can we get out

498
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,233
Then we won't be trapped here

499
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,033
unable to escape, right

500
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:50,900
This secret room

501
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,366
has a faint breeze passing through

502
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,100
and the sound of water

503
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,566
There must be a way out

504
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:03,466
Wait a moment

505
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,733
Yao Shuliang

506
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,566
Which side are you really on

507
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:07,766
One moment you want to kill us

508
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:08,500
the next you want to save us

509
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,466
You've completely confused me

510
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:11,700
Brother Jia

511
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:14,100
How come you still don't understand

512
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,233
The map I drew with you all

513
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,200
is exactly the same

514
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:18,866
When you mention this city defense map

515
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,766
it makes me even more puzzled

516
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,300
Clearly, I drew a fake one

517
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,133
Could it be

518
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,166
that I remembered wrong

519
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I drew one

520
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,100
And it actually appeared

521
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,966
If one wishes to draw an identical fake map

522
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:35,966
There is only one way

523
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:37,366
That is for everyone to have seen

524
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,333
The template of this fake map

525
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,966
My Heluo gambling wheel

526
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,666
Is made from the ancient Hetu diagram

527
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,000
Heluo gambling wheel

528
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,700
The name sounds quite intimidating

529
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,900
So your Donglu city defense map

530
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:56,766
And my gambling wheel

531
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,300
Share a striking resemblance in different forms

532
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,633
To achieve a perfect deception

533
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,300
We had no choice but to follow the Heluo gambling wheel

534
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,433
And draw a fake map

535
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,566
Fortunately

536
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,333
Everyone had the same idea

537
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,966
During the map verification

538
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,300
Little crybaby gave me a signal

539
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,933
To seize the opportunity and act when the time is right

540
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,966
This bet can be won

541
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:26,033
The Gambling King of Western Sichuan deserves much credit.

542
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,466
I told you so.

543
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:28,566
A small gamble is just for fun.

544
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,366
A blinded cat caught a dead rat.

545
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:51,966
Did you guys hear something?

546
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
I think I found the door.

547
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,766
Oh no.

548
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:04,866
It's a water dungeon.

549
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,400
Why is there no one here?

550
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,900
Yeah, no one.

551
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:23,700
Did we come too late?

552
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,533
Maybe they've already left.

553
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:34,833
Heaven bless us.

554
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:35,766
God of Gambling, protect us.

555
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,200
I, Xin Jia,

556
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,466
have yet to experience the beauties of this world.

557
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,066
I can't die here.

558
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,133
Brother Chong,

559
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,133
talking wastes energy.

560
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,400
You'll die faster.

561
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:45,733
What do we do now?

562
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,366
We're not really going to die here, are we?

563
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,600
Alright, crybaby.

564
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,666
Do you really think there isn't enough water already?

565
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,300
Save your tears, will you?

566
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,800
Let's go check somewhere else.

567
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,466
Go.

568
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,133
Wait a moment.

569
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,100
Donglu City hasn't had rain for a long time.

570
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:13,200
Why is the ground wet?

571
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,633
Everyone, lend a hand.

572
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,200
Move these two bricks aside.

573
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,900
There's definitely a problem.

574
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,933
Everyone, quickly dig this area up.

575
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:46,766
Brother Chong.

576
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,200
My chest feels so tight.

577
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,000
I can't catch my breath.

578
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,233
If you want to live,

579
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:53,533
then shut up.

580
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,366
Survive.

581
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,766
A-Ye.

582
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,833
E Shun.

583
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:36,966
What's wrong with you?

584
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:38,900
E Shun.

585
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,800
What's wrong with you?

586
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,366
Born a lowly slave.

587
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:51,566
E Shun.

588
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:54,166
I don't want to owe you.

589
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,833
Brother Jiang.

590
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,466
I don't want

591
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:01,200
to owe you.

592
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,966
E Shun.

593
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,633
ku ku ku .

594
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,400
I am

595
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,233
Where am I

596
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,366
Did I survive

597
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:37,800
Father

598
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,700
Mother

599
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,166
I miss you so much

600
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:14,966
It's Brother Xin Jia and the others

601
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:15,833
Quick, pull them up

602
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:35,700
What are you doing

603
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:37,400
What do you mean, what am I doing

604
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:37,866
I saw you were unconscious

605
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:38,900
I wanted to give you mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

606
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:49,033
Thank you

607
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:50,033
I'm fine now

608
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:53,833
You didn't think

609
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:54,966
I was going to do something to you, did you

610
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,833
You sure have quite the imagination

611
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,633
Alright, alright, stop talking

612
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:02,400
E Shun just woke up; let him take a moment to recover

613
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,166
How are you feeling

614
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm fine

615
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:10,566
Underwater

616
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,000
What exactly happened to you

617
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,433
Trapped in the water prison

618
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,033
Exhausted my strength

619
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:22,133
Sorry

620
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,100
I worried everyone

621
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,200
Do you still remember what you said

622
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:32,200
What did I say

623
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,466
You were talking nonsense while you were unconscious

624
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:45,300
I must have had a nightmare

625
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,133
I don’t remember

626
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,133
talking in my sleep

627
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:54,000
Well

628
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,066
Since Lord E Shun is awake

629
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:57,866
let’s all get ready

630
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:58,900
and head down the mountain early

631
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,066
Wait a moment

632
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:26,533
This time

633
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:30,766
it truly was me

634
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:32,566
who let you all down

635
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,766
I dragged you into this

636
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,666
The cause of this matter

637
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,566
stems from a letter from home

638
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,266
I received a few days ago

639
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,533
I initially thought

640
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,566
it was about my mother’s worsening illness

641
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,733
but what I never expected was

642
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,633
that inside this letter

643
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,800
was also a threatening note from Gui Fang

644
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,166
According to what the letter said

645
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
My homeland is plagued by civil strife

646
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,500
The rebels have colluded with the Gui Fang people

647
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,433
and taken control of my family

648
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,633
They ordered me to steal the city defense map of Donglu City

649
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,133
or my family's lives would be forfeit

650
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:12,966
They even

651
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,033
imprinted the letter with

652
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,733
my mother's bloody handprint

653
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:21,366
I had no choice

654
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,100
and was desperate to save them

655
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,233
so I could only follow their commands

656
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,833
Brother Tao, I am sorry

657
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,666
I used the sleepwalking Brother Tao

658
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,766
to go to the Qian Room

659
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:41,600
to divert your attention, Brother Jiang, and the others

660
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:44,533
Then I came to the stables

661
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:46,600
and, as instructed by the Gui Fang people

662
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,666
released all the Golden Realm warhorses

663
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,933
pretending they had been stolen

664
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,733
to make you go search for them

665
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:57,566
leaving

666
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,466
and drawing you away from the heir's camp

667
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,066
I then sent a message to inform the Guifang people.

668
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,700
I was afraid that if I were even a step too late,

669
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,233
they would harm my parents.

670
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Then,

671
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,466
I secretly slipped a sedative into the water bowl.

672
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,700
The guarding soldiers

673
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,666
had no suspicion of me.

674
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,933
After drinking the water I brought,

675
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,200
soon,

676
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,166
they all passed out.

677
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:29,300
I took the chance to grab the guards' keys,

678
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:31,666
sneaked into the lecture hall,

679
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,933
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,133
But I knew well

681
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,333
that the city defense map was crucial to Donglu City.

682
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,766
If Donglu City fell,

683
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,200
then Mount Shang would be in danger.

684
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,033
Therefore,

685
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,833
I combined Brother Xin Jia's Heluo gambling wheel,

686
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,366
and drew up a fake map,

687
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,100
which I gave to the Guifang people.

688
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,566
I know I have committed a grave mistake,

689
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,166
and do not seek everyone's forgiveness.

690
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,166
I only ask for one chance

691
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,233
To let me return to my homeland

692
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,500
And die in my native land

693
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:36,500
Thank you, brothers, for helping me

694
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,233
Let me go back to my homeland

695
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:39,133
We cannot let you go

696
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:50,800
If we let you

697
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:53,133
All of us

698
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,300
Will be punished as accomplices

699
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,966
I did deceive everyone

700
00:38:59,133 --> 00:38:59,800
But

701
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:02,733
But I never intended to betray the Prince's camp

702
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,266
Then you should act like a man

703
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,700
And return to camp with us

704
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,366
To bear the punishment you deserve

705
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,666
I

706
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:11,033
Wait

707
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:15,866
Jiang Wenjuan

708
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:17,966
Do not forget

709
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,366
The Gui Fang elite troops

710
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:23,366
Are poised and ready at the eastern Lu border

711
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,933
Do you want to wait for them?

712
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,833
This is the position of "Dai Jiu Lü Yi"

713
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,066
Seize this watchtower

714
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,233
Just like blinding the eyes of the Donglu defenders.

715
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,700
Within a single day

716
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,566
they could advance unhindered

717
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,166
and capture Donglu.

718
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:00,500
Send the signal.

719
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:01,200
Understood.

720
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,666
Damn it.

721
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,766
This is the wolf-smoke signal of the Gui faction.

722
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,200
They are preparing to attack the city.
