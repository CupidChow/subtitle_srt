1
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,433
Chong Yibiao didn't make a move.

2
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,700
What? He actually didn't make a move?

3
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,166
Yes.

4
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,600
Chong Yiwu, that useless thing.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,433
The Crown Prince was frightened yesterday at the East Martial Marquis's residence.

6
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,433
This is something the General specifically ordered us servants

7
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,833
to prepare: a calming soup.

8
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,900
To soothe the nerves and replenish energy.

9
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,733
Thank the General for his kind intentions.

10
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,800
Will the Crown Princess deliver it personally?

11
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:56,600
It's fine.

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,300
A dignified Crown Princess,

13
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,000
actually doing the work of us servants.

14
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,033
Keep your voice down.

15
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,733
This Crown Princess is truly not simple.

16
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,266
At yesterday's banquet,

17
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,400
those two brothers almost came to blows

18
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:15,500
over her.

19
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,666
That Second Young Master Chong is quite terrifying.

20
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,033
I thought

21
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,366
he was really going to kill his own brother.

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,266
Let's go, let's go.

23
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,266
Go, go.

24
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:38,766
Crown Princess!

25
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,300
Someone has been killed!

26
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
It's truly an outrage against heaven and reason.

27
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,433
Yes.

28
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,033
Utterly devoid of conscience, unforgivable by heaven and earth.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,333
Absolutely, it really is.

30
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,000
General.

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Lord Gongsun.

32
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,166
I have already examined it.

33
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,166
The fatal wound on the chest

34
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,400
is deeper at the top and shallower at the bottom,

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,233
appearing everted.

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,966
It indeed matches the shape of this blade, the Warrior's Edge.

37
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,400
I did not kill him.

38
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,233
But it's just as well that he's dead.

39
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,633
Saves me the trouble of doing it myself.

40
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,900
You audacious scoundrel!

41
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,600
How dare you still quibble at a time like this!

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,066
Chong Yibiao has killed his own flesh and blood,

43
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,166
an evil act truly unheard of.

44
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,066
We request the General and Lord Gongsun

45
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,133
to immediately apprehend this individual of heinous crimes.

46
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,200
Try and punish for the crime

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,333
We ask General Jiang and Lord Gongsun

48
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,066
to immediately try and punish him for the crime

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,533
in order to quell the anger of the people

50
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,600
The few esteemed gentlemen present here

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,666
believe they represent the will of the people

52
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:02,800
Young Master Jiang

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,733
What do you mean by this

54
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,200
In front of everyone

55
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,166
The evidence is conclusive

56
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,500
Could it be that Eastern Lu

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,966
intends to shield the criminal

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,866
Indeed

59
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:13,600
In front of everyone

60
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,133
May I ask all of you esteemed gentlemen

61
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,433
Which of you personally witnessed Chong Yibiao

62
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,333
wielding the blade to kill someone

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,466
The evidence is conclusive

64
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,066
Is this evidence witness testimony

65
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:23,900
or physical evidence

66
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,566
This Warrior's Blade is the physical evidence

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,133
Right, indeed

68
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,466
This Warrior's Blade

69
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,466
though unique

70
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,533
but the blade marks of the Warrior's Blade

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,666
It might not be impossible to replicate.

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,866
Then how do you explain

73
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,500
that at the time of the incident, Chong Yibiao

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,666
was precisely at the scene?

75
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,766
Yes, how do you explain that?

76
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:44,966
Besides Chong Yibiao,

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,300
were you all not

78
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,633
also here in the Marquis of Dongwu's residence at the time?

79
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,300
If that's the case,

80
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,300
then everyone in this residence is a suspect.

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,733
You—this is

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,333
sheer nonsense!

83
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,366
Young Master Jiang, you have quite a sharp tongue.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,866
This Chong Yibiao

85
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,766
and his brother are like fire and water—

86
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,500
we are all witnesses to that!

87
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,333
If we're talking about motive for murder,

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
who else could it be but Chong Yibiao?

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
Who else?

90
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,366
If we're talking about motive for murder,

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think all of you

92
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,100
have even less clarity to offer.

93
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:17,500
You—

94
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,333
yesterday, you were peeping at the consort.

95
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,766
Caught red-handed by Chong Yiwu

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,466
You you

97
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,133
I am

98
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,333
Isn't that right

99
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,366
You

100
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,733
Had long been dissatisfied with Chong Yiwu

101
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,633
Repeatedly treated him with disdain

102
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:31,666
Right

103
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:32,833
Young Master Jiang, you

104
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,500
You two

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,766
Who was it that said after yesterday's banquet

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,733
This Chong Yiwu

107
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,100
Has no talent, no conduct

108
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,900
No virtue, no affection

109
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,433
The Northern Earl

110
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,266
Actually dotes on this heir so much

111
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,633
Nothing of the sort

112
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,400
How did it go again

113
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,933
Said he was, blind as a bat

114
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,300
It was you, right

115
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,800
Young Master Jiang, you

116
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,500
It was you

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,433
Enough

118
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,666
All present here

119
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,200
Are people of insight

120
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,766
It's not your turn, you brat

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,933
To order people around here

122
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,500
Everyone knows.

123
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,966
The evidence is insufficient.

124
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,966
It is not enough to draw a hasty conclusion.

125
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,366
Right?

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Since that is the case,

127
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,833
my Eastern Martial Marquis Estate

128
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,000
cannot easily assign blame either.

129
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,033
and wrong an innocent person.

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,900
Otherwise,

131
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,333
when the time comes and you all meet the King,

132
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,466
and the Northern Bo Marquis Estate,

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,233
there will be no way to explain it.

134
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,966
But rest assured, everyone,

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,466
this incident occurred in Eastern Lu,

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,633
which is a provocation against Eastern Lu.

137
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500
My Eastern Martial Marquis Estate

138
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,700
will never let it slide.

139
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,700
We will investigate it thoroughly.

140
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:34,900
Jiang Wenxuan.

141
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,333
Subordinate General present.

142
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,366
I now order you to take full responsibility

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,266
for investigating this case thoroughly.

144
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,133
Before the Gaomei Sacrifice,

145
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:43,933
the true culprit must be found.

146
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,233
Subordinate General accepts the order.

147
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,333
Subordinate General will definitely uncover the truth.

148
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,600
To clear everyone's name

149
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,433
Then I must trouble you gentlemen

150
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,700
To stay at the Marquis's residence for a few more days

151
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,300
To assist in the investigation

152
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,766
As for Chong Yibiao

153
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:03,933
Take him to the Marquis's dungeon

154
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,333
Await interrogation

155
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,433
Guards

156
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,866
The task you entrusted to me

157
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:39,766
I have completed

158
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:43,100
On the day the heir's wish is fulfilled

159
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,866
Could you honor the agreement and let me go

160
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,633
As for the upcoming Gaomei sacrifice

161
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
My useless body is of little use

162
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,033
I hope you will not forget the Marquis's past kindness

163
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,866
And handle it personally

164
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,833
Heir, rest assured

165
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,400
I will certainly abide by the agreement with the old Marquis

166
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:14,766
In today's court session

167
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,666
You were somewhat thoughtless

168
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,600
You disapprove of my approach

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,900
Whether you approve or not

170
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,066
This matter is undeniably linked to Donglu

171
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:25,966
You also think this matter

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
is targeting Eastern Lu

173
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,700
Not just Eastern Lu

174
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,600
At present, it seems

175
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,900
it is also targeting the Crown Prince's camp

176
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,966
We actually thought alike

177
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,800
Once the elixir of immortality appeared

178
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,766
and the Crown Prince's camp was set up in Eastern Lu

179
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,200
Eastern Lu has not had a single day of peace

180
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,700
This is my fault

181
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,800
Originally, I couldn't stop the sovereign

182
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,466
which is why I proposed

183
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,533
You must not blame yourself

184
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,300
Blame this elixir of immortality instead

185
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,500
I actually think

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,766
this is no elixir

187
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,333
but more like a calamitous object that brings disaster to the state

188
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,500
Eldest Young Master

189
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,000
Do not speak of this again

190
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,166
If the sovereign finds out

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,333
Eastern Lu will face great calamity

192
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,200
I understand

193
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,600
Now

194
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:16,366
we can only rely on Huan

195
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
What clues have been found?

196
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,100
Crown Prince

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,400
Open the door

198
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,066
Yes

199
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,433
Stubborn mule

200
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,866
Are you alright

201
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:50,400
Are you injured

202
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,333
Did they torture you for a confession

203
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,100
Did they give you any food

204
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,400
Let me see

205
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,566
Torture for a confession and withholding food

206
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,733
What do you take our Dongwu Marquis Estate for

207
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,100
That stubborn mule is now being framed

208
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,866
Someone must be behind it

209
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,000
Who knows what other underhanded tricks

210
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:01,900
Those demons and monsters might have

211
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,100
Why do you believe I was framed

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,700
Stubborn mule

213
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,666
Although you're usually annoying

214
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,000
You are proud and arrogant

215
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,666
You wouldn't even take an unfair advantage in field assessments

216
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,366
If you wanted to deal with your brother

217
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,933
You'd at least win fair and square

218
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:14,800
Blameless.

219
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,333
Right?

220
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,566
Impossible to commit such a fratricidal act.

221
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,866
Don't talk as if you know me well.

222
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,666
No, brother, what time is it now?

223
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,366
Still being stubborn?

224
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:23,633
We've drunk together.

225
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,233
Been punished together, faced life and death as brothers.

226
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,866
Then tell me, if you're in trouble.

227
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,700
Would we not believe you and help you?

228
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,600
I am not your brother.

229
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,266
Nor do I need your pity.

230
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,600
Look at you, stubborn, still so stubborn.

231
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,233
Why must you push people so far away?

232
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:39,266
You clearly know.

233
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:40,533
In this world.

234
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,733
There are still those who truly care about you.

235
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,200
Brother Chong, this matter is of great importance.

236
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:45,933
I'll speak bluntly.

237
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:47,766
You have great ambitions.

238
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:48,766
And extraordinary talent.

239
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,566
If it's because of your brother's matter

240
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
and you ruin yourself

241
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,566
bearing the blame

242
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,633
wouldn't that be too bad?

243
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,200
Why are you helping me?

244
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,300
Well

245
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't know about the two of them

246
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,066
but as for me

247
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,533
I just want you to owe me

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
I'll see if in the future

249
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,100
you still dare

250
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,866
to put on that stinky donkey face of yours

251
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,766
in front of me, your savior

252
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,133
As for me

253
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,133
I naturally can't stand these

254
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,766
dirty tricks, that's all

255
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:28,166
And you?

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,333
For the sake of a promise

257
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:35,600
Brother Chong

258
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,733
So what exactly happened back then?

259
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,066
Why did you show up

260
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,300
in Chong Yiwu's room with a knife?

261
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,566
How did Chong Yiwu actually die?

262
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,700
I don't know

263
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,533
That day after returning

264
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,633
I was feeling upset

265
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,633
and practicing martial arts in the courtyard

266
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:57,666
when suddenly I received news that

267
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:59,500
the Marquis Father was critically ill

268
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,733
and Chong Yiwu intended to kill me

269
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,233
saying he would make sure I never return to Libei

270
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,266
I was filled with anxiety at that moment

271
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,366
and without even putting down my blade

272
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,133
I rushed to confront him

273
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:12,700
Chong Yiwu

274
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,500
I yielded a foot to you

275
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,433
yet you bullied me even more

276
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:19,666
Get up

277
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:41,766
Crown Princess

278
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,600
Murder

279
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
That letter

280
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,300
who sent it

281
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,266
do you know

282
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:56,433
Later I thought

283
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,166
it must have been the real culprit

284
00:12:58,633 --> 00:12:59,566
trying to lure me there

285
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,800
to make me the scapegoat

286
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,233
This person knows Brother Chong so well

287
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,166
they must have witnessed it

288
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,633
The grudge between you and Chong Yiwu

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,133
is why such a scheme was devised

290
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,933
This matter

291
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,333
is truly not simple

292
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:13,700
Brother Chong

293
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,266
Regarding the Blade of the Brave

294
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,333
are there any aspects that are difficult to replicate?

295
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,033
There is indeed one

296
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,733
that no one can imitate

297
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,166
How so?

298
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,500
Could it truly be as Brother Chong said?

299
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,533
The Blade of the Brave

300
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,500
is forged from meteorite copper from the far north

301
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:02,900
extremely cold and sinister

302
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,733
The wounds it inflicts

303
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,933
cause blood vessels to instantly freeze and burst

304
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,233
flesh sealed by the chilling cold

305
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,000
At the time, very little blood is shed

306
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,766
but after a few hours

307
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,266
when the cold recedes and the ice melts

308
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,366
the gruesome scene of mangled flesh

309
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,133
and ruptured blood vessels becomes visible

310
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,266
Chong Yiwu's wound was clean and precise

311
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,933
with neatly severed blood vessels.

312
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,733
There is no Blade of the Brave

313
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,233
The resulting bloodline rupture

314
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,966
That is to say

315
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
Someone has forged the Blade of the Brave

316
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,066
Exactly

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,100
This person, in such a short time

318
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,566
Could create such a divine weapon

319
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:37,300
Must be someone

320
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,166
Quite familiar with Donglu

321
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,066
Brother Jiang

322
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:47,533
Where are you going

323
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,800
Since it's someone familiar with Donglu

324
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,500
Then let's see if there's a person

325
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,233
Willing to help us

326
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:10,866
Brother Jiang

327
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,400
Who exactly are we waiting for

328
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:13,700
Waiting for someone

329
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,400
There's a person who can help us investigate this matter

330
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,200
Because in Donglu

331
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,000
The place capable of forging the Blade of the Brave

332
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:21,700
I'm afraid

333
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,966
Is only Qiankun Alley

334
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,166
Look, the person is here

335
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,866
What

336
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:31,700
Jiang Wen Huan

337
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
So you also have a day where you need to ask this young lady for help

338
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:41,466
After you, miss

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,766
Thank you both

340
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,733
The best weapon shop in Qiankun Alley

341
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,866
The one and only, no other branches

342
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:03,233
Miss, what brings you here

343
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,366
Who are these people

344
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,533
There's no need to be nervous, sir

345
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:06,566
They are all my friends

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,466
They've come to seek your advice

347
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,166
Since they are all the young lady's friends

348
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,133
I will certainly hold nothing back

349
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,600
When you, sir, create something

350
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,133
It's nothing but masterpieces

351
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,800
The customers who come and go

352
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,966
Must undoubtedly be either rich or noble

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,133
That goes without saying

354
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,366
These distinguished people

355
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,133
Are all difficult to please

356
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,900
Their demands for weapons are extremely苛刻

357
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
Presumably

358
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,466
There must be times when even you, sir, find it beyond your ability

359
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,833
It's not that I'm boasting

360
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,833
As long as it's a request made by a client,

361
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,666
there is no weapon I cannot craft.

362
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:44,166
This object—

363
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,533
Has anyone recently

364
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:46,233
commissioned you to make it?

365
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,200
This.

366
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,100
No.

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,000
I have absolutely never seen this item.

368
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
I knew at a single glance that I had not seen it.

369
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,500
Are you certain you don't need to take another look?

370
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,700
In my lifetime,

371
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,966
I have examined countless weapons.

372
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,666
Whether I've seen it or made it—

373
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,133
I naturally know in an instant.

374
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,733
This matter is urgent.

375
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:16,933
If there is any mistake,

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,533
it may implicate Qiankun Alley.

377
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:19,533
Are you sure you haven't seen it?

378
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:21,033
Rest assured, miss.

379
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,300
This old life of mine

380
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,100
was saved by Elder Li.

381
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,866
I swear on my reputation as Ghosthand Fourth Brother—

382
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,333
I would never do

383
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,033
anything to betray Qiankun Alley.

384
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:33,866
Let's go

385
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,766
Thank you for your trouble

386
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,133
Take care, everyone

387
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:58,766
Go

388
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,266
Take this

389
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,133
and give it to that person

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,066
This

391
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:03,766
Hurry up and go

392
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,733
Uncle Ghost Hand's entire life

393
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,866
has been built on reputation and integrity

394
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,700
Since he's sworn on his honor

395
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
he absolutely would not lie

396
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Even if you stake out here all day

397
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,200
you'll only end up empty-handed

398
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,566
Don’t speak too soon

399
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,933
What do you mean by that

400
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:34,466
Are you suggesting

401
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,400
that we, the people of Qiankun Alley

402
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,833
are colluding with criminals

403
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,633
And you are

404
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,400
That shop owner was so respectful to you

405
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,433
but so dismissive about what you asked him to do

406
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,833
It feels deliberate

407
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:45,400
Besides

408
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:46,800
that assistant

409
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,200
that assistant wasn't as composed as he was

410
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,066
I panicked at the sight of that picture.

411
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,666
But why would Uncle Ghosthand lie?

412
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,166
Only he himself would know that.

413
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,500
What about Xin Jia?

414
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,666
Brother Jiang, these chestnuts are pretty good.

415
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,366
Try one quickly.

416
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,133
Chase.

417
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,433
Little brother.

418
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,733
Where are you trying to go?

419
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:27,166
I...

420
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,133
I...

421
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,833
I don't know anything.

422
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,300
If you have the guts, kill me.

423
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:36,566
Who said anything about killing you?

424
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,133
This is Qiankun Alley, after all.

425
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,500
You've tied me up.

426
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,500
None of you can escape.

427
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,400
Is that so?

428
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,533
If you confess truthfully, I’ll naturally let you go.

429
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:47,666
That knife—

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,133
Have you seen it or not?

431
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,933
Even if you don’t tell me, I can find out myself.

432
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,333
But when the time comes, the one suffering won’t—

433
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:57,200
be just you.

434
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,666
Uncle Guishou will also be expelled from Qiankun Alley

435
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,900
You'd better think carefully

436
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,866
A few days ago

437
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,400
Someone brought a strange knife diagram

438
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,866
Requested knife-making

439
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,766
Then tell me that person's full name

440
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,433
What was their physique like

441
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,366
What was their appearance like

442
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:13,333
That person

443
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,400
Wore a wind hat and cloak

444
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,666
Covering their body and face

445
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,633
Their left foot seemed injured

446
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,100
Was a cripple

447
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:21,966
Your master told you

448
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,933
To tip that person off

449
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:31,433
It's a trap

450
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,933
What trap

451
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,900
The person is gone

452
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:42,933
Well done

453
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,500
Actually used subordinates to divert us

454
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,566
Went to tip them off yourself

455
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:47,066
Could it be

456
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,966
Uncle Guishou is really related to the murderer

457
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,666
Brother Jiang

458
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,866
Now that the clue is broken, what should we do

459
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,500
It's not like we're completely without clues.

460
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:54,700
The clerk said,

461
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,666
that person is lame.

462
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:58,700
But we don't know

463
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,000
whether what he said is true or false.

464
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,000
We coaxed this statement out of him,

465
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,066
so it should be true.

466
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,066
Besides,

467
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,933
telling such a lie doesn't help anything.

468
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,633
Then you say a cripple

469
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,900
couldn't possibly have killed Chong Yiwu.

470
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,800
Usually, when coming in and out of Qiankun Alley,

471
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:11,966
how many routes are there?

472
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:13,200
Only one.

473
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,766
It's the water route we came in by.

474
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:15,800
The murderer is one person,

475
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,600
and they should still be in Qiankun Alley right now.

476
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,066
How do you know?

477
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:20,500
The water route of your Qiankun Alley

478
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
isn't something an ordinary person can navigate.

479
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,300
The shopkeeper is over fifty years old

480
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,600
and simply doesn't have the physical strength.

481
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,666
Usually, coming and going in Qiankun Alley

482
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
must all be done by the clerks rowing boats, right?

483
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:30,966
Exactly so.

484
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:32,566
Since that's the case,

485
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,233
if the murderer is still within Qiankun Alley,

486
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:36,000
the shop owner would surely use himself as bait

487
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:36,900
and have a clerk deliver the letter.

488
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,166
But instead, he chose to deliver the letter himself.

489
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,333
This indicates two things.

490
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,300
First,

491
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,433
the place where the murderer is located

492
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:43,200
is right within Qiankun Alley.

493
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:44,000
Second,

494
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,833
this letter must be delivered personally by him.

495
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
What kind of person could make Old Fourth the Ghost Hand

496
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,366
take the risk to deliver the letter personally?

497
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,466
We should go back to the dungeon.

498
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:57,833
And si,

499
00:21:59,033 --> 00:21:59,900
I’ll need you to help me check

500
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,766
if there’s been anyone suspicious

501
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:01,766
with a limp

502
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,600
in Qiankun Alley recently.

503
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:03,666
Alright.

504
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,533
Let’s go.

505
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,400
Qiankun Alley

506
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,700
There are so many lame people here

507
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,366
Asking each one of them

508
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,233
Really tired this young lady out

509
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,800
If I get caught later, I’ll be nagged again

510
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:42,833
That person was wearing a wind hat and cloak

511
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,500
Covering their body and face

512
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,600
But

513
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,366
Their left foot seems to have been injured

514
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,500
They’re a cripple

515
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:49,666
First

516
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,133
The place where the murderer is

517
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:51,900
Is inside Qiankun Alley

518
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:52,966
Second

519
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,300
This letter must be delivered personally by them

520
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,033
Who could make Ghosthand Old Fourth

521
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,366
Risk delivering the letter personally?

522
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,366
Say

523
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,900
Why are you back so late?

524
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,833
Where did you go?

525
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:10,733
Why aren’t you speaking?

526
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,200
Possessed?

527
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,800
Father

528
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:16,733
Recently in the mansion

529
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,133
Has there ever been a lame person

530
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:19,833
Yes

531
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,400
A couple of days ago

532
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,866
The steward in the backyard injured his leg

533
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,966
What's wrong

534
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:28,700
The steward

535
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:36,966
A doctor has already been called to see him

536
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,166
Although he still walks with a limp

537
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:40,500
He is already fine

538
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,333
That's good

539
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,700
Si'er, it's late at night

540
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,733
It's windy and cold outside

541
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:49,333
Go back to your room

542
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,300
Hello, eldest young lady

543
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,866
The footprints here are lame on the left foot

544
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,800
The steward is lame on the right foot

545
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,066
Father, why did you lie to me

546
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:48,600
Come out

547
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,266
You came here late at night

548
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,166
Has something happened

549
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,766
The heir of Beibo Hou has died

550
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,200
It involves many people

551
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,900
Jiang Wenxuan and E Shun

552
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,833
Have also started investigating this matter

553
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:08,900
Young master

554
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,833
I'm afraid we haven't yet stirred up

555
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,933
the hatred between Libei and Donglu

556
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
Both you and I will be doomed

557
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,900
You're overthinking

558
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,533
Since I dare to do this

559
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,133
I naturally have no fear of Jiang Wenhuan's investigation

560
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
What are you trying to do now

561
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:29,500
Tell me

562
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,000
If this murderer

563
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:32,866
commits suicide out of guilt

564
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,900
wouldn't that mean dead men tell no tales

565
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:40,833
By then, the North Bo Marquis will have lost two sons

566
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:43,733
I'd like to see how the East Wu Marquis Manor

567
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:45,000
intends to explain this

568
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,166
Fair Crown Princess Consort

569
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,100
Why has the Crown Princess Consort come

570
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,800
This place is filthy

571
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,466
What if it offends the beauty

572
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,533
The Crown Princess Consort lingers here

573
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,433
Could it be that you wish to enter and see

574
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,966
the murderer who killed your husband

575
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,666
The Second Young Master is not the killer

576
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,166
The Second Young Master is definitely not that kind of person.

577
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,666
How do you know?

578
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:15,533
I

579
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:16,933
I just know.

580
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,933
No matter what, I believe in him.

581
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,833
Crown Princess, watch your words.

582
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,166
Do not forget your status.

583
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,600
The way she speaks

584
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,333
makes it sound as if the one in prison

585
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,666
is her husband instead.

586
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:31,666
Do you want to go in and see him?

587
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,300
This is mare's milk wine from the grasslands

588
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,466
and lamb meat.

589
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,000
I beg you to give it to him.

590
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,266
Today

591
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,166
is his birthday.

592
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,533
Today is Brother Chong's birthday.

593
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,433
I didn't know.

594
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
Let's go, time is running out.

595
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:54,966
Open the door.

596
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,200
That's how things are.

597
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,500
The线索 leads to the weapons shop and then goes cold.

598
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:00,600
We are already investigating

599
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:01,466
the person who forged the fake blade.

600
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:02,733
Stubborn mule.

601
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,966
Do you know anyone

602
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,100
Lame

603
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:09,300
Don't know

604
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,800
Brother Chong

605
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,733
Do you still remember that day

606
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,666
Was there anything overlooked

607
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,333
Bead

608
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:27,233
I think under the bed

609
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,833
I vaguely saw a glowing luminous pearl

610
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,400
Didn't have time to think it through at the time

611
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,000
Thinking back now

612
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,366
Chong Yiwu hated luminous pearls the most

613
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,166
He thought that thing was an evil object

614
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:40,066
So why would he hide it in his room

615
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:41,766
Luminous pearl

616
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,166
Luminous pearl

617
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Not an ordinary item

618
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,766
In Donglu City

619
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,933
It's considered quite valuable

620
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,166
I understand

621
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,400
This murderer

622
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:52,366
Must not be an ordinary person

623
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,166
Either rich or noble

624
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:56,700
Brother Chong

625
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,000
You stay here.

626
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,933
Leave the investigation to us.

627
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,100
Wishing you a peaceful birthday.

628
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:17,966
This

629
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,300
was sent in by the Consort.

630
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,266
She said today is your birthday.

631
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,166
Let's go.

632
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:31,900
Wait.

633
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,300
Have a drink with me.

634
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:04,700
Young Master.

635
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:06,333
There's news from Donglu.

636
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,433
Send word to Libei.

637
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,933
Say the Marquis of Nanbo's Residence

638
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,366
wishes to discuss business with the Marquis of Beibo.

639
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,600
If the Marquis of Beibo is willing to wait some time,

640
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,100
until the truth is uncovered,

641
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,666
before pursuing the matter of Second Young Master Chong,

642
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:37,833
we are willing to open the Xichuan

643
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
and Baishan checkpoints.

644
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,633
and reopen the north-south trade route.

645
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,433
Young Master is concerned

646
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,100
the Marquis of Beibo may harm Second Young Master Chong.

647
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,966
But the Marquis of Beibo has only two sons.

648
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Now one has already died.

649
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,200
Could it be that he still

650
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,700
The resentment between the father and son has reached this point

651
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,833
There is no room for reconciliation left

652
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,300
Brother Chong is still alive

653
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,800
Because he still has use value

654
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,633
Even though Chong Yiwu has died

655
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,466
Even if the Marquis of Beibo supports a collateral branch

656
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,566
He would absolutely never let Brother Chong succeed to the throne

657
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,866
Young master, opening trade routes is no small matter

658
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:09,466
I spoke out of turn

659
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:11,300
I should not have questioned your decision, young master

660
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,833
I will send someone to deliver the message right away

661
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,066
Haven't you always disliked this wine?

662
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:49,966
It's been many years since we last met

663
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:51,933
Your horsemanship has improved

664
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:54,966
And so has your alcohol tolerance

665
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,033
I never thought that after all these years

666
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,933
When you and I drink this wine again

667
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,133
So much would have changed

668
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,466
Yet the sentiment in this wine

669
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,266
Remains as it was

670
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
Rest assured

671
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,000
We will do everything we can

672
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:33,500
to uncover the truth

673
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,033
Young master

674
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:01,166
It's time to take your medicine

675
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,100
These injuries and illnesses

676
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,033
were all bestowed by that Chong Yibiao

677
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,366
Do not speak recklessly

678
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:12,600
This servant hasn't said anything wrong

679
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
Someone like him

680
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,600
Why must the young master repay his malice with kindness

681
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:16,833
and offer help in secret?

682
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:24,566
Between him and me

683
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,666
there is an agreement

684
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,633
Though I have ended up in this state

685
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,466
as long as he remains

686
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,500
our wish

687
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:45,566
can still be fulfilled

688
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:48,733
Has the young master

689
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,100
never once hated Young Master Chong?

690
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,366
Why?

691
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:07,300
Perhaps I have hated him

692
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:14,566
Brother Chong

693
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,333
Brother Chong, look

694
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,633
Beyond this small royal tent

695
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:30,433
the world outside

696
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:32,133
is vast

697
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,566
Even if everyone in the world

698
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,666
Everyone has prejudices against you

699
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,233
But they still cannot diminish in the slightest

700
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,866
Your strength as the number one warrior of the grasslands

701
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:44,866
Because this

702
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Is something you earned yourself

703
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,000
No one can change it

704
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,566
Including your father and brothers

705
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,333
Today

706
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Is again the day to drink kumiss

707
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,500
Birthday

708
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,733
Well-being

709
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:40,633
Between you and me

710
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,300
The knot in our hearts is hard to undo

711
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,633
After this cup of wine

712
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,500
We owe each other nothing

713
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:04,933
Never expected

714
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:07,200
The esteemed Prince of Nanbo

715
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,533
When drunk

716
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:11,000
Turns out to be a little stutterer

717
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
Non

718
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,433
sense

719
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,033
I

720
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,033
Just wanted to

721
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:18,933
Befriend you, that's all

722
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,600
The Prince's way of making friends

723
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,166
Is really quite unique
