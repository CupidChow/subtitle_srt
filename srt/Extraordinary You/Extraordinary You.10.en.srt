1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,610
Do you like...

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,250
Dan Oh?

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,880
- What?
- Forget about your character.

5
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,350
Do you like Dan Oh?

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,620
Who are you to ask me that?

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,790
Because I do.

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,130
I like Dan Oh.

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,500
(Thank you.)

10
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,750
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

11
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,020
(You always say this to me.
"Your happiness is my happiness.")

12
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,289
I'm right here, Dan Oh.

13
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,590
That's not possible.

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,530
You always say this to me.

15
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,430
"Your happiness is my happiness."

16
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,100
I can't ever win, can I?

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,330
(I prepared this for you.)

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,870
(I prepared this for you.)

19
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,070
(I love you the most in this world.)

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,210
I love you the most in this world.

21
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,580
(I love you the most in this world.)

22
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,820
What kind of nonsense is this?

23
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,430
My gosh.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,060
How can he be so romantic?

25
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,230
"I prepared this for you.
You like flowers."

26
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,070
"My gosh, I love you the most
in this world. I love you."

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Bringing out the flowers
in the most decisive moment!

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,570
Gosh, cliches are the best.

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm not done with it yet.

30
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,520
This is only possible because
they're main characters, right?

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
Main characters?

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,490
These kinds of scenes are only given
to the main characters.

33
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,390
It's cool and heartrending.

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,160
I can't be compared to Nam Ju,
not even in 100 years.

35
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,130
I should stop reading
something like this.

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,130
The supporting male characters are
so foolish...

37
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,230
that it makes me feel miserable.

38
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,570
I can connect with them as
a fellow supporting male character.

39
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,720
Inductive reasoning
isn't very difficult.

40
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,420
We're just looking at
these sequences in another light.

41
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,990
The relationship between
the neighboring numbers.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,930
Finding out the relationship is...

43
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,390
what we call an inductive reasoning.

44
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,230
If we want to know more
about a guy named Yang Yi,

45
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,570
we won't just
find out more about him.

46
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,140
We'll look at
the relationship he has...

47
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,640
with Yang Il and Yang Sam too.

48
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
We're looking at the relationship
between each of these numbers.

49
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,980
You three always go around together.

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,480
Is this a love triangle?

51
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,880
No way!

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,820
The girl I like is sitting up there.

53
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,150
Hey, man.

54
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,190
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

55
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,460
Okay, I'll give you
another example. Ban Jang?

56
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,100
This is only possible because
they're main characters, right?

57
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,200
These kinds of scenes are only given
to the main characters.

58
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,380
Stop mimicking me.

59
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,110
The main characters?

60
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,140
Darn it, you're making it
way too obvious...

61
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,740
that you burnt this book.

62
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,240
(Thank you.)

63
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,550
Will you pretend
like you're clueless again?

64
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,180
- How did you find that?
- I told you...

65
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
that you'll have to talk to me
once I find that book.

66
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,390
I don't think
that story is from this world.

67
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,420
Is this a book
that the writer made before?

68
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,860
I guess I'm right.

69
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,130
So what if it's
the writer's former book?

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,640
The former work
has nothing to do with this.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,940
It already ended,
so it has no power.

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,010
You say it's already over
and it has no power,

73
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,040
but why do you
try so hard to hide it?

74
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,550
Dan Oh said exactly the same lines
as what's in that book.

75
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,550
So what?

76
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
What do you want?

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,950
What do I want?

78
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,990
Getting back
what was taken from me.

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,060
That's what I want.

80
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,190
For everything to go back
the way it was.

81
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,110
I thought
I burnt up the entire book.

82
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,450
This is too dangerous.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,820
He's way too dangerous.

84
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,990
What are you up to?

85
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Nothing.

86
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,630
What is this?

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
What...

88
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,500
(Daily Test)

89
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,440
Goodness.

90
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,880
Give it to me.

91
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,250
I'm a specialist
when it comes to English.

92
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,480
Specially?

93
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,980
Be quiet.

94
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,980
In order to speak English very well,

95
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,390
you need to know many, many words.

96
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,620
- Many, many?
- Yes.

97
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,790
What are you not sure of?

98
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,860
- Question 24.
- Okay.

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,260
I studied that just now.

100
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Give me a moment.

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Right here.

102
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,940
Extraordinary.

103
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,370
What do you think that means?

104
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,510
Extras like us?

105
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,510
Sure.

106
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,240
"Ordinary" means typical.

107
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,380
Typical?
Like what Bo Tong's name means?

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,550
Me? What about me?

109
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,320
Come on, focus.

110
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,350
If you add "ordinary"
with "extra", like us,

111
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,260
it becomes extraordinary.

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,260
It means remarkable and amazing.

113
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,790
This word is...

114
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,560
like us.

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,000
Two ordinary extras met up...

116
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,440
and are making
a special time out of this.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
So to me,

118
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,870
you aren't just an extra.

119
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,680
Extra-ordinary you.

120
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,880
My gosh. You're good
at applying these words.

121
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,050
Okay, then. Out of 10 points,

122
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,120
you get 100.

123
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,420
No, 1,000 points.

124
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,060
Okay, write it down.

125
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,990
Stop looking at me
and write it down.

126
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,500
I hope our special time...

127
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,070
last a very long time.

128
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,370
Ordinary...

129
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,540
No, that's wrong.

130
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,380
Ordinary. It's an O. Where's the O?

131
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,450
Two ordinary extras met up...

132
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,250
and are making
a special time out of this.

133
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,560
So to me, you are...

134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,630
Extra-ordinary you.

135
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,300
My gosh, what was that?

136
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,539
Focus.

137
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,980
"He definitely stood out to me..."

138
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,550
"among the numbers of people."

139
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,620
"When he approached me
from a distance,"

140
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,030
"my heart began to ache a little."

141
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,130
"When the little things he did..."

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,400
"began to have big
and small meanings to me..."

143
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,340
Hello.

144
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,850
Let's go.

145
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,890
"I finally realized..."

146
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,260
"that I am in love with him."

147
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,490
Love?

148
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,730
Dan Oh.

149
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
What are you reading?

150
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,740
Oh. Hey, Haru. Hi.

151
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,010
Goodness.

152
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Are you okay?

153
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,340
No, it's...

154
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,880
My gosh. This is...

155
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,650
Why haven't I seen
Dried Squid Fairy lately?

156
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
It doesn't feel like
I had a satisfying meal for a while.

157
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,090
You always say that
after finishing your meal.

158
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,820
I have no appetite.

159
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,990
Then what are you eating?
Is that a nutritional supplement?

160
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,860
I have another stomach for dessert.

161
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,760
Just be honest.

162
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,770
Tell me that it's so good
that you want another serving.

163
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,970
Gosh, don't come near me.

164
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,740
What are you looking at?
By the way, where's Haru?

165
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,710
Haru? Why?

166
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,140
It feels boring without him.

167
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,880
I found you.

168
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,610
- What?
- Hi, Haru.

169
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,030
Why did you leave back there?

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,370
Guys...
Guys, I'm going to leave first.

171
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,870
Dan Oh!

172
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,910
Dan Oh?

173
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
What?

174
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,380
Why does she look so awkward
around you?

175
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,380
"Awkward"?

176
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,280
She's embarrassed
by all the food around her mouth.

177
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,490
- Sae Mi.
- What?

178
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,020
How do my teeth look?

179
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,860
Gosh!

180
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Sigma means "to add".

181
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,230
Let's look at an example.

182
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,400
Sigma K is from one to N, AK.

183
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,970
Add all of them.

184
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,140
You need to add until the end.

185
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,610
You can express it this way as well.

186
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,390
Where are you going?

187
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,660
I'm going to have lunch.

188
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,590
Right, lunch.

189
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,860
You already had lunch.

190
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,730
Right. Yes, I did.

191
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,500
But I'm going to eat again.

192
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,870
I'm ravenous.

193
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,210
Dan Oh.

194
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,780
Yes?

195
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,510
Why do you look so shy today?

196
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,610
I'm not.

197
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,250
Where is he?

198
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,990
Haru, are you coming?

199
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes, I am.

200
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,830
I'll see you later.

201
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,360
Hurry up.

202
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,600
- Come on.
- Let's go.

203
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,480
Haru. Haru.

204
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,420
Gosh, you are too handsome.

205
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,690
She's so consistent.

206
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,620
She has the same face
from the previous story.

207
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,260
No. The writer lacks creativity.

208
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,500
It's the same story
over and over again.

209
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,600
- You like him too much.
- My goodness.

210
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,840
Who? Me? What do you mean?

211
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,100
Haru.

212
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,870
Is it that obvious?

213
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,840
So what if it is?

214
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,480
I don't want to hear
about how extras can't do this...

215
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,580
or that I'll change the world.

216
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,920
Everyone has the right
to like someone.

217
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,750
Whether it be a lead character
or an extra.

218
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,260
Oh, my. I can't believe
you said that.

219
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,160
What is it? Do you like someone?

220
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,330
I used to.

221
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,830
Who? Do I know her?

222
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,230
She's not in this world.

223
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,470
The writer didn't add her.

224
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,870
Perhaps, it's a good thing.

225
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,410
In a way, I should thank the writer.

226
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,010
I'm better off...

227
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,480
not seeing her again.

228
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,140
It's a good thing?

229
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,450
You should see the person
you like whenever you want.

230
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,120
Since we're mere extras,

231
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,290
we need to try hard to find love.

232
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,890
But even the writer cannot stop me
from liking someone.

233
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,960
The writer has nothing on me.

234
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,960
Come on.

235
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,630
Are you punishing me
for badmouthing you?

236
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,150
I'll forgive you
since Haru's in this stage.

237
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,250
Just say it.

238
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,020
Haru doesn't need to leave.

239
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,220
Okay.

240
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,390
Hey, that's my gift.

241
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,630
You must like it.

242
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,830
Actually, Haru helped me choose it.

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,630
I have enough of these,
so don't buy me any more.

244
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
- Okay.
- Don't cause any trouble.

245
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,610
Don't collapse and make me
visit the hospital again.

246
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,250
Every time I go there,
I want to go insane.

247
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,380
I'm sorry for being sick.

248
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,850
That's not what I meant.

249
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,620
- Look at him.
- What's his problem?

250
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,650
- Is he bothering her?
- Is he doing it again?

251
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,990
- I feel so bad for Dan Oh.
- Me too.

252
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,320
Hey.

253
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,530
You're always like this.

254
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,630
You always make me out
to be the bad guy.

255
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,470
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it!

256
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,140
Hey, keep this or throw it away.

257
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,480
- Let's go.
- Hey.

258
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,490
I know you don't mean it,

259
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,390
but it does hurt me.

260
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,320
Dan Oh, listen...

261
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,330
Hey!

262
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,400
I warned you.

263
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,870
Stop bothering her.

264
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,610
I was wondering why he was being
so good to her these days.

265
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,710
He treats her however he wants to.

266
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,480
Stop fighting, will you?

267
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,020
Since when...

268
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,990
have you become a lead character?

269
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,369
Did you see it?

270
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,450
("Secret")

271
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,870
The former work
has nothing to do with this.

272
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,700
It already ended,
so it has no power.

273
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,880
(Eun Dan Oh, Haru)

274
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,590
Then why does he keep interfering...

275
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,960
when he's a mere extra?

276
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,540
Among all the stars
that I have seen,

277
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,680
that one is the biggest,
the brightest,

278
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,620
and the most beautiful.

279
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,090
It must have been difficult
to find it.

280
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,720
Thank you.

281
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,360
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

282
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,900
and for remembering my wish.

283
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,950
It's that dream again.

284
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,090
That's why I couldn't give you
an answer about your beginning.

285
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,390
The secret about your beginning
doesn't exist here.

286
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,170
- Hey.
- Wait up!

287
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,480
- Hi.
- Hey.

288
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,610
Dan Oh.

289
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
What?

290
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,880
What I said on our stage...

291
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,060
You want to apologize to me, right?

292
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,160
You don't know how to apologize
because you've never done it.

293
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,130
And you don't know how to smile
because you never do.

294
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,340
Your character is tough to play too.

295
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,470
At times like this, it's better
off being an extra without a set-up.

296
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,540
Don't you agree?

297
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,010
But what about me?

298
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,710
I'm an extra. Yet, I have a lame
set-up like my heart problem.

299
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,880
You think
it's better to be an extra?

300
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,550
Yes, take Haru for example.

301
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,720
Because he doesn't have a set-up,

302
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,180
he can change the stage.

303
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,350
Why are you bringing him up now?

304
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,360
- What?
- Even during our stage,

305
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,630
you seem to look at him
while you talk.

306
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,690
Do you like him?

307
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,900
Forget it. Don't answer that.

308
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Well...

309
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,680
Kyung.

310
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,450
Kyung. You wanted to check this out.

311
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
- Get that away from me.
- What is it?

312
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,490
Are you embarrassed
to read a romance comic book?

313
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,660
What's so bad about it?
We're in a romance comic book.

314
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,030
Get that away from me.

315
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,130
Fine. I should lend this
to Haru first.

316
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,770
- Haru?
- He doesn't know anything.

317
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,670
He should read this to get
a girlfriend, you know. Look.

318
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,170
("A Rose for You")

319
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,510
Why do you guys pay
so much attention to an extra?

320
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,810
What's so bad about being an extra?

321
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,450
I'm quite envious of Haru.

322
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,550
Think about it. When we walk
with Nam Ju like a trio,

323
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,120
doesn't that make you cringe?

324
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,320
Whenever that scene begins,
I'm utterly embarrassed.

325
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,950
That halo,

326
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,390
our gaze, and music...

327
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,430
- He's so handsome.
- He's so hot.

328
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,800
It's A3.

329
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,030
Hey, they are so hot!

330
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,870
I should watch my mouth.

331
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,170
I bet the writer is watching us.

332
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,670
What are you doing?
It's too early for that.

333
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,870
That's enough.

334
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,610
Keep the dignity of A3.

335
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,010
My dignity is
to return the greetings I get.

336
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
That was so cheesy.

337
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,780
I get the feeling
we're about to run into Ju Da.

338
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,850
She cried a lot in the science lab.

339
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,090
She looks okay. What a relief.

340
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,150
And making her your errand girl to
flirt is a way to keep our dignity?

341
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,150
Nam Ju.

342
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,460
- Hey, hey.
- I know. Your method is childish.

343
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,630
So when will you go out with her?

344
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,630
- Nam Ju.
- Yes.

345
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,400
Thank you for helping me
in the science lab.

346
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,570
Did something happen
between you two?

347
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,400
Well, Nam Ju...

348
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,570
Oh, that?

349
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,040
You don't need to know.

350
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,140
I guess he saved Ju Da.

351
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,040
Nam Ju is a true protagonist.

352
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,550
So when will you tell me your wish?

353
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,550
Today.

354
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
Today?

355
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,350
Meet me in the auditorium...

356
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,960
after class.

357
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Okay.

358
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,870
Hey. You guys...

359
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,800
Nam Ju. I'm fine now.

360
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,140
No matter what happens to me,

361
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,370
you'll come to save me.

362
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,120
Nam Ju, we'll get going.

363
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,780
Do Hwa, let's go.

364
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,800
I should just throw out
this violin or something.

365
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,300
No way. Will she show up now?

366
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,450
I was wondering where this beautiful
melody was coming from.

367
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,750
It was coming from your fingers.

368
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,780
That's a compliment.

369
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,390
Are you going out with Nam Ju?

370
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,420
It's not that.

371
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,060
I'm glad.

372
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,830
What's the piece
you were just playing?

373
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,630
My feeling
which I hope you can recognize.

374
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,330
The name of this piece is called...

375
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,370
"Love's Sorrow".

376
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
"Love's Sorrow"?

377
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,550
The writer made the line sound
so cheesy.

378
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,250
How could it be so cheesy
and predictable?

379
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,050
I don't know why our scenes
are always the same.

380
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,450
And I always play this violin.

381
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,450
At this point,
my role isn't the deuteragonist.

382
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,990
I'm just a musician
for background music.

383
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,660
This is embarrassing.

384
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,430
Do Hwa.

385
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,360
- I like it when you play.
- What?

386
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,900
It comforts me.

387
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,630
I think about it
when I'm having a hard time.

388
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,440
Don't smile. I'm serious right now.

389
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,940
You only remember the good things,
so it's okay for you.

390
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,610
Ju Da, aren't you going
to the art class?

391
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,880
Okay, Nam Ju.

392
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,090
But I liked the piece
you played before.

393
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,960
i did not like "Love's Sorrow"

394
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,930
but "Love's Joy".

395
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,820
Let's keep a distance, okay?

396
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,290
Hey, Kyung.

397
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,030
As you know,

398
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,300
Nam Ju and Ju Da
are the main characters of "Secret".

399
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
And I'm just an insignificant
supporting character.

400
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,070
- So what?
- I decided to root...

401
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,040
for the love of the main characters
to wish Ju Da happy.

402
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,710
It's hard to tell
how I feel on stage.

403
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,310
But you confessed
your feelings to her before.

404
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,310
Right.

405
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,150
But Nam Ju was supposed to confess
his feelings on that stage.

406
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,550
What are you saying?

407
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,350
According to the storyboard
Dan Oh saw,

408
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,450
Nam Ju was the one who announced
Ju Da as his girlfriend.

409
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,720
But because I confessed
my feelings to her,

410
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,890
you and Dan Oh took over that scene.

411
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,230
From now on,

412
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,930
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

413
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,140
Thanks to Haru, I was able
to confess my feelings too.

414
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,970
But it didn't change anything.

415
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,070
So...

416
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,480
the stage changed?

417
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,710
Yes.

418
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,150
How was that possible?

419
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,650
Because it's Haru.

420
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,680
I know that.
So what did that jerk do?

421
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,350
I'm not sure. Did he have
a special method to do that?

422
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,720
I don't know. How did he do that?

423
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,470
If the stage changes,

424
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,540
can the characters change?

425
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,940
I heard
that Haru can change the stage.

426
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,910
If I change it,

427
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,150
will something change?

428
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,180
Never.

429
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,020
Not everyone can change the stage.

430
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,120
So why is Haru capable
of doing that of all people?

431
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,630
I don't know.

432
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,330
Even the main characters
and I cannot do that.

433
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,700
But an extra, Haru, can do it.

434
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,870
Perhaps, being an extra
might be more helpful.

435
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,280
We can't fool the writer...

436
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,680
because our role
in each scene is set.

437
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,180
Besides, whatever the writer
intends will happen...

438
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,080
no matter what
regardless of how it happens...

439
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,890
because the changed stage
was drawn by the writer too.

440
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,640
Here.
You asked me to get this for you.

441
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Okay.

442
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,610
Haru.

443
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,410
Thank you.

444
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,650
- Don't mention it.
- If...

445
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,550
If you don't have
a lot of time left,

446
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,950
what do you want to do the most?

447
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,090
Why?

448
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,660
I want to do everything...

449
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,930
for Dan Oh.

450
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,460
If I were her,

451
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,370
I would always want to be with you.

452
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,700
She likes you very much.

453
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,870
Dan Oh does.

454
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,120
I think Dan Oh is really sleeping.

455
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,690
- Go. I'll stay here.
- Move.

456
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,160
Why don't you just stick
to your role just like earlier?

457
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,770
You can't do anything
for Dan Oh on stage.

458
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,770
You can barely do
whatever I ask of you.

459
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,470
But you can change her fate?

460
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,710
So did anything change?

461
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,680
You can't beat me.

462
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,880
You're a mere extra.

463
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,960
Everyone! The test result is out.
Come and check.

464
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,460
- My gosh.
- We'll do it later.

465
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
Who wants to check that?

466
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,460
I'm sure Nam Ju is the first place.

467
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,900
Hey, Nam Ju didn't take the test
because of an event for Serinne.

468
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,400
Then who do you think is
the number one...

469
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,970
in year 2, class 7 without Nam Ju?
Me, obviously.

470
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,300
Hey, you are number one.

471
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,640
From the back!

472
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,740
You idiot.

473
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,470
- You're right!
- My gosh.

474
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,710
I'm happy to be number one anyway.

475
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,340
Hey, who do you think it'll be
without Nam Ju?

476
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,680
If the number one
of Seuli High School is gone,

477
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,810
who can fill that in?

478
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,050
Of course, it's our dear Kyung,
you bunch of idiots.

479
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,150
- Idiots?
- Yes!

480
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,020
I studied through the night,

481
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,520
but I'm the third place again.

482
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
It's not that bad.

483
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Wait.

484
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,690
What? Kyung isn't
the top of the class.

485
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,600
Then who is it?

486
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
Gosh, Haru. Have you
always been that smart?

487
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,570
My gosh, that's so cool.

488
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,900
What? Haru?

489
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,300
What is this?
I'm disappointed in Kyung.

490
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,370
Our teacher wants the top student
to help Dan Oh catch up.

491
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,210
- I'll do it.
- She told the top student to do it.

492
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,210
That's me.

493
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll do it.

494
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,950
Why would you?

495
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,220
Why didn't you win
against the extra, then?

496
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,820
- What?
- I guess you didn't expect this.

497
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,820
Move aside, you idiots.

498
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,490
Haru, can you tutor me too?

499
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,800
Hey. I hope
someone can teach me too.

500
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,830
- You're better than Kyung.
- Hey, me too.

501
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,270
Can you tell me about this question?

502
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,070
You can't do anything
for Dan Oh on stage.

503
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,080
But you can change her fate?

504
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,250
So did anything change?

505
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,110
You can't beat me.

506
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,080
You're a mere extra.

507
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,320
- Haru.
- Goodness.

508
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,830
- Yes?
- What's on your mind?

509
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,300
Something is getting on my nerves.

510
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
What is?

511
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,430
Oh, how I just collapsed?

512
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,940
Why?
Did you wait for me for so long?

513
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,240
I thought I would be fine
once the stage is over,

514
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,440
but my chest pain
has gotten worse lately.

515
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,250
No, it didn't get worse.

516
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,250
No, I'm totally fine. Really.

517
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,350
I'm good.

518
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,790
I know you're in pain.

519
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,890
Dan Oh.

520
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,390
I want to change your character.

521
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Let's do it.

522
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,400
Let me do it.

523
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,570
What if you disappear again
like you did last time?

524
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,810
I have a role to play now
as Kyung's friend.

525
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,810
I won't disappear that easily.

526
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,880
You're Kyung's friend,
and I'm Kyung's fiancee.

527
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,450
Gosh, the writer
must love Kyung a lot.

528
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,520
His character is better than Do Hwa,
who plays the supporting role...

529
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,720
Right.

530
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,290
What if Kyung is the one
who can change your fate,

531
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,660
and not me?

532
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,370
This isn't good.

533
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,910
I'm fine.

534
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,910
I'm not in pain.
Why is this ringing?

535
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,750
The stage is about to begin.

536
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,950
I'm going to change...

537
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,150
your story.

538
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
Sae Mi.

539
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,160
Hey, Haru.

540
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,930
- You. You're holding Dan Oh's...
- What's going on?

541
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,300
You'll probably collapse
during this stage.

542
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,670
Kyung will show up to save you.

543
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,540
If this is your stage...

544
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,910
and if you need this
to play the scene,

545
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,010
something might change with this.

546
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,250
Look.

547
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,720
It's still ringing
although it's not on you.

548
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,920
What are you doing, Haru?

549
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,360
What is he doing?

550
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,130
But everything might
go back to the way it was.

551
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,070
Hey, why is this ringing so much?

552
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,440
Do you have a thing for me?

553
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,270
No way. Quiet.

554
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,110
What's with you?

555
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,610
Maybe it'll ring faster
if I hold your hand.

556
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,310
No, this must be broken.

557
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,850
Wait, is your heart
beating faster because of me?

558
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,290
No, this is...

559
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,620
Dan Oh.

560
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,929
- This is bad.
- Oh, no.

561
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,929
- Is she okay?
- What are we going to do?

562
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:33,929
Wait and see...

563
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,670
if the main character
of this stage is you or me.

564
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,800
- Oh, no.
- Take her to the nurse's office.

565
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,969
- Oh, no.
- Move.

566
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,310
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

567
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,310
Why are you here?

568
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:46,980
Where's Dan Oh?

569
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,480
Gosh, Nam Ju was so hot...

570
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,679
that my heart almost popped.

571
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,550
- Come on.
- What was that?

572
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,050
Sae Mi.

573
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,050
- Goodness.
- Hey.

574
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,120
Don't get ill without my permission.

575
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,290
I told not to copy what Nam Ju said.

576
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,730
Darn it.

577
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,030
Are you all right? I was surprised.

578
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,230
I'll do whatever that jerk
did for you.

579
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,600
I can help you change the story.

580
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,940
Only Haru can do that.

581

(Seuli High School's Official
Couple, Oh Nam Ju and Yeo Ju Da)

582
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,100
I knew something was weird.

583
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,370
That brat got a good hold of you.

584
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,040
Don't talk about her that way.

585
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,740
Are you out of your mind?

586
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,170
How can you do this to me?

587
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,540
- Do you know how hard I tried...
- To keep my place?

588
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,550
You mean, your place?

589
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,680
I'm just like
some ornament to you, no?

590
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,080
I'm just a shell.

591
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,920
You. Shut your mouth.

592
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,660
Come back. Come home immediately.

593
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,790
I can't.

594
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,670
Is it that tough for you
to live as the successor...

595
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,170
of Serinne?

596
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,740
(Boarding Pass)

597
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,740
I'm sure you are aware of...

598
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,980
how important this is.

599
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,750
Even if you're just a shell, go.

600
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,850
Mother!

601
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,220
Then tell everything
to the chairman!

602
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,620
Tell him about Ju Da
and your secret!

603
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,420
There cannot be...

604
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,630
a single mistake in my life.

605
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,800
You're Cha Ji Hyun's son,

606
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,800
Oh Nam Ju.

(Seuli High School's Official

608
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,300
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

609
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,570
Please leave a message
after the beep.

610
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,480
Nam Ju probably confessed
to her, right?

611
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
What are you doing here, Do Hwa?

612
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,840
Excuse me. Is Ju Da here?

613
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,540
- Are you her friend?
- Yes.

614
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
- Did something happen to her?
- Sorry?

615
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,910
She's not picking up
and hasn't shown up either.

616
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,680
She's never done this before.

617
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,880
Pick up, please.

618
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,800
Are you stupid?

619
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,830
Hey, Do Hwa.

620
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,800
How long were you going
to wait here?

621
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,670
Nam Ju wanted to meet me here.

622
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,180
He'll be here soon.

623
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,410
Come on!

624
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,580
I can't stand this.

625
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,050
I know you're not aware of yourself,

626
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,290
but please think about yourself.

627
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,790
Put yourself first.

628
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,760
Then what should I do?

629
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,030
What can I do?

630
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,300
The girls bully me at school.

631
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,940
And outside of school, I'm busy
part-timing to pay...

632
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,000
for my grandmother's hospital fees.

633
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,570
I wish my parents could pay...

634
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,270
for my school fee
just like you guys.

635
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,280
I don't want to part-time
after school.

636
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,810
I want to play with my friends.

637
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,810
I want to take
extra-curricular classes as well.

638
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,750
I want to be
a true Seuli High School student.

639
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,420
And Nam Ju was the first person
to offer his hand.

640
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,890
So...

641
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,300
even though you think I'm a fool...

642
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,700
that is waiting for someone
who's not even coming,

643
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,200
I can't help but wait for him.

644
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,680
Because there's nothing I can do
on my own.

645
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,300
- Hello.
- Where are you going?

646
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,610
- To school.
- But it's the weekend.

647
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,810
I'm going to meet Nam Ju...

648
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,050
You should at least have some sense
if you're slow-witted.

649
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,020
Nam Ju is going through
a critical phase right now.

650
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,050
How dare a girl like you...

651
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,470
Ma'am.

652
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,000
That's enough.

653
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,170
You won't change anything.

654
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,210
What?

(Seuli High School's Official
Couple, Oh Nam Ju and Yeo Ju Da)

656
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,560
- Ju Da, about yesterday...
- I'm sorry.

657
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,160
I couldn't come yesterday.

658
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,790
You couldn't?

659
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,060
Please refrain from saying things
that others may misunderstand.

660
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,500
Thanks to your foundation,
I can attend our school.

661
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,440
I don't want to cause
any misunderstandings.

662
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,670
"Misunderstandings"?

663
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,910
Yes.

664
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,440
There's nothing between us.

665
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,910
You have no idea what I had
to go through to come this far.

666
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,180
- I gave up everything and...
- Please...

667
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,180
clean this up by today.

668
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,290
Thanks in advance.

(Hani Hospital)

670
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,030
You're frequently checking
your heart rate monitor, right?

671
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,200
You need to tell me
if something abnormal happens.

672
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,240
Okay.

673
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,840
Do you have any other symptoms
other than chest pain?

674
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:35,080
How should I put it?
My heart feels electrified...

675
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,680
and tingles.

676
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,180
- And your breathing?
- I feel suffocated.

677
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,580
But then, I feel fine.

678
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,550
When do you usually feel that way?

679
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,030
- Haru...
- What? Every day?

680
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,570
Why does it feel so serious in here?

681
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,400
Even my dad's here.

You're frequently checking
your heart rate monitor, right?

684
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,280
You need to tell me
if something abnormal happens.

685
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,650
Actually,

686
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,280
I feel more pain these days.

687
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,090
Dan Oh.

688
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,520
How about being admitted here...

689
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,590
and undergoing
a thorough examination?

690
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,560
I need to get admitted
for an examination?

691
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,060
It's just an examination.
Don't worry.

692
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,800
Don't lie to me.

693
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,940
Be honest.

694
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,640
Am I critically ill?

695
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,400
Why does it hurt so much?

696
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,570
Don't tell me...

697
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,410
I'll be undergoing surgery.

698
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,790
So to me, you aren't just an extra.

699
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,520
Extra-ordinary you.

700
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,780
I don't want to die.

701
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,420
I miss you.

702
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,070
Haru!

703
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,780
I hate the writer.

704
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,180
We're always separated.

705
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,190
But I hate my character even more.

706
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,650
I'm such a fool for confessing
my feelings...

707
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,960
even though I get rejected
countless times.

708
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,190
I like your character.

709
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,060
She's cute, pretty,

710
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,160
and honest.

711
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,630
What is it?

712
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,840
Keep going.

713
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,910
Come on. I thought you liked
that I was honest.

714
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,410
Since it's the weekend,
there's no one here.

715
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,050
The weather is wonderful,
and I have so much free time.

716
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,580
What should I do? What should I do?

717
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,520
Then...

718
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,820
do you want to hang out with me?

719
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,290
(English)

720
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,660
Hi, everyone. My name is Betty.

721
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,530
I'm an English teacher.
It's a very funny book.

722
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,340
Try it.

723
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,330
I feel so shy.

724
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,670
Do my legs look long?

725
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,270
What is this?

726
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,580
I wanted my legs to look long.

727
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,210
What is this?

728
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,480
They look long.

729
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,730
Come here.

730
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,400
Let's take one with this tree.

731
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,300
Okay.

732
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
Can you tiptoe?

733
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,810
Okay.

734
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,810
I'll crouch.

735
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,280
Thanks.

736
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,090
The view from up here...

737
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,190
makes everything look so small.

738
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,030
Is this how the writer feels
when the writer looks at us?

739
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,130
The writer watches us from above,

740
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,330
and we move exactly
how it's drawn...

741
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,830
and stop when the writer
erases the drawings.

742
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,540
We can move even
when we're not drawn in the scenes.

743
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,470
Right. That's true.

744
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,750
Haru, what's your dream?

745
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:21,620
- My dream?
- Yes. Like your dream job.

746
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,150
Well, I'm not sure. What about you?

747
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,620
I want to be...

748
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,090
an ordinary person who can spend
an ordinary day like today.

749
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,300
Someone who can do
whatever she wants.

750
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,940
What's the ending of the story
the writer is drawing?

751
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,850
I wonder
if I'll be able to live until 19.

752
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,650
You'll be right next to me
when you're 19...

753
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,290
and 20.

754
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,290
We're creating our own story.

755
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,390
What was that?

756
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,570
Right. The tree
where we took our photo earlier.

757
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,800
- Yes.
- Everyone told me...

758
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,000
that it was the oldest tree
at our school.

759
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,040
They said something about
October 10 being its 300th birthday.

760
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,240
300th birthday?

761
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,780
Yes, but I'm sure
the writer came up with this.

762
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,550
Even so, the fact that
the tree was here the longest...

763
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,520
makes it feel special.

764
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,290
Whether we're on stage
or in the shadow,

765
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,060
let's meet there on October 10.

766
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,230
If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

767
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,400
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

768
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,210
When we are 19...

769
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,680
and 20.

770
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,630
(October 10)

771
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
All done.

772
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,140
You'll be right next to me
when you're 19...

773
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,100
and 20.

774
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,040
We're creating our own story.

775
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,550
My goodness. He practically
confessed his feelings to me.

776
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,350
How can he say something
like that without even blushing?

777
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,270
I miss him.

778
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,340
How am I going to wait
until the morning?

779
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,240
How am I going to wait
until the morning?

780
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,650
Am I in the hospital? When?

781
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,220
This is a dream. Right? It must be!

782
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:57,800
This cannot be!

783
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,230
It's today.

784
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,480
Hey, did you hear?

785
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,110
Today is this tree's 300th birthday.

786
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,880
No way. It's so old.

787
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,450
Hey, don't call the tree old.

788
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,890
This tree is
like Ellen of the family.

789
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,320
It's "elder" of the family.

790
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,890
- Hey, I knew that.
- Goodness.

791
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,720
That's what I said.
It's the same thing.

792
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,760
- That was embarrassing.
- Hey. Darn it.

793
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,430
We'll keep her here
for a few days and observe her.

794
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,790
She'll be okay, right?

795
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,390
To be honest,

796
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,030
I'm worried
whenever I get the test results.

797
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,070
I'm not sure
if Dan Oh can get through this.

798
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,040
She will.

799
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,100
She's brave.

800
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,380
Right. I'm brave.

801
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,310
So hurry. Please hurry.

802
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,820
Hey, Dan Oh. What are you doing?

803
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,490
Where are you going in that state?

804
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,260
Dad. I'm really fine.
I have an important plan.

805
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,130
No.

806
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,280
It's time for your medication.

807
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,650
What am I going to do?

808
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,790
Hey, Haru.

809
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,760
I think Dan Oh got worse.

810
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,060
She's been in the hospital
for a while now.

811
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,770
What should we do?

812
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
She's there?

813
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,640
When will Dan Oh come back?

814
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,740
I'm bored without Dan Oh.

815
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,510
Let's go visit her
and play with her.

816
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,420
- Hey, Su Chul.
- What?

817
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,120
That's a great idea.
You're a genius!

818
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,890
- Right?
- Let's buy a lot of good food.

819
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,990
Great. Let's go.

820
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,390
What does she like?

821
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,570
Dan Oh!

822
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,840
- Dan Oh.
- Dan Oh.

823
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,340
I missed you so much.

824
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,310
Hey, is it serious?

825
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,380
We came here
just in case you were bored.

826
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,540
Guys, thank you so much.

827
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,810
You need to stop being sick now.

828
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,080
My wrists hurt by the way.

829
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,580
- Do you have a pain relief patch?
- Guys.

830
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,880
I appreciate this,

831
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,720
- but what about Haru?
- It was so heavy.

832
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:13,560
Whether we're on stage
or in the shadow,

833
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,790
let's meet there on October 10.

834
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,000
If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

835
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,230
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

836
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,690
Please.

837
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,240
Time for your shots.

838
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,790
Okay, fine. Who is it this time?

839
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,190
Kyung.

840
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,600
Take it.
I only chose the ones you like.

841
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,670
Thank you.

842
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,240
- This is...
- I know.

843
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,270
I'll put in a good word to Dad.

844
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,310
Thanks, Kyung.

845
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,880
What are you doing?

846
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,620
Dan Oh.

847
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,090
Let go of me. I have to go.

848
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:55,560
Where are you going
in this condition?

849
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:56,730
To see Haru.

850
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,110
If it won't change,

851
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:17,010
if my life is bound to go
as the writer intended,

852
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,050
then I wish
to spend the time I have...

853
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,450
with you, Haru.

854
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,320
Haru!

855
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,400
Haru.

856
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,200
Haru...

857
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,480
Haru!

858
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,800
I miss you. I do.

859
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,970
I miss you, Haru.

860
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,520
Haru...

861
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,130
Dan Oh.

862
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,770
Haru.

863
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,900
I missed you.

864
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,800
I like you.

865
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,540
What?

866
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,610
I like you, Dan Oh.

867
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,430
I'm sorry.

868
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,290
(Extra-ordinary You)

869
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:54,460
I want time to stop like this.

870
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,770
I keep thinking of you
all day, Haru.

871
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,600
Do you fall for anyone
who can change the stage?

872
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,700
It doesn't matter anymore.

873
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,570
Haru and I are happy enough
outside of the stage.

874
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,070
It drives me insane...

875
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,940
whenever that jerk
meddles with my stage...

876
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,480
and whenever you show him
a face that you never showed me.

877
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,750
The memories I forgot
keeps on creeping back.

878
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,280
Even back then, Kyung was...

879
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,950
- The fiance.
- You're my only love too.

880
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:17,350
Dan Oh and you cannot be together.

881
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,390
You have to stop the one
who changes the stage.

882
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,020
Do not repeat the same mistake.

883
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,060
- Who is this?
- A new student...

884
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,060
- in our class.
- Hi.

885
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,760
I'll make sure I find
whatever you're hiding.

886
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,860
Why do I feel so anxious?

887
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,060
Will you really die?

888
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,600
It's not too late for you and me.

889
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,370
I'll do anything for you.
