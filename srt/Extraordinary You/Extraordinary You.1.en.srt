1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,790
(English subtitles are available)

2
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,810
- My gosh, it's Dan Oh!
- It's Dan Oh.

3
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Hey, it's her.

4
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,480
There are a few things...

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,000
that always happens to a heroine.

6
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,010
Dan Oh.

7
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Why won't you pick up my call?

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,140
It's her destiny to have
hot guys obsess over her.

9
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,420
Something like that always ends up
coming to the heroine.

10
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,270
Dan Oh, can you kick it over?

11
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,180
You can never leave out
the lone rebel.

12
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,460
He's definitely the lead
among the male cast.

13
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,050
Long time no see, Dan Oh.

14
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,259
But I don't want to accept him
that easily.

15
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,370
Sorry.

16
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,020
What a tacky taste.

17
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,090
Hey, Nam Ju.

18
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,380
This is yours, isn't it?

19
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,300
- What was that?
- They fell in love.

20
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,770
Goodness, it's so predictable.

21
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,730
That's why it's more thrilling.

22
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,870
A fateful encounter,

23
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,970
a romantic relationship,

24
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,410
and Prince Charming
on a white horse.

25
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,270
- You're delusional.
- It's A3!

26
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,510
Nam Ju!

27
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,770
It's Baek Kyung!

28
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,770
Hey, Nam Ju!

29
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,380
My gosh, it's A3!

30
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,700
Aren't they so amazing?

31
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,380
The amazing 3, A3.

32
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,500
- They're so amazing.
- Baek Kyung!

33
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,620
- My gosh.
- Move, it's dangerous.

34
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,690
What is this?

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,670
- What was that?
- What's going on?

36
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,040
- Goodness.
- What happened?

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,500
- Hey, get up!
- What was that?

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,880
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

40
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,810
Take your hands off.

41
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,880
Oh, I'm sorry. Goodness.

42
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,050
You ruined the art supplies,

43
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,660
my uniform,

44
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,320
and my face.

45
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,540
Are you insane?

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,970
Nam Ju.

47
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,130
Enough.

48
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,700
Are you okay?

49
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,280
Do you think you're something
because you're A3?

50
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,590
All of you are the same too.

51
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,470
You're the first woman
who did that to me.

52
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,090
Dan Oh.

53
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,590
Hi, Nam Ju.

54
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,970
What was that?

55
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,980
"Scops Owl" by Kim So Wol.

56
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,840
My sister who lived...

57
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,200
I told you to stop messing with me!

58
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,340
Enough! Darn you.

59
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,650
You're so scary.

60
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,950
I was trying to study.

61
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,650
Gosh, I lost my timing to study.

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,450
Dan Oh, did you study?

63
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,520
Bad students...

64
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,450
always pretend like they're
studying hard right before the test.

65
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,020
Look at how clean your textbook is.

66
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,230
Did you buy that today?

67
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,030
Do you want me to hit you
with this book?

68
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,530
Today is the midterm?

69
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,590
Good students...

70
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,630
always pretend like they
didn't study right before the test.

71
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,840
Look at how worn out
your textbook is.

72
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,900
You can't even recycle this.

73
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,560
You have to throw it out as
burnable, you know that, right?

74
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,540
Gosh, you're so tenacious.

75
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,480
Dan Oh, you said you didn't study,

76
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,910
but you studied so hard.

77
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,710
- This is my handwriting.
- You said...

78
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,140
All right, get ready for your test.

79
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,660
Wait, three more minutes!

80
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,820
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

81
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,159
- I'm not done reading yet.
- Wait, isn't this an English test?

82
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,880
I studied for the English test.
It's not English?

83
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,090
- It's Korean?
- It's literature.

84
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,090
I'm going to do so bad.

85
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
(Korean)

86
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,150
Wait, is this a dream?

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,460
(1st-semester midterm, 1st day)

88
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,890
All right, time is up.

89
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,460
Everyone, put down your pens.

90
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,960
Wait, we just got started.

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
(Name: Eun Dan Oh, Subject: English)

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,410
Please.

93
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,410
(1st-semester midterm, 4th day)

94
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,340
- I'm done.
- Thank you!

95
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,980
(English)

96
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,210
What's going on?

97
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,570
Thank you, sir.

98
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,020
It's finally over. Let's hang out.

99
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,590
- How about some pasta?
- Okay!

100
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,450
The midterm just began.

101
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:37,920
What?

102
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,090
Are you two joking?

103
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,520
Did you study that hard?

104
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,659
You're completely gone.

105
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,590
Yes! I got over 200 likes!

106
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,900
I can't believe Ju Da
fell right into...

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,970
Nam Ju's arms...

108
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,700
as if she planned this.

109
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,700
How dare she do that to Nam Ju?

110
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,700
I won't let her slide.

111
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,770
Look at Sae Mi's face.
It's a state of art.

112
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,140
Su Chul, shut your mouth.

113
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,080
"Su Chul, shut your mouth."

114
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,520
- Do you really want to die?
- "Do you really want to die?"

115
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,590
- Darn you!
- Goodness.

116
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,210
Come here!

117
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,820
I remember up until this moment.

118
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,250
Ju Da fell over Nam Ju.

119
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,770
Then I don't remember.

120
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,140
What is this?

121
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,640
I must be crazy.

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't worry.
People don't go crazy that easily.

123
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,010
No, my memories really disappeared.

124
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,580
Is it a side effect
of my heart surgery?

125
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,080
Or is it because of my new drug?

126
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,220
Doctor Lee, am I going to die?

127
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,950
It smells great.

128
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,220
Please thank your father for me.

129
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,590
Doctor Lee.

130
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,280
I heard
you cut back on your sleep...

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,120
to study very hard.

132
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,790
- I did?
- The weather is getting hotter,

133
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,870
and a girl
with a weak heart like you...

134
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,060
strained yourself.

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,660
It's not the first day
I've been sick.

136
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,700
How many times do I need
to tell you that it's not that?

137
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,070
I teleported and heard
strange noises.

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,330
You're completely healthy.

139
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,670
A good night's sleep will fix
the ringing in your ears.

140
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,710
As for the teleporting...

141
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,810
Reading fewer comics
will alleviate that.

142
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,410
I'm not joking right now!

143
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,950
It's a temporary symptom
that all teenagers can go through.

144
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,860
It's not that big of a deal,
so don't worry about it.

145
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,300
Right. It's not.

146
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,090
It's actually a huge deal.

147
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,960
Calm down.

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,590
I bet I'm the only teenager
in this country...

149
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,070
who's suffering from such symptoms.

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
I thought the heart disease
was enough.

151
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,980
Gosh, I'm living
such a dynamic life.

152
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,550
Why is this happening to me?

153
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,600
Is Kyung bothering you these days
as well?

154
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,220
One-sided love
can also cause stress.

155
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,810
I'm so frustrated.
Why are you bringing him up?

156
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,310
Kids these days are
so passionate about falling in love.

157
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,480
I swear. There's something wrong
up here.

158
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,100
"New facts. You fail to remember
objects and people's names."

159
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,690
"You also cannot remember
what happened in the past."

160
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,170
That's not me.

161
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,210
(Alzheimer's disease)

162
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,110
"You have trouble speaking
and lack judgment skills."

163
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,180
"You cannot function
in your everyday life."

164
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,450
"When it gets worse,
you hallucinate."

165
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,750
"Hallucinate"?

166
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,980
(1st-semester midterm, 1st day)

167
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,090
But then again,
it only lasted for a short time.

168
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,590
Other than that, I'm totally fine.

169
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,700
So exactly what do I have?

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,700
Did you stop by the hospital?

171
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,120
Did you not?

172
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
Didn't I tell you...

173
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,050
to make sure you stay...

174
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,080
with Dan Oh every time
she goes to the hospital?

175
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,680
I didn't know.

176
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,120
Don't you know how many businesses
Chairman Eun has?

177
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,780
How could you let go
of such an opportunity?

178
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,090
Get out.

180
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,620
Go.

181
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,210
Darn it.

182
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,710
Kyung.

183
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,340
Good morning.

184
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,550
I heard you went to the hospital.

185
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,350
What? How did you know?

186
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,450
My father told me that
your father was worried.

187
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm fine. It was nothing.
I was just stressed out.

188
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,970
Are you so desperate
for my attention...

189
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,840
that you'd involve my own family
in this?

190
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,340
- What?
- This was how you proceeded...

191
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,470
with our engagement.

192
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,200
At times, I just...

193
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,170
Forget it.

194
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,450
I was really sick.

195
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,020
I can't remember things these days,

196
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,350
and I hear noises.

197
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,330
Dan Oh. Just blame
your heart disease as always.

198
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,990
Don't overdo it.

199
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,370
That little...

200
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,160
I went to the hospital
because I was really sick, okay?

201
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,840
I have trouble with my memory,
and I hear things.

202
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,070
That little punk!

203
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,930
- Isn't that Dan Oh?
- You're right.

204
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,840
- Why does she have a fist?
- I bet she fights well.

205
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Dan Oh! You're here early.

206
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,730
Sae Mi, don't I look strange
these days?

207
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,730
You look the same.

208
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,730
I can't remember things,
and I hallucinate.

209
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,590
Right. My personality has changed
as well.

210
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,970
Did something happen with Kyung?

211
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,490
That too.

212
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,200
I saw him back there,
and I was so irritated.

213
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,340
Don't be ridiculous.

214
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,200
Everyone at this school knows
that you like him.

215
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,950
Dan Oh! Dan Oh!

216
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,310
Let's go to the snack bar.

217
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,090
- Weren't you just talking to me?
- What?

218
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,320
We were sitting here, talking
about how I was strange.

219
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,050
You look the same.

220
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,090
What is it?
Did something happen with Kyung?

221
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,090
No, that's not the issue right now.

222
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,070
- My gosh!
- My gosh.

223
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,500
What's wrong?

224
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,670
What are these?

225
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,200
What do you think?

226
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,120
They're our love fridges
that are full of love.

227
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,410
Yours is for Kyung,
and mine is for Nam Ju.

228
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,590
Why exactly am I making this?

229
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,230
What's wrong?
Did something happen with Kyung?

230
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,350
Never mind. That's ridiculous.

231
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,420
Everyone at this school knows
that you like him.

232
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,700
Don't be ridiculous.

233
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,660
Everyone at this school knows
that you like him.

234
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,830
Something is wrong with me.

235
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,410
Did you know that you need
to support the bowl...

236
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,580
with your ring finger
when eating noodles?

237
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,840
It's your middle finger.

238
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,710
No one watches your channel,
so why do you do it?

239
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,090
That's how it all begins. And then,
you get 200,000 likes.

240
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,210
I can't believe it.

241
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,680
At times, I leap two hours in time.

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,950
Other times, it's several days.

243
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,450
Are you all right?

244
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,200
I have no idea when and where...

245
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,060
I'll open my eyes.

246
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,340
My memory...

247
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,840
is fading.

248
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,090
See? I heard it again.

249
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,710
Breathing? Normal.

250
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,440
Chest pains? None.

251
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,340
Heart rate? Normal.

252
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Memory?

253
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,950
Abnormal.

254
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,160
"Forgetfulness"?
No, it's not this one.

255
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,840
"Amnesia"?

256
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,980
It does sound similar.

257
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,220
"Total amnesia...
Partial amnesia..."

258
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,310
Loss of memory in bits?

259
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,580
I don't know.

260
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,550
("Secret")

261
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,620
You followed me all the way here?

262
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,120
That's enough.

263
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,460
You followed me all the way here?

264
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,730
That's enough.

265
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,480
That's so disturbing.

266
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,410
How did you endure it for 10 years?

267
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,380
That's not some innocent
one-sided love.

268
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,980
That's stalking right there.
Gosh, I got the goosebumps.

269
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,980
I'm so sick and tired of her.

270
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,480
I'm sure you feel worse.

271
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,850
Gosh. Hey.

272
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,770
Hey.

273
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,490
Hey!

274
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,930
Where are you going?

275
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,670
Do you know him?

276
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,910
No.

277
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,140
When will you give me a ride
on your motorcycle?

278
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,800
Go ahead. Erase my memory.

279
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,120
Go ahead. Do it again.

280
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
Why is it the same?

281
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,470
Is anyone out there?

282
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,550
Please help.

283
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,950
Please help.

284
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,620
Hey.

285
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,910
Is anyone there?

286
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,450
Hey.

287
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,430
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

288
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,370
Gosh. What's this?

289
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,440
Dan Oh.

290
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,110
Did they bully you again?

291
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
No.

292
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,810
You just transferred to our school.

293
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,680
They should be nice to you.

294
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,710
Look who's talking. You should
be looking out for yourself.

295
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,710
I'm really okay.

296
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,180
Thank you for getting me out.

297
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,510
Eun Dan Oh,
you're losing your memories.

298
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,410
You should be worried
about yourself.

299
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,800
What is this now?

300
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
My memories are going away.
I'm hallucinating.

301
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,480
I think my personality
is changing too.

302
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,520
On top of that, I was so nosy
around Ju Da.

303
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,620
Is it possible that
I have a serious illness?

304
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,460
Oh, no.

305
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,460
- She's so loud. I can't sleep here.
- Why did I say,

306
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,110
"Are you all right? Are you hurt?"

307
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,130
Why did I say that to her?

308
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,140
And where did I get the wet wipes?

309
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,380
I didn't buy those wet wipes.

310
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,480
Hey, Eun Dan Oh.

311
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,380
You keep getting on my nerves.

312
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,710
Pretend that I'm not here.
Mind your own business.

313
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,450
Where on earth
did I get the wet wipes?

314
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,610
Something is definitely going on.

315
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,660
Is this how you treat Kyung too?

316
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,800
Him again.

317
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,400
That's not
what's important right now.

318
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,700
What?

319
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,200
Leave. Leave right now.

320
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,700
- Leave.
- Why? I was here first.

321
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,510
- I was about to get some sleep.
- Okay, okay.

322
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,730
- Hey, I need to get more sleep.
- Just go.

323
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,190
What am I going to do?

324
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,930
How rude.

325
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,770
She's getting on my nerves
every single time. I don't like it.

326
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Who?

327
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,180
Don't touch it. It's mine.

328
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,380
That's yours?

329
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,450
- Yes.
- I see.

330
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,810
I didn't know
your taste has gotten cute.

331
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,190
Hey, Kyung.

332
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,450
What do you think about her?

333
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,450
Who?

334
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,970
I told you. She's not my type.

335
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,160
Is that so? I'm glad.

336
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,200
- You're glad?
- She's been on my mind lately.

337
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,480
I'm certain
this isn't simple amnesia.

338
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,210
Just blame
your heart disease as always.

339
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,790
I was really sick.

340
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,210
I went to the hospital
because I was really sick, okay?

341
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,460
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

342
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,390
I thought I was
only hearing strange noises.

343
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,020
My thoughts and behaviors
don't match.

344
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,540
My gosh, am I
in "Jekyll and Hyde" or what?

345
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,700
You followed me all the way here?

346
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,270
That's enough.

347
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,020
You followed me all the way here?

348
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,720
That's enough.

349
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,950
That's right.

350
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,450
Then, what was
that hallucination about?

351
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,920
No, no. If I was hallucinating,

352
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,550
it's not supposed
to happen in real life.

353
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,400
Goodness.

354
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,920
Am I seeing the future or what?

355
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,470
No way.

356
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,010
Have I really gone mad?

357
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,470
Why is she doing that
in the cafeteria?

358
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,800
- What is it?
- You startled me.

359
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,570
- Sae Mi. Su Chul.
- Dan Oh.

360
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,710
My goodness!

361
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,980
My heartbeat is in the normal range.
That's good.

362
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,710
Come on. Am I that pretty
to give you a heart attack?

363
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,710
I think I saw her
during the East Asian History class.

364
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,050
She was somewhere in China.

365
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,230
Are you saying
that I look like a queen?

366
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,250
Like Yang Guifei?

367
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,230
- Come on. I'm not that pretty.
- No.

368
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,730
- Jiangshi.
- Yes, that's the one.

369
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,540
You're lucky that Dried Squid Fairy
is here today.

370
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,700
"Dried Squid Fairy"?

371
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,060
He's only here
when dried squid is served.

372
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,230
So we call him Dried Squid Fairy.

373
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,600
Oh Nam Ju, Lee Do Hwa,

374
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Baek Kyung, and Dried Squid Fairy
are called...

375
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,450
A4 of Seuli High School.

376
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,910
Isn't it A5?

377
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,720
"A5"? Is there one more?

378
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,480
You must count me in.

379
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,450
- Look.
- You startled me.

380
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,780
- He's here.
- He's here!

381
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,680
- Hey, he's here.
- Awesome.

382
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,760
Gosh, it's Dried Squid Fairy.

383
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,300
- I was here first.
- My gosh.

384
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,760
I was here first.

385
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,670
- His smile is out of this world.
- He's so hot!

386
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,040
Looking at his face is fun enough.

387
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,710
- Hey, I'm about to pass out.
- He's so handsome.

388
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,300
Thank you.

389
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
You seem out of energy.

390
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,890
All right. Eat a lot and cheer up.

391
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,520
Even if you give me a lot,

392
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,980
I won't be able to eat
if I skip my memory.

393
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,800
I just want to get less curry on me.

394
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,480
Thank you.

395
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,770
I'm so full.

396
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,810
Gosh, I lost my appetite.

397
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,720
What are you talking about?
You finished everything.

398
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,790
Hey, what would you do
if you can see the future?

399
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,690
I will make a hit with my channel
claiming myself as a prophet.

400
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,720
I'll get one million subscribers!

401
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,420
He's such an attention seeker.

402
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,730
I'll win the lottery.

403
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,990
And I'll buy Nam Ju an expensive...

404
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,230
and luxurious bag
that he will rock wearing.

405
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,270
And I'll buy him shoes,
studded with 100 diamonds.

406
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,730
There are so many things
I want to buy him.

407
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,070
What about you?

408
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,180
I'm going to prevent impending
misfortunes from happening.

409
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,610
- "Misfortunes"?
- What?

410
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,710
If I can really see the future...

411
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,050
Look at you.
You're eating a lot, Ju Da.

412
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,230
It's a free meal for you.
You ought to eat as much as you can.

413
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,900
You had to get sponsored
by Nam Ju's foundation...

414
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,490
to have this precious meal.

415
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,700
How will you pay
to get Nam Ju's uniform cleaned?

416
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
You'll have to get
about 10 part-time jobs.

417
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,630
- Part-time jobs?
- What are you doing over there?

418
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,510
Don't bother Ju Da.

419
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,410
Go to your seats now.

420
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,450
Okay.

421
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

422
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,620
Hi, sir.

423
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,250
Something about the air here...

424
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,220
tells me there will be a huge story.

425
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,200
- What are you doing?
- I told you.

426
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,680
I'll try to prevent
the misfortune from happening.

427
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,980
Ju Da, is it good?

428
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,730
I just have to make sure
Ju Da doesn't trip.

429
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,400
I asked you a question.
You should answer me.

430
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,380
- Where are you going?
- Hey.

431
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,980
- My goodness.
- No way.

432
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,380
Keep going!

433
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,800
- Hey!
- Look at them.

434
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,700
Look at them on the floor.

435
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Hey, film this.

436
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,500
- I got this.
- Keep filming.

437
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,570
You got the food all over you.

438
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,300
Darn it. Forget
about preventing the misfortune.

439
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,910
- That was classic.
- It stinks. What's this smell?

440
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,050
- Gosh, it smells.
- Good going for you.

441
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,380
Poor Ju Da.

442
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,650
How could she come to school
after this?

443
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,520
Ju Da got her scholarships
with curry.

444
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,730
Film this.

445
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,230
Gosh, it smells.

446
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,550
Which jerk took my phone?

447
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,330
- Who is it?
- It's Nam Ju.

448
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,330
Nam Ju?

449
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,370
- Hey.
- What?

450
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,410
Are you all insane?

451
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,450
Okay, let's learn about the life
of Kreisler, a renowned violinist...

452
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,640
and a songwriter who left many
great songs in the 20th century.

453
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,210
I really love
the songs that he wrote too.

454
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,230
They're all classics.

455
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,230
Here's a quiz.

456
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,230
Among the songs
which Kreisler wrote,

457
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,230
there's a song named "Love's Sorrow"
and "Love's" something else.

458
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,700
What do you think it is?

459
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,270
- I know!
- Yes, what is it?

460
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,560
"Love's Fool".

461
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,480
- I know!
- Okay, Il Jin!

462
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,550
"Love's Stick".

463
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,950
- Are you the stick?
- Wait.

464
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,720
Am I losing my memories
because I can see into the future?

465
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,720
I mean, is this that hard?

466
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,980
(Memory loss, hallucination,
foreknowledge)

467
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,880
Do Hwa guessed it right away
in the next classroom.

468
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,120
I can't believe this.
I can see the future?

469
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,620
Yes, Dan Oh?

470
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,660
Pardon?

471
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,210
- May I go to the nurse's office?
- Come on.

472
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,630
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

473
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,680
- I thought she would answer.
- What is it?

474
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,510
I'll buy you something delicious
from the snack bar if you guess it.

475
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,410
Okay, wait.

476
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,180
How can I see into the future?

477
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,710
Show me, show me, show me!

478
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,820
This isn't it.

479
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,730
If I focus my mind...

480
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,400
Okay, that's not it either.

481
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,340
Show me the future!

482
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,560
What is it?

483
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,010
How do I see into the future?

484
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,730
- "Love's Happiness"?
- "Love's Happiness"?

485
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,730
Kyung.

486
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,510
Can you go outside and
take Dan Oh to the nurse's office?

487
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,670
- What?
- What is she doing?

488
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,410
- Why should I?
- I thought you two were engaged.

489
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,790
- Mr. Baek!
- Mr. Baek!

490
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,900
You're all too noisy.

491
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,890
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

492
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,400
Focus.

493
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,300
Dan Oh.

494
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,980
What are you doing?

495
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,340
Don't bother me and go on your way.

496
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,550
I think you're stopping me
from seeing something.

497
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,070
Go.

498
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,820
Why do you always say
the same thing?

499
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,320
- What?
- This is a very tiring way...

500
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,520
of having a crush on someone.

501
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,880
A crush?

502
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,550
Wait, I have a crush on you?

503
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,120
Yes, well, you're right.

504
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,560
It's not wrong,
but you know, it's a little...

505
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,370
Forget it.

506
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,300
Hey, look. You're always rude to me.

507
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,950
Dan Oh.

508
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980
- Enough is enough.
- What is?

509
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,880
I don't like a woman who's ill.

510
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,060
It's annoying.

511
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,660
Do you want me to tell you again?

512
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,050
You're wasting your time
having a crush on me,

513
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,720
in the past, right now,
and in the future.

514
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
I'll never like someone like you.

515
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,430
Gosh, why didn't I say
anything like an idiot?

516
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,050
Why do I suddenly act nice...

517
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,210
and get angry whenever I see Kyung,
a guy I liked for my entire life?

518
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,520
What kind of disease is this?

519
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,980
What's with her again?

520
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,380
This is embarrassing.

521
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,160
Hey, you.

522
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,360
Come here. Stop right there.

523
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,660
Stop right there!

524
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,810
Excuse me.

525
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,480
What are you doing over there?

526
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,730
Me?

527
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,920
There's no one else around.

528
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,470
You know me, don't you?

529
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,490
I'm not sure. Where have we met?

530
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,160
We both saw that weird thing
on the bridge.

531
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,910
The black hole.

532
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,670
- Did we?
- You were looking at it.

533
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,580
It's probably more than
meets the eye.

534
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,540
Just answer my question.

535
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,880
Nothing good will come
from knowing the answer.

536
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,480
("Secret")

537
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,679
("Secret")

538
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,750
("Secret")

539
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,929
If you have time to spare,

540
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,270
can you give me a hand?

541
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,659
So you won't give me an answer?

542
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,270
She's more quick-witted
than I thought.

543
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,880
I thought it was
somewhere around here.

544
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,750
Everything is definitely connected.

545
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,840
This space, that book,

546
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,820
and Dried Squid Fairy.

547
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,220
(I don't like a woman who's ill.)

548
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,780
(It's annoying.
Do you want me to tell you again?)

549
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,190
(You're wasting your time
having a crush on me.)

550
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,910
(I'll never like someone like you.)

551
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,580
I don't like a woman who's ill.

552
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,790
It's annoying.

553
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,230
Do you want me to tell you again?

554
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,220
You're wasting your time
having a crush on me,

555
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,030
in the past, right now,
and in the future.

556
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,940
I'll never like someone like you.

557
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,510
Wait, is this...

558
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
me?

559
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,970
Goodness, you saw this.

560
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
You pervert.

561
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,490
That's too harsh.

562
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,670
What's in that comic book is...

563
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,670
me, isn't it?

564
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,740
I'm sorry,

565
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
but you're wrong.

566
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Wait, can you see the future too?

567
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,650
I can see into the future...

568
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,010
ever since I touched that.

569
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,180
And that hole.
You and I were the only ones...

570
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,750
who saw that hole.

571
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,030
Calm down.

572
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,770
Why don't you hear me out first?

573
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,700
We aren't humans.

574
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,410
What you're feeling is the gap
between scenes.

575
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,200
You didn't fall asleep,

576
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,840
but you're living in the next day.

577
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,300
You don't remember coming to school,

578
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,750
but you're at school.

579
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,880
A few days pass by...

580
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,950
in a blink of an eye.

581
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,310
You wouldn't usually feel it,

582
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,760
but once you gain consciousness,
you become aware of that gap.

583
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Then...

584
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,450
you end up thinking
you lost your memories.

585
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,760
This isn't amnesia?

586
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,270
This is...

587
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,550
"This is"?

588
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,630
The world of comics.

589
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,650
What a lunatic.

590
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,840
I'm getting bashed on
quite often today.

591
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,140
I think I'll live longer
than the writer had intended.

592
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm such a fool
for actually hearing him out.

593
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,460
Dan Oh.

594
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,120
You're a character
in this comic book.

595
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,960
So you're saying...

596
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,340
that this world I'm living in
is the world of comics,

597
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,500
and I'm a character.

598
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,910
Despite being a character,
I've become aware of myself.

599
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,640
So every time the scene changes,
my memory gets cut off.

600
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,140
Exactly.

601
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,200
Thank you for your insane babbling.

602
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,240
I expected this reaction.
I doubted you'd believe me.

603
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,380
We're strangers,

604
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,590
so we lack trust in each other.

605
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,690
Get lost.

606
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Okay.

607
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,900
Gosh, she intimidated me just now.

608
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
Dan Oh, just hear me out!

609
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,940
How is this the world of comics?

610
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,580
- Dan Oh.
- My gosh.

611
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,710
- Hear me out.
- Why are you following me?

612
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,840
- I'm not a bad person.
- Don't come near me.

613
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,520
- Dan Oh, hold on.
- Stay away.

614
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,450
Dan Oh? Dan Oh.

615
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Eun Dan Oh.

616
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,380
Just hear me out.

617
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,180
Let's take a break!

618
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,250
Just leave, already!

619
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,090
- I'm about to get a shock.
- I just need a minute.

620
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,070
Dan Oh.

621
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,770
Dan Oh.

622
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,580
Would you believe me
if I pushed you?

623
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Why are you doing this to me?

624
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,150
Will your limbs break?

625
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,380
Don't worry.

626
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,260
By the next scene,
you'll be good as new.

627
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,950
I'm going to report you.

628
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,760
This is better.

629
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,120
No!

630
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,830
Have you gone mad?

631
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,570
Aren't you going to report me?
Do it.

632
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,740
Wait...

633
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,680
Come here! Gosh, you little...

634
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,890
Sae Mi!

635
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,020
Hey, what are you doing up there?

636
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,200
Dried Squid threatened to push me
over this handrail.

637
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,090
- And my phone was here.
- What is she saying?

638
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,560
Hey, are you pulling
a one-man show or something?

639
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,800
What?

640
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,650
Guys, did you not see Dried Squid?

641
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,650
- What?
- That psychopath tried to kill me.

642
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,380
- What do you mean?
- He cornered...

643
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,020
and threatened me.

644
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,240
And my phone was floating
in the air.

645
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,310
That's not important.

646
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,880
You were with us the entire time.

647
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,450
Your phone is in your hand.

648
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,910
What?

649
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,620
- This is...
- Rock-paper-scissors!

650
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,200
the world of comics.

651
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,060
No way.

652
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,630
You've been reading
way too many comics.

653
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,140
That's why you're so gullible
into thinking that it may be true.

654
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,000
No, then how are you
seeing the future?

655
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,820
What? What would I do
if I saw the future?

656
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,710
I'd...

657
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,180
I will make a hit with my channel
claiming myself as a prophet.

658
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,210
I'll get one million subscribers!

659
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,350
I will make a hit with my channel
claiming myself as a prophet.

660
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,420
I'll get one million subscribers!

661
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,230
He's such an attention seeker.

662
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,160
I'll win the lottery.
And I'll buy Nam Ju an expensive...

663
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,060
and luxurious bag
that he will rock wearing.

664
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,230
I'll win the lottery.
And I'll buy Nam Ju an expensive...

665
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,440
and luxurious bag
that he will rock wearing.

666
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
And I'll buy him shoes...

667
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,580
And I'll buy him shoes,
studded with 100 diamonds.

668
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,430
If what Dried Squid said is true,

669
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,100
I can remember everything
since I'm aware of it.

670
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,340
You're right. I'm going
to buy him a brand new wallet.

671
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,910
- I'll buy him a new watch.
- Hey, I'll buy him a bag.

672
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,420
Those who aren't aware
of themselves cannot remember?

673
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,580
No way!

674
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,860
He's so handsome!

675
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,720
- Can I shake your hand?
- Me too!

676
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,100
- How did you do it?
- Do what?

677
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
You made my phone float.

678
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,660
I told you.
This is the world of comics.

679
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,340
I can't help but think that
you drew all that...

680
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,070
after watching me.

681
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,200
Do you know how terrible it feels
to be suspected as a pervert?

682
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,480
What? Where's that pervert?

683
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,910
- It's Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

684
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,090
Hey, it's Nam Ju.

685
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,090
Push me at the right moment.

686
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,220
You remember how Ju Da fell, right?
Push me just like how we practiced.

687
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,350
Okay? Like this.

688
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,800
He's so handsome!

689
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,830
I'll give you a chance.

690
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,830
What does he mean?

691
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,590
A chance to thank me.

692
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,440
Oh, that? Thanks... Thanks...

693
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,580
What? Why can't I talk?

694
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,200
Thanks. I mean it. Thanks!

695
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,350
- What?
- Nam Ju!

696
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,710
I can't hear you.

697
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,320
Nam Ju, I'm truly thankful.

698
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,410
- I'm thankful for your existence.
- My gosh!

699
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,690
You know how I feel, right?

700
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,430
Right? Nam Ju, you do know, right?

701
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
He probably does.

702
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,700
Dan Oh, I won't give up.

703
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,840
Push me towards him again
at the right time, got it?

704
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,040
I'll give you a chance.

705
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,550
A chance to thank me.

706
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,840
This just happened.

707
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,170
You weren't there,
so how did you know?

708
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,310
Writers are all-knowing.

709
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,120
They're the creators of such worlds.

710
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,690
- Let me see.
- No!

711
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,190
No! Stop!

712
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,200
You're going to rip it! No!

713
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,830
Just accept it, already.

714
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,950
You're Eun Dan Oh,
a character in the comic book.

715
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,480
(I don't like a woman who's ill.)

716
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,950
This is insane.
It's making my heart flutter.

717
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,550
You're right.

718
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,020
The more obvious it is,
the crazier I'm getting.

719
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,200
He's so handsome.
I want to live in here.

720
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,320
- Sae Mi.
- Yes?

721
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,430
- It's here.
- What?

722
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,030
The world you're in right now
is the world of comics.

723
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,800
What? This is the world of comics?

724
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,940
Hey, it's a secret.

725
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,580
Eun Dan Oh has spoken.

726
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,200
This is the world of comics!

727
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,690
Dan Oh, your imagination
is top-notch!

728
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,780
- Top-notch!
- Top-notch!

729
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,410
Did you read comic books all day
at the hospital?

730
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,690
Imagination. That's just great.

731
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,090
Someone said that the best talent
a person had...

732
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,700
was their imagination.

733
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,920
"Imagination".

734
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,920
What? What did you say?
"Image"?

735
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,070
Mo Beom, you may get good grades,
but your pronunciation is terrible.

736
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,110
Follow me.

737
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,110
- "I..."
- "I..."

738
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,110
- "Ma..."
- "Ma..."

739
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,180
- "Ge".
- "Ge".

740
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,850
- "Image".
- "Image".

741
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,450
(Independent Study)

742
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,480
- Sae Mi.
- Yes?

743
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,290
Do you remember what I just said?

744
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
What did you say?

745
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,590
That this was the world of comics.

746
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,180
What? This is the world of comics?

747
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,930
Eun Dan Oh has spoken.

748
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,590
This is the world of comics!

749
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,090
Dan Oh, your imagination
is top-notch!

750
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,200
- Top-notch!
- Top-notch!

751
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,700
Did you read comic books all day
at the hospital?

752
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,800
Imagination. That's just great.

753
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,940
Someone said that the best talent
a person had...

754
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,480
was their imagination.

755
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,050
"Imagination".

756
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,910
What? What did you say? "Image"?

757
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,460
So none of them can hear this sound?

758
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,060
Sound? What sound?

759
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,590
The sound of a page turning.

760
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,920
This is the world of comics,
you see.

761
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,200
What? This is the world of comics?

762
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,730
Eun Dan Oh has spoken.

763
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,600
This is the world of comics!

764
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,110
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

765
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,590
No. No.

766
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,450
You're a character
in this comic book.

767
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,470
Just accept it, already.

768
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,060
You're Eun Dan Oh,
a character in the comic book.

769
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,160
Oh, no.

770
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,060
It must be true.

771
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,450
They all don't make sense.

772
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,220
They don't, but if I were to believe
that I'm in a comic book...

773
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,750
I'm from a wealthy family.
I'm pretty, studious,

774
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,790
and I'm ill.
I have heart disease, at that.

775
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,790
There's more.

776
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,600
The guy I've been in love
with for the past 10 years...

777
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,820
is now my fiance.

778
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,200
They all fit into the criteria
of a female lead.

779
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,700
I'm a character in a comic book?

780
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,590
Dan Oh, what are you doing here?

781
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,090
- Dad.
- Are you not feeling well?

782
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,330
Dan Oh.

783
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,870
Dad.

784
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,330
I'm Eun Dan Oh, right?

785
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,940
Of course, you're Dan Oh.

786
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,030
What is it?
Did you have a nightmare?

787
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
Dad.

788
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,910
What would you do
if the world we're living in is...

789
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,300
the world of comics?

790
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,940
What? Gosh, you and your jokes.

791
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,080
I'm not joking.

792
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,680
What would you do then?

793
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,210
It would be great
if I'm the main character.

794
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,910
I can do everything I want to.

795
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,980
If that's true,
I can fix your heart first.

796
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,480
That's not what I meant.

797
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,950
We're in the world of comics.

798
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,070
Whether we're
in the world of comics or movies,

799
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,430
it's the same for me.

800
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,840
It won't change that...

801
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,960
you're the person I love
the most in this world.

802
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,880
Stop your wild imaginations
and go to sleep.

803
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,300
Okay? You have school tomorrow.

804
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,410
My heart is beating like this.

805
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,910
Nothing will change.

806
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,550
I am who I am.

807
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,820
I'm real.

808
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,840
See?

809
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,340
Look how they are all over me.
This proves I'm the main character.

810
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,840
I'm coming. Hey, you in the front.
Move out of the way.

811
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,410
Gosh, what's going on?

812
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:45,450
Are you making deliveries?

813
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,050
Come on.

814
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Hey.

815
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,420
Poor her.

816
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,160
I get that she's supposed
to be bullied.

817
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,590
Dan Oh. Hello.

818
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,670
But I'm glad she's cheerful.

819
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,630
18-year-old Eun Dan Oh.

820
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,040
I'm the main character
of a romance comic book.

821
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,320
Which one should I wear today?

822
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,020
- No way. Isn't it limited edition?
- What's that?

823
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,550
My dad bought me.

824
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,560
That's right.
Her dad is really sweet.

825
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,840
A rich family's only daughter...

826
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,300
who gets all the love in the family.

827
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,340
I had a weak heart since birth.

828
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,480
However,
after several rounds of surgery,

829
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,080
I miraculously survived.

830
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,650
- Hi.
- Hi, Dan Oh.

831
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,810
- Hi, Dan Oh.
- Hi.

832
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,740
Above all, I'm a classy
and graceful princess...

833
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,160
of Seuli High School.

834
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,550
That's me.

835
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,000
The heroine of a romance
comic book, Eun Dan Oh.

836
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,090
- Hey.
- Gosh.

837
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,090
It was you, right?

838
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,260
- What?
- Who on earth...

839
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,040
would steal a wallet
other than you here?

840
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,790
- It wasn't me.
- All right then.

841
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,060
Let me check your bag.

842
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,130
What are you doing? It wasn't me.

843
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,280
Give it back.

844
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,730
Give it back.

845
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,680
Hey, give it back to me.

846
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,880
Is it time for me to step in?

847
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,320
Enough is enough.

848
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,420
I saw everything.

849
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,230
So what?

850
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,660
Apologize to her.

851
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,130
Sorry.

852
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,030
Happy now?

853
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,080
Hey, let's go.

854
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,580
Why are you butting
in all of a sudden?

855
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,100
You're unbelievable.

856
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,150
Dan Oh, thank you.

857
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:02,290
You're pretty and kind too.

858
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,660
Of course.

859
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,720
It's a tiny bit bothersome,

860
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,600
but this is my role.

861
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,180
Who could be...

862
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,820
a good match for me?

863
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,740
A musician? Good, good.

864
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,880
An athlete?

865
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,260
Oh, gosh. I can't even...

866
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,620
Gosh, Lee Do Hwa.

867
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,090
Look at him, flirting with me.

868
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,020
Should I say hi back? Or not?

869
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,090
Should I? Or not?

870
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,590
Fine. I'll say hi back.

871
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,670
Gosh, that annoying jerk,
Baek Kyung.

872
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,080
Okay. You're hot.
I'll give you that.

873
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,340
Oh Nam Ju too?

874
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,520
My gosh, this is crazy.

875
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,430
What am I going to do?

876
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,150
Which one should I choose?

877
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,430
I don't know who I should choose.

878
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,120
Hi, guys.

879
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,570
Hi.

880
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,840
What are you doing?

881
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
What?

882
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,270
Out of my way.

883
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,170
What? Unbelievable. You little...

884
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,480
How dare you ignore me?
Have you gone mad?

885
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,520
What's wrong with her?

886
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:39,980
How should I know?

887
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,590
I saw this coming.

888
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,830
Hey, Dan Oh.

889
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,230
There's only one spot.
Whoever comes first will get it.

890
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
Hey, Dan Oh.

891
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,140
- Are you up?
- Yes.

892
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,850
Where am I?

893
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,570
You're at the hospital.

894
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,640
Gosh. I know that.

895
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,810
Since you're awake, I'll go.

896
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,790
Hey.

897
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,620
What about Nam Ju and Do Hwa?

898
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,820
Why are you...

899
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,270
looking for them?

900
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,840
Gosh.

901
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,100
What? That guy...

902
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,130
How much regret
is he going to suffer later on?

903
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,880
I don't understand him.

904
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,150
Gosh, that was so upsetting!

905
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,150
He has no idea how important I am!

906
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,340
I'm Eun Dan Oh.

907
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,340
Come on.

908
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,310
He's awful.

909
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,090
Since I'm the main character,

910
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,800
I was going to
be understanding about this.

911
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,470
But come on! This isn't right!

912
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,430
My heart is about to explode
out of frustration.

913
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,960
Here's what's more frustrating.

914
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,570
The only person I could talk to
about this is Dried Squid.

915
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,880
I'm here at this hour...

916
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:16,980
in this hospital outfit.

917
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,590
I feel sick.

918
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
You're here.

919
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,900
You don't seem angry today.
That's new.

920
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,560
You're not cursing at me either.

921
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,900
I'm sick.

922
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,560
Aren't you glad though?

923
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,010
You won't die...

924
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,300
from a ruptured heart
outside the scene.

925
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,630
"Glad"?

926
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,150
I'm always sick, get dumped,

927
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,340
and am looked down on.

928
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,520
How could a main character face
such treatment?

929
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,980
The set-up I have is totally lame.

930
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,380
You agree that being a daughter...

931
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,880
of a rich family with a fiance
is so outdated, right?

932
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,550
And being a weak heroine...

933
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,480
with a lot of sob stories
doesn't work these days.

934
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,150
It's so old-fashioned. It's lame!

935
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,330
That's...

936
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,170
Besides, I would like it more
if I had guys all over me.

937
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,570
Do I need to work this hard?

938
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,790
What on earth
is the writer thinking?

939
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,300
I hate being sick.

940
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,010
You know what?
That serves him right.

941
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,000
He'll beg me to date him
after turning me down so many times.

942
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:19,770
What?

943
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,250
Where did he go?

944
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,750
Come on.
Why is everyone so mean to me?

945
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,390
Hey!

946
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,320
Everyone is trying to give it
to someone they like.

947
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,050
I will make this
with all of my heart...

948
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,730
for Nam Ju.

949
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,900
Hey! What are you doing?

950
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,990
I'm sorry. Does it say, "man"?

951
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,730
Whose name should I write?

952
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,100
If you do this, it says, "man".

953
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,160
I was going to write, "Nam Ju",
not, "man".

954
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,530
That rude brat.

955
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,050
Seriously. Old habits die hard.

956
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,550
Nam Ju.

957
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,520
Hey, let me borrow this.

958
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
Okay.

959
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,620
- Wait, will it be Nam Ju then?
- Nam Ju.

960
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,210
- Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

961
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,420
No, no. There are too many rivals.

962
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,150
Then...

963
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,260
Can I taste yours?

964
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,390
No, that's not right!

965
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,370
Fine, I won't.

966
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,630
You're so clueless.

967
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,640
Of course, this is for Kyung.

968
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,860
Come on.

969
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,680
Didn't you make this for Kyung?

970
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,250
- No, I didn't.
- Come on.

971
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,840
Of course, you did.

972
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,050
You said that
he was the only one for you.

973
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,380
I said he wasn't.

974
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,690
You startled me.

975
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,380
When did I say
that he was the only one for me?

976
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,550
You said that every day
for the past 10 years.

977
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,880
You were the one who said it.

978
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,330
Why are you yelling at me?

979
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,330
I said that
when I wasn't aware of myself.

980
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,330
Anyway, it's different now.
It's not him.

981
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,660
No, never.

982
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,560
What are you saying?

983
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,530
Wait, if I am
the star of this story,

984
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,270
why should I give a cake to anyone?

985
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,650
They should be giving one to me.

986
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,310
Goodness.

987
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,250
I should have known
ever since he got cute last time.

988
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,910
How did you know
that I like chocolate?

989
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,760
I don't think it's for you.

990
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,390
I love cakes. Especially when
it's made from scratch.

991
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,500
Guys.

992
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,660
To be honest,
I haven't made a decision yet.

993
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,460
I hope your friendship
won't be sacrificed because of me.

994
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,960
I truly mean that.

995
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,770
Don't get into a fight.

996
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,410
Promise me.

997
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,480
Okay, guys.
I'll split this up into three.

998
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,780
Nam Ju, why don't you take
a piece with extra chocolate?

999
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,910
What? You don't like sweet food?

1000
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,830
Do Hwa, you're number two.
You have to wait.

1001
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,230
Wait, Kyung, you won't eat? Really?

1002
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,270
How disappointing.
This should be really good.

1003
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,940
It's a very funny book.

1004
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,600
What am I saying?

1005
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,580
- I'll help you.
- Curry.

1006
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,850
Curry? My gosh, he's so tacky.

1007
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,820
Never mind. Go on.

1008
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,820
Wait, has it begun?

1009
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,820
Curry, I had fun
looking at your curry show.

1010
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,590
- I had fun looking...
- This is such a tacky way...

1011
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,590
- at your curry show.
- of bullying.

1012
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,890
You broke my phone,

1013
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,840
so carry this.

1014
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,590
You can carry my bag.

1015
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,970
If you have no money to buy me
a phone, carry my bag.

1016
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,730
Carry his bag!

1017
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,670
I can feel it.
My prince is going to show up soon.

1018
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,780
- Hey, it's Nam Ju.
- My gosh!

1019
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,520
- Goodness!
- It's him!

1020
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,660
It was Nam Ju?

1021
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,020
It was Nam Ju!

1022
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,900
I knew it wasn't Kyung,
that mean jerk.

1023
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,230
- Gosh.
- Nam Ju.

1024
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,760
- How much was this?
- It's awesome.

1025
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,830
What are you doing?

1026
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,510
Well, he's not my type,

1027
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,970
but he's hot, and he's
the number one guy in this school.

1028
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,350
Oh, we're giving her a moral lesson
in your place.

1029
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,270
- A moral lesson?
- She was rude to you.

1030
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,180
She needs to be our errand girl
and learn her place.

1031
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,520
- Who said you can do that?
- Yes, she'll learn her place.

1032
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,590
Move.

1033
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,200
It's finally my turn.

1034
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,060
Wait, what is this?
Why can't I move yet?

1035
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,870
Oh, I see.
You're going to come to me?

1036
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,530
I hate it when someone touches
something that's mine.

1037
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,060
- Oh, right.
- What?

1038
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,500
If you know that, you should go.

1039
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,220
Hey, there's something new
at the snack bar.

1040
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,220
Hey, right. My mom quit cooking.

1041
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,940
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

1042
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,730
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1043
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,140
Did you hear me?

1044
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,840
You'll be my errand girl
from now on,

1045
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,090
Yeo Ju Da.

1046
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,840
- Is he serious?
- Yeo Ju Da?

1047
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,450
Ju Da, your last name is Yeo?

1048
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,590
Sorry.

1049
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,420
Are you okay?

1050
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,730
You're the first woman
who did that to me.

1051
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,150
I'll give you a chance.

1052
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,410
A chance to thank me.

1053
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,310
Hey, let me borrow this.

1054
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,330
I love cakes.

1055
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,600
Especially when
it's made from scratch.

1056
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,500
Nam Ju is the male lead,
which is what his name means.

1057
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeo Ju Da. Yeo Ju Da...

1058
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,570
Yeo Ju Da? You're the heroine?

1059
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,220
(Extra-ordinary You)

1060
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,760
I'm an extra? I, Eun Dan Oh?

1061
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,090
Everything I say and do is...

1062
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,120
done for Nam Ju and Ju Da.

1063
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,160
The writer will figure out
what you'll say and do.

1064
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,570
That's what I hate!

1065
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:27,410
Everything will happen
according to the plan in this world.

1066
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,910
I can see the future.

1067
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,770
For example, it's fate.

1068
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,650
If I can see it beforehand,
doesn't that mean I can change it?

1069
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,620
Nothing will change in this world.

1070
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,170
The story changed?

1071
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,740
I might be able to become
someone more than an extra.

1072
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,050
Is he planned to save me?

1073
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,810
I'm sure. There's something
going on with that boy.

1074
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:44,810
Found it.

1075
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:47,480
I will not live
according to the writer's plan.
