1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,520
Dan Oh.

3
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,020
Dan Oh.

4
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,260
Can we...

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,990
Can we talk for a second?

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,730
She's coming.

7
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,200
- Hey, Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Did you just see, Sae Mi?

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,170
- Doing what?
- Like this.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,120
I really think
this was the power of love.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,780
- The power of love?
- Yes.

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,520
If it's not that,
how can we explain this miracle?

13
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,230
It's pretty.

14
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,900
Of course, it is.
This means so much to us.

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Gosh, the ring is so pretty.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,630
I guess your mother's ring was
exactly the same as me.

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,970
It fits me perfectly.

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,340
Kyung, what's wrong?

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,450
It's weird.

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,580
- What is?
- Did you just...

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,020
- call me Kyung?
- Oh, I get it.

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,750
It's because
the ring looks so good on me.

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,850
Gosh, the ring is so pretty.

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,060
I guess your mother's ring was
exactly the same as me.

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,289
It fits me perfectly.

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,690
Dan Oh.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Dan Oh.

28
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,759
Can we talk for a second?

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,200
Gosh, you surprised me.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Hey, it's you, Haru.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,810
Kyung, it's Haru.

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,470
Are you two practicing tennis today?
Are you?

33
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,110
What's going on?

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Tell me.

35
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,420
What's going on?

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,690
I should be asking you.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,060
You were the one who was with her.

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,200
It's all for the better.

39
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,370
- What?
- Everything is back in its place,

40
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,130
just as I hoped.

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,670
It's probably better for Dan Oh too.

42
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,710
At least she won't suffer between
the gap of the stage and the shadow.

43
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,500
It's all for the better.

44
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,110
Everything is back in its place,

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,510
just as I hoped.

46
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,050
Are you the only one
who works in the cafeteria?

47
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,250
Do you need a hand?

48
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,660
No, I can manage by myself.

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,290
You don't have any friends, do you?

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,460
I can totally tell.

51
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,560
Why do you keep doing this to me?

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Because I keep on noticing you.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,570
If you don't have any friends,
I can be your friend.

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,140
I don't need any.

55
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,610
Oh, why does it sound like
you need some?

56
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,830
Dan Oh...

57
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,130
Dan Oh lost her memories.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
You remind me...

59
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,170
of what I was like in the past.

60
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,080
That's exactly the face I made...

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,020
when I lost her.

62
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,750
If you die in a place
that is not in this book,

63
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,060
you still exist,

64
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,760
but your memories disappear.

65
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,830
I couldn't stop my beloved
from dying before my eyes.

66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,870
My story will end soon.

67
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,640
But I hope
you can change your story.

68
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,000
("Trumpet Creeper")

69
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,010
Back then, I hoped
your story could change,

70
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,820
but I didn't realize
the stages you changed...

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,920
will lead us to a tragedy.

72
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,820
Our self-awareness disappears...

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,820
once we die in the shadow.

74
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,760
Then if the story ends like this,

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,930
what happens to us?

76
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,310
We fall into a deep sleep...

77
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,070
until the writer draws us again.

78
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,240
What if the writer
never draws us again?

79
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,950
Then this world may be...

80
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,020
the last one for Dan Oh and me.

81
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,820
If you make a big impression
on the writer...

82
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,750
or if it's easy
for the writer to draw you,

83
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,890
then there will be a higher chance
that you'll be drawn again.

84
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,260
I guess
that's what Su Hyang is like.

85
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,500
The story is about to be over,

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,730
but the writer
added her in the last minute.

87
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,240
I'm not sure if it's easy
for the writer to draw her...

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
or if she made a big impression.

89
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,440
Or I may have looked so pathetic...

90
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,010
that the writer added her in
out of pity.

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,510
When someone is drawn,

92
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,810
others tend to get erased.

93
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,680
When the story is about to be over,

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,620
it's a piece of cake
to erase us from the scenes.

95
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,060
That means
we can't be freed until the end.

96
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,130
It's time for you to refrain from
getting noticed by the writer.

97
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,130
Especially so...

98
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,260
for an extra like you
who doesn't play a huge role.

99
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,270
I don't want you...

100
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,170
to suddenly disappear
in the middle of the story.

101
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,680
We only have a few scenes left.

102
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,880
The writer is about to
wrap up this world.

103
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,120
Why?

104
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,370
My lady.

105
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,500
My lady.

106
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
My lady.

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,940
My lady.

108
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,740
Dan Oh.

109
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,110
Dan Oh!

110
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,000
No matter what I do,

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,570
I cannot control my feelings.

112
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,070
You know that as well.

113
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,850
I will wait for you...

114
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,720
just like this flower.

115
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,020
I will protect you.

116
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,160
I will wait...

117
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,640
until we meet again.

118
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,010
I will remember you...

119
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
forever.

120
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,150
No matter what happens,

121
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,990
I will...

122
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,130
Hey.

123
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,630
You knew everything, didn't you?

124
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,600
You knew it wasn't me.

125
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,540
You were the one who did it.

126
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,340
So what?

127
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,510
But that won't happen this time.

128
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,980
Dan Oh's set-up has changed.

129
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,610
The writer intends for her
to stay by my side.

130
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,750
And that will torture her.

131
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,950
It tortured her then,
and it will this time as well.

132
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm going to find the real Dan Oh.

133
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,130
So that...

134
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,030
she can truly be herself.

135
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,980
Dan Oh.

136
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Hi.

137
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,880
Hi.

138
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,520
Dan Oh.

139
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,500
We're in the same class.

140
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,370
I see.

141
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Where's Kyung?

142
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,990
Do you remember this?

143
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,130
"Heart disease
and one-sided love for 10 years."

144
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,370
"That's my set-up."

145
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,530
"If we change the story,"

146
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,040
"both you and I will no longer
be extras."

147
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,940
"Let's..."

148
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,740
"change our fate."

149
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,760
I like that this is a romance comic.

150
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,120
At least, nobody dies.

151
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,360
What are you doing here?
What are you reading?

152
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,400
Look at you.
You're an ardent fan, aren't you?

153
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,230
You read this illogical
and ridiculous story...

154
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,470
again and again.

155
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,870
You're here again.
Could you please stop...

156
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,870
Come on. I know you're happy
to see me.

157
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,280
I give the writer props
for curing Dan Oh.

158
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,520
If it was this easy to cure her,
why did she have to be in pain...

159
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
for the past decade?

160
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,250
Hey, Dan Oh.

161
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,390
Hi, Do Hwa.

162
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,960
What is this?

163
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,800
It feels like back when Haru
wasn't his true self.

164
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,130
Dan Oh.

165
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,270
- Hi, Do Hwa.
- What?

166
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,880
This is a cliche!

167
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,580
Fine. Dan Oh has finally
fully recovered.

168
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,020
And I'm glad that
Kyung has become nice,

169
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,450
and that this will be
a happy ending.

170
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,520
But...

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,260
What's the use of Dan Oh only
being happy on stage...

172
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,990
when she no longer exists
in the shadow?

173
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,100
I remember when you lost
your memory.

174
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,600
Dan Oh was in so much pain.

175
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,010
I think I'm being punished.

176
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,240
Don't be ridiculous.

177
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,710
It's all because of our illogical
and obnoxious writer.

178
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,010
You're right.

179
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,880
I'll try to follow my heart.

180
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,120
I'm going to do so...

181
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,760
no matter the consequences.

182
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,720
Just trust me and follow me.

183
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,730
Okay?

184
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,300
That darn writer.

185
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,160
So...

186
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,100
I'm going to follow my heart.

187
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,770
I'm going to do so...

188
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,640
no matter the consequences.

189
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,380
Dan Oh.

190
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,150
Hi, my name is Haru.

191
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes, I know.

192
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,230
Let me.

193
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,230
It's okay. I can manage.

194
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,460
They're not heavy at all.

195
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,270
I want to walk...

196
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,170
with you.

197
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,420
What did he do
before she turned into a flower?

198
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,120
What had to be done beforehand?

199
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
It was her name.

200
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,950
He called out her name.

201
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,890
This means that there is...

202
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,590
determination, effort, and hope.

203
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,800
That is how she became a flower.

204
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,100
The two of them could finally
have a relationship.

205
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,840
Do you understand?

206
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

207
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,990
Hi.

208
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,020
Dan Oh.

209
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,620
You gave me my name...

210
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,730
because you hoped
that I could change...

211
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
your day.

212
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,370
I did that?

213
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,600
Yes.

214
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,900
Please remember...

215
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,010
the name you've given me.

216
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,010
"Haru".

217
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,850
Dan Oh, you can take your time
if it's too difficult.

218
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,250
I'll go to you.

219
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
("S Group's Second Son, Mr. Oh,
Born out of Wedlock!")

220
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,600
- Hey, this is about Nam Ju.
- No way!

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,600
- It's the second son!
- Isn't that Nam Ju?

222
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,730
Look at this.

223
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,400
- Oh, no!
- "Oh" is his surname.

224
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,870
"Cha Ji Hyun".

225
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,740
This is a lie.

226
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,040
Nam Ju is too perfect for this.

227
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,740
And we thought he'd inherit
Serinne Fashion?

228
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,880
- Darn it! I had no idea!
- After everything we did...

229
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,620
We blew so many balloons
because of him.

230
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,120
Does this mean Y3 will take over?

231
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,120
You have no courage, do you?

232
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,590
What?

233
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,960
I'll be taking over Nam Ju's spot.

234
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,260
My goodness.

235
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,130
This is official.

236
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,500
From now on, I will take over...

237
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,770
- nothing.
- Hey, Nam Ju.

238
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,000
- Poor Nam Ju.
- Does he think he's still...

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,370
a part of A3?

240
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,770
Will this be the end of him?

241
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,970
I never thought he'd be a liar.

242
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,110
If you have something to say,
say it to my face.

243
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,510
Nam Ju, this isn't true, is it?

244
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,220
Hey! Don't say such things to him!

245
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,890
It's all true.

246
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,260
It's true?

247
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,390
So what?

248
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,790
Does that mean
I'm no longer Oh Nam Ju?

249
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,340
Are you okay? I'm going to lose
my subscribers!

250
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,580
Are you okay?

251
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
You also liked me...

252
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,090
because I was the heir
to Serinne, right?

253
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,260
- I...
- Ju Da.

254
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,990
Close your eyes.

255
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,090
Close your eyes.

256
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,640
He's crying.

257
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,710
- Look at him. He's a crybaby.
- Don't cry now.

258
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,520
Hey, look at him crying.

259
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,650
These jerks...

260
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,250
- Hey.
- What?

261
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,090
Do you have anything to say
to a Y3 member?

262
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,820
- You're nothing but a peasant.
- What did you say?

263
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,290
High-class school, my foot.

264
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,460
You divide people into classes
based on money and reputation.

265
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,930
And you praise or condemn them.

266
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,630
You guys are such peasants.

267
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,460
You... You...

268
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,830
Let's go, Nam Ju.

269
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,670
Hey.

270
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,420
Drink it.

271
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Okay.

272
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,530
This is nice.

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,840
To tell you the truth,
I've been having a hard time.

274
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,240
- Why?
- Just because.

275
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,510
It was inevitable.

276
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,850
I'm Oh Nam Ju.

277
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,050
I'm the leader of A3
at Seuli High School.

278
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,920
And I had to protect the woman...

279
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,250
I like.

280
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,430
I exist...

281
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,590
for you.

282
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,910
Go abroad.

283
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,010
No, I won't.

284
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,750
You'd better take this
before anyone sees it.

285
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,520
You still care about how other
people will think of us even now?

286
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,180
I took down all the articles.

287
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,550
I, Oh Nam Ju...

288
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,420
- Hold on.
- What is he doing?

289
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Come home. Let's talk at home.

290
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,330
I'm not the biological son...

291
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,830
of Serinne Fashion's chairman,
Oh Jae Beol.

292
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,600
What are you doing right now?

293
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,770
- This feels better.
- What?

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,770
I don't want to be a coward anymore.

295
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,040
I will live my life
as the real Oh Nam Ju now.

296
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,710
Can you throw away
everything you have...

297
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,340
and privileges
that are given to you?

298
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,050
Nam Ju.

299
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,580
This is all for you.

300
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,680
No.

301
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,720
The best thing you can do
for him is...

302
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,190
letting him accept who he really is.

303
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,300
Nam Ju.

304
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,260
I don't care if you're
the heir to Serinne Fashion...

305
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,330
or just a regular guy.

306
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,500
To me,

307
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,070
you were always mine.

308
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,010
I'll help you.

309
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,580
- My goodness. No way.
- I can't believe it.

310
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,020
I love you.

311
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,890
Nam Ju, it must've been
hard for you too.

312
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,030
I'm sure the main character
came with...

313
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,500
a lot of burdens.

314
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,300
- Ma'am.
- "Ma'am"?

315
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,240
You can't use your own son
like you use a tool.

316
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,340
Nam Ju, tell them
what's on your mind.

317
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,010
You...

318
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,410
I, Oh Nam Ju, will put down
the crown of Seuli High School...

319
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,750
and live my life as it is...

320
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,650
with the love of my life, Ju Da.

321
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,760
- Oh Nam Ju!
- Oh Nam Ju!

322
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,270
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

323
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,700
Is there anything you want to do?

324
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,470
Anything you want to eat...

325
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,900
or anything you want to have.

326
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,240
There are tons.

327
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,710
I want to go to the movies with you,

328
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,310
eat delicious food, and...

329
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,250
And...

330
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,010
Gosh, there are tons.

331
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,250
But I can't remember them
now that we're talking about them.

332
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,990
Why didn't I ask you that sooner?

333
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
You want to do so many things
with me.

334
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,790
If you don't remember it,

335
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,600
I'll just do whatever I want to do.

336
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,770
You told me...

337
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,740
that your affection for me
was all fake.

338
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,900
But I'll believe that your affection
for me is genuine.

339
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,510
You can run away...

340
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,510
if you remember it now.

341
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,050
Why would I run away from you?
I like you so much.

342
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,820
- Why?
- You and I are meant to be.

343
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,720
- We're meant to be?
- Yes.

344
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,360
I only like you, no one else.

345
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,330
If that doesn't mean we're meant
to be, what else would that mean?

346
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,190
Hey, Dan Oh.

347
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,090
Don't you know
that Sae Mi has sensitive eyes?

348
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,530
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,230
Hey, stop looking out for me.

350
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,500
Why are you complaining about that?

351
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,700
Gosh. Go away.

352
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,900
Go away. Go.

353
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,100
I was going to leave anyway.
I need to film there too.

354
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,800
Goodness.

355
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,470
My mom was right.

356
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,610
Letting someone in your heart
little by little is the scariest.

357
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,210
What? What's wrong with him?

358
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,640
Hey, Su Chul. Come over here.

359
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,680
Goodness.

360
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,270
What's wrong with me?

361
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,980
Must you ask?

362
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,210
You're shining a light at your eyes.

363
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,450
Of course, it would make you cry.

364
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,350
Goodness, you're so cheeky.

365
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,520
Haru.

366
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,920
What? "Haru"?

367
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,020
- "Haru"?
- I mean,

368
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,990
that's what you just said.

369
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Hey.

370
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Wait up for me.

371
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,770
Stop right there.

372
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,510
Dan Oh.

373
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,010
I decided to let Nam Ju go.

374
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
Really?

375
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,590
I've never seen him smile like that.

376
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,260
Goodbye, Nam Ju.

377
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,930
I sort of feel like...

378
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,030
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

379
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,430
You'll be right next to me
when you're 19...

380
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,870
and 20.

381
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,770
I heard that
this tree is 300 years old.

382
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,580
This tree must have seen thousands
of students over that long time.

383
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,950
I'm Do Hwa's friend.

384
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,950
I transferred to this school
a while ago.

385
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,820
I don't think we've met before.

386
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
Really?

387
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,890
I thought you were close
with Do Hwa.

388
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,590
We're not that close. We've known
each other since we were kids.

389
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,590
Then, this tree must have seen
you guys too.

390
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,830
Probably not.

391
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,000
When I was young,
I mostly stayed at the hospital.

392
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,530
If you look at the top of the tree,

393
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,270
you can probably see everything.

394
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,900
That's kind of creepy.

395
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,740
Just make sure the tree
doesn't find out.

396
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,710
You can hide among other students.

397
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,680
Living the same life people live,
hiding among other students...

398
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,480
isn't fun.

399
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,750
Is that so?

400
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,980
I must find my own meaning
for my life.

401
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,220
This is my life.

402
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,750
What a great line.

403
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,890
"My own meaning".

404
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,590
I think it might differ depending on
whom I live my life with.

405
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,600
Does the meaning of your life
have to do with Kyung?

406
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,700
Of course...

407
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,470
Probably.

408
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,600
Either you know it or you don't.

409
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,870
You can't say, "probably".

410
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,570
It's about the writer who made us.

411
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,040
What do you think
the writer is thinking...

412
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,480
while looking at us from above?

413
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,150
- "Writer"?
- At first, I was scared too.

414
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,920
No matter how hard
I tried to escape, I couldn't.

415
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,260
I just wanted to be happy
with the love of my life.

416
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,260
We tried to change it,

417
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,330
but some things never change.

418
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,530
And things you didn't want to change
can change.

419
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,470
It's up to the writer.

420
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,940
Sometimes, it follows storyboards.
And sometimes, it doesn't.

421
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,740
What do you mean?

422
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,750
Just like you don't know
which leaf will fall next,

423
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,150
there are no rules
in this world as well.

424
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,920
As long as your affection
for one another is strong,

425
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,990
you can overcome it.

426
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,200
- Dan Oh, let's go eat some bread.
- Sure.

427
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Sure. Let me carry your backpack.

428
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,470
Hey. I told you to stop
taking care of me. Give me that.

429
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,540
- I'll carry it for you.
- Let go of that.

430
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Dan Oh.

431
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,840
- Get home safe.
- Okay.

432
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,250
Poor Haru.
This is breaking my heart.

433
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,250
Dan Oh.

434
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,020
Dan Oh. Where are you going?

435
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,990
Hey. Nam Ju already left.

436
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,660
Dan Oh.
A small flutter of a butterfly...

437
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,500
can change your destiny.
It changes. Changes. Changes.

438
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,660
Hey, Kyung.

439
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,070
Let's go.

440
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,170
I'm going to go eat something
with Sae Mi.

441
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,840
It didn't change.

442
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,520
Dan Oh, you rascal. You can't
remember any of our memories.

443
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,430
Did I keep you waiting?

444
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,030
No, I just got here too.

445
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,240
You must really love strawberries.

446
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,640
I don't like strawberries.

447
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,780
I just have it because Nam Ju says
that I like strawberries.

448
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,750
The guy who went crazy saying
"my woman" and "strawberry".

449
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,180
Nam Ju really likes you.

450
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,790
I know.

451
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,190
Ju Da.

452
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,930
What do you think will happen to us?

453
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,800
I like you.

454
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,100
Don't be surprised.
But I like Nam Ju too.

455
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,640
All he does is
giving me expensive gifts...

456
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,270
and declaring to everyone
that he likes me.

457
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,510
But I know that he truly likes me
because he always has...

458
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,310
his eyes on me.

459
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,580
Did you...

460
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,750
just turn me down?

461
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,760
I can't be courageous
because we're in a comic book.

462
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,660
I need the courage...

463
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
to change the story
in order to like you.

464
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,060
But I've been through so much
until now.

465
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,760
If I don't get to enjoy...

466
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,400
this happy ending,
it'll be just too unfair.

467
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,040
If you became
aware of yourself a bit earlier,

468
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,110
- would it have changed?
- No.

469
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,980
You can be happy without me.
But Nam Ju...

470
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,320
can't be happy without me.

471
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,020
Gosh, am I still number two
next to Nam Ju in the shadow too?

472
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,990
I won't lead you on...

473
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,290
and ask you to be a friend
while I'm turning you down.

474
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,990
If I may make a suggestion
as the guy who got dumped,

475
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,700
I hope we can at least be friends.

476
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Do Hwa.

477
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,300
Thank you.

478
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,400
You really were my guardian angel.

479
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,740
Ju Da.

480
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,680
I really liked you a lot...

481
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,320
in the stage and in the shadow.

482
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,170
What should we do next?
Kyung, what do you want to do?

483
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,500
Whatever you want to do.

484
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,510
Gosh, I'm so happy.

485
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,910
- What?
- Are you okay?

486
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,350
- Should we go home?
- No.

487
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,780
I'm saying this as someone
who had a heart condition for long,

488
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,520
and my heart is just racing
out of excitement.

489
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,290
It only rings
in front of someone I like,

490
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,420
telling you that I like you,
and that I want you to know.

491
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,000
- Should we go eat?
- Yes.

492
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,230
What do you want?

493
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,000
Something really delicious.

494
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,330
Tteokbokki?

495
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,940
Kyung, put this on.

496
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,240
You're so cute.

497
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,870
Dan Oh.

498
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,070
I'm not in pain.

499
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,460
Dan Oh.

500
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,830
I'm so glad.

501
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,330
For what?

502
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,000
That we reached each other.

503
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,500
Thank you.

504
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,500
Everything got better thanks to you,

505
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,410
and it'll continue to get better.

506
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,980
I want to thank you too.

507
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,250
You turned me into someone
who's healthy and in love,

508
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,920
not a girl who had a crush on you
for 10 years with a heart condition.

509
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,290
Thank you so much, Haru.

510
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,460
Haru?

511
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,700
What?

512
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,470
Haru.

513
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh, do you have to go
and practice tennis with him?

514
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
Right now?

515
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,710
It's pretty late.

516
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,710
You don't even remember,
but you still...

517
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,210
What?

518
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,670
Bo Tong!

519
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,000
- Who? Bo Tong?
- Yes.

520
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,770
He was here until this morning.

521
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,840
Maybe he didn't come.

522
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,409
- He did.
- Mo Beom.

523
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,780
Have you seen Bo Tong?

524
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,909
- Call him.
- Fine.

525
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,679
That's odd. Who knows his number?

526
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,750
- Me.
- Me.

527
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,790
I'll call him.

528
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,190
What?

529
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,889
- I don't have his number.
- You don't?

530
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,620
I know that I had his number.

531
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,230
I stored it in my head.

532
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,389
- Write it down.
- Okay.

533
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,960
- It's 010...
- 010...

534
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,260
Wait, 018?

535
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,370
- 018?
- 018?

536
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,570
I don't remember.

537
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,440
- I'm sure he'll come.
- He will.

538
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,510
- Should we go to the snack bar?
- Oh, he must be there.

539
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,639
- Yes, he is. What do you want?
- Let's go.

540
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,179
- Me?
- Strawberry milk.

541
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,310
it's a piece of cake...

542
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,380
to erase us from the scenes.

543
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,980
Especially so...

544
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,280
for an extra like you
who doesn't play a huge role.

545
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,350
Dan Oh. Dan Oh? Wake up.

546
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,350
Dan Oh.

547
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,790
Give me one second.

548
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,580
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

549
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,450
By the next scene,
you'll be all healed up.

550
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,630
Nevertheless, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

551
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,900
Back then, you said this to me here.

552
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,600
You wished I could change
your fate.

553
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,270
I said that?

554
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,600
Yes.

555
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,110
Dan Oh.

556
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,280
Please remember me next time.

557
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,610
You gave me my name.

558
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,020
It's Haru.

559
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,220
- Are you...
- Go.

560
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,420
I think my heart is hurting
because of you.

561
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,460
Because of you, my heart is starting
to hurt again.

562
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,930
I'm sorry, but could you leave?

563
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,970
What was that?

564
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,220
(It's exactly the same with Ju Da.)

565
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,710
- Are you...
- Go.

566
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,280
I think my heart is hurting
because of you.

567
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,480
Because of you, my heart is starting
to hurt again.

568
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,730
The writer is about to
wrap up this world.

569
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,270
He'll get rid of the memories
that haunted you...

570
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,610
and the place where you could
see them. Everything.

571
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,090
Dan Oh.

572
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,600
- That's not your seat.
- I know.

573
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,630
But this is the best spot
to look outside the window.

574
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm sure Haru will understand.

575
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,400
He's a close friend of yours.

576
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,720
Kyung.

577
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,410
Apart from being sick
and a student here,

578
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,650
what kind of person
do you think I'll become?

579
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,350
I can't wait to find out...

580
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,590
the person I'll become
now that I'm all better.

581
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,720
"All better"?

582
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,030
Yes. My heart is no longer hurting.

583
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,170
It's a wonderful thing.

584
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,600
But at times, I feel...

585
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,040
How do you feel?

586
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,300
(Haru)

587
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,400
"Haru".

588
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,330
Dan Oh.

589
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,040
Oh, Kyung already left.

590
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,840
I didn't introduce myself properly.

591
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,710
My name is Haru.

592
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,910
Someone very dear to me
gave me that name.

593
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Go home safely.

594
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Goodbye, Dan Oh.

595
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,350
Oh, my.

596
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,350
- Hi, Kyung.
- What were you doing?

597
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,480
Nothing.

598
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,490
What do you want to do today?

599
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,320
Let's see.

600
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,350
Haru.

601
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,860
You've lost weight lately.

602
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,960
You're right. I think he's lost
about 3kg.

603
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,500
Did Bo Tong not come
to school today either?

604
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,960
I'm sure he'll be here.

605
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,970
Let's go.

606
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,350
That's odd. The doctor said
I was almost completely healed.

607
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,390
It has never beeped
this much before.

608
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
My heart has never hurt
this much before.

609
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,440
What?

610
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,710
By the way, do you know
why he's like that?

611
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,880
- What do you mean?
- He's always there at night.

612
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,320
It's obvious.

613
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,220
He's waiting.

614
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,620
"Waiting"?

615
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,960
If you lost your self-awareness,

616
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,930
you shouldn't have looked for him.

617
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,230
I'm all alone once again.

618
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,610
What? It's here.

619
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,810
Come here.

620
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,250
Look at this. This is still here.

621
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,980
(Dan Oh, Kyung)

622
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,690
I'm taller.

623
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,850
No, I'm taller.

624
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,820
See? Come here.

625
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,440
I'm this much taller.

626
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,610
I'm going to eat more
and become taller than you.

627
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,840
- When?
- When I become 10.

628
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,110
No way.

629
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,980
(Dan Oh)

630
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,090
What will you do
if I'm still taller?

631
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,560
I'll grant you a wish.

632
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,460
- Promise?
- Promise.

633
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,430
(Dan Oh, Kyung)

634
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,830
I didn't grow much.

635
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,000
What have you been eating?

636
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,100
This is unfair.

637
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,970
Oh, but I do have something
that's bigger than yours.

638
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,110
And what is that?

639
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,210
My love for you.

640
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,080
Do you love me that much?

641
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Yes.

642
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,490
Then let's meet at school
tomorrow night.

643
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,220
Tomorrow is our 10-year anniversary.

644
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,760
- What do you mean?
- Don't you remember?

645
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,060
We were going to measure
our height after 10 years.

646
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Did we?

647
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,960
It's obvious that you're much taller
than me.

648
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
Dan Oh.

649
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,970
Thank you for always being
by my side...

650
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:55,010
back then and now as well.

651
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,470
What's wrong?

652
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,310
Both the memories...

653
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,350
and you haven't changed.

654
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,980
I desperately wanted everything
to go back to its places.

655
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,690
I hoped that
the stage was the reality.

656
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,520
"Stage"?

657
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,730
But it wasn't the real you on stage.

658
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,130
And wishing to keep you by my side
knowing that you weren't yourself...

659
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,800
makes me a monster.

660
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,050
What's wrong?

661
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,680
Something is wrong with my body.

662
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,450
- What is it?
- I think I'm helping Nam Ju...

663
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,090
and Ju Da get closer.

664
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Look what happened earlier.

665
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,360
Why did I push Ju Da
when she did nothing?

666
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,860
I'm not that mean, you know.

667
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,430
Thanks to you,
Ju Da felt into Nam Ju's arms.

668
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,600
Hey.

669
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,130
I thought you gave up.

670
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,000
You said that you were going to bid
him a beautiful farewell.

671
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,240
- Come on.
- Okay.

672
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,140
Don't even bring up his name
in front of me.

673
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,470
Gosh, my life belongs to me.

674
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,140
Come to think of it,

675
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,210
I was playing Cupid
between Nam Ju and Ju Da...

676
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,710
on multiple occasions.

677
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,220
It feels as if someone has
control over my actions.

678
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,450
Gosh. I hate living a life
that I have no control over.

679
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,760
I've done my share of time for that.

680
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,720
When I was young, I was always
at the hospital because I was sick.

681
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,730
I will help you get
your memories back,

682
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,600
so you have complete control
over your life.

683
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,070
I'm serious.

684
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,100
It wasn't fun at all.

685
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,840
No, it was so much fun.

686
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,640
I'm serious.

687
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,580
What's wrong, Dan Oh?

688
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,250
I thought your heart is all better
now. Why did that beep?

689
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,350
- Right.
- It must be broken.

690
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,720
Ask Kyung to buy you
an expensive watch...

691
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,820
for the wedding gift.

692
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,990
Since we're on the subject,
ask him to buy that tonight.

693
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,220
Tonight?

694
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,490
What if tonight becomes
a historical moment for them?

695
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,090
Goodness, look at you.

696
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,730
So on a day like this...

697
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,570
No, it's nothing like that.

698
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,000
Dan Oh, I'm the expert on dressing
people up for their dates.

699
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,940
What time are you meeting him?
I'll go style you from head to toe.

700
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,640
Hey, you're not going to make her
look like a zombie, right?

701
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,010
You know that thing you often do.

702
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,340
- Come over here now.
- No.

703
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,380
- You come here.
- Okay.

704
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,950
Why is this happening?

705
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,190
(I'm almost there. I'm glad
the weather is great today.)

706
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,960
(I'm glad the weather...)

707
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,630
(I'm glad the weather is great too.)

708
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,480
I'm on my way.

709
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,440
That's odd.

710
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,200
Why is this beeping again?

711
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,750
I'm not sick.

712
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,110
Why is my heart beating so fast?

713
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,460
I told you, didn't I?

714
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,200
I said I would be taller
10 years later.

715
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,470
But let's still measure our height.

716
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,600
This feels a bit unfair,

717
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,710
but I always keep my promises.

718
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,370
I'll grant you a wish.

719
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,370
Dan Oh.

720
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,570
I came here because I wanted
to see you one last time.

721
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,080
It's okay if I get erased
in the comic.

722
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,780
As long as you're happy,

723
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,250
even if you don't remember
this moment,

724
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,120
- I'll be...
- I'm...

725
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,360
a terminally-ill high school girl.

726
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,530
And you were a nameless extra.
Number 13.

727
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,360
Thanks to you, my fate has changed.

728
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,070
And every day of my life
has become special.

729
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,310
You said you would never leave me.

730
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,650
You promised me
that you wouldn't leave me alone.

731
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,500
Dan Oh.

732
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,300
Every moment of my life
is meant for you.

733
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
And even in my last scene,

734
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,110
I'll remember you.

735
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,290
("Secret")

736
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,300
(I brought her here from Paris.)

737
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,640
Get out, Do Hwa.

738
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,880
"Do Hwa"? That guy in my class?

739
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:48,950
Hello, Dried Squid Fairy.

740
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,920
I'm glad.

741
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,750
I missed you.

742
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,330
Ta-da.

743
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:07,170
You want me to eat everything here?

744
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,670
Yes.

745
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340
Dig in.

746
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,770
Right. Here. Try this.

747
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,570
Try this.

748
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,540
Here.
Try the stir-fried dried squid too.

749
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,010
You said you liked
stir-fried dried squid.

750
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,810
Aren't you being too nice to me?

751
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,650
I like students who like
stir-fried dried squid.

752
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,190
Since we don't have much time left,

753
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,660
I'll be allowed to spend
a bit of time with you, right?

754
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,370
It's impossible to pretend not to...

755
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,270
know you.

756
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,050
- I can get rid of this.
- Get lost.

757
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,910
And the second one is
on how to take selfies.

758
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,850
- You need to take the photo first.
- Let me see.

759
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:57,880
I'm on my way.

760
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,420
- Hey. stop that.
- This won't work.

761
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,490
- I'm serious. Look.
- Look at this.

762
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,120
- Hey, this is it.
- This is fun.

763
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,360
Yes!

764
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,690
- This is what I'm talking about.
- It's good.

765
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,590
Look at the light.
Why don't you strike a pose?

766
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,600
Great.

767
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,630
- Change it.
- You look pretty.

768
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,240
The stage between Dan Oh and me
will start shortly.

769
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,240
You can go in place of me.

770
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,020
Don't get the wrong idea.

771
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,680
I don't want to help you.

772
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,250
But Dan Oh probably
would want to see you.

773
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,060
No.

774
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,620
I'm doing this
because I hate that darn writer.

775
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,360
I thought you were the only one...

776
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,900
who could change the stage.

777
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,370
Try it if you can.

778
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,200
Don't look at me like that.

779
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,340
What? You can't do it?

780
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,800
Kyung.

781
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:29,380
Go.

782
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,620
Go.

783
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,790
Back then and even now,

784
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,360
I'm like a monster to you.

785
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,010
At least for Eun Dan Oh of "Secret",

786
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,780
you weren't like that.

787
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,450
Two any old characters
in a romance comic...

788
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,750
who exist only for
the main characters.

789
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,050
You're Baek Kyung of A3,
the wounded and mean guy.

790
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,020
And I'm a terminally ill girl
who had a crush on you.

791
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,990
There are cliches,

792
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,000
but we're the only ones who know
how cruel and sad this is.

793
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,530
We're just these characters
that the writer created,

794
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,940
but we're just Dan Oh and Kyung
before our characters.

795
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,040
Kyung.

796
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,410
That's why...

797
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,610
Dan Oh of "Secret"
wants to thank you.

798
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,650
Dan Oh of "Trumpet Creeper"
forgives you.

799
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,490
Those are just your characters
created by the writer.

800
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,200
Thank you.

801
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,870
I hope you can become the real you,

802
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,940
just like how I could find
the real me.

803
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,760
Did you read the romance comics
in the library?

804
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,170
My friend, you're way too slow.

805
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,330
If you keep reading those...

806
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,200
Hey, Ju Da.

807
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,940
- Hi.
- Hi, Do Hwa.

808
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,550
- Have a great class.
- You too.

809
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,800
What did I tell you?
I told you we have to hurry.

810
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,830
Not everyone can get the new bread.

811
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,570
I told you that it's all about
our speed, didn't I?

812
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:13,640
I'm sorry.

813
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,140
Do you know what to do next time?

814
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,110
Yes, I'll be faster.

815
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,780
I got angry just now,
so give me something to drink.

816
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,090
I don't want you...

817
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:33,860
to suddenly disappear
in the middle of the story.

818
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,800
We only have a few scenes left.

819
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,930
The writer is about to
wrap up this world.

820
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,000
Goodness. You're so clumsy.

821
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,140
You're unbelievably clumsy.
Give me your hand.

822
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,350
Gosh, why did you spill it?

823
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,280
Your jacket is wet too.

824
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,650
What are you doing?
What if someone sees us?

825
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,820
I don't care.

826
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,060
Dan Oh.

827
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,490
I don't mind...

828
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,660
no matter what the price is.

829
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,660
I like the art room the most
in our school.

830
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,860
Why?

831
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,090
It's where you made
my wish come true.

832
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,090
You showed me stars,
and we were on a date too.

833
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,200
Dan Oh.

834
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,100
Thank you.

835
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,900
For what?

836
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,140
For staying with me
in every single one of my scenes.

837
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,140
Then I want to thank you too.

838
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,780
Haru, thank you for helping me
change my character.

839
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,020
I was born with a weak heart,

840
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,680
had a crush on a guy for 10 years,
and was just an extra.

841
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,590
This absurd character
that the writer created...

842
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,550
only for the main characters
changed completely.

843
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,190
I'm so glad that it was you
who changed it for me.

844
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,660
If my fate was to live out
the writer's character,

845
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,360
then I decided to have you
be the fate I made.

846
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,940
Haru. Please be with me
on my final page.

847
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:33,950
Ta-da.

848
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,620
Ta-da.

849
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,620
What was that sound?

850
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,020
(Extra-ordinary You)
