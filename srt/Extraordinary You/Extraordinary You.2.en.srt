1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,410
You'll be my errand girl
from now on,

3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,580
Yeo Ju Da.

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,150
- Is he serious?
- Yeo Ju Da?

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,620
- No way.
- My gosh.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,049
Ju Da, your last name is Yeo?

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,090
Nam Ju is the male lead,
which is what his name means.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,130
Yeo Ju Da. Yeo Ju Da...

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,060
Yeo Ju Da?

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,700
You're the heroine?

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,640
I wasn't the heroine?

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,100
I can't believe this.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,010
You're here...

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,920
Where am I?

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,830
(Characters)

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,260
(Oh Nam Ju, Yeo Ju Da, Lee Do Hwa)

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,460
(Baek Kyung, Shin Sae Mi)

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,760
(Extra Characters)

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,000
No way.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,570
(Eun Dan Oh, Kyung's fiancee,
has a heart condition)

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,280
(Eun Dan Oh, Kyung's fiancee,
has a heart condition)

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm just an extra?

23
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,000
(Dried Squid, Ahn Su Chul, Mo Beom,
Ban Jang, Eun Dan Oh)

24
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,240
Where did you get this?

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,730
Why?

26
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,710
It looks just like mine.

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,780
It's yours.

28
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,950
Then why do you have it?

29
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,620
I don't think this is
the right place to talk about that.

30
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,590
Wasn't it around here?

31
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,690
That you ruined my school uniform.

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,900
You didn't only ruin
my school uniform but...

33
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
For what?

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,570
For touching your face with my lips.

36
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,440
Does that bother you so much?

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,350
Do you want me
to take responsibility?

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,550
No, that's not what I meant.

39
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,190
Even if you can't do anything about
touching my face with your lips,

40
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,630
you should still pay
for the laundry.

41
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,160
But if you run errands for me well,
I'll exempt you from that...

42
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,870
and give this back to you.

43
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,340
How childish.
This is way too childish!

44
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,440
("Secret")

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,780
Romance comic books are
meant to be childish.

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,780
I did think all my classmates' names
were so weird.

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,350
Il Jin, Yi Jin, Sam Jin,

48
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,550
Ban Jang, Mo Beom...

49
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,250
Yeo Ju Da, Oh Nam Ju...

50
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,320
How nice and simple are they?

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,990
Dried Squid.

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,760
I wonder why I'm not called
Heart Disease.

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,930
In addition to being a part
of this ridiculous story,

54
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,100
I'm an extra? I, Eun Dan Oh?

55
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,610
Yes.

56
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,100
You're not the main character here.

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,210
- That's crazy.
- Open your heart and accept it.

58
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,209
I'm not even
the main character here.

59
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,810
I'm an extra in this childish comic.

60
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,750
Do you expect me to say,
"Thank you very much"?

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,150
You seem to be more shocked...

62
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,920
that you're an extra
than that you're in a comic.

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,390
Everything I say and do is...

64
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,460
for Oh Nam Ju and Yeo Ju Da.

65
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,290
What about me?

66
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,360
Am I supposed to only help
the main character all my life?

67
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,300
You have your role as an extra too.

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,400
The writer will decide
what you'll say and do.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,870
That's what frustrates me!

70
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,010
Who says the writer can do that?

71
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,240
Calm down.

72
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,510
We're in a romance comic book.
Why don't we keep our dignity?

73
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,010
"Dignity"?

74
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm not even the main character.
Who cares about my dignity?

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,950
That's ridiculous.

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,250
I hate this obnoxious writer.

77
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,520
What makes you think
you can do this to me?

78
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,390
I bet the writer had no idea...

79
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,900
you could be this aggressive.

80
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,940
All right. It's time to go back
to where you belong.

81
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,940
Gosh, what are you doing?

82
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,450
What's wrong with you?
Get out of my way.

83
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,550
Ju Da, what's all this?

84
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,190
Are you going to sell these?

85
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,150
Just sit down.

86
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,670
So this whole place is
for those two?

87
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,750
Even the sunshine
follows her around.

88
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,690
Ju Da, will you scoot over a little?

89
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,860
Darn it.

90
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,930
Can you sit over there instead?

91
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,270
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

92
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,740
I just want to sit here.

93
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,610
- Can you move?
- Okay.

94
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,510
Thanks.

95
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,080
Yes! This is it.

96
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,260
I can't believe this.
How can this be possible?

97
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,880
The writer is pretty clever.

98
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,010
Ju Da gets to have everything...

99
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,650
that boys go crazy for?

100
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,020
Dan Oh, please step up.

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,760
What are you waiting for?
You're today's model.

102
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,390
Give her a big hand!

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,120
Everyone, please look at Dan Oh.

104
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
Which side of her face
do you see from here?

105
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,550
- The right side.
- The left side.

106
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,560
- It's the left side, pig.
- "Pig"?

107
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,720
Pig, it's the left side.

108
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,560
That's right. Also,
even if you're on her left side,

109
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,260
depending on where you're sitting,

110
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,830
she'll look a little different
to all of you.

111
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,570
It all depends on the angle,

112
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,770
the direction of light,

113
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,880
and how you feel about the model.

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,910
You could say...

115
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,180
that each of us is actually
drawing a different person.

116
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,010
You can start.

117
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Oh, my. Nam Ju, you're so talented.

118
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,870
Look at that.

119
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,870
But Dan Oh has shorter hair.

120
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,640
This looks more like Ju Da...

121
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,580
It looks exactly like Ju Da!

122
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,740
Ju Da?

123
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,410
Su Chul, how dare you
comment on my drawing?

124
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,580
I'm sorry. You don't have to
get so worked up. We're friends.

125
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,120
What's the big deal?
He says it's Dan Oh.

126
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,230
I love boys who are good at drawing.

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,990
- What did she say?
- Why do you have to be so indirect?

128
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Sae Mi, I've never thought of you...

129
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,400
- that way...
- I'm not talking about you!

130
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

131
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,440
Guys, just look at his drawing.

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,340
- Okay.
- Look at those eyes.

133
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,140
How deep do they look?

134
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,140
They must be
at about 300m above sea level.

135
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,910
- It's "below", you idiot.
- Oh, she meant depth.

136
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,280
Look at the hair now.

137
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,280
It's extremely detailed, right?

138
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,050
I'm doing all this
for Nam Ju and Ju Da, right?

139
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,390
Guys! Attention!

140
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,190
There's a person over here too!

141
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,360
- What do you think?
- It looks like her.

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,630
Stop hitting me.

143
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,570
It looks just like her.

144
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,210
Gosh, I can't stand it anymore.

145
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,160
Are you guys finally looking at me?

146
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,460
Did you see that?

147
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,220
What just happened?

148
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,560
How did those plaster casts
go back to where they were?

149
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,630
Gosh.

150
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,730
What is this?

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,070
Here too?

152
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,970
What...

153
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,640
("Secret")

154
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,070
Weird things are happening here too.

155
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,800
You're not even surprised anymore.

156
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,830
Explain.

157
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,200
- What do you mean?
- Explain...

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,470
so that I can understand.

159
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,540
We're in a comic.

160
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,410
Anything can happen here.

161
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,280
But it doesn't make sense.

162
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,750
This right here. I smashed it.

163
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,620
How violent.

164
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,820
But no one seemed to notice it,

165
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,890
and the broken plaster casts
went back to normal.

166
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,360
Well, I'm not sure.

167
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,800
What about that one?

168
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,520
I really...

169
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,120
didn't want to use this.

170
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,390
Here we go. Ta-da.

171
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,000
All right. Listen up.

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,270
This world is in a comic
created by the writer.

173
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,940
And this is a secret place
in the romance comic.

174
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,540
Nothing happens here
unless it's intended by the writer.

175
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,010
That's why we only say lines
the writer intended us to say...

176
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,220
and behave the way
the writer drew us.

177
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,690
And this place is called the stage.

178
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,390
I was nice to Ju Da...

179
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,290
and couldn't talk back to that jerk,
Kyung because of that?

180
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,430
Right. Bingo.

181
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,430
Scenes and spaces...

182
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,100
that the writer hasn't drawn
also exist.

183
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,300
Since the writer
didn't draw this scene,

184
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,570
that kind of odd stuff happens
as you can see.

185
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,940
This is called the shadow.

186
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,110
"Shadow".

187
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,080
It's outside the stage.

188
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,720
In other words,
characters are free in the shadow...

189
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,890
just like us here.

190
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,420
Only characters
who are aware of themselves...

191
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,690
can remember what happens
in the shadow.

192
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,030
This is crazy.

193
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,630
However, just because
you are aware of yourself,

194
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,700
it doesn't mean
you can be free all the time.

195
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,900
Whatever a character does,

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,340
things are bound to happen
just as the writer has planned...

197
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,740
on the stage.

198
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,350
The plaster casts you broke
in the art classroom were restored.

199
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,780
You were sitting down when
you were standing up a second ago.

200
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,150
It means that
in the world of comics,

201
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,450
things are bound to happen
as planned.

202
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,020
It's the same...

203
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,120
as fate.

204
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,420
"Fate"?

205
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,770
I will never behave the way
the writer wants.

206
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,080
We'll see...

207
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,280
in whose hand my fate lies.

208
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,310
Stage.

209
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,520
"Instead of bidding farewell
to you,"

210
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,590
"I would rather give up my weaving."

211
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,620
This is so touching.

212
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,520
Okay, up to here was a year.

213
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,620
When you read through it,

214
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,690
it means that she is willing to go
after him even if it means...

215
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,300
she must give up everything...

216
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,600
she loves
as long as he loves her back.

217
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,300
It made a mark
in the history of literature.

218
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Dan Oh.

219
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,940
All right.
Why don't you read the chorus?

220
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,710
Hey. What are you doing?

221
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,810
My gosh, this is the line.

222
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,650
This will get your heart to pound.

223
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,850
Excuse me.

224
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,720
You should definitely read up
on this excellent reference.

225
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,730
"If you are so kind to love me back,
I will follow you in tears."

226
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,830
- I'm on the stage again.
- "Pyeongyang is the capital,"

227
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,970
"but I love a new capital
that was just built."

228
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,400
What's this?

229
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,740
Since you feel sorry for me,
I should drink this?

230
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,280
You are the writer indeed.
You know what I like.

231
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,850
Again, again. It's the stage again.

232
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,820
I knew it.

233
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,420
There's no way
the writer would give me free food.

234
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,620
Dan Oh, hello.

235
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,630
Hi.

236
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,660
You didn't eat?

237
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,100
I had to do something
in the morning.

238
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,600
Have this.

239
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,240
- I'm okay.
- Just drink it.

240
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Thank you.

241
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm so thirsty too.

242
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,510
My role is to give this milk
to the main character.

243
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,520
You're always helping me, Dan Oh.

244
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,890
Thank you.

245
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,560
This is good.

246
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,470
I can't ever get used to that.

247
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,280
What is this?

248
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,230
Errand girl.

249
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,660
- Me?
- Is there another errand girl...

250
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,130
here other than you?

251
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Let's go.

252
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,000
Hold on.

253
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,510
I earned that yesterday
with my part-time job.

254
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,410
I didn't ask you to give me
your pocket change.

255
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,820
I felt bad
for dirtying your uniform.

256
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,680
I should pay it back
as soon as I can,

257
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,990
so I won't have to carry your bag.

258
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,290
Do you think you can pay it back
until you graduate at this rate?

259
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,390
Yes. I can.

260
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,500
Hey, did you see that?

261
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,130
I didn't know she could be so bold.

262
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,290
What do you want to eat, Dan Oh?

263
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,290
I have to drink
strawberry milk today.

264
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,820
Okay, here I go.

265
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,830
Let's go.

266
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,590
- Wait up.
- Come on.

267
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,460
- What are you doing?
- Move.

268
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,770
- There's a line!
- Why are you cutting?

269
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,300
- Hey, move out of the way.
- Excuse me.

270
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,740
Hey, move back.

271
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,510
It's A3!

272
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,210
It's A3.

273
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,950
- We're so lucky.
- Look at them.

274
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,080
- They are so handsome.
- It's A3.

275
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,490
The milk...

276
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,930
- You're so hot!
- Kyung!

277
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,630
- Look over here!
- Kyung!

278
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,940
- Hello.
- Have some milk.

279
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,510
- Can you look over here?
- That.

280
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,980
- Hey, A3 is here.
- My gosh.

281
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,010
That. Strawberry milk.

282
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,680
- Strawberry milk?
- I guess it's for me.

283
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
Give me all of it.

284
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,350
You're completely wet.
You should've been careful.

285
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,120
I can't even eat what I want.

286
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,390
That's odd.

287
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,190
Why is Nam Ju at the snack bar?

288
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,430
My strawberry milk.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,600
Look what you did at the snack bar.

290
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,500
Why are you making
her carry your bag?

291
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,200
I'd like to know too. Nam Ju.

292
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,970
You don't seem like yourself lately.

293
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,940
Just because. I was curious.

294
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
I love this.

295
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,020
Hey, this is mine.

296
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,350
Gosh, you're so cheap.

297
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,050
You have a lot here.
I just drank one.

298
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,090
Hey, you don't like sweets.

299
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,860
Is it sweet?

300
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,500
I never said that I hated sweets.

301
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,630
This is good. It's nice.

302
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
(Father)

303
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,370
Because you failed
to win over a girl,

304
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,670
it affected the investment deal.

305
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,520
My gosh, this is so precious.

306
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,520
I will tape this back.

307
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,230
I'll destroy the writer.

308
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,430
You scared me for a second.

309
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,930
The writer ought to draw
the scenes more meticulously.

310
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,900
Look at that. Over there.

311
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,470
There are more than
a couple of those odd objects.

312
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,200
Right. And there was
another one here.

313
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,510
Here?

314
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,780
It was here before.

315
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,210
You know what it is, right?

316
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,180
You know that black space
that looks like a black hole.

317
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,450
It was here?

318
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,920
I definitely saw it.

319
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,520
Come on. There's no way.

320
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,030
No, my hand went
into that hole once.

321
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,530
Promise that you will never see
a dangerous thing like that.

322
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,770
- Promise me.
- "Dangerous"?

323
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,030
Why?

324
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,570
It will be too much
for you to handle.

325
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,940
I can't seem to handle myself
the most nowadays.

326
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,080
Ma'am, I have a question.

327
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,050
What is it?

328
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,060
I used a trigonometrical function
to get the right answer for this.

329
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,690
I was wondering if I could use
calculus to solve this too.

330
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,930
Let me solve it for you.

331
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,430
What? I got everything right.

332
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,830
Why am I asking a question?

333
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,510
Hey, you owe me again.

334
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,650
I had to ask a question
to let them flirt?

("Lee Ha Nee's Higher Mathematics")

336
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,220
Give this to Ju Da.

337
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,760
Why should I? Don't do it.
Don't do as you're told.

338
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,860
This is the best math lecturer,

339
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,870
Lee Ha Nee's note
for higher mathematics.

340
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,770
This is really precious.

341
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,830
Do that for me.

342
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
("Lee Ha Nee's Higher Mathematics")

343
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,780
What's this?

344
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,210
Nam Ju asked me to give it to you.

345
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,430
Why didn't you name me Love Bridge
instead of Eun Dan Oh?

346
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,570
Love Bridge.

347
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,170
My role in this story is
to be a cupid...

348
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,340
to the two main lead roles.

349
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,510
And...

350
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,250
get miserably ignored
by a jerk like him.

351
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,110
- Those two.
- We need to talk.

352
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,850
What are you trying to say to me?
No way.

353
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,590
I don't have any say in this.

354
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,390
I'll have to face him...

355
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,230
and talk to him
just as the writer wants.

356
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,330
Is this your way of protesting?

357
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,900
- What are you talking about?
- Don't pretend like you don't know.

358
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,970
You're why Chairman Eun is
trying to reduce the investment.

359
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,010
Bullying us with money.

360
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,480
Is that the way you express
your awesome first love?

361
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,010
Kyung, you need to listen to me.

362
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,280
Goodness, what are you saying?
That's completely misunderstandable.

363
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,480
This is so annoying.

364
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,350
Don't jump to conclusions.

365
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,620
I never told my family...

366
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,420
that you hate me.

367
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,490
And I won't tell them
in the future either.

368
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,660
This isn't a problem for the adults.

369
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,830
It's a problem...

370
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,630
between you and me.

371
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,540
You should be swearing at him.
Why are you crying?

372
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,340
Dan Oh, say it.
Punch him or something.

373
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,580
I'll talk to my dad...

374
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,050
about the investment.

375
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,880
Goodness, what a pushover.

376
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,150
Talk to him about what?

377
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,890
Can you go alone?

378
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,230
I'm sick of working
as your caregiver.

379
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,860
It's awful enough that
I have a heart condition,

380
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,600
but I have to keep liking him
even after he's that rude to me?

381
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,340
Because that's my character?

382
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,940
What you said really hurts.

383
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,580
My heart is already a wreck.

384
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,910
Please stop hurting me anymore.

385
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,520
Forget about this character
that only hurts me.

386
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,430
Writer, I will make sure
I take it back from you.

387
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,030
Because my life belongs to me.

388
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,430
Hit him hard.

389
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,870
- Your turn.
- Hit her hard, okay?

390
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,040
Cham-cham-cham.

391
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,810
- Do it.
- Hit her hard.

392
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,740
- I've been waiting for this.
- He's going to hit you.

393
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,210
Forget it. Hit me hard.

394
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,910
- I'll hit you really hard.
- Keep it up!

395
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,420
- Come on.
- What was that?

396
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,350
- Are you two flirting?
- Goodness.

397
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,960
They look so happy.

398
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,430
If I wasn't aware of myself,

399
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,730
would it have hurt less
whenever Kyung turned me down?

400
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,270
Would I have been happy
every single day of my life?

401
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
No, I still like who I am now.

402
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,120
I can change whatever that hurts me.

403
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,590
I will change this. I will.

404
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,460
What? Dan Oh,
you're cleaning up? Why?

405
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,070
Aren't you Ms. Eun, who feels
comfortable in chaos?

406
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,270
I've been reborn today.

407
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,710
You're watching a historical moment
of Dan Oh cleaning up her...

408
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,510
I think something smells.

409
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,010
Darn it.

410
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,880
If you aren't going to help,
stop bothering...

411
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,280
Is that mold?

412
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,150
Right, I can see into the future.

413
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,230
What you saw isn't the future.
It's called a storyboard.

414
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,070
It's like a rough sketch
that a writer creates.

415
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,200
It includes lines
and the presentation method.

416
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,440
Kind of like a preview.

417
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,840
Whatever.
If I can see it beforehand,

418
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,310
doesn't that mean I can change it?

419
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,280
I can change my character
and the next scene.

420
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,080
No, nothing changes in this world.

421
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,250
Never.

422
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,030
Why doesn't he have
any dreams or hope if he's a fairy?

423
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,350
("Guardian Angel Story")

424
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,470
What was that?

425
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,710
Has Ju Da always been that pretty?

426
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,610
Goodness, it finally began.

427
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,410
The fateful moment when
the supporting actor falls in love.

428
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,150
Poor Do Hwa.

429
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,490
You'll have
an awfully tough time too.

430
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Thanks.

432
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,530
I heard you're busy preparing
your company to be listed.

433
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,830
I'm barely busy.

434
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,270
What we do is like a joke...

435
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,700
compared to your business.

436
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,310
Everyone knows how talented
of a businessman you are.

437
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,410
And you have
a great personality too,

438
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,870
so I have a lot to learn from you.

439
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,580
If you help us out a little more,

440
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,980
things might go smoother.

441
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,080
I doubt there's
anything I can do to help.

442
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,880
There are a lot of things.

443
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,960
Oh, I'm thinking about having
dinner with Chairman Oh too.

444
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,490
Chairman Oh of Serinne Fashion?

445
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,930
I didn't know you were
interested in fashion too.

446
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,030
Now I see...

447
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,760
why you've become
such a huge success.

448
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,030
Since our kids are
all in the same class,

449
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,570
it could be a great gathering.

450
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,000
What was his son's name again?

451
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,340
Oh Nam Ju.

452
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,470
You met him at my school.

453
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,140
Right, I heard Chairman Oh's son is
close with Kyung.

454
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,940
When did you get this big?

455
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,750
It seems like just yesterday
when you were this tiny.

456
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,450
You can probably get married soon.

457
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,650
It feels like we're a family...

458
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,050
to dinner together like this.

459
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,420
I'll invite you
to my house next time.

460
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,560
The pasta that Mother made
last time was...

461
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,120
really delicious.

462
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,690
Mother, my foot.

463
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,430
If you want to have
that pasta again,

464
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,740
come over anytime.

465
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,880
Come in.

466
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,620
Dan Oh, stay out of
my family matters.

467
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,390
Mother, my foot.

468
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,760
That jerk.

469
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,070
Why would you keep this?

470
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,170
I know. I don't understand either.

471
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,940
Look at it closely.

472
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,640
- You were such a brat as a kid too.
- What?

473
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,450
I always wondered why you never
said nice things or smiled.

474
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,020
But now I know
it wasn't your choice.

475
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,620
What's wrong with you?

476
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,830
What's this?

477
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,800
Leave it alone. It's my destiny.

478
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,800
Your destiny? This?

479
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,070
You don't have to know.

480
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,110
Right. Kyung,
you better stay away from me.

481
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,210
What?

482
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,110
Keep a distance from me
at all times.

483
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,550
Also, don't even dream of
carrying me in your arms, okay?

484
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,950
Are you crazy?

485
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,160
Forget it.
You won't even remember this later.

486
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,830
Get out. Get out right now!

487
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,060
- I will.
- Get out!

488
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,270
Gosh, that jerk.

489
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,300
I'll be nice and eat this.

490
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,710
No matter how many times I tell you,
you won't understand.

491
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,530
What is she doing?

492
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,210
Ju Da is so cute.

493
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,720
You think that's cute?

494
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,190
She's completely different
from all the other girls.

495
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,790
Ju Da.

496
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,460
You're lucky that you fall in love
with her at first sight.

497
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,930
Dan Oh?

498
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,400
You just fell in love with Ju Da
at first sight, didn't you?

499
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,870
That's wrong. Considering
what happened at the library,

500
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,170
technically,
this is not a love at first sight.

501
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,580
That's the destiny
of a supporting character.

502
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,179
You're always a little late
and falls a little short.

503
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,380
Especially when Ju Da is in danger.

504
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,650
Still, some readers will like
a supporting character like you.

505
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,820
Even an extra like me is
working so hard.

506
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,159
So cheer up.

507
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,000
Is she really okay though?

508
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,670
What's with her?

509
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,710
She's so cute.

510
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,850
- Sae Mi.
- Yes?

511
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,590
Is it very painful to break a leg?

512
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,160
Don't get me started.

513
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,360
I once broke my leg
while horseback riding,

514
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,090
and the pain was killing me.

515
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,430
Is it that bad?

516
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,800
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how painful was it?

517
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,960
I'd say it was nine.

518
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,330
Nine?

519
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,600
- No. It was 9.5.
- 9.5?

520
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,740
It's extremely painful.

521
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,070
I'm doomed.

522
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,480
All right. I'm ready.

523
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,080
Are you having an MMA fighting?

524
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,250
If I can't avoid it,
I should confront it.

525
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,850
Are you going to confront me?

526
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,820
I'll just avoid you. I lose.

527
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,490
This looks a little different.

528
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,590
Let me do it. Guys.

529
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,690
I'll clean the whole place alone.
You guys can go home.

530
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,660
- What's with you?
- Guys!

531
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,430
I'll clean the whole place alone!

532
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,070
No one should be left in the lobby!
Leave!

533
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,840
Judging from her determination,
I'm sure she'll be the champion.

534
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,740
This will do.

535
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,580
As you know,
I'm officially Nam Ju's first love.

536
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,520
That new girl can't do this to me!

537
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,880
Of course not.

538
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,950
She could transfer here thanks to
Nam Ju's foundation scholarship.

539
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,150
She should know her place.

540
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,520
But she can't stop
flirting with Nam Ju.

541
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,630
Gosh, this is exactly
what I saw in the storyboard.

542
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,860
She pretends to be so innocent.
"Nam Ju!"

543
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,260
I can't stand it.

544
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,970
Okay. Kyung isn't here.

545
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,670
Everything's fine so far.

546
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,300
I just need to leave this place...

547
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,440
Please let me move.

548
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,980
Do you remember the play...

549
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,310
we did back in kindergarten,
"Sleeping Beauty"?

550
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,780
I played the princess,
and Nam Ju the prince.

551
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,950
Is that right?

552
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,080
The moment Nam Ju kissed me
on the lips...

553
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,250
As you know,
that's when our history began.

554
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,960
But Nam Ju doesn't seem
to remember that.

555
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,160
Isn't that so sad?

556
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,660
Unbelievable. Really?

557
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,790
Yes.

558
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,200
It's all Ju Da's fault.

559
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,330
You're right.

560
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,700
Am I an audience member?
Why did I say she was right?

561
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,370
If she flirts with Nam Ju again,

562
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,600
I'll destroy her.

563
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,610
Of course, you should.

564
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,970
Everything I say sounds so lame.

565
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,780
- That foxy wench.
- Nam Ju is here!

566
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,850
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

567
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,050
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

568
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,120
Nam Ju!

569
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,050
Look at me! Hi!

570
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,750
Hi.

571
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,290
I saw this...

572
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,000
In addition to having a pain
in my heart,

573
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,740
I have to break my leg
while trying to help Ju Da?

574
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,180
Oh, no. Why is she already here?
I'm not ready yet.

575
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,250
Hey, Errand Girl.

576
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,120
Are you ignoring me?

577
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,890
Good. Ignore him and walk away.

578
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,920
You don't even have any bag
I should carry right now.

579
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,060
Well, that's...

580
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,220
I have to go.

581
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,800
No. You can't leave yet.
Stay a bit longer.

582
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,030
Wait.

583
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,770
What's going on?
Is she not coming here?

584
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,190
Dried Squid was right.

585
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,970
There's nothing I can change
after all.

586
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,080
Dan Oh!

587
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Dan Oh.

588
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,810
You were asleep for so long.
I was getting worried.

589
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,850
According to the storyboard,
I should be in the nurse's office...

590
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,120
and wearing a cast on my right leg.

591
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
How is your leg?

592
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,990
It's different from the storyboard.

593
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,200
This can't be a coincidence.

594
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,330
Someone must have helped me.

595
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,870
I've had heart problems since birth.

596
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,540
But right now, my heart isn't
pounding because of the disease.

597
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,940
Why did Ju Da have to fall over you?

598
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,580
It's all my fault.

599
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,640
I'm sorry, Dan Oh.

600
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,210
It's okay.

601
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,110
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,190
Kyung carried you all the way here.

603
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,350
What are you talking about? Kyung?

604
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,290
Yes. As soon as you fell, he picked
you up and carried you here.

605
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
It was pretty cool.

606
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,300
Didn't I fall on someone?

607
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,330
I'm not sure.

608
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,100
That's strange. I'm sure...

609
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,000
Sae Mi!

610
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,640
What did you do to Ju Da?

611
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,010
Nam Ju, the thing is...

612
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,350
You should stop.
This has nothing to do with you.

613
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,150
It does. You got hurt.

614
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,290
Don't get hurt
without my permission again.

615
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,960
Don't go anywhere dangerous.

616
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,760
Just stay right beside me.

617
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,190
Why are they suddenly being
all romantic?

618
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,270
Guys, I'm the one
who's actually hurt.

619
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,170
Gosh, it's so heartbreaking
to be an extra.

620
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,970
Dan Oh?

621
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:24,970
Do Hwa?

622
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,440
What are you doing here?

623
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,450
I was just passing by.

624
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,050
I was checking up
on my friend who's hurt.

625
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,980
- Ju Da is fine.
- What?

626
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm the one in trouble.

627
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,840
- Hey, let me borrow your back.
- Why?

628
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,370
Just don't ask.
Let me see your back.

629
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,800
I need to find someone.

630
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,910
Who?

631
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,140
Someone who can change my fate?

632
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,440
What if that's me? What will you do?

633
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,880
Go ahead. Check it out
as much as you want.

634
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,680
You should take a good look at it.

635
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,390
Why are you drooling over my back?

636
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,390
That's scary.

637
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,260
Be quiet.
I'm taking this really seriously.

638
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,700
- What are you doing?
- Like this.

639
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,100
- Just like this.
- Hey.

640
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,750
You have a good back,

641
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,590
but that wasn't it.

642
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,990
Bye.

643
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,020
If I find the mysterious guy,

644
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,690
the story might change.

645
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,660
If I do, my fate might change!

646
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,030
You're mistaken.

647
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,470
The story changed.

648
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,140
That's enough.

649
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,410
You said nothing can change.

650
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,740
But what I saw doesn't match
the plot of the comic.

651
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,280
If things keep changing,

652
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,920
will I be able to
be more than an extra?

653
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,090
I'm certain of it.
There's something about that guy.

654
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,690
But why are these pages empty?

655
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,460
Those are the pages for the plot
that hasn't happened yet.

656
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,100
After each stage,
a page will be filled.

657
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,100
I see.

658
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,840
That means
I must find the guy myself.

659
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,700
How?

660
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,270
I just need three things.

661
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,540
Pacemaker, the sound of my heart,

662
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,950
and my back.

663
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,150
"Back"?

664
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,850
Don't be so surprised
when you see him in person.

665
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,090
I'm sure he was there.

666
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,460
The story changed.

667
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,930
- Hey.
- Seriously.

668
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,930
- Hey, let's go out.
- Give me a second.

669
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,200
Come on. Hurry up.

670
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,600
- What are you doing?
- Move.

671
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,310
This is the most important task
in my life.

672
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,110
Gosh.

673
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,950
Are you here to peep
when I'm changing?

674
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,610
Do you think I'm a pervert?

675
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,380
You saw me.
That's what you came for.

676
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,850
Don't bother me.

677
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,220
Just butt out.

678
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,720
What about your leg?
Are you all right?

679
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,860
Goodness.

680
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,190
Are you trying
to make it up to me now?

681
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,560
You seem okay.

682
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,840
Hey.

683
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,670
Let me check something.

684
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,550
What's wrong with you?

685
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,780
I knew it. It wasn't you.

686
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,780
Have you gone mad?

687
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,690
If you were him,
I would feel wronged.

688
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,390
Bye. I think I'll be
really busy from now on.

689
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,660
Kyung.

690
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,030
Where are you going?
Do you want to go to the snack bar?

691
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,060
Did you eat?

692
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,270
(Back)

693
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,910
(Classroom 1: 13 students,
Classroom 2: 12 students)

694
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,680
If I start with the juniors,

695
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,680
I have to check at least...

696
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,750
10 students a day.

697
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,120
This is so complicated.

698
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,640
(Change the story,
be more than an extra,)

699
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,710
(change my set-up,
and establish my own fate.)

700
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,110
(Be more than an extra,
change my set-up,)

701
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,280
(and establish my own fate.)

702
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,450
Okay.

703
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
What was that?

704
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,740
Did something pass by here?

705
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,750
Isn't that Dan Oh?

706
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,320
Yes!

707
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,690
Bounce!

708
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,360
Come on!

709
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,070
Dan Oh, what's wrong with you?

710
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,970
I'm sorry. It just came out.

711
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:52,970
I'm sorry.

712
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,940
That totally caught me off guard.

713
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,070
She's working hard.

714
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,110
I told her so many times
that nothing would change.

715
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,580
I get it. It's not something
she can just ignore.

716
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,080
At first,

717
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,320
everyone has expectations.

718
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,700
I'm so busy. What do you want?

719
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,770
Are you here for Ju Da?

720
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,440
I came here for Nam Ju.

721
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,200
All right.
Don't beat around the bush.

722
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,310
Let's make this easy on us.

723
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,370
You're bound to ask anyway.

724
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,410
You want to know about Ju Da
right now, not Nam Ju.

725
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,680
You like Ju Da.

726
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,010
- I do?
- Don't play innocent with me.

727
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,750
Ask me quickly.
I have a lot of backs to check.

728
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,920
Where is...

729
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,220
Ju Da?

730
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,520
In the schoolyard.

731
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,330
Hey, Do Hwa.

732
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,030
Did you get hurt badly?

733
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,340
No. I'm really strong, you know.

734
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,400
I was just taking a break.

735
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm glad.

736
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:06,710
I was worried.

737
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,650
Do Hwa.

738
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,820
You seem...

739
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,420
different.

740
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,820
You are always nice to me.

741
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,220
- It's because...
- You're like...

742
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,460
my guardian angel.

743
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,610
It's summer. Where did
the cherry blossom come from?

744
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,610
Good for you guys.

745
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,680
All right. Shall I start?

746
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,160
Hey.

747
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,970
Hey, can you run slower?

748
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,240
Gosh.

749
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,240
I can't run with this darned heart.

750
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,450
Gosh, I feel like a pervert.

751
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,790
Dan Oh, calm down. Relax.

752
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,570
Right. I can make him come find me.

753
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,040
I'm such a genius.

754
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,610
Fire.

755
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,540
- Here!
- Great.

756
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,110
- Get the inner corner.
- Darn it.

757
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,580
- Hey.
- Please.

758
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,950
- Let's do this.
- Yes. Even the writer won't know...

759
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,550
if I stay under the radar like this.

760
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,630
Hey, isn't our team the best?

761
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,460
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

762
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,560
I thought you couldn't take PE
because of your heart condition.

763
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,330
It's okay.

764
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,540
Let's go!

765
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,510
Please. Before the stage is over,

766
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,810
someone should throw a ball
at me hard. Please.

767
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,310
- Please.
- Fire.

768
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,150
Why aren't you playing?

769
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,820
Just because.

770
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,720
I see. "Just because."

771
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,420
Hold on.

772
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,790
Is it that good?

773
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,400
- Give that to me.
- Move.

774
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,400
- Come on, block that.
- Hey.

775
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,900
- Fire!
- Hey.

776
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,930
Hey, throw it over there, not here!

777
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,170
That was a foul.

778
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,340
- Nice!
- Over here.

779
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,040
It's not good
if you drink it like that.

780
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,340
Hey, pass it to me.

781
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,050
Hey, rest. Everyone, rest up.

782
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,410
- You must use a straw.
- Let's resume.

783
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:58,610
Then, it's good.

784
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,650
Take a deep breath.

785
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,650
Hey, don't. We can do this.

786
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,430
My gosh.

787
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,100
Hey, I'll get...
I'll get you a new one.

788
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,430
I'm sorry.

789
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,340
Okay, things are going
according to my plan.

790
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,340
Keep flirting for a long time, guys.

791
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,450
- Where's the ball?
- Move!

792
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,780
Over here, I'm the one
you're supposed to hit.

793
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,850
Hey, can't you see me?

794
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,150
I'm the one you should be aiming at.

795
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:42,420
- Give me the ball.
- Opposite side.

796
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,060
Watch out, I'm coming for you next.

797
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,700
Yes, you look like someone
who can throw well.

798
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,330
Welcome to Eun Dan Oh's world!

799
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,440
- All right!
- Hit him. Kill him!

800
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,510
Have I always been
this good at dodgeball?

801
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,150
Let's go.

802
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,410
- Come on, Ban Jang.
- That's it.

803
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,940
Yes, that's it. Throw it hard at me.
Give it to me!

804
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,790
I found you.

805
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,780
Darn it, that was so awful.

806
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,940
Why was I suddenly summoned here?

807
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,280
Where in the world is Ju Da?

808
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,380
Hey, she's coming in.

809
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,690
She was right in front of me,
and I had to come here to say this?

810
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,660
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

811
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,200
Nam Ju is looking for you.

812
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,730
Nam Ju? Why?

813
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,470
No idea, you should go.

814
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,900
You can give me
this strawberry milk.

815
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,050
Darn it, I have no time for this.

816
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,190
Where am I? What is this?

817
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,390
I have to be on the field,
but I'm in the nurse's office?

818
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,620
I'm sure he's already gone by now.

819
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,960
Move. Get up, Dan Oh.

820
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,100
What's going on in this scene?

821
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,900
Kyung? Nam Ju? Do Hwa? Or...

822
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,800
Okay, it's Ju Da.

823
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,540
Nam Ju.

824
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,270
Are you here?

825
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,510
What's with the door?

826
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,150
Hey.

827
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,490
I guess I won't be able to move
until this scene is over.

828
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,820
- Who's out there?
- At this rate,

829
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,320
I'll lose that guy forever.

830
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,490
Ju Da, not bad.

831
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,190
You go to this school with
Nam Ju's company's help,

832
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,060
and you always
hang out with him too.

833
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,870
Are you flirting with him
or something?

834
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,100
You should know your place.

835
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,170
Cinderella stories
only exist in books, Ju Da.

836
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,670
Stop giving him pennies...

837
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,770
to get his clothes cleaned
in order to stay involved with him,

838
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,980
and look back on what you did
in there, Ju Da.

839
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,050
Open the door. Open it.

840
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,650
- Let's go.
- Open the door. Open it.

841
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,820
Open it.

842
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,520
Open the door.

843
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,940
Dan Oh.

844
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,540
No one is going to come
even if you cried like that.

845
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:18,910
Don't you have a phone?

846
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,250
Right.

847
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,980
No one ever has a phone
in a crisis like this.

848
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,320
Move aside.

849
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,590
Do you trust me?

850
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,000
What? What was that? That was easy.

851
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,730
Hey, I'm sorry. Nam Ju is
supposed to open this, not me.

852
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:46,840
- Wait...
- Sorry.

853
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,370
Nam Ju is going to come soon,
so pretend like you didn't see me.

854
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,970
You won't remember anyway.

855
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,340
Hey, it's Nam Ju. See? I'm right.

856
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,910
He came here sooner than I thought.

857
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,350
Okay, I'll be leaving.

858
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,320
Anyway, how did he know?

859
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,530
Coincidences like that are a must
in a romantic comic.

860
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,140
- Nam Ju.
- Hey.

861
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,180
Errand Girl.

862
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,250
I told you to stick next to me.

863
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,190
What?

864
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,020
- Good riddance.
- What do you think she's up to?

865
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,720
She's probably crying.

866
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,860
You should have seen her face.

867
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,160
Hey, Sae Mi. Isn't that Nam Ju?

868
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,330
Where?

869
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,700
You're right. That's Nam Ju.

870
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,900
Did he save her?

871
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,240
I can't believe
she cried in front of him.

872
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,740
See that?
She's crying in the perfect timing.

873
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,980
She's such a sly fox.

874
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,780
She can never do anything...

875
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,980
unless Nam Ju gives her a hand.

876
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,220
Is she an idiot?

877
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,980
I can't let things go like this.

878
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,820
What is it this time? That guy.
Where's the guy with the back?

879
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,030
What? Seeds?

880
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,900
Oh, this must be it.

881
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,000
I can't believe
how hard it is to find him.

882
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,480
Ju Da.

883
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,940
Hey, Dan Oh. What is it?

884
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,080
These. Our teacher told me
to give these to you.

885
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,880
The flower garden will
look prettier.

886
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,620
Thanks, Dan Oh.

887
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,690
Nam Ju's errand girl is Ju Da,

888
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,690
and I'm the writer's errand girl.

889
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,390
I've seen people run errands
for bread,

890
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,930
but never for seeds.

891
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,230
What? Is my job over?

892
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,700
Make it look pretty, then.

893
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,810
Hey, isn't that her?

894
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,250
That's her.

895
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,710
Nice location.

896
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,460
She's the main character.
I'm sure she'll figure it out.

897
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,930
I didn't become their cupid
according to my will,

898
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,230
but I can't just pass by
even when I see something unjust.

899
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,850
Nice shot.

900
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,790
- Sorry, my hand slipped.
- Boo-ya.

901
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:51,490
- Gosh, bad news.
- Good for her.

902
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,290
I can't even do this?

903
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,630
Nothing changes in this world.

904
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:00,760
Never.

905
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,470
Gosh, darn it.

906
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,070
How come nothing goes
the way I want it to?

907
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,210
Dan Oh, are you okay?

908
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,170
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

909
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,280
Wear it.

910
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,620
You can't go back to the classroom
looking like that.

911
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,790
Dan Oh.

912
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,560
I'm not looking to flirt
with the heroine,

913
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,590
but should the main character
or the supporting character do this?

914
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,200
Thanks.

915
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,130
Don't get it dirty
before you give it back.

916
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,080
Of course. There's no reason
for him to be here at this point.

917
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,590
Is his character
someone who saves me?

918
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:59,160
Why? I'm not even the heroine.

919
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,360
What are you doing?

920
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,900
Hey, you.

921
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,960
You've been odd lately.

922
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,300
Mind your own business.

923
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,030
Kyung, are you
making that ball or something?

924
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,140
Hey, it's you, Dan Oh.

925
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,640
Man, I'm here with a huge headache,

926
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,140
but good for you two.
You have time to play ball.

927
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,080
Darn you.

928
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,200
- My gosh.
- You little...

929
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,300
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

930
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,530
You two would never know.

931
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:00,710
That is...

932
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,820
Finally.

933
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,060
I found him.

934
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,970
This time, I won't...

935
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,900
let him go.

936
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:06,510
Hey.

937
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,260
(Extra-ordinary You)

938
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,890
I can't believe
a guy who's as hot as him...

939
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:28,890
is just an extra.

940
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,390
Hi, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

941
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,130
Next time, please remember me.

942
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,400
I have a heart condition.
I had a crush for 10 years.

943
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,430
That's my character.

944
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,500
If we change the given story,

945
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,370
you and I will both be
more than just extras.

946
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,670
Let's do this together.

947
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,170
Do you think an extra...

948
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,000
with less of a presence
can really change your fate?

949
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,210
You didn't buy that stone?

950
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,370
If you write your wish
on a broken stone...

951
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,340
and build up a tower with it,
it'll come true.

952
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,440
Kyung is a lucky guy.

953
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,780
There's no one who is
as faithful as Dan Oh.

954
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,720
Nothing can ever change
in this world.

955
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,320
I thought you could
help me change this.

956
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,650
I was wrong.
