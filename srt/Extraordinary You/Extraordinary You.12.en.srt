1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,750
(Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...)

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,820
(and for remembering my wish.)

4
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,470
Did you get hurt? Let me see that.

5
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,670
Wait, did you get hurt...

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,780
as you prepared for this?

7
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,210
What is this?

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,680
It's all because of me.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,520
I'll never forget this moment.

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,630
I'll remember it for life,

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Haru.

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,200
(Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...)

13
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,780
You must know, don't you?

14
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,720
What's the end of this story?

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,180
Will Dan Oh end up with me?

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,920
Or will she end up with him?

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,090
The end of this story?

18
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,860
I'm obviously
the main character in this story,

19
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,229
but why does this
make me feel so awful?

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,360
Don't beat around the bush again
and tell me frankly.

21
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,200
Who is that guy, Haru?

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,570
Who is he?

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,370
You already know.

24
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,570
Someone who can bring change.

25
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,580
Oh, that darned stage?

26
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,880
I can change it too.

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
You?

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,750
- How?
- No matter what it takes.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
You're going to change the stage?

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
I lost...

31
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,490
everything that's precious to me
because of that.

32
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,560
As I said, talk in a language
I can understand.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All because of you, I...

34
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,170
All because of you.

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,150
Go away.

36
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,280
I have nothing to say.

37
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,500
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

38
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,050
(I will not marry him.)

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,550
"I will not marry him."

40
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,190
Calling off the engagement?

41
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,120
Dan Oh?

42
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,320
- I mean it.
- Hey.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,990
Hey, Kyung.

44
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,890
- Where are you going?
- Dan Oh.

45
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,430
You'll call off our engagement.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,370
What do you suddenly mean?

47
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,230
You'll break off our marriage.

48
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,300
You'll tell Chairman Eun yourself.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,310
That you won't marry me
because you hate me now.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,910
The writer may not have
the best plot,

51
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,540
but I'm going to say I hate you?

52
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,780
In front of my dad?

53
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,280
If things go as I say,

54
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,820
don't ever be with that jerk.

55
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,480
- What?
- As I said,

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,490
I'm the one
who can change your fate.

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,820
Baek Kyung, your partner
in this comic book.

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,090
I'm not a mere extra.

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,160
Haru, what are you doing tomorrow?

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,130
I mean, if you're free tomorrow...

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,170
and there's no stage, let's...

62
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,440
I mean, you know,
we went to the movies too.

63
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,810
I have tennis practice tomorrow.

64
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,780
Right, tennis practice.

65
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,079
Look at this.

66
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,050
The writer's story
and lines are filled with cliches,

67
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,260
but these little setups are
too detailed for no reason.

68
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,590
But the writer is pretty ignorant
on something like that.

69
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,090
I never see any stars in the sky.

70
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,130
I definitely don't like it.

71
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,230
But you gave me
a beautiful night sky as a present.

72
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,070
I really won't forget it.

73
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,600
Seriously. I'll never forget it.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
It's okay to forget.

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,610
I'll remember.

76
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,040
I won't forget...

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,409
the way you were excited...

78
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,980
to see the stars.

79
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,980
- Haru.
- Yes?

80
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,620
I want to hear that story.

81
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,690
That old story you once mentioned.

82
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,720
("Secret")

83
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,930
Do you remember this?

84
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,490
Yes, from the camp.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
- They're the same.
- I thought it was a dream,

86
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,840
but I had a conviction
once I saw this.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,110
That everything I saw
wasn't a dream,

88
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,610
- but what I remember.
- What you remember?

89
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,050
I gave you this as a present
in those memories.

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,990
I think that's why
I kept seeing this flower...

91
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,120
to remember you.

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,290
To wait for you...

93
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,930
until you find me.

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
What brings you here at this hour?

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,750
It's what you like, my lady.

96
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,250
These are very rare.

97
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,480
Are these from Prince Kyung?

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,290
Thank you. You may leave.

99
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,290
Wait.

100
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,430
That is odd.

101
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,300
I am talking and acting
against my will.

102
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,040
Do you want to eat these with me?

103
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,110
What I mean is...

104
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,910
They seem too much for me
to have alone.

105
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Prince Kyung.

106
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,230
I have prepared these for you.

107
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,090
Thank you.

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,500
You should go.

109
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,540
- Sorry?
- Did you not come to give these?

110
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,740
That is right but...

111
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,810
I am a busy man at the palace,

112
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,810
so please refrain
from visiting all of a sudden.

113
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,350
I understand.

114
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,909
That is fine.

115
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,540
Working for the country
must be exhausting.

116
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,610
Yes.

117
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,180
About seeing
those flowers together...

118
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,060
Prince Kyung, are you forcing
yourself to...

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,299
I do not like you anymore.

120
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,440
So you do not need
to come here anymore.

121
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,940
- Lady.
- She must be sad...

122
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,840
from waiting for you for so long.

123
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,350
Please forgive her.

124
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,110
That is not why.

125
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,050
Father, I would like...

126
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,190
to cancel our marriage.

127
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,820
She is a headache.

128
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,660
I convinced her
to withdraw canceling our marriage,

129
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,400
but I need to do something more.

130
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,770
Right. Did she not say
that she wanted to see the stars?

131
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,940
- That is right.
- Give her gifts...

132
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,640
that will mesmerize her
once and for all.

133
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,410
These are from Prince Kyung.

134
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,020
Do not leave.

135
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,260
I must be ill.

136
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,030
Do not mind me.

137
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Do you hear...

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,570
strange sounds?

139
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,800
Does your memory fail you?

140
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,910
Can you not move as you wish?

141
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,910
How do you know that?

142
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,510
("Trumpet Creeper")

143
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,420
Even though I can move freely,
once I hear that sound,

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,090
I cannot move my body as I wish...

145
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,820
and have to say things
that I do not mean.

146
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,560
And everything that is happening...

147
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,930
is drawn in that book.

148
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,660
It is as if someone is watching us.

149
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,630
We cannot move as we wish...

150
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,200
and say things that we do not mean.

151
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,640
Are you saying not everyone
is like us?

152
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,670
There are those who can remember
and those who cannot.

153
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,910
I can remember.

154
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,150
I remember your favorite song...

155
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,280
and what you wanted.

156
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,150
I also remember
what you have gazed upon.

157
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,290
So do ask me for help
if you need to.

158
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,260
You are to marry Prince Kyung...

159
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
which means you are important
to me as well.

160
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,670
It is cold tonight.

161
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,700
- What about you?
- I am...

162
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,010
okay.

163
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,620
Why are you smiling?

164
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,830
Because...

165
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,030
you are pretty.

166
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,080
My lady.

167
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,680
This is...

168
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Just like those flowers,

169
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,660
I will always wait for you.

170
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,930
I will...

171
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,800
protect you.

172
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,490
Dried Squid said...

173
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,420
that I was created
a long time ago.

174
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
When?

175
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,030
A long time ago in another world
before this comic book was made.

176
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,630
"A long time ago in another world
before this comic book was made."

177
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,570
Where is that other book?
I want to read it.

178
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,940
I've never seen it either.

179
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,170
I only remember scenes
from it bit by bit.

180
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,950
What? I can't remember a thing.

181
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,050
I feel upset.

182
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,320
How were we back then?

183
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,450
- We were...
- Don't tell me just yet.

184
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,590
Let me guess.

185
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,930
I was probably a princess,

186
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,460
and you were a prince.

187
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,880
What? Am I wrong?

188
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,570
I guess it's similar.

189
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,570
I'm so curious about how we were
in that other world.

190
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,140
Were we happy?

191
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,010
Really? I'm glad.

192
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
All of our moments
that I remember...

193
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,920
made my heart flutter.

194
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,090
Haru, I believe...

195
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,140
that we will have a happy ending
in this story as well.

196
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,200
Yes. I will see to it that we do.

197
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,540
You didn't come to practice.

198
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,380
It's so nice and quiet
since there's no one else.

199
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,450
We can talk in private as well.

200
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,190
What do you need to tell me?

201
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,990
Do I always need a reason
to see you?

202
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,060
If it wasn't for the stage,
we wouldn't be seeing each other.

203
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,790
Come on. That hurts.

204
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,300
We've known each other
for a very long time.

205
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,600
"Haru". "Tennis team".

206
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,570
"Loyal to Kyung".

207
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,840
We're friends.

208
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,140
Actually, you can't
really call us friends.

209
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,540
You seem to enjoy pretending
to be the protagonist with Dan Oh.

210
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,780
- Let her be.
- And who are you to tell me that?

211
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,420
I've known her for a very long time.

212
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,920
I see.

213
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,950
And it's much longer than you think.

214
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,330
Don't make her suffer.

215
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
Okay.

216
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm not going to.

217
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,170
By the way,

218
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,040
you say you're changing your fate.

219
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,640
Is that true,

220
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,010
or is it just going the way
the writer intends?

221
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,880
Have you given that a thought?

222
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,890
Kyung.

223
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,290
We are in the world of comics.

224
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,430
- So what?
- We have to move and speak...

225
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,790
as the writer intends.

226
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,800
If you know that,
just follow the storyboard.

227
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,300
This all started
when the writer drew the first page.

228
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,640
The writer definitely drew me,

229
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,010
but why do I feel emotions
that the writer didn't draw for me?

230
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,670
The feeling of liking someone...

231
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,680
and wanting to protect someone.

232
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,880
These feelings weren't drawn
by the writer.

233
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,420
They were all drawn by Dan Oh.

234
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,780
She's mine.

235
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,590
We were destined to be together
from the get-go.

236
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,920
Dan Oh is neither yours
nor the writer's.

237
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
She's just Dan Oh.

238
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,790
The writer drew Dan Oh...

239
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,660
as my fiancee.

240
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,700
You keep trying to change
the stage or whatnot.

241
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,670
Think about it. Was there anything
that changed as you intended?

242
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,870
In the end, we're following
the writer's story.

243
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,240
Don't talk as if you can
actually make changes here...

244
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,410
about Dan Oh
or about this world we are in.

245
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,510
Even if the story continues
to flow as the writer's storyboard,

246
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,579
I'll try my best for Dan Oh
to the end.

247
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,079
Do you want to vanish again?

248
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,180
I don't care.

249
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,250
You say that we are here
because the writer drew us.

250
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,829
For me, Dan Oh is my beginning.

251
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,160
So I'll be okay
if my role ends with Dan Oh.

252
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,829
To you, she may be a mere extra.

253
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,940
To me,

254
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,270
she's the main character.

255
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,660
Sorry, I'm late. I had
to stop by somewhere.

256
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,920
It's all right.

257
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,960
By the way,
what brings you to school?

258
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,330
Just because.

259
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,930
Did something happen?

260
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,600
We can still hang out even
when nothing happened, can't we?

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,370
I just thought about you.

262
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,010
I don't play the violin anymore.

263
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,380
I didn't ask you to come,
so you could play the violin for me.

264
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Right.

265
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,480
Here. Take this.

266
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Open it.

267
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,600
I tried to guess your size by eye.

268
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,430
Hold on.

269
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,520
They fit perfectly.

270
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,420
Wait.

271
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,460
This might be gone
when the stage is over.

272
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,070
Do you know something called
a butterfly effect?

273
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,740
Something so small can change
a huge fate.

274
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,510
Dan Oh and I tried
to change our fate.

275
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,650
Dan Oh wanted to fix
her heart problem,

276
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,920
and I wanted us to like each other.

277
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,690
Now, that can't happen.

278
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,190
I have no choice
but to root for you and Nam Ju.

279
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,430
Do Hwa.

280
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,330
I don't want you to root for me.

281
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,630
Why?

282
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,670
I'm not allowed to say
something like this?

283
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,010
"Someone I truly like".

284
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,680
(Yeo Ju Da, Call)

285
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,720
Then tell everything
to the chairman!

286
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,080
Tell him about Ju Da
and your secret!

287
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,990
There cannot be...

288
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
a single mistake in my life.

289
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,490
You're Cha Ji Hyun's son,

290
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,730
Oh Nam Ju.

291
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,200
If you don't feel comfortable
with it, just let me handle it.

292
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,970
You didn't have to come here
by yourself.

293
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,870
I'll go to the next conference
in your place.

294
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,070
No, I'll go.

295
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
You weren't interested
in the business.

296
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,340
You should just graduate
from school,

297
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,180
go abroad to study,
and spend money like water.

298
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,780
What are you doing all of a sudden?

299
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,380
Why? Is there a reason
that I shouldn't be interested?

300
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,620
Do you think
this will change anything?

301
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,250
You've gone mad over a girl.

302
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,330
It looks like your mother
seemed pretty anxious.

303
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,660
She even went
to visit the girl herself.

304
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,800
She did what?

305
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,570
Please refrain from saying things
that others may misunderstand.

306
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,440
Thanks to your foundation,
I can attend our school.

307
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,670
I don't want to cause
any misunderstandings.

308
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,410
That was why.

309
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,380
Yes, she drives me insane.

310
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,750
That's why I must be the son
of Serinne Fashion's Oh Jae Beol...

311
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,260
not to make my woman cry.

312
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,070
("Oh Hee Ju and Oh Nam Ju
Compete to Be the Heir")

313
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,970
You all know
that Nam Ju participated...

314
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,440
in the conference
that was held in Paris, right?

315
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Really?

316
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,240
My father went
to the conference too.

317
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,870
Nam Ju went there alone
on behalf of his father.

318
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,610
- What?
- That's so cool!

319
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,610
My gosh. Does it mean
he'll work at the company too?

320
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,350
I couldn't approach him
as he was too perfect.

321
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,420
Now, he's someone
from another world.

322
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,360
You should at least have some sense
if you're slow-witted.

323
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,090
Nam Ju is going through
a critical phase right now.

324
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,960
- I heard that he'll study abroad.
- What?

325
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,730
Study abroad? Who told you that?

326
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,170
I found out with
my crazy good intelligence skills.

327
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,170
Nam Ju's father is sick.

328
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,570
That's why they are fighting
for the seat of the heir.

329
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,640
Nam Ju's old brother feels
threatened by Nam Ju.

330
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
Rumor has it that he'll send Nam Ju
abroad for his studies.

331
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,650
You startled me.

332
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,450
Goodness, poor you.

333
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,960
Nam Ju isn't here
to protect you anymore.

334
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,430
Ju Da, we'll take care of you.

335
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,630
I think she's crying.

336
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,170
Why are you crying?
You're breaking my heart.

337
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,370
I feel bad for you.

338
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,870
You thought you were
like Cinderella, didn't you?

339
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,210
But do you know...

340
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,840
why Cinderella was able
to marry the prince?

341
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,380
Because she was pretty?
Because she was a good dancer?

342
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,120
That's not it.

343
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,180
Cinderella wasn't a peasant.
She was an aristocrat.

344
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,620
You know what I'm saying, right?

345
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,930
You...

346
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,400
- I can't believe this.
- Has she gone mad?

347
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,770
What?

348
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,610
Will you lock me up again?

349
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Hey.

350
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,910
- Has she gone mad?
- She's gone mad, right?

351
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,090
Something is definitely off.

352
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,990
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

353
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,730
Ju Da is acting a bit odd.

354
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,760
Yes. She is.

355
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
I've seen her water
the flowers a lot.

356
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,170
But I have never seen her
attack the flowers like that.

357
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,770
Right. Are you all right?

358
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,340
- What do you mean?
- My bro said your heart...

359
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,380
- Hold on.
- What?

360
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,410
Your "bro"? Stop acting cute.

361
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,850
Darn it. That's
what I call him at home.

362
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,150
I mean, my brother. Ju Hwa.

363
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,950
We have a big age gap.

364
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,250
He still calls me baby at home.

365
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,490
Darn it.

366
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,860
- What's this?
- No need to explain it.

367
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,490
You're the super cute
youngest son at home, Do Hwa.

368
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,030
Stop teasing me.

369
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,000
- Do Hwa, you're such a cutie!
- What are you doing?

370
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,330
You pinched me again.

371
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,470
Ju Hwa is worried sick,
but I'm fine.

372
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,670
I've overcome my set-up,
the heart problem.

373
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,940
And I'm enjoying
the happiest moment of...

374
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,980
Let's get the surgery, Dan Oh.

375
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,010
Surgery?

376
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,420
Surgery? Already?

377
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,820
We've done a lot of
complicated surgeries so far.

378
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,090
Every time,
we always got through it.

379
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,720
You trust me, right?

380
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,190
Let's talk with your father...

381
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,260
and pick a date.

382
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,570
Hey, Kyung.
You must have waited for long.

383
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,470
Why did you call him?

384
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,770
He didn't call me. I came on my own.

385
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,410
Dan Oh,
I'll talk to Ju Hwa a bit more.

386
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,080
You should leave with Kyung.

387
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,520
You hate coming to the hospital,
but you always come for me.

388
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,990
I...

389
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,530
will not marry him.

390
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,090
What? All of a sudden?

391
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,330
You'll call off our engagement.

392
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,930
What do you suddenly mean?

393
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,670
You'll break off our marriage.

394
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,640
You'll tell Chairman Eun yourself.

395
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,340
That you won't marry me
because you hate me now.

396
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,640
Dan Oh, what's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

397
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,210
I hate him now.

398
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,010
So you should stop coming
to the hospital now.

399
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,150
Dan Oh.

400
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,680
Dan Oh is in bad condition today.

401
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,320
That's not the reason.

402
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,660
Dad.

403
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,100
I don't want to...

404
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,730
marry Kyung.

405
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,700
She must feel sorry for you...

406
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,470
because she had been
in the hospital all the time...

407
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,370
getting hospitalized and checked up.

408
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,240
- I know.
- Yes.

409
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,780
I'm sorry
you had to come so far today.

410
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
Dan Oh.

411
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,360
How did you know?

412
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,330
How did you know...

413
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,200
I'll tell my dad that I hate you
and won't marry you?

414
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,670
Can you also see the storyboard?

415
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,440
This is more decisive.

416
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,880
I know something
that will never change.

417
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,510
I'm asking how you found out.

418
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,180
You shouldn't be asking.
Give me an answer.

419
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,580
What will you do...

420
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,720
if I already know your fate?

421
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,090
I now have something
more important than my fate.

422
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,130
Are you talking about him?

423
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,260
Yes.

424
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,760
I get it,

425
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,240
but you'll have to wait and see
if your feelings won't change.

426
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,940
Go get some sleep, then.

427
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Darn it.

428
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,600
Can't you see?

429
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,040
Ju Da, do you need some glasses?

430
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,440
Did I just see that right?

431
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,910
Yes, you definitely did.

432
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,780
You're the one who needs glasses.

433
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
What did you say?

434
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,450
I don't want to clean up anymore.

435
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,950
You're here on a scholarship.
You have to clean...

436
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,750
But you don't pay for that.

437
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,620
- Nam Ju's foundation gives...
- He didn't ask me to clean up.

438
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,360
How dare you mention him?

439
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Why do you...

440
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,500
bully me so much?

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,460
Are girls who are poorer than you...

442
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,300
not allowed to be pretty and smart?

443
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,300
Or is it because Nam Ju likes me?

444
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,140
- Hey.
- Don't be so immature.

445
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,170
Things are already tough as it is.

446
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,890
What is this?

447
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,090
Why are there so many people?

448
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,000
She definitely had the sneakers
I got for her.

449
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
- It's Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

450
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,700
- Nam Ju.
- Hey, there's Nam Ju.

451
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,000
- Come on.
- Nam Ju.

452
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,110
- Get him on camera.
- Nam Ju!

453
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,280
My goodness, Nam Ju
must be a superstar now.

454
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,350
What is this?
Why are there so many reporters?

455
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,580
They're here to cover
the famous Nam Ju,

456
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,250
like how butterflies are
drawn to flowers.

457
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,750
That's cool.

458
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,220
He does look cool.

459
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,090
The Serinne collection in Paris
received great reviews.

460
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,530
I heard there was a muse
behind this collection.

461
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,890
Can you tell us?

462
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,800
Tell us who your muse is.

463
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Yeo Ju Da.

464
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,230
- Yeo...
- Yeo Ju Da?

465
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,070
Ju Da? That Ju Da?

466
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,840
Ju Da? Who is Ju Da?

467
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
My girl.

468
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,940
- My gosh.
- "My girl"?

469
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,640
I can't change the stage
like Haru does,

470
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
and I'm not cool like Nam Ju either.

471
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,950
- What was that?
- Is she Ju Da?

472
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,480
Over there?

473
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,880
Ju Da, I'm back.

474
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,420
- What is that?
- Goodness.

475
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,860
Just take pictures for now.

476
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,660
Sae Mi, are you okay?

477
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,630
What are they doing in front of me?

478
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,130
- Just take the pictures.
- You're too heavy.

479
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,930
- Just take it.
- Sae Mi.

480
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,050
Haru worked so hard for that,

481
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,650
but it's all gone after a scene.

482
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,760
The biggest charm in sculpture is...

483
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,830
that the warmth of the creator...

484
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,130
goes right into the piece.

485
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,060
If the warmth goes in there,
then so is your heart in it.

486
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,300
Who is that ancient guy?

487
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,750
Above all,

488
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,550
you must have a good understanding
of what you're making.

489
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,890
Even if it continues
to spin the same way,

490
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,290
you can never make
the same piece of pottery.

491
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
What?

492
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,870
This one said,
"I don't want to grow bigger."

493
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,340
How do we know
what the pottery is saying?

494
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,800
It's your instinct.

495
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,040
Take a look.

496
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,410
If you just want to
make it bigger...

497
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,180
and do whatever you want with it...

498
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,950
- Goodness.
- Oh, gosh.

499
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,320
It'll ruin the pottery...

500
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,950
and the potter will be hurt too.

501
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,150
Now, get in teams of two.

502
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,120
- Yes.
- Who wants to do it with me?

503
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,760
- Who's with me?
- Let's do it together.

504
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,730
- Who's with me?
- Move, I'm going with her.

505
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,330
- I want to do it with her too.
- Who's with me?

506
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,100
Man, it's you again?

507
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,600
Who wants to do it with me?

508
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,600
Who wants to do it with me?

509
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Let's do it together.

510
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Sure.

511
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,410
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

512
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Nam Ju.

513
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,280
You're such an artist,

514
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,080
so do you want to come up
and do it here?

515
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,920
No, I want to do it with Ju Da.

516
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,220
Come on, Nam Ju.

517
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,160
I understand that
you want to work with your friend,

518
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,460
but I want to show other kids
the masterpiece you create.

519
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,660
What do you think, everyone?

520
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,030
- Yes!
- Sounds great!

521
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,600
- No, I...
- Nam Ju.

522
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,330
I'll work with Ban Jang.

523
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,700
- Ban Jang?
- Me?

524
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
All right.

525
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,350
Okay, Nam Ju's partner will be...

526
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,150
(Pottery Class)

527
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,760
Kyung, will you make it with me?

528
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,100
- Go.
- What?

529
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,600
You're a nuisance, so go.

530
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,170
Okay, fine.

531
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,640
This is really sad.

532
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,150
You worked on it so hard,
but it disappeared in a second.

533
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,350
But you still have
the wounds on your hand.

534
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
This isn't fair.

535
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,850
Are you that sad about it?

536
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
It won't disappear.

537
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,030
The times we spend together
will continue on...

538
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,030
even after the scene changes.

539
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,270
That again! You're saying...

540
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,710
such romantic things
like it's nothing.

541
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Haru.

542
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,410
Do you want to be partners?

543
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,420
Things were going so well.

544
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,450
No, I'm partners with Dan Oh.

545
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,450
What?

546
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,920
I want to be Dan Oh's partner.

547
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,400
Hey, the sides won't be too smooth
if you keep doing that.

548
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,660
Whatever.

549
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,830
Hey, Su Chul.

550
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,300
You're actually good at something.

551
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,400
Of course, I'll make it look pretty.

552
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,409
It's yours.

553
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,550
My gosh. Let me do it.

554
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,050
What's wrong?

555
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,949
I'll do it.

556
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,159
- Is that me?
- No.

557
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,270
- Roll it. Come on.
- What?

558
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,110
Is this Flirting 101 or what?

559
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,260
Knead it like this.

560
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,660
Done.

561
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,170
Please don't beat so fast.
Don't beep.

562
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,550
After we're done with this,
should we write our names on it?

563
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,800
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

564
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,800
Oh, no.

565
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,300
Are you okay?

566
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Yes.

567
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,340
Relax. Oh, dear.

568
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,270
This won't do. Sit on this chair
and rest.

569
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,280
No, I'm really fine.

570
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,710
My heart rate monitor is broken.

571
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,850
- That's why.
- Kyung, you don't have a partner.

572
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,030
What are you two doing? Hurry up.

573
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,540
Forget it. I'll turn it.

574
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,870
No. I'll do it.

575
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,680
Gosh. Seriously.

576
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,130
I've always wondered
why this thing bothered you.

577
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,040
Now, I know why.

578
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,570
You should think carefully
about it...

579
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,270
before something happens.

580
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Yes. I'm at the school
because of her surgery date.

581
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,190
Hey, Dad.

582
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,390
Let me call you back.

583
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,120
What is it this time?

584
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,530
Why are you here?

585
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,030
I came to keep an eye on you.

586
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,730
Come on, I'm not a kid.

587
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,630
Of course.
To me, you're still a baby.

588
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,570
Don't say that.

589
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,670
Chairman Eun.

590
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,870
Oh, hey, Kyung.

591
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,070
You must've come
because you were worried about her.

592
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,940
I'm always by her side at school,
so don't worry.

593
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,620
Have you two reconciled?

594
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,250
Well...

595
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,280
I'm going to make sure...

596
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,520
she never cancels
our engagement again.

597
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,290
Don't be sorry about being sick.

598
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,530
How many times do I need
to call off this engagement?

599
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,700
I bet the readers hate my character.

600
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,040
She's all that I have.

601
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,810
I'm so grateful
that you're by her side.

602
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,050
Don't worry. I'll protect her.

603
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,670
I had a great time today.

604
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,140
I should have
given this to you sooner.

605
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,050
Do understand.

606
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,320
This scented sachet was...

607
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,790
given to me by my late mother.
It is very precious to me.

608
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,420
That is why...

609
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,020
I wanted to give this to you.

610
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,760
No one asked me to do this.

611
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,300
It is coming from my heart.

612
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,900
Do you really?

613
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,140
I am happy that you are my lover.

614
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,650
To me, you are...

615
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,150
my beginning.

616
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,800
My heart belongs to someone else,

617
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
so why can I not control
what I say or do?

618
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,310
Is it truly my fate
to get married to Prince Kyung?

619
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,140
Haru!

620
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,410
How long have you been out here?

621
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,650
Why would you risk doing
such a dangerous thing?

622
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,300
I feel like
the stars will fall soon.

623
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,370
Yes, my lady.

624
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,910
Since I will not be able to see
such things from inside the palace,

625
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,940
I must enjoy them while I still can.

626
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Do you want to know
a secret of mine?

627
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
I do not want...

628
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,560
to marry Prince Kyung.

629
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,040
Why do you not ask me why
if you are his loyal follower?

630
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,040
I refuse to listen.

631
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,570
You know very well...

632
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,110
that we cannot stop ourselves...

633
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,650
from having these feelings.

634
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,680
I will not...

635
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,050
listen to you.

636
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,300
The past perfect is when you talk...

637
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,370
about something in the past
that happened...

638
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,040
much before.

639
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,640
It means it has already happened
and ended in the past.

640
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,740
Here's an example.

641
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,010
"When I arrived there,"

642
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,550
"the tragic stage had
already finished."

643
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,510
"When I arrived there,"

644
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,920
"the tragic stage had
already finished."

645
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,990
Kyung.

646
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,930
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

647
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,000
Answer me.

648
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,340
I'm honored that you're taking
an interest in me.

649
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,290
Seeing how the same thing
keeps repeating itself,

650
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,150
you and I have
a tenacious, ill-fated relationship.

651
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,670
(If there is no answer
to my beginning,)

652
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,300
(then I will create my own answer.)

653
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,270
Who hit me?

654
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,440
- Not me.
- Me neither.

655
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,940
Come on, it's you.

656
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,080
Do you have proof?

657
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,150
- Tell me the exact time.
- If it's not you, then who?

658
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,750
- It's not me.
- 1, 2, 3!

659
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,620
Hi. Those little...

660
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,990
Gosh.

661
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,290
This is all because
the writer has become strange.

662
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,300
"I'll protect her."

663
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,400
My gosh. Do you know that
you're talking like Nam Ju now?

664
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,170
What is that?

665
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,840
(Seuli High School's
32nd Video Fair)

666
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,550
Here.

667
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,420
I will declare it
on the honor of A3.

668
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,190
I wanted to give this to you.

669
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,990
No one asked me to do this.

670
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,660
It is coming from my heart.

671
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,660
Hold on.
Isn't this from the storyboard?

672
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,030
Come on!

673
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,170
Why is the writer dying
to marry us off?

674
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,870
Aren't we in high school?

675
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,740
What did you see?

676
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,810
I think we might get married.

677
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,380
So what?

678
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,180
You were the one
who begged to marry you.

679
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,580
Right. And that's why you always
yelled and got mad at me.

680
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,050
You have to pretend
to like a girl...

681
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,350
that you hate for the sake
of your family business.

682
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,990
I feel bad for Dan Oh...

683
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,820
who had been hurt
for the past 10 years.

684
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,960
She's holding onto the heart that
could stop beating any minute...

685
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,460
and onto a man...

686
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,300
who never loved her and never will.

687
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,270
That's why...

688
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,370
I'll try to change it
before my heart stops beating.

689
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,540
Change what?

690
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,040
It's enough that the writer can
boss me around with my illness.

691
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,810
Don't try so hard.

692
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,080
- What?
- No matter how hard you try,

693
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
it won't change.

694
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,090
You must stay by my side.
That's the story.

695
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,220
Just like that time and now.

696

(Seuli High School's

697
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,230
(Surprise Event: Confess Your Love,
Letter from the Teachers, and Prize)

698
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,370
- Dan Oh.
- What are you doing?

699
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,280
I think Kyung is going
to propose to me.

700
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,680
What? He'll propose?

701
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,580
Yes. The storyboard I got to see
after all this time was...

702
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,620
The writer is really
going to marry us off.

703
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,620
But I will not let that happen.

704
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,020
I told you, didn't I?

705
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,730
Even the writer can't force me
how to feel about someone.

706
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,530
The person I like isn't Kyung.
It's...

707
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,530
- It's...
- It's not him?

708
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:17,970
It's...

709
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,240
To tell you the truth,
I don't want to marry Kyung.

710
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,240
I do not want...

711
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,250
to marry Prince Kyung.

712
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:34,550
Dan Oh.

713
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,290
Do you want to change it?

714
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,890
So Haru who follows Kyung's order
on the stage...

715
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,690
is the one who brings the ring?

716
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,830
So that's where the stage
will begin, right?

717
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,830
Yes. I'm sure of it.

718
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,860
A video of us
will play on the screen.

719
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,430
And he'll confess his feelings
with the ring...

720
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,770
in front of the whole school.

721
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,440
Kyung will do that? Not Nam Ju?

722
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,640
No one can tell
what the writer wants.

723
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,010
My gosh, I must change the stage
for the sake of Kyung too.

724
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,940
Do you think anyone would
buy this writer's books?

725
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,910
I know, right?

726
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,080
Wait. What was the line?

727
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,080
"Attention, everyone."

728
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
"I will declare it
on the honor of A3."

729
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,180
I don't think you are A3.
Shouldn't you be called D3?

730
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,120
Declare Three. The trio
who loves to make declarations.

731
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,290
The writer has gone insane.

732
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,190
This is lamer than the violin.

733
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,230
I always return the favor.

734
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,960
Since you changed
my stage that time,

735
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,600
I'll help you change your stage
the best I can.

736
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
We're all in this.

737
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,030
We can do this. Join us, Haru.

738
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,840
Okay, okay. Let's do this.

739
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,940
- 1, 2, 3. We can do this.
- We can do this.

740
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,620
Give it back.

741
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,290
Kyung. Did you read the whole book?

742
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,960
Did you?

743
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,010
I hope you meant what you said.

744
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,940
Dan Oh might be part of our family.

745
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,510
Can't we just live like this?

746
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,340
Please don't change anything.

747
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,780
I wonder what you meant
by "anything" here.

748
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,590
Whether you were in the story...

749
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,930
or you read it.

750
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,500
I don't care which one it is.
You're aware of yourself too.

751
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,040
This repeating story
from the previous work...

752
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,240
and this ridiculous set-up
are enough to drive me insane.

753
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,340
This makes no sense.

754
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,470
You're aware of yourself?

755
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,510
How much of this world
must I accept?

756
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,680
It must've been fun for you.

757
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,550
The father who tries to sell off
his son for money.

758
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,320
A happy family
as long as I'm not in it.

759
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,850
I never thought about that.

760
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,790
If the story goes as planned,

761
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,830
I know for sure that
you'll be happy in this story.

762
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,830
"Happy"?

763
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,030
It's funny to hear that from you.

764
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,070
The writer drew your character
to torture me.

765
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,540
You told me not to change anything.

766
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:11,740
I won't change anything.

767
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,110
I'll make sure no one does.

768
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,010
So pretend you don't know anything.

769
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,780

- Yes.

Kyung, I'm trying
so hard to save you.

779

I know you. If you declare that
in front of the whole school...

780

on the honor of A3...

- Kyung. Here.
- Yes.

- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

Your advice.

786
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,300
It helped a lot.

787
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,700
You told me that if you were Dan Oh,

788

you'd always want to be with me.

did their part, right?

of Seuli High School.

- Your Love!

ended up getting married!

Let's check it...

- with the video!

- Yes, they are. They look familiar.

- It's him.
- Who is it?

- No.
- Isn't that me?

- It's me.
- Nam Ju is handsome.

- No way.

00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,800
- I can't believe this.
- I have a good feeling about this.

815
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,030
Kyung and Dan Oh will get married.

816
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,030
Kyung must have prepared
this for you.

817
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,610
- You look great!
- Let's give it up for him!

818
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,710
- You look so handsome!
- Husband Baek!

819
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,410
I will declare it
on the honor of A3.

820
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,950
The writer has gone mad indeed.

821
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,950
Why is my body moving
against my will?

822
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,560
Oh, no. No. This isn't it.

823
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,260
What's that? Isn't that a ring?

824
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
It's my late mother's.

825
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Dan Oh.

826
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,640
I wanted to give this to you.

827
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,270
No one asked me to do this.

828
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,210
It is coming from my heart.

829
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,450
Kyung.

830
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,750
What's wrong? Why hasn't
the stage changed yet?

831
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,050
Did something go wrong?

832
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,290
Will you accept this ring?

833
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,190
This scented sachet was...

834
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,530
given to me by my late mother.
It is very precious to me.

835
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,030
I wanted to give this to you.

836
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,830
No one asked me to do this.

837
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,700
It is coming from my heart.

838
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:25,460
- Accept the ring!
- Accept the ring!

839
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,560
This time, I'll make sure I...

840
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,350
Did it work? Has it changed?

841
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,220
What? It's the same.

842
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,820
Welcome to the 32nd Video Fair
of Seuli High School.

843
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,360
It's a segment within a segment.

844
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,330
- Confess...
- Your Love!

845
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:04,500
This is the highlight of Video
Fair that always gives birth...

846
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,700
to a new official couple
of the school.

847
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,840
Actually, most of the couples
who were matched...

848
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,810
through the Video Fair
ended up getting married!

849
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,980
This is exactly the same as before.

850
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,480
Let's check it with the video!

851
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:22,150
(Dear beautiful Il Jin...)

852
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,750
- What?
- What is this?

853
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,220
Isn't that Il Jin?

854
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,260
- Isn't that Il Jin?
- Yes, it's Il Jin.

855
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,490
- My gosh.
- I can't believe this.

856
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,930
I have a good feeling about this.
They will get married.

857
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,730
- What is this?
- She looks great.

858
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,130
- This is huge.
- What a great couple.

859
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,930
- That's amazing.
- My gosh.

860
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,870
I will declare it
on the honor of Y3.

861
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,040
Y3?

862
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,540
Yang Il, Yang Yi, and Yang Sam. Y3.

863
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,310
Did it change?

864
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,520
Il Jin.

865
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,520
Wait, is that a ring?

866
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,020
I wanted to give this to you.

867
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,790
No one asked me to do this.
It is coming from my heart.

868
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,430
Yang Il.

869
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,560
- That's amazing.
- Goodness.

870
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,600
What is it?

871
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:22,880
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

872
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:33,760
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

873
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,320
- Kiss!
- Dan Oh!

874
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:36,930
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

875
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:38,960
What's wrong?

876
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,430
Why did I end up here?

877
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,440
I don't have to wonder.
It's just an absurd story...

878
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,070
that a terminally ill extra
has to go through.

879
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,610
What happened?

880
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,580
I'm really curious.
Can this end already?

881
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,780
Gosh, it's over.

882
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,780
Man, my body aches.

883
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,690
My goodness.

884
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,790
What? Since when were you here?

885
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,960
You're up.

886
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,760
I knew it.

887
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,130
I stopped your weird proposal,

888
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,500
but I can't stop my illness,

889
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,370
because we ended up
in the nurse's office once again.

890
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,540
Anyway, I'm leaving
because the stage is over.

891
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,710
Where are you going?

892
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,340
To see Haru?

893
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,680
Did you want to change...

894
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:33,750
our story that desperately?

895
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,220
I didn't want to change it.

896
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,020
I didn't want to change it.
I didn't.

897
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,530
Dan Oh.
I'm your beginning, am I not?

898
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,060
I always liked Haru from the start.

899
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,070
He's my beginning.

900
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,530
No.

901
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,600
You already know that...

902
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,270
we can never be apart.

903
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,540
Never.

904
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:18,460
(Characters)

905
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,350
It was easier
because he was an extra.

906
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,780
He can enter the stage
without the writer knowing.

907
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,590
Nothing goes back to the way it was
only because the stage begins.

908
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,760
What happens in the shadow...

909
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,030
Make sure you play this. Okay?

910
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,060
impacted the stage.

911
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,040
One last thing is...

912
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,770
a stand-in who will carry out...

913
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,010
the stage.

914
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:17,620
(Characters)

915
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,020
Dan Oh.

916
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,100
That past story I remember.

917
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,600
Yes, the story where I'm
the princess and you're the prince?

918
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,140
I feel anxious.

919
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,270
About what?

920
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,950
Haru.

921
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:48,050
I don't care
what happened in the past.

922
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,790
That story is already over.

923
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:52,090
Who cares what happened
in the previous work?

924
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,790
We're here changing our fate
which the writer already decided.

925
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,700
I'm sure of this.
I knew it ever since I met you.

926
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,030
That you'll be able
to change my fate.

927
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,010
Dan Oh...

928
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,290
I'm going to die?

929
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,360
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

930
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,560
One second.

931
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,200
I want to stay like this
for a second.

932
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,760
(Extra-ordinary You)

933
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,790
I don't have to be depressed
all the time...

934
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,760
just because I don't know
when my heart will stop.

935
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,230
I'm scared that I'll lose you.

936
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,060
I'm sorry for what happened
after changing the stage so much.

937
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,500
Dan Oh has to get an operation
because you changed it.

938
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,500
An operation?

939
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,100
You know that this world is...

940
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,070
moving according to the story
of that book, don't you?

941
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,240
It's repeating itself.

942
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,180
Dan Oh is someone
you can never protect.

943
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,780
This is the only thing I know.

944
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,910
If you die,

945
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,180
I'll be hurt beyond repair.

946
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,250
Let's get the operation.

947
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,550
You might die
if you get the operation.

948
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,050
I can feel that
I don't have much time left.

949
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,960
I have to change the stage.
