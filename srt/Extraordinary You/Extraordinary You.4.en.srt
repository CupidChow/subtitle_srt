1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,220
(I want to live.)

3
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,570
Eun Dan Oh.

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,440
("Secret")

5
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,680
It's split exactly in half.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,850
I think you're my destiny.

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,920
Move if you're done.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,580
Let me see
if Kyung is my destiny too.

9
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,220
Please split it.

10
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,290
You split it.

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,770
I don't even know
when and where I'll die.

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,470
Will I spend all the time
I have left getting hurt by Kyung?

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,340
What's with her?

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
She's trying to look miserable.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,110
To win Kyung's attention.

16
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,710
Dan Oh, while you're at it,

17
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,350
why don't you make
your heart rate monitor go off too?

18
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,980
Beep, beep, beep...

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,080
"Kyung!"

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,580
"Dan Oh, are you okay?"

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,820
Let me make this clear.

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,490
I'm not crying because of that jerk.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm just sad...

24
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,330
that having hopes
doesn't change anything.

25
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,740
Why didn't you stay in the hospital
if you have heart problems?

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,630
Dan Oh, have you gone crazy?

27
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,700
You're the one who's crazy.

28
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,150
("Secret")

29
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,840
Are you going to break
the Relationship Stone?

30
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,570
Why are you all dolled up?
Kyung will love it.

31
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,740
Relationship Stone? Kyung?

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,680
Don't you dare mention his name
in front of me ever again.

33
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,320
This is exactly why
I don't like you.

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Dan Oh!

35
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,970
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,210
"This is exactly why
I don't like you"?

37
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,350
He sure knows what to say
to a patient.

38
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,950
How electric. Applaud.

39
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,920
I hate the writer.

40
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,590
And I hate Kyung even more
for hurting me.

41
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,030
- Is someone talking about me?
- I'm sure many are.

42
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,260
How many Relationship Stones
have you broken?

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,830
- Many.
- Do you even know...

44
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,870
what the meaning behind them is?

45
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
Do you actually believe that?

46
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,040
- Get ready to go out.
- I'm going to skip...

47
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,140
the evening schedule.

48
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,610
- Why?
- Thanks to the Relationship Stones,

49
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,079
I've been running away all day
from the girls, and I'm knackered.

50
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,350
The couple night trekking
sounds fun, though.

51
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,420
"Couple night trekking"?

52
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,460
What's that on your back?

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,530
- What is that?
- It's a girl's hand.

54
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,300
You deserve many of those
on a daily basis.

55
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,370
I think I know whose hand it is.

56
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,940
There's this girl who's crazy
about guys' backs.

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,110
What's gotten into you?

58
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,810
Are you trying to memorize
the entire route?

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Yes, I am.

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,710
Why?

61
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,050
I'm planning to get lost.

62
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,120
Dan Oh, do you know
why our camp is also called...

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
a love camp?

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
"A love camp"?

65
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,260
I'm not interested.

66
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,000
It's because couples are made
during the night trekking.

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,770
You should pretend not to know
the routes, not memorize them.

68
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,670
(Trail, Maebong)

69
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,240
You just need to follow
Kyung's lead.

70
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,040
The darker the routes,
the brighter your love becomes.

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,950
"Nam Ju, I'm scared."

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,070
(Off Limits)

73
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,420
- What's your number?
- What's your number?

74
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,990
- What?
- She's with me.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,590
- What's your number?
- 13.

76
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,420
- I'm number 3.
- I'm number 4.

77
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,930
This is unbelievable.

78
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,700
Why did you mix it
with other classes?

79
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,670
What can I do when everyone wants
to become partners with Nam Ju?

80
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,570
If you're meant to be,

81
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,040
you'll be partnered up with him
no matter what.

82
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,110
Exactly.

83
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,440
I actually like that
I'll be partners...

84
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,910
with a girl from another class.

85
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,380
Shut it! I'm going to pick him.

86
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,650
My goodness.

87
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,720
It's not him!

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,990
You look ugly right now.

89
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,159
Let me take a photo. 1, 2, 3.

90
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,659
That hurt.

91
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,130
You look perfectly ugly.

92
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,630
Come on.

93
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,159
- Shall we open at the same time?
- Okay.

94
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,270
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

95
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,640
- What is your number?
- Hey...

96
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,080
When did you come?

97
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,910
- I love it.
- I can't believe it.

98
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,580
- I thought you were exhausted.
- I am.

99
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,580
But...

100
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,090
There's a reason why
I want to do this.

101
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,390
It's not likely to be partners
with the person you want.

102
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,930
It's only possible...

103
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,030
Let's go.

104
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,170
I can't believe this.

105
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,000
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

106
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,270
Because the writer planned it out.

107
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,370
I'm so upset.

108
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,110
I'm in a pickle, but you're also
in trouble.

109
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,580
If it's your fate as an extra
to connect them together,

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,720
then I should get it over
with as well.

111
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,560
- He's probably number 27.
- No, he's number 3.

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,420
- No, he's probably number 27!
- Stop pushing me!

113
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,290
Kyung, I got number three.
What about you?

114
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,030
- Are you...
- Kyung, what's your number?

115
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,270
I'd love it if you were number 27.

116
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,970
It's neither one.

117
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,970
Excuse me.

118
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,340
- What?
- What are you doing?

119
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,470
Get up. Let's go.

120
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,210
- Go where?
- Where?

121
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,980
I bet you're number 10.

122
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,050
I know doing this won't end
this scene any quicker.

123
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,480
But I'm in a hurry, you see.

124
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,420
Ta-da. See?

125
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,320
Let me take him.

126
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,320
- Get up.
- Where are we going?

127
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,590
- Don't go!
- Don't leave!

128
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,230
Let's go! Let's go!

129
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,870
- We can do it!
- Go!

130
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,880
Have you been here before?

131
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,850
Of course not.
This is my first time.

132
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,320
Then how do you know
the way so well?

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,520
I know, right? Thanks to someone,

134
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,160
I skipped dinner
to memorize the routes.

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,490
Because of whom?

136
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,560
Gosh.

137
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,140
Can we slow down a bit?

138
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,820
This is exactly why
I don't like you.

139
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,190
This is exactly why...

140
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't like you.

141
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,300
What a jerk.

142
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,010
Darn you.

143
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,550
I can't always act
like a love bridge.

144
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,430
It was around here.

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,710
You have a special talent.

146
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,710
You keep hugging me
every time you trip.

147
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,580
That's not true.

148
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
I should take responsibility
for this.

149
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
What?

150
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,160
What I mean is,
make sure you follow me.

151
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,700
<i>Which way do I go
to go back to our accommodation?</i>

152
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,070
I don't remember. Where is it?

153
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
My gosh.

154
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,410
What? I think I've seen
this tree before.

155
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,410
You flip the pages so often,

156
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,180
so why aren't you doing it
this time?

157
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,320
What? Is it dead?

158
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,050
Hold on. Where's my phone?

159
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,660
My phone...

160
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,730
is gone.

161
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,140
Can we slow down a bit?

162
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,810
(Eun Dan Oh)

163
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,720
- The number you have called...
- Darn it.

164
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,690
You're back.

165
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,820
What are you doing here?

166
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,190
It's your gift.

167
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,160
Control your temper in front of her.
She has a weak heart, you know?

168
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,670
Do you expect me
to carry something like this?

169
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,040
I'm in no place
to give others advice.

170
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
I can't believe this.

171
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,710
Please...

172
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,720
<i>Until that day
when Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>

173
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,390
<i>And the East Sea runs dry</i>

174
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,290
I'm not scared. I'm not.

175
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,090
I'm not scared. So what?

176
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,660
I'm scared. No, I'm not scared.

177
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,600
Dan Oh, get a grip.
Get a grip. Focus.

178
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,170
You're one awful writer.

179
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,910
No, no. Dear writer,
I'm begging you like this.

180
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm really scared.

181
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,310
I want to go home now.

182
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,180
I'm so scared.

183
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,650
What?

184
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,890
What is it?

185
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,160
Who's there?

186
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,430
Don't come. Don't come near me.

187
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,660
I really don't have any money.

188
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,130
Please spare me just this once.
Don't kill me.

189
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,150
Number 13?

190
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,060
I'm scared. Wait for me.

191
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,370
<i>I've got peace like a river</i>

192
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh, goodness. I'm scared.

193
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,710
Hey, you know what?

194
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,710
Well,

195
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,480
I'm sorry,

196
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,350
but can you turn that on?

197
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,990
I see.

198
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm so scared. Please.

199
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,830
Hey. You scared me.

200
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,640
Sorry.

201
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,280
You...

202
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,810
You could speak?

203
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,550
- Yes.
- My gosh.

204
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,750
It was so frustrating
to talk to you.

205
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,190
Since when? How?

206
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,690
No, how did that happen?

207
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,590
If you could talk,
why didn't you answer me?

208
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,470
What's happening?
Hey, wait for me. I'm scared.

209
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,870
This.

210
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,680
- This is fake.
- What if it's a real ghost?

211
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,750
Because we're real.

212
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,520
This is fake.

213
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,060
Stop complaining. Hurry up.

214
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm scared too.

215
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,060
This is too much.

216
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,400
Dear deity, why did you give me
the same number with Sae Mi's?

217
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,230
- Number four here meant death.
- Hey, Su Chul.

218
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,940
Hurry up. What if we lose them
because you're slow?

219
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,370
Please just lose me.

220
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,540
Nam Ju.

221
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,510
Where are you?

222
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,780
- Hey, wait up.
- Your Sae Mi is right here.

223
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,080
Hey, wait for me.

224
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,890
If he could talk, why didn't he
say anything all this time?

225
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,690
Goodness. Does he just
have a quiet personality?

226
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,060
Or is it something else?

227
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,590
Gosh, I'm cold.

228
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,470
Hey, I told you I was cold.

229
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,140
You should take off
your jacket or something for me.

230
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,010
You're not considerate at all.

231
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,110
Hey, what are you doing?

232
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,510
I was going to take this off.

233
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,250
No, I was just saying it.

234
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,320
But you shouldn't take off
your clothes in front of me.

235
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,350
You must've gone crazy.
Just put it back on.

236
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,160
Unbelievable.

237
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,030
Dan Oh, get a grip.

238
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
It's cold here.

239
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,410
I'm so cold.

240
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm sorry,

241
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,190
but if you can't change my fate,

242
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,500
no matter how handsome you are,
it will be useless.

243
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,060
Dan Oh!

244
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,970
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

245
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,970
The story has changed.

246
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,200
Dan Oh.

247
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,920
- Let's go.
- I'm certain it was Kyung...

248
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,619
who came looking for me.

249
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,060
Where are we going?

250
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,380
I think I hear some sounds.

251
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,150
Hey, where are we?

252
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,350
(Off Limits)

253
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,420
Hey, I think we came too deep
into the mountain.

254
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,320
How far are we going to go?

255
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,090
My gosh.

256
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,620
Hey, how far are we going to go?

257
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,840
This is so pretty.

258
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,380
How did you find this place?

259
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,620
Do you know what this flower is?

260
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
That flower?

261
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,630
No. But...

262
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,600
I can see that it's beautiful.

263
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,780
You don't know this place?

264
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,580
No, I don't.

265
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,810
Why?

266
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,860
Why is he looking at me like this?

267
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,500
What's he doing all of a sudden?

268
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
This was on your hair.

269
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,020
You know what?

270
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,760
I was a bit sad that I had
to follow a path that had already...

271
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,890
been decided for me.

272
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,730
But...

273
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,900
that just changed.

274
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,370
You showed me...

275
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,370
that there is another path just now.

276
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,410
I'm certain of it.

277
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,450
Thanks to you,

278
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,720
I think my day can change.

279
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Can I...

280
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,630
call you Haru?

281
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,490
We should go trekking again.

282
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,760
Why are we visiting
an ancient palace? It's so boring.

283
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,230
I wonder
what a guy and a girl did...

284
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,930
at a deserted mountain last night.

285
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,860
I bet it was a huge scoop, right?

286
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,870
I'm supposed to be with Nam Ju.

287
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,640
How could you pick that number
out of all numbers?

288
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
That hurts.

289
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Dan Oh.

290
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,410
Where have you been?

291
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,980
Why are you here?

292
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,850
I've been looking all over for you.

293
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

294
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,790
Why are you saying this
in the shadow instead of on stage?

295
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,160
It's too late.

296
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,260
How's your heart?

297
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,160
Are you okay?

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
- What's with you?
- I'm worried about you.

299
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,230
What?

300
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,570
Forget it.

301
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,610
Hey.

302
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,820
- Kyung.
- What?

303
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,850
Why are you so out of it
from the morning?

304
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,690
What did you do last night?

305
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,520
I went looking for Dan Oh...

306
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,960
Where was I?

307
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,200
- Step back!
- Even farther back?

308
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,600
My gosh. There are carp!
Come check them out first.

309
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,770
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

310
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,310
They're so cute.

311
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
- What are you doing?
- What?

312
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,310
Take a picture of me.

313
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,980
- Of you? Okay.
- Do it.

314
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,910
1, 2, 3.

315
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,280
One more.

316
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,880
- Another one?
- 1, 2, 3.

317
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,320
Well... This place is nice,

318
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,920
but it's even nicer over there.

319
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,560
Do you want to check it out with me?

320
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,960
- Over there?
- Yes. Let's go.

321
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,980
Can I call you Haru?

322
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,450
I hope he remembers me.

323
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
What are you doing?

324
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,330
You're very good at drawing.

325
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,810
Every time I see you, I should
introduce myself first, right?

326
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,510
I'm Eun Dan Oh, number 7.
I'm a junior in Class 7.

327
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,680
And your name is Haru.

328
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Haru?

329
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,620
You remember me.

330
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,990
I can change the future.

331
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,870
Doesn't this place look familiar?

332
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,340
I must have been...

333
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,740
a princess in my past life.
A princess.

334
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,520
Hey, I was joking.

335
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,220
It was just a joke.

336
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,350
Haru.

337
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,250
Too bad I'm the only one who knows.

338
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,790
Know what?

339
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,150
Your name.

340
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,290
Isn't it nice
that you have a name now?

341
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,640
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

342
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,980
Look at that.

343
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
What is it?

344
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,030
Isn't that the flower we saw
in the valley yesterday?

345
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,850
Let's try one more time.

346
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,080
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I must have strained myself.

347
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,490
- We'll be doing this all day.
- One more round.

348
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,520
- I don't want to.
- Let's do it.

349
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,160
- I don't want to!
- Come on!

350
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,710
Am I only imagining it,

351
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,780
or does Haru really remember me?

352
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,730
Haru.

353
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,900
(Dan Oh)

354
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,460
Dan Oh, you came to school today.

355
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,390
"Guys, my heart..."

356
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,500
I'll recover.
I'll recover completely.

357
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,060
Yes. To have a good time
with your love, Kyung, again,

358
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,700
you should recover quickly.

359
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,900
A good time. What did I say?

360
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,700
- A good time!
- A good time!

361
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,880
<i>- A good time
- A good time</i>

362
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,010
I have no energy
to spend on you punks.

363
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,710
From today on, I'll be working...

364
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,720
on this great project
to change my fate. So move.

365
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,380
- A project?
- A project?

366
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,920
You'll be working on a project?

367
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
What kind of project?

368
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,790
- A project to win Kyung's heart!
- A project to win Kyung's heart!

369
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,790
<i>- To win Kyung's heart

371
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,560
<i>- To win Kyung's heart

372
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,300
- Kyung.
- Kyung.

373
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,670
Kyung is here. Hi.

375
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,190
(Ahn Su Chul's Summer Camp,
4 dollars)

376
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,760
Guys, this is a rare opportunity.

377
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,360
These photos are all one of a kind.

378
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,660
Memories of Seuli High School
Summer Camp!

379
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,470
Masterpieces by Class Seven's
photographer, Ahn Su Chul.

380
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,570
The best of the best!

381
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,840
Each photo costs two dollars.

382
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,340
But photos of A3 cost
4 dollars each.

383
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,110
- I want one!
- Me too!

384
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,010
Su Chul, are there photos
of Nam Ju too?

385
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,380
- Come!
- I want this one!

386
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,110
Come take a look.

387
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,710
- Move!
- It's mine!

388
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,750
- I'll take these two.
- Okay, calm down.

389
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,550
- Hey!
- Hey!

390
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,390
Can I get a receipt?

391
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,560
No, I can't give you a receipt.

392
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,890
All right.

393
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,230
Ta-da. An Oh Nam Ju straight flush.

394
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,970
Lucky you.

395
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,070
What are friends for?

396
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,470
I got a few for you too.

397
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,710
Wait.

398
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,640
I want only this one.

399
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,810
But I'm not in it.

400
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,620
No. That's why
I'm keeping only this one.

401
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,590
Not this?

402
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,160
Hey.

403
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,100
- Dan Oh!
- What?

404
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,730
What is it now?

405
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,780
That jerk.

406
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,780
There aren't many photos left!

407
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,920
Take this opportunity!

408
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,420
This was a success.

409
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,990
What about my portrait rights?

410
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,760
Well... I need to pay for my films.

411
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,060
- Where are photos of me?
- They were sold out immediately.

412
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,430
You're so popular.

413
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,630
They were sold out? All of them?

414
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,940
Yes, they're all gone.

415
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,300
What's wrong?

416
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,280
Su Chul.

417
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,050
I'll take this.

418
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,920
- Ju Da?
- Ju Da?

419
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,980
It's all yours.

420
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,050
A3 made me so much money.
You can have it for free.

421
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,890
- What's going on?
- Nam Ju!

422
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,660
- Wait!
- Nam Ju!

423
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,860
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

424
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,640
- Gosh, it's Ju Da.
- What are you looking at?

425
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,370
Look at her eyes.

426
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,870
Let's look at these photos instead.

427
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,380
Hey, Ju Da.

428
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,790
In the mountain, you were
so aggressive. At school...

429
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,790
Hey.

430
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,390
Be careful. What if someone
gets the wrong idea?

431
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,160
Let them think what they want.

432
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,600
- Hey.
- Yes?

433
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,070
How have you been dealing with it?

434
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,340
- Deal with what?
- Everything.

435
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,380
We can't do things we want to do.

436
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,780
We can't see people we want to see.

437
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,520
We always have to follow the plans.

438
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
You're right.

439
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,120
But it can change.

440
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,990
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

441
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,560
He can't remember you.
Isn't that frustrating?

442
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,130
It frustrates me.

443
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,830
Whether I'm in the scene or not,

444
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,200
I only get to see Ju Da from behind.

445
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,600
If you try, you can see her
from the front too.

446
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,840
Wait. See?

447
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,909
I was right.

448
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,540
I'm seeing her from behind
this time too.

449
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,150
You can change it.

450
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,780
Both you and I can change it.

451
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,949
- Follow her.
- What? Right now?

452
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,820
Right now. Run!

453
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,590
Ju Da.

454
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,260
Do Hwa, where are you going?

455
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,400
I came...

456
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,270
to you.

457
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,110
They've been so lovey-dovey
ever since the camp.

458
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,239
It totally makes me cringe.

459
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,409
You have no idea.

460
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,949
- Did you have fun?
- Yes, absolutely.

461
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,350
But something strange happened too.

462
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,560
I guess I was tired
from spending time with Haru.

463
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,430
- Haru?
- Yes.

464
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,090
Being with Haru
changes the storyboard.

465
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,130
I'm sure you don't believe me.

466
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,970
So you gave him a name?

467
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,410
Do you realize
what giving a name means?

468
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,340
You're an extra in this comic book.

469
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,380
I know that. So what?

470
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,680
Extras exist
for the main characters.

471
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,150
I've been supporting those guys
all this time.

472
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,490
When extras get names
and start acting on their own...

473
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,460
Everything will go wrong.

474
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,900
Leave.

475
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,200
Everything will go wrong?

476
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,900
If something changes,
it'll only be better for me.

477
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,300
Who knows
my heart will become healthy?

478
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,910
Why would he suddenly become
so serious?

479
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,840
Everything will go wrong?

480
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,110
(Mom's Flowers)

481
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,980
Dad, I'm home.

482
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,790
You look happy today.

483
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,150
Yes, I am.

484
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,150
Dan Oh.

485
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,260
Look at this.

486
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,930
Do you remember planting these?
Mom's flowers.

487
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,100
I planted them with Mom.
How could I forget it?

488
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,130
They bloom so beautifully
every year.

489
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,170
As if your mom comes to see you.

490
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,340
You're right.
They're just as beautiful as Mom.

491
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,970
- Flowers!
- Hey.

492
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,840
Dan Oh, did you have fun?

493
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,010
Look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

494
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,320
Dan Oh, do you know
what this flower is?

495
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,450
I'm not sure.

496
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,090
- It's Mom's flower.
- Mom's flower.

497
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,220
Whose flower is this then?

498
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,590
- It's Dad's.
- It's Dan Oh's.

499
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,130
Whose flower is this then?

500
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,290
It's Kyung's.

501
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,160
- Kyung's?
- Kyung's?

502
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,870
Even if I'm in a comic book...

503
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,970
and everything is decided
by the writer,

504
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,970
my feelings are real.

505
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,680
So I'll change it by all means.

506
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,450
The way I want.

507
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,690
(What are you doing?)

508
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,300
(It's a gift.)

509
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,970
Do you expect me
to carry something like this?

510
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Well...

511
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,290
("Secret")

512
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,500
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

513
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,170
- No, I'm not.
- Let's put it down.

514
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,310
I'll carry it.

515
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,080
But it's our job.

516
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,420
No one cares about extras anyway.

517
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,390
What did he say? Extras?

518
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,660
I'm not sure. By the way,

519
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,160
who is he?

520
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,910
Shoot!

521
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,040
Over here.

522
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,810
Pass me the ball.

523
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,250
Do you like her so much?

524
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,050
No, I don't.

525
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,580
Try to keep a straight face.

526
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,690
Stop staring at her so intensely.

527
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,130
What are you doing?

528
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,470
I think I should practice some more.

529
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,440
You'll never succeed that way.

530
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,310
Nam Ju?

531
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,680
Don't use your hands.

532
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,920
Use your wrists instead.

533
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,260
- That's so cool!
- Nam Ju!

534
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,760
Can you teach me too?

535
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,330
Try it.

536
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
What?

537
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,070
Yes, go ahead.

538
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,330
I got it wrong.

539
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
It went in.

540
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,480
- What's up with her?
- She's so annoying.

541
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,880
I hate her.

542
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,190
(Screaming)

543
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,960
The writer didn't even
draw him properly.

544
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,930
Look at this. He doesn't have
any facial features.

545
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,370
("Secret")

546
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,300
You almost got hurt.

547
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,210
I can't believe this.

548
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,510
Where is it?

549
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,010
The key ring Dan Oh gave you.

550
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,220
Why are you asking me for that?

551
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
I need it.

552
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,420
I threw it out.

553
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Who are you?

554
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,530
Who are you?
Why do you keep popping up...

555
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Haru.

556
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,640
- What?
- My name...

557
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,510
is Haru.

558
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,050
Hey, wait.

559
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,430
Darn it.

560
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,410
Extras aren't allowed to have names?

561
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,140
Haru.

562
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,080
It suits him well.

563
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,240
What are you looking at?

564
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,770
You.

565
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Me?

566
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,350
You were just talking to me. Right?

567
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,780
You remember me, right?

568
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,120
You pointed at me with this pencil.

569
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,320
Just like this.

570
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,560
Like this.

571
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,030
- I pointed at you?
- Yes.

572
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,090
- Like this?
- Yes. Like that.

573
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Like this.

574
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,300
If you can't even remember it,
why are you looking at me like that?

575
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,070
I almost thought that you did.

576
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,410
Just like this.

577
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Ban Jang.

578
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,320
("Hoping for a Faint Light
Like the Moon and the Stars")

579
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,770
Come on.

580
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,980
I moved because of the sunlight.

581
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,190
I see.

582
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,320
You keep getting on my nerves.

583
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,220
Kyung.

584
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,160
Are you two having fun?

585
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,830
What's gotten into him
all of a sudden?

586
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,690
If you don't want
to end up like him,

587
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,930
don't get on my nerves.

588
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,430
There's only
so much I can put up with.

589
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,110
What's this?

590
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,610
I can't see anything.
I'm scared.

591
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,850
Could it be... Am I dead?

592
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,180
Just like that? Already?

593
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,770
Gosh, what a relief.

594
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,540
I thought...

595
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,170
something had...

596
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,210
gone wrong just like
what Dried Squid said.

597
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Right.

598
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,480
This isn't a thriller.

599
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,650
A romance story won't turn
into a sad story all of a sudden.

600
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,650
Right.

601
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,330
Dan Oh, you're awake.

602
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,610
Dr. Lee, don't look at me
with such sad eyes.

603
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,610
Dan Oh.

604
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,520
My gosh, you never change, Dr. Lee.

605
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,090
How could you be worried about me
both on stage and in the shadow?

606
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,750
Gosh, I've lived a successful life.

607
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,620
Although I was an extra,

608
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,830
someone sincerely cared about me.

609
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,030
Dan Oh, actually...

610
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,430
I know everything.

611
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,130
I don't have much time left.

612
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,470
Don't worry.

613
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,870
I will change the story
no matter what...

614
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,410
and come up with
a new expiration date for my heart.

615
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:31,630
What is this?

616
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,630
Flowers!

617
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:39,670
Let's go.

618
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,600
- Dad.
- Yes?

619
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,240
What happened to the swing
and the flowers here?

620
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:47,780
What are you talking about?

621
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,650
You'll be late for school.
Let's hurry.

622
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,150
How can all of them
disappear like this?

623
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,350
What do you mean?

624
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,750
I planted them with Mom.

625
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,190
Dan Oh.

626
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:27,950
Can I call you Haru?

627
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,030
When extras get names
and start acting on their own...

628
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,200
Everything will go wrong.

629
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,770
Everything is going wrong...

630
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,710
because of me.

631
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,280
Because of my greedy wish
to become real.

632
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,800
What should I do?

633
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,640
I told you to put on goggles.

634
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,710
No. I deserve to suffer.

635
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,750
You were right.

636
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,020
The harder I try to change things,

637
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,620
the worse everything gets.

638
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,560
I told you.

639
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,090
You told me the other day,

640
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,630
when extras get names
and start acting on their own,

641
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,330
everything will go wrong.

642
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,640
If I hadn't given him a name,
this wouldn't have happened.

643
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,870
No. If I hadn't sat next to him,

644
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,870
he wouldn't have gotten hurt.

645
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,980
These onions are burning my eyes.

646
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:38,410
I'm crying.

647
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,050
It was selfish of me
to drag someone innocent into this.

648
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,420
I'll stop talking to him altogether.

649
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,060
That'd be best for Haru...

650
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,790
No! I take that back!

651
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,830
That'd be best for Number 13.

652
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,230
My eyes are burning.

653
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,710
He should put that antiseptic
on his wound.

654
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,150
Dan Oh.

655
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,350
Yes?

656
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,820
Isn't Kyung coming to school today?

657
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,950
Isn't he here yet?

658
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,850
You're his fiancee.
How could you not know that?

659
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,690
After making that scene yesterday,
he's even skipping school?

660
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,730
This is not okay.

661
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,900
Hey, Number 13!

662
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,230
What if you get a scar
on your forehead?

663
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,100
You're bleeding.
Have you applied any antiseptic?

664
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,270
You're bleeding a lot.
It must have hurt.

665
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,030
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Haru...

666
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,900
I mean Number 13.

667
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,590
You prepared food Dan Oh likes.

668
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,660
I'm sorry.

669
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,720
Dan Oh is not an easy girl.

670
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,890
We rarely get to even see her.

671
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,800
If you think about it,

672
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,670
isn't it amazing
that Kyung won her heart?

673
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,500
Don't you agree?

674
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,170
I was looking forward
to seeing Dan Oh.

675
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,910
Why couldn't she make it?

676
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:23,780
The thing is, Dan Oh isn't
so happy right now.

677
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,750
- What happened?
- Nothing.

678
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,620
She's just a bit tired
of her one-sided love.

679
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,450
Please be nicer to her.

680
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,420
I trust you.

681
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:36,990
Answer him.

682
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,100
Sure.

683
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,200
Bye, Chairman Eun.

684
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,040
Follow me.

685
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,250
You punk. How dare you?
Didn't I tell you already?

686
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,280
Why can't you be more pleasant
to that Dan Oh girl?

687
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,820
Father.

688
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,620
Honey, please stop.

689
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,930
Ma'am, you don't have to do that.

690
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,030
Just stay out of this.

691
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,600
What? You punk.

692
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,040
You little...

693
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,580
Fine, let's settle this for good.

694
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,730
Kyung!

695
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,370
Why didn't you come yesterday?
You didn't pick up your phone.

696
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,370
What happened to your lip?

697
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,210
- Where's Dan Oh?
- Dan Oh?

698
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,010
Where is she?

699
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,500
I'm jealous.

700
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,130
You always have everything your way.

701
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,840
I'm not in the mood. Give me that.

702
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,240
Why didn't you come yesterday?

703
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:33,180
I can't believe I have to be
on stage even in this situation.

704
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,140
Just because.

705
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,310
Just because?

706
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,720
- What are you doing?
- Are you trying to provoke me?

707
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,090
Just continue to be all smitten
with me like you've always been!

708
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,890
Quit playing
this childish trick already.

709
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,040
You always get what you want.

710
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,610
Just because you're sick,
people would do anything for you.

711
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,140
They'd give you anything.

712
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,610
Don't talk about it that way.

713
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,810
Using your darn heart disease
as an excuse, you start crying...

714
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,080
and collapse all the time.

715
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,690
It's not like you're dying.

716
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,060
Let's go.

717
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,370
Dan Oh.

718
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,470
Who are you?

719
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,250
You won't remember
even if I tell you.

720
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,220
The scene will change soon.

721
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,590
(Extra-ordinary You)

722
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,920
Do you remember me?

723
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,390
All I know is
that it all started with you.

724
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:28,620
That's impressive.

725
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,830
Isn't that too harsh for an extra?

726
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,100
No one knows
when her heart will stop beating.

727
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,260
I need you to change the stage.

728
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,670
Stop Dan Oh.
That's your reason for existence.

729
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,330
I'll be at your birthday party.

730
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:42,040
Oh, my. This is
such a private and secret place.

731
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,210
What's our job?

732
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,710
To change the given story.

733
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,940
You'd better stop.

734
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,340
Will the stage really change?

735
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,040
I'm going to ask Ju Da out today.

736
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,110
I'm doomed.

737
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,850
Ju Da, I have something to tell you.

738
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,950
- What's wrong?
- Nam Ju disappeared!

739
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:55,250
I have an announcement to make.

740
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,050
As of today, our engagement is off.
