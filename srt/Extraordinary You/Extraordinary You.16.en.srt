1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,710
What was that?
Is something in there?

3
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,010
Haru, what's wrong?

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Let's go.

5
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,850
Haru, what is it?

6
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,050
Let's go back there.
I heard something weird...

7
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,050
Don't go.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,260
It's just something
that always happens in the shadow.

9
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,730
It's nothing.

10
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,490
But still...

11
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,970
I want to be with you, that's why.

12
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,800
Come on.

13
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Haru.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,550
Yes, I'm right here, Dan Oh.

15
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,950
I'm here.

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,289
Yes, you're right here.

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,060
It finally feels like
we're back in our places.

18
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,160
You and I both lost
our self-awareness once,

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,270
but we did not succumb
to the writer.

20
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,930
We ended up finding each other.

21
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,470
We created our own fate
by meeting once again.

22
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,400
What do you think?
Aren't we amazing?

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,210
Yes, so I'm very happy right now.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
No, we have a long way to go.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,310
We're going to spend our days
together when we're 19 and 20.

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,080
There will be way more things
we could do after we graduate.

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,550
My heart is perfectly fine now,
so what should we do first?

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,190
(All notes)

29
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,560
Forget these.

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,460
I'll write up new wishes here.

31
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,660
What should I write?

32
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:22,100
"Dan Oh and Haru's list".
"Write a letter to each other."

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,560
"Get matching items."

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,300
Oh, right.

35
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,829
No, this is nothing.

36
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,040
It's... Well, this is...

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,070
Did you see everything?

38
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,070
Yes.

39
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,640
"Kiss 100 times."

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,780
Yes. No. No way. Not that.

41
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,750
These are...
These weren't written by me.

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,480
It was written by... You know...

43
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,320
It's not me.

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,890
I didn't write these.

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,530
Where is he?

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,900
Right here, probably.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,580
Man, the writer.

48
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,510
The writer is way too lazy...

49
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,320
to draw the story
now that it's about to end.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,720
The writer left
only the things they need to draw...

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,290
and began to erase
the things they don't need.

52
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,020
Gosh, what should I make
for tomorrow?

53
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,160
That doesn't suit you.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,329
- What?
- You and school.

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm a member of A4
of Seuli High School, actually.

56
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,470
You're number one from the bottom.

57
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,700
Well, that's...

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,940
Then which place suits me better?

59
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,810
Well.

60
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,280
You seem kind of ancient.

61
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,550
Ancient?

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,720
- I have to go.
- Don't go.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Go.

64
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,590
You might be late for class.

65
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,890
I'm going to come back.

66
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,260
I want to come back
now that I've seen that face.

67
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,820
(Eun Dan Oh, Baek Kyung, Kim Ae Il)

68
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,600
(Haru, Kim Yang Il,
Kim Il Jin, Lee Yang Sam)

69
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,270
The writer
began to erase this world.

70
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,690
What are you up to?

71
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,830
- I'm writing a letter.
- A letter?

72
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,200
(Hey, Dan Oh. From Haru.)

73
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,070
What? This is your letter?

74
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,640
You call this a letter, Haru?

75
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,640
It's too short. It's confusing.

76
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,140
- Confusing?
- Yes.

77
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,340
You can say that
when you say goodbye too.

78
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,450
I want you to put in
a lot more effort...

79
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,780
and write something much longer.

80
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Okay?

81
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,520
You write things...

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,820
that you always wanted to say...

83
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,190
to the other person
but couldn't in a letter.

84
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,690
Write those down.

85
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,400
What are you doing? Write something.

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,900
I have too many things
I want to say to you.

87
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,630
Like what? That I'm lovely, pretty,

88
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,570
cute, and that you like me so much?

89
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Yes.

90
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,940
I know. Let's not write down
the obvious in the letters.

91
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,840
No, I want you to write it down.

92
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,010
Make it longer
and more detailed next time.

93
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,820
Haru!

94
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,830
Should I come in again?

95
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,760
I'll pretend like I didn't know,
so do your best to hide it.

96
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Okay?

97
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,340
Goodness, Haru.
I had no idea you were here.

98
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,070
But what are you hiding over there?

99
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,140
A matching item.

100
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,080
Wait, are you doing this
because of my list?

101
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,880
Oh, right.
The letter, a matching item, and...

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
"Kiss 100 times."

103
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,090
Hey, you can leave that out.

104
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,150
Do you really want me to do that?

105
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,760
No. Yes.

106
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,830
Show me the matching item.

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,260
I'll look forward to it.

108
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,450
What is this?

109
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,780
Our matching item.

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,250
- I see.
- Isn't it pretty?

111
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,520
His taste is on another level.

112
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,760
Does that mean you like it?

113
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,960
Come on, now.
How could I not like this...

114
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,700
when you're looking at me like that?

115
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,940
Why are you smiling?
Your eyes are open, aren't they?

116
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,750
Come on! Why are you laughing?

117
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,320
Don't you ever...

118
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,590
What?

119
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,090
Forget it.

120
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,760
Do it again.

121
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,010
Hey, Dan Oh.

122
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,520
Look at that necklace.

123
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,650
This isn't a birthday party
at Seuli Kindergarten.

124
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,720
If it was the real Dan Oh,
she would've been disgusted...

125
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,020
and thrown it into the trashcan.

126
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,130
Is he trying to help her remember?

127
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,670
Dan Oh! Dan Oh!

128
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,780
Do you still not remember this?

129
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,110
This. Don't you remember
this flapping?

130
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
What?

131
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,790
That gaze is from...

132
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,020
You're right. I'm the Dan Oh
you know.

133
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
Dan Oh!

134
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,430
I hate coming to school
if you're not here.

135
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,670
I'm either playing the violin...

136
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,500
or walking to some strange music,
you know?

137
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,040
Of course, I know.
It's the A3 triangle walk.

138
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,310
By the way, what are those?

139
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,380
- Our matching items.
- What?

140
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,110
Should I have not told him?

141
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,890
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

142
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,760
I'm going to be a great friend
to you both.

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,890
I'm saying this on the honor of A3.

144
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,290
Three Seuli Musketeers, cross!

145
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,400
- Cross!
- Cross!

146
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,290
I couldn't find it.

147
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,360
I wished I hadn't seen it.

148
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,060
Why are you looking at me
like that?

149
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,530
Kyung.

150
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,860
Make it quick.

151
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,430
Thanks.

152
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,000
- For what?
- For helping her regain her memory.

153
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,470
We're not that close
to thank each other.

154
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,310
Then can I ask for a favor?

155
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,010
Don't be ridiculous.

156
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,550
My fiancee likes you over me...

157
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,550
whether it be on stage
or the shadow.

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,780
She's always been that way.

159
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,650
Once she set her mind on something,
she'd see to it.

160
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,560
That's like her.

161
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,790
What do you know? You've never
seen her when she was little.

162
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,030
I know that you are unlikable...

163
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,530
whether it be on stage
or the shadow.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
I used to think that her preference
for men was weird.

165
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,040
But she's finally where she belongs.

166
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,510
Both you...

167
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,550
And you.

168
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,380
And me.

169
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,530
Ignore me.

170
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,100
I just don't want to go to class.

171
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,970
No, thanks.

172
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,510
Gosh, you're such
a terrible student.

173
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,520
This is where we met.

174
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,290
We met inside the writer's world...

175
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,890
as a fiance and a fiancee.

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,060
But now, we're here.

177
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,490
What are you doing?

178
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,280
That's the real you.

179
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,550
It's a gift.

180
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,490
(Baek Kyung)

181
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,260
This is like you.

182
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,390
You put your heart
into the most useless gifts.

183
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
(Baek Kyung)

184
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,400
Gosh, I hate you.

185
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,140
Dan Oh.

186
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm not used to saying thank you.

187
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,150
You can say that again.

188
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,050
(Baek Kyung)

189
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,390
Thanks.

190
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,390
I'll see you on the next stage.

191
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

192
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,820
What is this?

193
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
Open it.

194
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,870
How do I look?

195
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,670
I have a knack for finding
pretty things.

196
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,370
When did you get this?

197
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,170
I'm not sure.

198
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,410
You're the only thing I think of.

199
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,150
I can't remember anything else.

200
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,150
Nam Ju.

201
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,720
Nam Ju.

202
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
Do you really not remember?

203
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,060
Remember what?

204
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,400
When and where did you get this?

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,130
I don't know.

206
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,570
Before being the heir of Serinne,

207
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,530
you're a high school student.

208
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,640
You don't have a good sense
of economy, do you?

209
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,470
What?

210
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,910
Here.

211
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,480
(Allowance Entry Book)

212
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,910
- What is this?
- It's an allowance entry book.

213
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,850
"Allowance entry book"?

214
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,390
Write in this, and I'll check.

215
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,520
Okay?

216
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm going to turn you
into a great man.

217
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,760
All right. I'll try.

218
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,130
Okay. Let's go.

219
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,010
Nam Ju, go inside first.

220
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,310
Okay.

221
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,510
Stop right there.

222
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,520
Should I guess
what you were planning to do?

223
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,390
Why would you do that?

224
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,390
Since I was just with Nam Ju,

225
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,520
you can't lie and say that
he was looking for me.

226
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
You were probably going to make me
slip by pouring water on the floor.

227
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,630
Or ruin the flower I was growing.

228
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,070
Or perhaps, hide my PE uniform.

229
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,900
I have another uniform in my locker.

230
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,970
I'm sorry, but that's fake.

231
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,480
Next time, pour oil on the floor.

232
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,540
Then I can surely slip.

233
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,120
You don't improve, do you?

234
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,920
You're too obvious and boring.

235
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,850
Sae Mi.

236
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,160
If I were you,
I'd find another hobby...

237
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,990
than bullying.

238
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,400
What are you guys doing?

239
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,280
And find a guy who's nearby.

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,670
- What?
- I think...

241
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,370
it's better for you...

242
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,870
to find someone who likes you more,
not the other way around.

243
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,610
Find someone who is always
by your side...

244
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,180
and thinks the world of you.

245
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,120
Hey, what do you know about me?

246
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,390
She's so nosy.

247
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,160
What's going on? Why are you
so upset from the early morning?

248
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,530
Guys, I'm going
to turn the camera off.

249
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,660
Just stay still.

250
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,800
Are you okay?

251
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,300
Why are you crying?

252
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,650
Do Hwa.

253
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,520
Hey, Ju Da.

254
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,650
Don't pretend
like you didn't see me.

255
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,420
I'm not.

256
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,619
What?

257
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,630
They're pretty and comfortable.
I can still wear them, right?

258
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,829
I couldn't fly freely
like this butterfly.

259
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,100
But you told me...

260
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,070
that a small flutter of a butterfly
can change one's fate.

261
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,480
Although that small flutter
didn't work out for us,

262
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,980
I'm sure it would've been meaningful
for someone else, right?

263
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,280
What a shame.
Can't the three of us go out?

264
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,950
I can date you
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

265
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,590
And I can date Nam Ju
on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

266
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,120
And I can spend some time alone
on Sunday.

267
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,460
My gosh, aren't you too greedy?

268
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,060
This is what the heroine
of a romance comic book does.

269
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,700
She weighs her love interests
in a love triangle.

270
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,730
Did you not know?

271
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,240
My man must be waiting for me.

272
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,010
I picked that up from Nam Ju.

273
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,350
I'll get going.

274
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,690
Ju Da.

275
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,790
Goodbye, forever now.

276
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,270
Gosh, they should be coming
in any minute now.

277
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,270
My goodness. You startled me.

278
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,440
Hey, you should've let me know
that you were here.

279
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,270
You almost gave me a heart attack.

280
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,610
Well, I'm not doing this
to make myself feel better.

281
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,150
It's a type of ritual.

282
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,810
- Ritual?
- Yes.

283
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,280
Great. He's here.

284
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,490
- Darn it.
- Hey, come on.

285
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,020
- Where are you going? Come inside.
- Let go of me.

286
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,060
Darn it. Stop overreacting.

287
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,760
Stop.

288
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,940
Sit down when I say nicely.

289
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,270
You too.

290
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
Eat a lot.

291
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,050
What's that?

292
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,550
You guys used to like them...

293
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,820
in "Trumpet Creeper".

294
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,290
Some things ought to be forgotten.

295
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,560
But having a memory
is a cruel thing.

296
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,170
That must be why we suffered a lot.

297
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,570
Stop beating around the bush.
Get to the point.

298
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,770
We have quite the history
in the previous story.

299
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,880
Well, it wasn't unintentional.

300
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,310
Let's call this a ritual.

301
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,610
There's no reason behind it.

302
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,750
We will leave this place
once we have to.

303
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,520
Let's not get mad...

304
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,720
or hate each other
from now on.

305
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,360
Goodness, I shouldn't have meddled
in the first place.

306
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,800
Why don't we put the past behind us?

307
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,120
The writer is too cruel.

308
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,050
You guys are only 18.

309
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,450
How old are you then?

310
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,520
It's a secret.

311
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,770
Haru.

312
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,510
That's odd.

313
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,540
You called me by my name.

314
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,850
It's been hard, right?

315
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,720
Goodbye.

316
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I'll get going.

317
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,860
You always have the same look
on your face when you're alone.

318
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,360
How do I look?

319
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,700
You look sad...

320
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
and lonely.

321
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Lonely?

322
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,200
I've always been alone
from the beginning.

323
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,500
Whether I feel lonelier...

324
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,570
or less lonely,
it doesn't change anything.

325
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,480
Dan Oh told me...

326
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,950
to find the real me.

327
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,180
I know the real you.

328
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Should I tell you?

329
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,990
You probably don't remember,

330
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,250
but you were affectionate
and friendly...

331
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,590
in "Trumpet Creeper".

332
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,490
You were adorable.

333
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,930
You're just making up stuff
because I can't remember it.

334
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,530
You were always lonely.

335
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,270
That's the look you always had.

336
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,790
You can't throw out trash here.

337
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,760
This will all disappear
on the next stage anyway.

338
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,430
Fine, then.

339
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,010
I remember everything about you
in this story.

340
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm glad...

341
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,910
that the writer made me
your younger brother.

342
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,350
That's the funniest thing
you ever told me.

343
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,190
That means
that I'm always by your side.

344
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,460
I don't need you.

345
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,930
You can't be honest
just like back then and now.

346
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,440
Wait, there's something in my eye.

347
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,170
Really? Let me blow on your eye.

348
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,510
Lee Do Hwa!

349
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,610
Hey.

350
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,120
What are you doing? Hey.

351
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,190
What was that?

352
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,520
This is tasty though.

353
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,860
Are you serving stir-fried
dried squid today?

354
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,990
I have forgotten
that you are in A3 for a moment.

355
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,990
You.

356
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,560
Don't get close to Su Hyang.

357
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,170
What? Su Hyang?

358
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,100
When did you get so close?

359
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,270
I sometimes go and hang out
in the cafeteria.

360
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,510
- Why?
- To keep an eye on him?

361
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,920
What's up with your eyes, Su Hyang?

362
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,690
There are a few things
that people cannot conceal.

363
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,030
They are cough and love.

364
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,330
And your eyes just now looked...

365
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,750
You're getting punished...

366
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,280
because you changed
my brother's stage.

367
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,920
Your name got erased.

368
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,560
You're an extra
who interrupted the stage.

369
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
I know.

370
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,260
Aren't you scared?

371
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,370
I would be really scared
if I were you.

372
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,670
I am.

373
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,040
When I try to guess
how much time I have left,

374
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,770
it scares me.

375
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,710
And I'm frightened.

376
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,280
But when I think about Dan Oh,
I feel okay.

377
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,820
The time Dan Oh and I spent
will be eternal.

378
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,020
The love Dan Oh gave me...

379
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,850
will not disappear...

380
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,350
after the story ends...

381
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,760
and when I disappear.

382
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,690
You don't regret your decision?

383
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,770
Not at all.

384
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,540
I have never regretted once.

385
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,170
Since the writer created this world,

386
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,670
I always thought
we never had a choice.

387
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,010
I thought behaving as I'm drawn
was my fate.

388
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,250
But you chose your own fate.

389
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,720
That's why the story changed.

390
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,290
I'm envious of your bravery.

391
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,760
You made the scenes
in the shadow real.

392
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,250
Dan Oh probably got
her memories back...

393
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,300
because you tried to change the fate
the writer decided...

394
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,770
for us in "Trumpet Creeper"
and "Secret", right?

395
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,730
I made my decision too.

396
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,540
I'm going to stay
next to my brother...

397
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,510
until the last scene
the writer draws.

398
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,240
I hope you will be...

399
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,300
with someone you love
in the last scene.

400
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,820
I truly hope that for you.

401
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,160
(Write a letter to each other, get
matching items, kiss 100 times,)

402
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,260
(give each other unforgettable
gifts: about to be fulfilled)

403
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,540
This is my gift of time to you,
Haru.

404
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,840
Dan Oh, you're such a romanticist.

405
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,010
What's that?

406
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,420
- Nothing.
- No way.

407
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,520
That was definitely
a men's watch. Is it for...

408
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,720
It's mine. Mine.
I'm going to use it.

409
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,930
What's going on, you two?

410
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
What happened, Sae Mi?

411
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,230
What? Darn it. Why did he go alone?

412
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,370
What's going on?

413
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,040
This is Haru's locker.

414
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,720
Dan Oh, what are you doing?
Hurry up and come.

415
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,780
Okay.

416
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,950
He'll be surprised, won't he?

417
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,070
Haru!

418
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
- You're here.
- Yes.

419
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,980
Oh, it was...
It was fallen on the ground...

420
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,620
on my way here.

421
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,820
Hey, I gave this a thought.

422
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,760
You said the lines and situations
of the previous work are repeated,

423
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,100
but I don't think
everything went as the writer hoped.

424
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,100
We finally got to say the things...

425
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,670
we really wanted to say and hear...

426
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,800
in the scenes that the writer drew.

427
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,370
We remembered those lines...

428
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,410
because we wanted to say it
outside of the scenes.

429
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,610
We wanted to tell each other
how we really feel.

430
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Haru.

431
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,290
- Yes?
- Don't look at me for a second.

432
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,430
Okay.

433
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,360
Do you like me?

434
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,430
Yes.

435
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,130
I don't.

436
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,470
What?

437
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,770
I love you.

438
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,080
Thank you for giving...

439
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,850
an extra like me
the present of first love.

440
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,720
I love you, Haru.

441
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,660
Me too.

442
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
One second.

443
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,190
Haru.

444
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,450
Everyone, Nam Ju has
something to say.

445
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,890
- What?
- What is it?

446
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,630
I had a lot of fun with you all
in the same class.

447
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,600
Above all, year 2, class 7 was
more special to me...

448
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,470
because I could make
precious memories with Ju Da.

449
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,240
- What was that?
- Come on.

450
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,740
That's too much.

451
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,480
(Look...)

452
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,780
- "Look at the I..."
- "Look at the I..."

453
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,450
- "with my look?"
- "with my look?"

454
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,290
"At this time,"

455
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,590
- "love with..."
- "love with..."

456
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,290
- "someone else."
- "someone else."

457
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,630
"The letters seriously say..."

458
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,600
"that I like you so much at first."

459
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,400
Ju Da, read this.

460
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,570
"Look at the I with my look"?

461
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,410
"At this time,
love with someone else"?

462
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,380
She must be dating someone else.

463
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,850
She must only watch
the movies with him.

464
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,980
This is very serious.

465
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,650
"I love you so much."

466
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,360
What is she saying?

467
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,360
Hey, read
just the first letters vertically.

468
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,460
"Look at..."

469
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,730
- "Look at the back letters."
- "Look at the back letters."

470
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,330
- "Look at the middle letters."
- "Look at the middle letters."

471
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,970
- "I love you so much."
- "I love you so much."

472
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,770
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

473
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,480
- Man, that's good.
- It was.

474
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,750
My 18th year of life was
filled with only you, Ju Da.

475
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,380
Nam Ju.

476
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,750
From now on, my only woman is...

477
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,960
- Yeo Ju Da!
- Yeo Ju Da!

478
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,890
Gosh, that was cool.

479
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,900
My goodness.

480
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,960
Haru, this is weird.
I continue to...

481
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,090
Dan Oh.

482
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,060
We have to go.

483
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,020
Dan Oh.

484
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,090
Your scar.

485
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,390
This is too precious.

486
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,390
You got hurt trying to save me.

487
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,830
No, it can't be gone.
You have to remember.

488
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,000
Dan Oh.

489
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,500
Back then, I couldn't protect you.

490
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,400
But this time,
I'm glad your fate changed.

491
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,139
I'm sorry...

492
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,810
I can't be with you
in the last scene.

493
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Dan Oh.

494
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,130
Don't cry.

495
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,270
Today is the happiest day for me.

496
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,770
Because you were...

497
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,270
my beginning and the end.

498
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,450
Call my name.

499
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,390
Dan Oh.

500
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,060
My name.

501
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,970
Haru.

502
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,070
Haru.

503
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,240
Dan Oh.

504
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,700
Haru.

505
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,900
Haru.

506
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,270
Haru.

507
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,940
Haru...

508
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,650
Haru...

509
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,820
Haru...

510
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,390
Haru...

511
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,690
Haru...

512
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,560
(Seuli High School's
115th Graduation)

513
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,860
I'll draw on his nose.

514
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,670
If I think about the time
when I blew those balloons,

515
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,430
I become too stressed
to sleep at night.

516
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,700
I know. Thanks to this punk,
I became a long-distance runner.

517
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,210
Draw more on that side.

518
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,740
I think we look more handsome
than him.

519
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,580
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

520
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,210
Nam Ju's here!

521
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,080
- What? Where?
- Where?

522
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,080
- It wasn't me.
- Me neither.

523
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,820
Hey, is Nam Ju a joke to you?

524
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,490
No, I've never thought that way.

525
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,550
Don't be ridiculous.

526
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,090
He's the number one boss
at our school.

527
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,160
Erase that.

528
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,430
- What?
- Erase that.

529
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,730
Who are you to order us around?

530
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,030
Me?

531
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,970
I'm that boss's girlfriend.

532
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,840
She's starting to feel
like the boss.

533
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,340
My gosh.

534
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,310
I'm so irritated at Nam Ju
and Ju Da!

535
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,340
Let's erase this.

536
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,350
- Nam Ju!
- Hurry up.

537
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,720
Once we graduate,
we'll never see him again.

538
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,680
That's why you should take photos.

539
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,690
What are you doing, Wifey?

540
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,960
What are you doing?

541
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,030
Nam Ju tortured you
all throughout this year.

542
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,570
I should do this
to relieve my stress.

543
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,800
Wifey.

544
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,440
I promise you that
I'd take care of you.

545
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,670
Seriously?

546
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,540
I don't expect that much.

547
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,210
Let's just take a photo.

548
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,440
- Us two?
- Yes.

549
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,680
That's not hard. Sure.

550
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,680
Ban Jang, make sure this looks nice.

551
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,190
I'm so proud of you.

552
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,960
You studied so hard
for the past three years.

553
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,060
And now, you've finally
brought honor to our school.

554
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,700
Don't ignore me
when you become famous.

555
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,430
- Sure.
- You have...

556
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,570
the most followers.

557
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,100
But you're not following me back.

558
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,370
Being an influancer isn't
an easy job.

559
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,040
No. It's "influencer".

560
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,710
Ae Ri, you are an amazing friend.

561
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,040
You're great. Give her
a round of applause.

562
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,550
Don't do that.

563
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,580
By the way, have you registered
to get your name changed?

564
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,920
I gave it some thought.

565
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,050
"Ae Sam" is a cute name.

566
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,620
Have you seen Dan Oh?

567
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,360
- What?
- Dan Oh.

568
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,460
She was right here.

569
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,600
She went outside.

570
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,030
Hey, I told you to use a filter.

571
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,170
I did. Look.

572
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,240
Come on.

573
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,440
(Dan Oh and Haru's list)

574
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,580
(Write a letter to each other, get
matching items, kiss 100 times,)

575
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,810
(give each other
unforgettable gifts,)

576
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,180
(meet in front of the 300-year-old
tree on October 10.)

577
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,090
You were here.

578
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,560
Your father is here.

579
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,330
I'll be there.

580
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,860
Smile.

581
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,230
It's a good day.

582
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,200
Of course, it is.

583
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,210
I'll go first.

584
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,910
Okay.

585
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,460
- You're finally here.
- He's so late.

586
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,360
Now that we're all here,
shall I begin?

587
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Begin what?

588
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,210
"To A3, whom I love dearly."

589
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,970
"I remember the day
when we first met."

590
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,940
"We were in Forsythia Class
at Seuli Kindergarten."

591
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,910
"Nam Ju couldn't write yet."

592
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,920
"Kyung looked unhappy
back then as well."

593
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,920
"And then there was me,
the cutest boy in the world."

594
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,460
"From our first encounter,
I knew..."

595
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,360
"that we'd be good friends."

596
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,060
"Thanks to you, I had
a wonderful time."

597
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,170
"I will never forget you."

598
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,230
Do Hwa.

599
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,070
Why do you sound like
you're going somewhere far away?

600
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
We're graduating,
so I ought to do this.

601
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,840
Graduating isn't a big deal.

602
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,710
Even after graduation,
A3 will always be A3.

603
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,080
My boys.

604
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,820
He's right.

605
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,790
A3 shines the brightest
when we're all together.

606
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,090
Kyung, this isn't even the stage,
and you're saying such a thing?

607
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,190
"Stage"?

608
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,200
What I mean is, you always seem
like the star of the stage.

609
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,330
That's what I'm talking about.

610
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,440
- Thanks.
- When did you ever thank anyone?

611
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,940
You've all grown up!

612
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,950
I'm saying this on A3's honor.
We'll always be together.

613
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,620
Gosh.

614
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,820
You're right, Nam Ju.

615
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,930
Come here.

616
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm so happy to have you guys.

617
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,070
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

618
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,100
- Don't cry.
- Make a V.

619
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,840
- What was that?
- What?

620
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,670
- Look at that.
- Come on.

621
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,580
Who wants to take a photo?

622
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,080
I try not to let them grow on me,
but I fail every single time.

623
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,220
Why do you sound like a geezer?

624
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,780
You're standing here all alone
once again.

625
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,190
Do you want to take a photo?

626
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,190
No, thanks. I don't want to have
anything to remember.

627
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,560
So what?
This is the last page anyway.

628
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,540
I thought I'd be happy
just looking at you,

629
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,840
but I was wrong.

630
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,210
I was going to just watch you
from afar,

631
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,980
but that was hard.

632
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,710
Su Hyang.

633
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,820
It's been a long time...

634
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,120
since you've called my name.

635
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,760
Congratulations
on graduating from this world.

636
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,800
You've become more emotional.

637
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,470
I've missed you.

638
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,590
Everyone, gather here.

639
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,490
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

640
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,090
We're taking a photo!

641
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
Attention.

642
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,930
On such a wonderful day,
I ought to play the violin.

643
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,600
- That'd be great!
- Yes!

644
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,300
Don't be so cheesy.

645
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,340
Forget about the violin.
Let's take a photo instead.

646
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,980
But I'm not in your class.

647
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,210
- So what?
- Do Hwa, come here.

648
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,950
Come on.

649
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,950
See? Ju Da is the boss.

650
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,090
Ju Da?

651
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,490
Let's take good care of her.

652
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,330
Yes. Look at the camera.

653
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,860
All right. Huddle a bit more.

654
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,330
- Okay.
- Huddle.

655
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,330
Look here. I'll set the timer...

Heidegger claims...

703
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,670
that our existence
is thrown into time.

704
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,010
When something or someone exists,

705
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,580
it's thrown into the world...

706
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,810
regardless of his or her will.

707
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,150
Sir.

708
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:44,280
Then, does Heidegger think
that we, humans, exist...

709
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,990
out of coincidences?

710
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,820
That's a great question.

711
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,420
The world has been created
regardless of one's will.

712
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,090
He's claiming that depending on
the relationship you make...

713
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,530
with the world,
you can create your own meanings.

714
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,070
We go on with our lives
in this current world.

715
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,370
As we love, suffer, and die,

716
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,270
we're living in a real world
according to Heidegger.

717
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:08,470
And all of us are individuals
that make up the world...

718
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,540
and exist in the world.
That's what he's saying here.

719
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,160
(We are thrown into time.)

721
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,360

he's so handsome.

732

But why is he buying meals
all the time?

733
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,360
Because he's interested in me.
