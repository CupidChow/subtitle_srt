1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,250
Oh, hey, Kyung.

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm trying to hang out
with my fiancee.

4
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
Stop bothering us.

5
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,180
Why do you keep bothering us?

6
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,590
Kyung.

7
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
Let's go.

8
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,230
- What happened?
- What's going on?

9
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,230
Hey!

10
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,940
What's going on?

11
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,780
This way.

12
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,910
- Go over there!
- Go!

13
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,579
- Move aside.
- What is this?

14
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,590
This way.

15
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,590
Where are we going?

16
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,490
Hey, go that way.

17
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,590
Get that!

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,180
("Secret")

19
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Are you...

20
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,290
("Secret")

21
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,360
looking for this?

22
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,840
("Secret")

23
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,780
I guess you were in a hurry
to come here in that outfit.

24
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,320
You.

25
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,650
Had a lot of fun to this day?

26
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,450
- How?
- You said...

27
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,060
you had a crush on me for 10 years.

28
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
Do I have to spell it out for you?

29
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,430
I know it's just your character,

30
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,430
but it's still disappointing.

31
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,240
Who are you?

32
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
You won't remember
even if I tell you.

33
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,580
The scene will change soon.

34
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
At first, I had no idea
what he was saying.

35
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,079
From today on,

36
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
- we're no longer engaged.
- You...

37
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,350
annoyed me for 10 years,
and you suddenly call that off?

38
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,590
My gosh. I had no idea
I could say such things.

39
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,660
Oh, my!

40
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,290
By the way,

41
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,600
is your face all right?

42
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,170
I know everything's planned out
and not real, but it still hurts.

43
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,770
You said all this nonsense about
characters, set-up, how it's fake.

44
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
But ridiculous things...

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,470
started to happen.

46
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,780
(You said you're disgusted
and irritated by my disease.)

47
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
(From today on,
we're no longer engaged.)

48
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,980
I understood everything
once I read that book.

49
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,920
Do you know what's even funnier?

50
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,920
There was another person
who knew of this.

51
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,160
You do know that
she's my fiancee, don't you?

52
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,960
It was fun...

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,030
to see that extra was
trying his best.

54
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,600
Do Hwa, now.

55
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,970
You knew everything,
yet you kept doing this?

56
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,710
You're the one
who made a fool out of me first.

57
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,280
You and that extra
got a little too smart.

58
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
That's why he disappeared.

59
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,780
Don't talk about him like that.

60
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,150
You're just an extra.

61
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,480
Did you think you became...

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,520
one of the lead roles
by doing whatever you want?

63
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,960
What if you disappear too?

64
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,230
Dan Oh.

65
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,659
Don't be delusional.

66
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,530
You're just an extra too.

67
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,210
You're just a character
who might disappear at any moment...

68
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,610
because of your heart condition.

69
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,410
(Yes, you. What's your name?)

70
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,340
(Do you want to be a part of A3?)

71
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,980
Haru...

72
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,409
disappeared.

73
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,090
- Have you seen Haru?
- Who?

74
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,050
Haru! Number 13!

75
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,220
What do you mean?

76
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,960
Mo Beom is Number 13.

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,530
Dan Oh, perhaps, you're sick
in your head as well.

78
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,600
All I did was worry,
and she's ignoring me.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Let's go.

80
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,100
Dan Oh, are you sick?

81
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,900
- Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh.

82
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,670
Dan Oh, did you come here
dressed like that?

83
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,980
Sae Mi, have you seen Haru?

84
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,040
"Haru"?

85
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,540
"Hi, there. Dan Oh"?

86
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,350
Haru!

87
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,550
Hey, what's going on?

88
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,290
What should I do? Haru is...

89
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,890
He disappeared.

90
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,100
I warned him that helping you
would make him disappear.

91
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,400
And he made a choice.

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,100
He helped us even though
he knew he would disappear?

93
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,210
- Yes.
- You never told me...

94
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,610
that he'd disappear.

95
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,040
I've warned you several times.

96
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
I said changing one thing
would change everything else.

97
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,780
You should be relieved...

98
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,850
that he's the only one who's gone.

99
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,220
How could you say such a thing?

100
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,360
After what has happened,
we can't predict the future anymore.

101
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,960
How much more will you destroy
this world just for your own sake?

102
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,860
Then...

103
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,630
Are you saying he disappeared
because of me?

104
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,730
That's right.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,040
You're the one
who changed the story.

106
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Haru!

107
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,090
Haru!

108
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,920
Haru!

109
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,160
Haru! Haru!

110
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,300
Dan Oh.

111
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Stop it.

112
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,470
Then what should I do?

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,970
If I can find the storyboard,
I'd be able to find him.

114
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,470
But I can't find it.

115
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,169
What if he disappears for good?

116
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,280
All that I can do...

117
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,280
is search for him.

118
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,050
Haru!

119
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,770
I think that one's better.

120
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,910
You're right.

121
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,450
- This one?
- Yes.

122
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,060
Kyung.

123
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,660
Take it. It's for her.

124
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,430
Let's go. Jun Hyun must be waiting.

125
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,070
They should be here.

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,540
Are you waiting for someone?

127
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,780
Goodness, it's nice to meet you.

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,410
- Who are you?
- I've heard a lot about you...

129
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,050
from Chairman Eun.

130
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,780
He's President Baek of Silver Moon.

131
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,690
My name is Baek Dae Sung.

132
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,650
What a surprise.

133
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,820
I know.

134
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,690
You came all the way to the store.

135
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,660
The rumors about how detailed
you are must be true.

136
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,260
No wonder Serinne Fashion
became globally successful.

137
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm guessing you got a gift
for someone.

138
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,180
He insisted that he buy
his fiancee's gift from here.

139
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,280
You're talking about Dan Oh, right?

140
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,310
"Dan Oh"?

141
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,410
She's Chairman Eun's daughter.
I told you last time.

142
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,420
This is a lovely coincidence.

143
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,290
We should meet together
with our children once.

144
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,290
Sure, I hope to see you soon.

145
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,290
Of course.

146
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,260
I should've done that sooner.

147
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,670
Do you consider this a gift?

148
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,010
I think you're just using her.

149
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,770
Watch what you say.

150
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,680
Father, for the first time,
I'm starting to pity her.

151
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,410
I'm doing something nice for a girl
who doesn't have much time to live.

152
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,180
Are you sure you're not
stepping over the line?

153
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,450
Watch what you say.

154
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,550
Don't be rude to your father.

155
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,390
Pick it up.

156
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,530
Pick it up.

157
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,030
Kyung.

158
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,670
Kyung!

159
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,820
I warned him that helping you
would make him disappear.

160
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,760
And he made a choice.

161
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,760
Are you saying he disappeared
because of me?

162
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,270
That's right.

163
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,130
You're the one
who changed the story.

164
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,900
I've given it a lot of thought.

165
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,370
I won't rebel anymore.

166
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,010
I'll do whatever the writer
intends me to do.

167
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,750
So tell me.

168
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,520
How can I find him?

169
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,650
Everything has consequences.

170
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,030
You wanted to change
your character, didn't you?

171
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,000
The consequence...

172
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,070
was Haru.

173
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,780
You need to shoot
in this perfect posture.

174
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,180
Gosh, it's not working.

175
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,650
That's not right.

176
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,520
Focus on the tip of your foot
when you kick.

177
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,920
That way, it'll go right in.

178
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,420
I'll show you.

179
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,060
Don't you think the girls
will go crazy during Sports Day?

180
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,130
- No!
- No!

181
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,300
- "No"?
- He's so scary!

182
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,200
- There's Nam Ju.
- "Nam Ju"?

183
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,540
Over there.

184
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,170
Should we ask Do Hwa
to play soccer with us?

185
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,740
Hey, don't say that!

186
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,040
- What did you just say?
- What?

187
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,610
What?

188
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,910
Come here.

189
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
- Us?
- Us?

190
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,980
Us?

191
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,190
I'm pretty sure I kicked Do Hwa out
of A3.

192
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,150
- Right.
- But still, it's Do Hwa.

193
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,560
Hey.

194
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,060
Do Hwa is not that good anymore.
Don't you think so?

195
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,630
- Right.
- He lost to Nam Ju...

196
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,660
during the swimming competition.

197
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,000
- Right, you were so good.
- Exactly.

198
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,770
Do Hwa. I mean, Nam Ju.

199
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,370
Do Hwa is not on your level.

200
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,800
You're the best.

201
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,440
- Am I?
- Of course, you are.

202
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,540
Hey, what are you doing?

203
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,280
What is it? Is there a problem?

204
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,650
- We're not allowed to...
- Hey.

205
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,120
- What?
- "What?"

206
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,760
- Hey.
- What is it?

207
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,020
You're afraid
Nam Ju will know, right?

208
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,890
We were going to go back in anyway.
Let's go.

209
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,660
I'm hungry. Do you want
to go to the snack bar?

210
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,060
- Let's go.
- I want to go.

211
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,160
Let's go.

212
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,670
Let's go.

213
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm about to go crazy.

214
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,780
Do Hwa.

215
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,050
About what you said
at Nam Ju's birthday party...

216
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,050
Forget it.

217
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,450
How could I tell her to forget
about my sincerity?

218
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,750
- What?
- Just forget about it.

219
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,620
I think that's the best.

220
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,460
Thanks. You're a great friend.

221
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,370
I'll forever be just a friend
to you on stage.

222
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,670
I'll see you later.

223
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,770
Bye.

224
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,430
Do Hwa.

225
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,400
Didn't I tell you that
you're no longer a part of A3?

226
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,170
I wanted to play the violin...

227
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,300
just because I wanted to,
not because someone told me to.

228
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,310
I was curious about how I'd feel.

229
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,810
It consoled me.

230
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,550
Nam Ju.

231
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,420
Let me ask you one thing.

232
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Ask.

233
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,150
If you had the chance
to watch Ju Da and me...

234
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,890
spending time together like a deity,

235
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,520
what would you do?

236
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,390
I won't watch you two.

237
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,260
I will not be a coward...

238
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,530
and just watch the girl I like
spending time with another guy.

239
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,030
You are cool even outside the stage.

240
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,670
This feels awful...

241
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,800
because I feel like I'm cheating.

242
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,170
As if.

243
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,240
Did you think
you'd be a match for me?

244
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,910
Right.

245
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,510
It would've been nice
had I known that sooner.

246
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,980
Then, your birthday party
would have been cooler,

247
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,819
Ju Da would've been happy,

248
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,650
and Haru would still have been here.

249
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,160
Then, Dan Oh wouldn't
be having a hard time now.

250
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,730
Nam Ju.

251
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,599
I'm sorry.

252
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,530
Haru?

253
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,770
Aren't you going to the music class?

254
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,320
Drink it.

255
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,540
My goodness, stop acting so silly.

256
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
Dan Oh, I heard...

257
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,880
a great bakery opened up
in front of our school.

258
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Do you want to check it out?

259
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,210
Bakery? Let's go with Haru.

260
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,580
Haru likes bread too.

261
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,620
Haru?

262
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,020
"Haru"? Were you trying
to say, "Hi, there"?

263
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,520
Are you serious?
Are you from the old days?

264
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,090
You should say, "DH".

265
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,530
What does that mean?

266
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,590
Dan Oh, hi.

267
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,630
That was so lame.

268
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,100
Hi, there. Dan Oh.

269
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,730
Attention. Everyone, attention.

270
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,140
As for the song
you are going to play today,

271
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,810
the tempo may vary
depending on the player.

272
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,340
So it's important
to follow the score precisely.

273
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,540
Who wants to play this song?

274
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,350
- Number 13.
- Yes.

275
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,350
Number 13? Haru?

276
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,290
Haru is Number 13.

277
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,830
How could no one remember him?

278
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,630
How could this be possible?

279
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,040
How is this possible?

280
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

281
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Come with me.

282
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,550
Dan Oh, have you gone mad?

283
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,190
But you remember him, don't you?

284
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,430
Please.

285
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,630
Please tell me
that you remember him.

286
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,470
I do.

287
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I remember him.

288
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,640
So stop it.

289
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,280
That's enough, Dan Oh.

290
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,530
What are you doing here?

291
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,530
I'm having a hard day today.

292
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,930
Are you also sad
because of that guy, Haru?

293
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,140
That too.

294
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,270
What? What?

295
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,440
Kyung, did you...

296
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,940
When did this happen?
Does Dan Oh know this too?

297
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,510
She doesn't know?

298
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,510
When she finds out
you're aware of yourself now,

299
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,850
Dan Oh will be happy too.

300
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,790
Or not. She's too shocked
to process that Haru is gone.

301
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,090
She might not be happy about it.

302
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,790
I can't believe
you're aware of yourself now.

303
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,790
That's such comforting news, buddy.

304
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,530
I don't even know
where this story...

305
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,370
is headed.

306
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,810
Hey, Dan Oh.

307
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,110
Why do you keep stealing my seat?

308
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,510
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,950
Make yourself comfortable.

310
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,620
Hey, let's go.

311
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,410
Dan Oh.

312
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,050
Haru.

313
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,830
Are you looking for him again?

314
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,970
What's wrong? Why don't you
scream like you did earlier?

315
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,710
Go away.

316
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,510
How could you weep
over the disappearance of an extra?

317
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Hey.

318
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,620
Dan Oh, I'm talking to you.

319
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,830
Hey.

320
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,760
Get in.

321
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,300
I don't need a ride.
My driver will pick me up.

322
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,470
Just get in.

323
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,500
Please.

324
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,110
Just get in the car, please.

325
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,510
Hey.

326
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,310
Why don't you just get in the car?

327
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Are you all right?

328
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,370
You've been crying the whole day.

329
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,390
Put this on your eyes.

330
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,270
Are you that upset?

331
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,480
You barely ate your meal.
And you're crying all the time.

332
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
Yes.

333
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,550
I'm so upset that I might die.

334
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,320
I feel like this is all my fault.

335
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,990
I'll do whatever that jerk
did for you.

336
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,830
I can help you change the story.

337
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,430
Only Haru can do that.

338
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,130
You're bringing him up again.

339
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,940
Is that what he told you?

340
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,570
Did he ask you to change
this world with him?

341
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,680
You can still have a comfortable
life without doing so.

342
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,780
You have a decent house
and a nice family.

343
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,510
And you have friends who adore you.

344
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,950
I'm dying.

345
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,120
If the writer draws a scene
in which I die,

346
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,520
I'll die right away.

347
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,290
That's my set-up.

348
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,630
A female high school student
with a terminal disease...

349
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,960
that can kill her
anywhere and anytime.

350
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,100
- Hey.
- But all of my remaining time...

351
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,200
is only used for main characters
or supporting characters like you.

352
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,540
I'm your fiancee...

353
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,780
and a classmate
with Nam Ju and Ju Da.

354
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,440
But before that, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

355
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,680
You would never know
how desperate I am...

356
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,110
to spend my time for myself.

357
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,050
You would never know.

358
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,290
Goodbye.

359
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,550
Are you Yeo Ju Da?

360
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,250
What's all this?

361
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,250
Just take it.

362
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,720
Students of Seuli High School
must live with dignity.

363
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,090
A broken bicycle
and working as a part-timer?

364
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
If your grandmother is ill,

365
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm sure you need to earn
every single penny.

366
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,900
How did you know?

367
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,940
Nam Ju told me.

368
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,470
He did?

369
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,270
You're one of
our scholarship students,

370
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,580
so Nam Ju has been
concerned about you...

371
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,610
because of our company's image
and all.

372
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,320
Here, if you need anything,

373
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,550
feel free to contact me.

374
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,890
I'm very grateful,
but I'll just accept your thoughts.

375
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,460
Just take it
while I'm offering it to you.

376
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,630
There is something in life
that's more important than pride.

377
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,800
Let's go.

378
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,550
You fool.

379
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,130
Who dares to knock A3's hideout?

380
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,730
I looked everywhere for you.

381
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,940
Me? Do you have anything to say?

382
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,610
I thought I should
give this back to you.

383
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,780
What are you doing?

384
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,620
- I had fun playing Cinderella.
- Cinderella?

385
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,320
Once the clock hits midnight,
the glass slippers, the dress,

386
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,550
and the carriage all disappear.

387
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,720
It feels pretty miserable.

388
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,060
Goodbye, Nam Ju.

389
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,040
Okay, microphone test.

390
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,810
1, 2, 3.

391
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,110
Ladies and gentlemen.

392
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,780
Welcome to Sports Day
of Seuli High School!

393
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,780
(The 112th
Seuli High School Sports Day)

394
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,690
(The 112th
Seuli High School Sports Day)

395
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,730
- All right!
- Let's go!

396
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,870
(MVP, third place, winner)

397
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,800
- Keep it up!
- 1, 2, 1, 2.

398
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,780
(Medical Aid)

399
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,780
No!

400
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,950
Gosh, I'm dying of heat.

401
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,120
Why couldn't the writer
give me short sleeves?

402
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,320
Or maybe give me less work.

403
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,830
I know we're in a comic book,

404
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,030
but how come
those students never study?

405
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,230
These high school students are
living a life far from the reality.

406
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,770
What's all this?

407
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,540
What is this?

408
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,610
Don't I make
this awful T-shirt look great?

409
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,610
Dan Oh's class's T-shirt is
even worse.

410
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,540
You looked pretty depressed
yesterday. Feeling better?

411
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,950
How did you know?

412
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,050
It seems like
you know quite a lot about me.

413
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,550
I need to be like this
to keep up my energy.

414
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,220
You're right. It's like that.

415
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
No way.

416
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,030
Why?

417
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,970
What's wrong?

418
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,910
(Nam Ju and Kids)

419
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,650
Hot pink?

420
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,380
So tacky.

421
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,480
"Nam Ju and Kids"?

422
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,750
So childish.

423
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,050
Okay, 5 junior students in class 7.

424
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,360
They're getting ready to run.

425
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,660
Do you see everyone cheering?
All right, now.

426
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,560
Okay, then. It looks like
the teacher is about to get started.

427
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,470
Okay. On your mark.

428
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,900
Get set, go!

429
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,740
- Go!
- Keep running!

430
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
- Go, come on!
- Run, run.

431
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,940
Keep running!

432
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,710
Who's the winner? Isn't that Ju Da?

433
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,340
That's Ju Da!

434
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,650
Ju Da wins!

435
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Yes!

436
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,880
- Yes, Nam Ju!
- There's Nam Ju.

437
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,590
- Nam Ju!
- Yes!

438
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,850
All right!

439
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,720
Hey, okay.

440
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,660
Ju Da, I'm sorry.
It's a misunderstanding.

441
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,760
Will you hear me out?

442
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,830
What? No?

443
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,500
Hey, Ju Da.
Apologize to me immediately.

444
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,770
I never said that.

445
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,200
What are you doing here?

446
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,540
What? Well.

447
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,010
Can't you see?
I'm practicing soccer.

448
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,810
You aren't practicing soccer.
You're practicing your apology.

449
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,710
The misunderstanding will be
resolved without you trying so hard.

450
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,520
That's the life of the lead roles.

451
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,690
Wait.

452
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,950
Don't tell Ju Da.

453
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I won't.

454
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
I trust you.

455
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I envy you.

456
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,360
You two will end up
seeing a happy ending.

457
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,230
On your mark.

458
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,270
- Come on, get ready!
- Get ready!

459
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,340
- All right!
- We can do it!

460
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,640
- We can do it!
- Get ready!

461
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,340
- All right!
- It's Nam Ju!

462
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,340
Hey, Nam Ju.

463
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,950
Hey, man.

464
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,320
- My gosh, it's Nam Ju.
- It's Nam Ju.

465
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,420
Get set, go!

466
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,330
You cheated!

467
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,560
Will he be able to pass?

468
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,570
He fails!

469
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,570
Let's see what she does.

470
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,970
Go lower.

471
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,170
- What was that?
- No way.

472
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Keep it up!

473
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,020
Who was that?

474
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,950
- Gosh!
- Get him!

475
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,230
Hey, that's mine.

476
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,900
Everyone is having fun.

477
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,630
The world seems fine
even without Haru.

478
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,900
Okay, we're going to do
a three-legged race next.

479
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,570
If you wish to participate,
you can come to me and...

480
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,810
Be quiet!

481
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,780
Su Chul! Turn off your microphone.

482
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,380
It's scorching hot out here.

483
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,850
We aren't elementary school kids.
Who would want to do that?

484
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,780
I was told by our teacher.

485
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,050
I'll do it.

486
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,850
- Kyung!
- I'll do it with you.

487
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,550
You can get some rest.

488
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,560
Kyung, I'll run with you.

489
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,690
- No way.
- Stop fighting.

490
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,730
(Kyung loves Dan Oh.)

491
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,770
Gosh, can the writer be any worse?

492
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,699
Kyung, will you run
in the three-legged race?

493
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,210
Of course, they will.

494
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,639
She's his only fiancee.

495
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,840
- Gosh. "Fiancee"?
- How awesome! Husband Baek!

496
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,780
- Husband Baek!
- Husband Baek!

497
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,480
- Husband Baek!
- I don't want to.

498
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,550
Husband Baek!

499
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,150
Why did you prepare this?

500
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,850
Because I was happy.

501
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,719
About what?

502
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,489
I've never participated
in a sports day before.

503
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,190
I'm happy.

504
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,230
My time with you has become
even more special.

505
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,870
(Kyung loves Dan Oh.)

506
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,840
Dan Oh.

507
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Where are you going?

508
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,580
Our stage is over.

509
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,350
You didn't care about it
when you were with him.

510
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,590
You'll always have to be by my side.

511
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,020
Because that's what
the writer intends.

512
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,790
No. That's just who you are.

513
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,830
It's natural for you
to always like me.

514
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,860
Don't you think
we have distanced ourselves...

515
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,700
because of that mere extra?

516
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,140
Nothing has changed.

517
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,370
My true self...

518
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,610
never liked you.

519
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,550
Tie your shoelaces well.
You better not trip.

520
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,490
Dan Oh, are you sure you can run?

521
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,860
Of course. I have him.

522
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,260
The power of love is strong, indeed.

523
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,900
All right. 1, 2...

524
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,050
This is so cruel.

525
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,490
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to be here.

526
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,730
I hate everything that's going on.

527
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

528
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

529
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,630
- Hey, let's take a break.
- Let's do that.

530
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,900
1, 2.

531
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,930
(The average heart rate)

532
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,640
Again?

533
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,340
Give me a minute.

534
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,850
- What's going on?
- He's leaving.

535
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,660
Haru?

536
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,470
Haru.

537
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,190
Here you were.

538
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,790
What is this?

539
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,930
The teacher wants everyone
to practice the dodge ball.

540
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,300
Are you okay?

541
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,310
I found you.

542
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,650
I thought our shirts were tacky.

543
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,320
But I'm so relieved.

544
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
I could spot you from afar.

545
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,360
I won't let you go anymore.

546
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,860
What's wrong with you?

547
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,660
You're crumpling it.

548
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,100
What?

549
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,730
Don't touch me when you talk.

550
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,970
Let's go.

551
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,310
Dan Oh! Dan Oh!

552
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,280
What is this?

553
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,380
(Haru, Male, 18 years old)

554
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,250
(Tennis team, loyal to Kyung)

555
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,920
Isn't that guy next to Kyung...

556
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,790
Haru?

557
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,190
What's wrong?

558
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,830
Let's go.

559
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,170
(Haru, Male, 18 years old)

560
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,470
(Tennis team, loyal to Kyung)

561
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,170
This is him.

562
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,740
But why?

563
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,910
(Haru, Male, 18 years old)

564
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,070
(Tennis team, loyal to Kyung)

565
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,650
What? He's appearing
alongside Kyung.

566
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,820
It's exactly like the book.

567
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,560
Kyung.

568
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,360
You're so mean.

569
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,090
Are you ignoring me just because
I'm no longer an A3 member?

570
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

571
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Who is he?

572
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,600
He's in my tennis team.

573
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,670
Hey, Do Hwa.

574
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,640
No way! He even has lines?

575
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,670
Hey, good luck dealing with him.

576
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,740
He may seem rude at times,
but he's a nice guy.

577
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,950
Do Hwa.

578
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,180
- Don't tell Nam Ju that...
- Stay out of it.

579
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,180
That's between him and me.

580
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
Bye.

581
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,860
I'll see you guys
at the soccer match.

582
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,560
You better play fair and square.

583
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,990
Bye.

584
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,900
Haru! Haru!

585
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,100
Where have you been?
I was worried sick about you.

586
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,200
"Worried sick"?

587
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,940
Don't joke around with me.

588
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,310
Dan Oh will get hurt.

589
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,340
I think you're the one
joking around.

590
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,710
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

591
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,750
Let's go.

592
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,580
Kyung, something's strange,
isn't it?

593
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,150
It's Haru.

594
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,490
But it's not him.

595
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,430
Aren't you coming?

596
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,130
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

597
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,270
Hey.

598
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,430
Who is he?

599
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Haru.

600
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,290
My father sent these
in the early morning.

601
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,460
Drink up.

602
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,860
It's so refreshing.

603
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,370
What did your parents send?

604
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,730
They sent several food trucks
run by chefs.

605
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,370
My mother sent some baristas.

606
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,070
But they should've sent
food trucks just like yours did.

607
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,210
Hey, baristas are better than
what our family sent.

608
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,840
My grandpa set up massage chairs
in each classroom,

609
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,180
saying the students would be sore
from all the exercise.

610
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,480
Everyone is pitching in.

611
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,250
I hope there's no one
at our school...

612
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,150
who'll try to enjoy all that
so shamelessly.

613
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,520
Don't be like that.
Ju Da will be hurt.

614
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,060
Ju Da, you should take some home.

615
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,530
You don't get to have these
every day.

616
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,210
Here.

617
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Thanks.

618
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,080
How did you know
this was my favorite?

619
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,080
I read it.

620
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,090
- You read it?
- Drinking it like this is tasty.

621
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,730
You know me very well.

622
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,300
It must be
because you're my guardian angel.

623
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,240
I don't deserve to be one.

624
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,240
What?

625
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,940
A guardian angel...

626
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,040
doesn't just stand there
when you're being bullied.

627
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,110
I'm always so apologetic...

628
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,280
to you and the kids.

629
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,720
Your shirt is really cute.

630
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,760
I didn't know
you could be sarcastic.

631
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm not being sarcastic.
You're really cute.

632
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,000
You're just like Nam Ju.

633
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,100
You're lovely, good-looking,
and adorable...

634
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,840
both on and off the stage.

635
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,570
About Haru becoming
an entirely different person...

636
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,540
and everything else
that has happened,

637
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,140
I think it was all
because of my greed.

638
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,810
Ju Da.

639
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,750
I'm sorry.

640
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,690
Why aren't you practicing?

641
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,230
I should.

642
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,670
Are you seriously going to listen
to the teacher and practice?

643
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,030
- Aren't you guys tired?
- I know, right?

644
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,640
- They're not all here anyway.
- Let's rest.

645
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,610
If an A3 wants to practice,
just do it without complaining.

646
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,010
That's right. You're always right.
Wait for me.

647
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,040
Yes, the ones who are already here
can practice together.

648
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,310
Even that annoying brat, Ju Da,
isn't here for the first time.

649
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,650
Let's go.

650
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,150
- Hold on.
- Wait up.

651
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,790
Haru.

652
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,560
It doesn't seem like you're lying.

653
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,260
But we'll see...

654
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,100
if you're pretending
not to remember...

655
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,600
or if you really can't.

656
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,480
Ball! Here's the ball.

657
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,910
20 seconds.

658
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,710
Haru.

659
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,450
Haru, don't you remember me?

660
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,180
A long time ago,
when we played dodgeball,

661
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,450
you kept me safe.

662
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,850
- Here it goes.
- Hey.

663
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,250
Back then, you didn't have a name.

664
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,260
But I knew you would come
and save me.

665
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,890
Haru, do you really
not remember that? No?

666
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,830
My gosh.

667
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,400
- Yes!
- Nice.

668
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,700
- Stop taking photos.
- Hey.

669
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:41,900
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Here we go again.

670
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,940
- Get this.
- Over there.

671
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,850
- Hey.
- Get away from there.

672
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,150
- You have to dodge the ball.
- Hey, hide in a corner.

673
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,470
Good job.

674
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,580
- We won.
- We won.

675
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,780
- We won!
- My gosh.

676
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:33,850
- We won.
- We won.

677
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,090
- Haru.
- Haru.

678
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,860
Haru, will you play soccer too?

679
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,990
I'm just on the bench.

680
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,130
You can play soccer too? I thought
you were in the tennis team.

681
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,230
Kyung put him on the list.

682
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,130
I bet he'll pretend to die
if Kyung tells him to do that.

683
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,780
Here. Kyung told me
to give this to you.

684
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,480
You don't have the scar.

685
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,420
You had a scar in a diagonal line
on your left hand.

686
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,590
I never had a scar.

687
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,400
Kyung.

688
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,860
So did you give that to her?

689
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,870
Yes.

690
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,170
Gosh, she keeps fainting
which is annoying.

691
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,410
I need to give her a present
once in a while,

692
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,140
so she bothers me less.

693
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,510
- Is that so?
- Haru.

694
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,050
When we played dodgeball earlier...

695
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,120
Dodgeball?

696
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,380
When did we play dodgeball?

697
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,920
I didn't play dodgeball.

698
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,720
Yes, you did.

699
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,120
Our team won.

700
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,790
You hit Dan Oh with the ball.

701
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,430
What are you talking about?

702
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,060
Did you have a dream?

703
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,700
Stop talking nonsense
and get ready to play.

704
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,100
Do Hwa wants to have
a fair match with you.

705
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,870
I'll get going.

706
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,540
It's as expected.

707
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,340
You remember the stage,
but not the shadow.

708
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,210
Because you're not aware
of yourself anymore?

709
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,280
What are you saying?

710
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,560
- Great, Do Hwa.
- He's great.

711
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:19,990
Do Hwa!

712
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,430
- Do Hwa.
- Hey.

713
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,430
Let's go.

714
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,300
- Right here.
- You're so good!

715
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,400
- Keep going!
- Yes!

716
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,970
- Nam Ju!
- Go, Nam Ju!

717
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,440
There you go!

718
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,640
(MVP of the Year, Oh Nam Ju)

719
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,420
- There's Kyung.
- Fair-Skinned Kyung.

720
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,490
- Go, Kyung!
- Hey, I got it.

721
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

722
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,990
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

723
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,790
- That's all right.
- Kyung!

724
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:52,860
Nice.

725
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,940
Okay.

726
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,870
Come on.

727
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,540
That was so cool.

728
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,140
My gosh, Kyung.

729
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,710
Let's win this match!

730
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,150
Hey, what are you doing?

731
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,550
I'm not in the mood for this.

732
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,290
Even if you're not in the mood,

733
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,550
cheer for him.

734
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,150
- Kyung is really good.
- Kyung!

735
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,420
- Go, Kyung.
- That was great.

736
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,920
- That was awesome, Kyung!
- Kyung!

737
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,190
(Haru)

738
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,100
Hey.

739
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,340
It's about Dan Oh.

740
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,540
Okay.

741
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
You know her, don't you?

742
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,140
Hey, everyone in our school
knows who she is.

743
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,570
She's your fiancee.

744
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,780
Weren't you close with her?

745
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,910
- Me?
- Yes.

746
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,410
Why would I be close with her?

747
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:49,420
You should take care
of your fiancee.

748
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,650
Right.

749
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,020
No one but I should
take care of her.

750
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,260
You came back
as a completely different person.

751
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,260
What do you mean?

752
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,400
I'm saying that I like...

753
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,170
you.

754
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,910
His name and face are the same,

755
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,750
but he only lost his memory.

756
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,420
And he has a set-up now.

757
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,360
On top of that,
he has lines on the stage too.

758
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,460
("Secret")

759
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,200
I wonder
if he's pretending not to know...

760
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,530
or if he really doesn't
remember her.

761
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,410
I wonder if the change
will be someone's set-up...

762
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,180
or someone's story.

763
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,460
"Wait".

764
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,900
That's what the flower symbolizes.

765
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,970
What's your problem?

766
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,740
So it's really true.

767
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,740
You are really Haru.

768
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,880
Your personality has changed a bit,

769
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,850
but actually, you're
more like your old character now.

770
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,090
What about your hand?
It doesn't hurt anymore?

771
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,420
Have you gone mad?

772
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,230
I've never seen this happen either.

773
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,530
I'm not sure
if this is a good thing or not.

774
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,230
I should let time take care of it.

775
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,470
All right. You have to do it
from the bottom like this.

776
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,170
- You must straighten your back...
- Right.

777
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,540
and kick.

778
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,710
This isn't for tennis.

779
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,880
- No.
- Strike from below. Use your back.

780
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,910
- That's it.
- Like this.

781
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,080
- Just like this?
- You have to hit it far.

782
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,980
I noticed that you use
your wrists a lot.

783
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,220
You don't know anything.

784
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,650
Hot pink...

785
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,690
He stands out too much.

786
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,690
He should at least
stay out of my sight.

787
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,660
Gosh, that doesn't look right.

788
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,960
- You have the right form.
- Right.

789
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,830
- You should practice harder.
- Use your legs more.

790
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,330
- Use your back.
- Right.

791
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,160
- Strike it gently.
- No, his wrist...

792
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,430
- Hey, don't snap your wrists.
- I don't do that.

793
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,440
If Tae Ho finds out later...

794
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,110
that one of the cameras
ended up with me...

795
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,710
I cursed at Tae Ho
for the first time in my life.

796
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,290
I won't let you go anymore.

797
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,350
What's wrong with you?

798
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,990
You're crumpling it.

799
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,800
Dan Oh, why don't you go
and check who it is?

800
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,130
I bet you'll be happy to see
this unexpected guest.

801
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:56,670
Okay. Coming.

802
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,710
My gosh,
you didn't have to bring all that.

803
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,020
I know it's a bad manner
to visit you at such a late hour,

804
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,850
but I lost out to
my son's determination.

805
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,160
Look. Kyung bought
a present for you, Dan Oh.

806
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,690
Gosh, my apologies
for making you stand here.

807
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,490
- All right. Come on in.
- Okay.

808
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,570
Kyung, you're getting
more good-looking day by day.

809
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,080
That's too kind of you.

810
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,650
I don't feel good, so I'm going
upstairs. Please excuse me.

811
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,710
Are you not well?

812
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,880
- Should we go to the hospital now?
- Stop with your act.

813
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,420
You're not even worried.

814
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,450
Besides, I didn't buy this present.

815
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,920
You did...

816
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,590
because you wanted to make
a good impression on her.

817
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,130
Hey, have you gone mad?

818
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:56,200
What's the point of playing along?
They won't even remember.

819
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,930
It doesn't matter who bought it.

820
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,800
It's all right
as long as it's for Dan Oh.

821
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,240
"For Dan Oh"?

822
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,640
Sir, I'm asking you
because I'm truly curious.

823
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,140
Can't you see that...

824
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,180
he's trying to use your sick
daughter to get your approval?

825
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,440
- Hey, Kyung.
- Have you lost your mind?

826
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,850
No, I have not unlike you guys.

827
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,290
Kyung, you're getting
more good-looking day by day.

828
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,590
That's too kind of you.

829
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,860
My gosh, this must've been
really hard to buy this.

830
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,560
Thank you, Kyung.

831
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:30,330
I guess he wanted to come here
at this late hour for a reason.

832
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:33,870
I wanted to see her happy
as soon as I could.

833
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,540
Goodness.
Kyung, you're such a romantic.

834
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,210
I'm going to focus on Dan Oh now.

835
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,440
You have no choice
but to marry him now.

836
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,450
Shall we set a date?

837
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,450
I'll be happy to
as long as Dan Oh is happy with it.

838
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,280
I should do everything she wants.

839
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,120
All right.
Please have some refreshments.

840
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,360
Did you have
to make a ruckus like that?

841
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,630
As long as I'm not on the stage,

842
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,370
I can do whatever I want
wherever I am.

843
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,870
You should at least feel sorry.

844
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:11,270
Your family is using my family
because of money.

845
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:12,810
What about that?

846
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,910
I just do things the way it's drawn
unlike you,

847
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,010
who wants to change things around.

848
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:19,950
But...

849
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,380
you make me annoyed,
angry, and irritated.

850
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,320
- What?
- Let me ask you something.

851
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,460
Do you want to be
more than an extra?

852
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,760
Or do you want to change
your set-up for terminal illness?

853
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,500
Or is it him?

854
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,030
He can't change your destiny.

855
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,530
I'm the one who can.

856
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,900
Not just an extra, your partner
in this comic book, Baek Kyung.

857
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,880
I'll help you.

858
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,910
I mean it.

859
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,790
Chairman Eun thinks
you honestly like Dan Oh.

860
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,760
I just did as I was told.

861
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,090
Great work.

862
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,860
If you insist that you won't
marry her like last time,

863
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,730
I won't consider you as my son.

864
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,770
Don't ruin everything
because of your rebellious spirit.

865
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,570
Marry her no matter what happens.

866
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,310
Answer me.

867
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,940
Yes.

868
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,350
Take this.

869
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,100
Darn it, President Baek.
You're always the same.

870
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,010
I'm not rebelling. I mean it.

871
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,570
I'm a character who can't say a word
to my biological father...

872
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,980
who uses me as a tool because
I don't want to be abandoned.

873
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,110
It's just awful.

874
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,850
What did you just say?

875
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,950
I told you that
you won't remember anyway.

876
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,620
You little jerk.

877
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,720
Who's there?

878
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,430
Kyung?

879
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,570
Why are you here at this hour?

880
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,070
I came to get my racket.

881
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,770
We have to practice
tomorrow morning.

882
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,040
Darn it, I thought...

883
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,540
- What's that?
- Oh, this?

884
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,610
I left an important book here.

885
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,020
Have you...

886
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,820
ever seen this book?

887
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,390
("Secret")

888
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,330
No.

889
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,300
Should I have seen it?

890
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,100
Oh, no.

891
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,370
What's with your face?

892
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,140
What's with your face?

893
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,340
Oh, things happened.

894
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,740
Are you okay?

895
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:40,750
That's weird.

896
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,380
What is?

897
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,780
You're worried about me...

898
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,750
at this point in time,

899
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,990
and of all people, you.

900
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,130
I thought everything was
already decided in this world.

901
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,830
But there are such variables.

902
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,230
("Secret")

903
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,240
I don't want to be an extra...

904
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,610
that can vanish whenever, wherever,
and however the writer wants.

905
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,410
I decided to be the only person
who can change...

906
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,510
someone's fate.

907
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,880
If there's no answer
as to how I came to this world,

908
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,780
I will make my own answer...

909
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,850
with Dan Oh.

910
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,070
This was the only place
I could think of.

911
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,780
Haru came back.

912
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,520
I know.

913
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,020
But he can't remember me.

914
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,290
Didn't you say you'll do anything
if he can come back?

915
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,260
Dan Oh.

916
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,660
You're one needy girl.

917
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,500
Why?

918
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,770
Are you going to run after him
and make him self-aware again?

919
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,700
No.

920
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,180
I loved it
whenever Haru and I...

921
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,150
changed the story together.

922
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,780
I didn't care
if the story got twisted.

923
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,390
I had the hope
that I might be able to live.

924
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,760
I thought the answer
I could create in this world is...

925
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,660
to change my fate to face death
as a terminally-ill patient.

926
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,400
But...

927
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:43,200
I became frightened of everything
ever since Haru disappeared.

928
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,710
I tell myself that
I should just live as an extra.

929
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,410
But then I get really scared.

930
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,080
I don't want to die.

931
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,720
Haru was the only one
who helped me find my answer.

932
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,100
But it's...

933
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,600
But it's all ruined now.

934
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,490
I will make my own answer.

935
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,170
With you.

936
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:47,690
(Extra-ordinary You)
