1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Who...

3
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,060
am I?

4
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,920
I want to know...

5
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,790
where I came from...

6
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,920
and where I'm headed.

7
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,460
(Extra Characters)

8
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,630
(Eun Dan Oh, female, 18 years old,
Baek Kyung's fiancee)

9
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,060
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- I don't think this is right.

10
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,870
Dan Oh.

11
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,480
I heard my voice for the first time.

12
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,190
You didn't work out.

13
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,130
- Don't lie.
- I used a pull-up bar yesterday.

14
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,360
Do you have a bar at home?
Seriously?

15
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,960
This outfit is a bit tight.

16
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,829
Did you see it?

17
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,240
Like this?

18
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,470
No, that is oversized.

19
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,170
How do I know her name...

20
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,810
when I don't even know mine?

21
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,060
Why do I always
have my eyes on you?

22
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,170
I don't even know who I am.

23
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,460
Tell me...

24
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,860
why it has to be you.

25
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,860
Using your darn heart disease
as an excuse,

26
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,870
you cry and collapse all the time.

27
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,840
It's not like you're dying.

28
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,980
Let's go.

29
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,050
Dan Oh.

30
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,590
Who are you?

31
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,260
You won't remember
even if I tell you.

32
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,030
The scene will change soon.

33
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,300
I heard you correctly, right?

34
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,970
It doesn't make sense,

35
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,010
but I wish it did.

36
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:57,980
Do you...

37
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,720
remember me?

38
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,120
Since when?

39
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,490
I don't know.

40
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,260
But...

41
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,900
I know that you started it.

42
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,710
Dan Oh.

43
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,120
Kyung.

44
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,250
Why are you drenched?

45
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,220
Did the writer make it rain?

46
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,390
Isn't it strange how it's dry
everywhere else,

47
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,200
but you're the only one
who's wet?

48
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,840
No, Dan Oh was there as well.

49
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,470
She's unlike you
since she's aware of herself.

50
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,470
You don't even realize
that it's strange.

51
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,310
Just hang in there for a bit.

52
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,510
Once the scene changes,
you'll become dry again.

53
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,680
"Once the scene changes"?

54
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,450
I'm upset.

55
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,720
I don't think
Nam Ju, Ju Da, or you...

56
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,450
will ever be aware of yourselves.

57
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,020
Cheer up.

58
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,390
At times, it's better
not to remember.

59
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,030
Bye.

60
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,110
Do you also not remember...

61
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,180
what happened
in between the scenes?

62
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,610
Then do you also hear
a strange noise...

63
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,810
whenever you lose your memory?

64
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,510
And you don't know when
or where you'll wake up,

65
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,180
and do you have the dates
and places all mixed up?

66
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,620
- Yes.
- And those around you...

67
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,320
can't remember what
you've said or done?

68
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,060
You're right.

69
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,130
But I remember all the moments...

70
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,530
we've shared together.

71
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,560
No way.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,630
Have you truly
become aware of yourself?

73
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,450
That's Dan Oh.

74
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,980
What brings you here?

75
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,620
I wanted to see something.

76
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,790
You're not my type.

77
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm not talking about you.

78
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm talking about that.

79
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,530
Hey, isn't this...

80
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,970
Stage. Shadow. Stage. Shadow.

81
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,539
What are you doing?

82
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,470
I still cannot believe
that we're in the world of comics.

83
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,240
But when I see those
who aren't aware of themselves,

84
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,309
I can easily believe that.

85
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,510
It's rather frightening.

86
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
"Ju Da."

87
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,980
- "Do Hwa, where are you going?"
- "I..."

88
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,320
I came...

89
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,650
to you.

90
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,760
No matter how sincere I am,

91
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,960
once the stage is lit,

92
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,890
she can't remember a thing.

93
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,100
Please, Ju Da.

94
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,330
That's because the writer controls
everything that happens on stage.

95
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,600
The writer has no plans
to make you confess.

96
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,870
Exactly. That's why
I was playing the violin here.

97
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,280
But in the shadow, I'm rather cool.

98
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,210
It can't be helped.

99
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,480
Those who are aware
of themselves...

100
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,380
are the only ones who can remember
what happened in the shadow.

101
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,850
Isn't it wonderful
to appear and disappear...

102
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,050
at the right time
for the main characters?

103
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,060
"He confesses his feelings
straightforwardly."

104
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,830
Why didn't the writer
write such a thing about me?

105
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,760
That's because
you're an extra in this comic.

106
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,930
There are many manly
and amazing male extras.

107
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,930
I've looked through
other comic books as well.

108
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
Hey, what is this?

109
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Is Dan Oh...

110
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,850
- I know.
- She doesn't have much time?

111
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,650
It means we don't know
when her heart will stop beating.

112
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,450
I had no idea.

113
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,850
I feel terrible for her.

114
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,860
Isn't this too cruel
for an extra to undergo?

115
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,160
It's only possible...

116
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,230
because she's an extra.

117
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,860
Haru...

118
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,030
remembers me.

119
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,440
Thank you, writer.

120
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,240
Please forget all the gibberish
I've said up until now.

121
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,440
Oh, yes!

122
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,680
Dan Oh.

123
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,860
Take this as my apology.

124
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,730
No, thanks.

125
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,530
- Take it.
- No.

126
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,960
We're over.

127
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,900
What?

128
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,370
I want to stop liking you.

129
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,810
You said you're disgusted
and irritated by my disease.

130
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,410
- That was just...
- Don't worry.

131
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,250
I won't let this
affect your father's business.

132
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,620
Dan Oh!

133
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,180
One-sided love...

134
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,950
wasn't only torturous
to the one doing it.

135
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,660
It's also painful for the one
on the receiving end.

136
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,190
I'm sorry...

137
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
for everything.

138
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,570
From today on,

139
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,700
we're no longer engaged.

140
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,210
My gosh. I had no idea
I could say such things.

141
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,310
Oh, my!

142
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,420
By the way, is your face all right?

143
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,820
I know everything's planned out
and not real,

144
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,150
but it still hurts.

145
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,860
Gosh, you're still a jerk.

146
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,690
But I'll accept your apology.

147
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,470
Take back what you just said.

148
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,970
About what?

149
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
What's with you?

150
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,790
(Time to take medication)

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,040
Look at these extra medications
I have.

152
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,140
What a useless detail.

153
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,650
Are you all right?

154
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,780
What's up with you?

155
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,490
Didn't you buy this for Ju Da?

156
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,720
No, I didn't. I bought it for you.

157
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,790
I want you to eat
a lot of good food.

158
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,690
You definitely read that part.

159
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,030
Hey, don't worry.
It's nothing. Okay?

160
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,800
The writer just
added an extra set-up.

161
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,200
My gosh, don't say it is nothing.
You could...

162
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,540
You could die.

163
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,540
You and Ju Hwa
have the same reaction.

164
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,240
You two are indeed brothers.

165
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,050
I had no idea.
I only pined after Ju Da.

166
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,090
Do you know
what a butterfly effect is?

167
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,090
It's a principle...

168
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,760
that a small flutter of a buttery
can bring a huge typhoon.

169
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,330
What does that have to do with you?

170
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,360
A small action from an extra...

171
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
can change the whole world.

172
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, Dried Squid did say
that I'm messing things up.

173
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,070
So even if the scene
has nothing to do with you,

174
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,570
keep making changes.

175
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,610
Then, I won't need these eventually.

176
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,640
From today on,
we're no longer engaged.

177
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,350
You'd better watch
where you're going.

178
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,790
I'm sorry, Kyung.

179
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,850
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

180
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,590
What are you looking at? What?

181
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,730
Don't do that. You'll get hurt.

182
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,100
Why do you care
if I get hurt or not?

183
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,870
I thought it might hurt.

184
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
And I felt bad for you.

185
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
My gosh,
I must have lost my mind!

186
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,940
Why did I close my eyes
at that moment?

187
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,110
Some people might think
I really like him or something.

188
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,550
But I'm really
not interested in him.

189
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,550
This is ridiculous.

190
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,060
"Let's change our fate together."

191
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,090
Hi. Hello.

192
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,830
Hi. Hi.

193
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,830
Hi.

194
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,730
Stop. Stop thinking about him.

195
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,670
I must have gone mad.

196
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,610
This is so embarrassing.

197
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,610
No way. There's no way
I'd remember every single thing.

198
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,620
I'm doomed.

199
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,130
I want to know...

200
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
why it has to be you.

201
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Dan Oh.

202
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,210
Hi.

203
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,359
My gosh, I can't exactly ask him...

204
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,730
because I humiliated myself
many times.

205
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,690
How much of memory does he have?

206
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,300
How much do you remember?

207
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,630
What? What do you mean?
I remember nothing. Who are you?

208
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,730
Nothing?

209
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,670
My gosh, it's quite chilly
this morning.

210
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,270
Hey, what are you doing?

211
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,640
You said I should take it off
when you're cold.

212
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,980
Hey, that doesn't apply here.

213
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,850
So you remember everything.

214
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,120
Darn it. He knows everything.

215
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,120
What are you staring at?

216
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,030
You.

217
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,060
I have always been watching you.

218
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Why?

219
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,700
Just because.
I just felt like I should.

220
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,640
How much does he know about me?

221
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,710
Dan Oh is engaged to Baek Kyung...

222
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,740
and is frail due to heart disease.

223
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
And...

224
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,650
you've recently found out
you don't have much time left.

225
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
You read the comic book.

226
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,090
I don't have much time left.

227
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,020
I don't like that.

228
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,230
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,070
Dan Oh.

230
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,870
I didn't know such a handsome guy
went to our school.

231
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,440
- Who is he?
- Haru.

232
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,580
Haru, hello.

233
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,380
Hello. "Shin Sae Mi".

234
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,550
My gosh, if you call my name
in that gentle voice of yours,

235
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,290
you'll make my heart pound.

236
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,790
What's going on? I thought
you only liked Nam Ju.

237
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,340
You're impressively tall.

238
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,110
What's your name?

239
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,050
So this is the snack bar.

240
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,580
Try it out. Here. Go.

241
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,620
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

242
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,190
- Stop trying to cut.
- Come on.

243
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,120
<i>- Let us pass through
- Let us pass through</i>

244
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,760
- Stop that.
- Why do you keep pushing?

245
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,730
Move out of my way. Move.

246
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,990
- Hey, come on.
- How dare you cut?

247
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,660
- Out of my way.
- Move.

248
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,500
- Move.
- Come on, man.

249
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,400
- I told you to move.
- Stop it!

250
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,230
- Move out of my way.
- What are you doing?

251
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,570
You trust me, right?

252
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,940
- Excuse me!
- Come on.

253
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,740
- Step aside.
- Hey.

254
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,080
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

255
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,850
- These, please.
- Come on.

256
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,590
What do you think?

257
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,490
You have to try that hard
every time you buy food?

258
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,290
"Try that hard"?

259
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,730
I can't believe you.

260
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,900
Listen. You can't learn
these skills overnight.

261
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,630
Do you know how hard it is
for extras like us...

262
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,570
to buy food at the snack bar?

263
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,170
Thinking about my old days
makes me cry.

264
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,380
When you have nothing else to say,
you just smile.

265
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,360
Nam Ju.

266
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,290
What is it, Errand Girl?

267
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
I'm no longer your errand girl.

268
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,570
For getting your uniform cleaned.
That's the last of it.

269
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,970
My gosh.

270
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,310
The writer has no creativity at all.

271
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,670
How long will the writer drag it out
with the cleaning fee?

272
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,350
So they are the main characters
of this comic book.

273
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,290
- I want to do something different.
- Something different?

274
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,520
I don't want to be your errand girl.

275
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,190
I want to be your friend.

276
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,120
I hope we get along.

277
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,260
- I don't want to.
- What?

278
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't want to be your friend.

279
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
She wants to be friends with him
after flirting with him.

280
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,370
That's so typical for a heroine
in a romance comic book.

281
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,340
- It's making me cringe.
- Dan Oh.

282
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Hey, you're here.

283
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,440
Hello, Back.

284
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,310
That's not his name. It's Haru.

285
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Hey, I get why you go crazy
for his back.

286
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,620
Stop it.

287
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,050
Stop it.

288
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,390
Did you know Dan Oh went crazy
for your back?

289
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,660
Hey, stop making up stuff!

290
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,560
That's not true. No.

291
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,890
Hey, Ju Da went that way.
Go that way. Hurry.

292
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,430
Dan Oh, don't be shy.
It doesn't suit you.

293
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,230
He won't even remember this anyway.

294
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,640
Look at your eyes.

295
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,940
My gosh, his eyes look
like the main character's eyes.

296
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,110
Scoot over.

297
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,640
He's not a main character, but he's
the other guy in the love triangle.

298
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,010
Remember Nam Ju and Ju Da earlier?

299
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,580
He's supposed
to make their love deepen.

300
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,750
His role is...

301
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,320
- What?
- Well...

302
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,960
It's similar to our roles.

303
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,490
What?

304
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,660
Why do I have to
let an extra feel bad for me?

305
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,430
Cheer up.

306
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,470
He can talk.

307
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,710
Do Hwa.

308
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,240
He knows my name too.

309
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,780
I want to do something different.

310
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,080
I don't want to be your errand girl.

311
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,380
I want to be your friend.

312
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,780
I don't want to.
I don't want to be your friend.

313
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,650
What's this?

314
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,390
The stage where the story unfolds.

315
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,560
Okay, then.

316
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,030
They're the main characters
of this comic book.

317
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,130
I see.

318
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,200
Where are we now?

319
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,100
Outside of the story, the shadow.

320
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,600
And what do we have to do?

321
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,870
Change the story.

322
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,770
Exactly. You can go into the stage,

323
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,210
so you'll definitely
be able to change it.

324
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,210
Although only small things
have changed thus far.

325
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,780
It's called the butterfly effect.

326
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,010
The fluttering of
Dan Oh and our wings...

327
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,810
will soon bring a huge typhoon.

328
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,980
Exactly. Who taught you that?

329
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,620
Dan Oh.

330
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,820
Right?

331
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,720
You're a smartie.

332
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,860
You shouldn't touch
what's not yours without permission.

333
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,670
Hi.

334
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,240
(I want to stop liking you.)

335
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,540
(From today on,
we're no longer engaged.)

336
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,740
Dan Oh. That was awesome.

337
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,310
"I want to stop liking you."

338
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,220
See that? Isn't it odd how
my character completely changed...

339
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,850
after liking Kyung for 10 years?

340
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,320
The storyboard changed
a number of times too.

341
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,690
You'd better stop.

342
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,490
Why do you want
to change this so badly?

343
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,860
Why can't I do it?

344
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,660
You're one scary guy.

345
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,730
You know
about Dan Oh's heart condition.

346
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,430
You always say I can't do anything.

347
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,370
All I want to do
is use my time freely,

348
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,400
the freedom to eat when I want,

349
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,700
hang out with friends
when I want to,

350
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,370
and not to go to the hospital
when I don't want to.

351
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,470
Such trivial things
will ruin this world.

352
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,380
Then you expect me to sit around
and wait until the day I die?

353
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,250
I just want to live my own life.

354
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,950
Instead of the Dan Oh who says
and does what she has to,

355
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,650
I want to live as the Dan Oh
who says and does what she wants.

356
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,820
Don't be a nuisance
if you aren't going to help.

357
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,420
Hey, Dan Oh.

358
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,560
What are you doing?

359
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,740
So what's the stage again?

360
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,240
The stage
is the outside of the story.

361
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,710
That's the shadow.

362
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,280
The stage is where the story
of the comic unfolds. Do you get it?

363
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,980
I'm going to ask you again tomorrow.

364
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,320
Bye.

365
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,150
What's with you?

366
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,750
Who are you?

367
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,820
You can't remember.

368
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
What?

369
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,360
My name is...

370
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,590
Haru.

371
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Haru?

372
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,100
You won't remember
when the scene changes...

373
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,030
The scene changes? I won't remember?

374
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,500
Is this some kind of joke?

375
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,970
You need to speak in a language
that I can understand, you idiot.

376
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,780
That's enough, Kyung.

377
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,550
(I don't even know...)

378
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,880
(where I came from!)

379
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,550
("Flower")

380
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,020
I thought some comic books
had recently gone missing.

381
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,830
So there was another person
who had been checking these out.

382
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,170
So you've woken up.

383
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,740
Who are you?

384
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
Me?

385
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,840
The Dried Squid Fairy.

386
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,910
Have you always known me?

387
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm not sure.

388
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,010
How?

389
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,510
By chance.

390
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,220
I guess you won't tell me anything.

391
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,790
But I don't care.

392
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,560
I'll find the answer myself.

393
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,430
You can't do that.

394
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,830
The pain will slowly
get worse and worse...

395
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,300
if you make a mess of the stage
in order to find your answer.

396
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,680
Stop Dan Oh.

397
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,880
That's the reason why you exist.

398
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,130
Dan Oh.

399
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,600
Why are you just passing me by?

400
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,770
Am I not allowed to do that?

401
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,270
It's weird. You always...

402
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,270
I always get clingy
when I'm with you.

403
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,370
I feel bad for myself too.

404
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,880
That's why I want to be free
in the shadow.

405
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,250
- "The shadow"?
- The outside of the comic...

406
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,720
- Forget it.
- You need to explain.

407
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,350
You'll get hurt if I do.

408
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,870
My goodness, that's amazing.

409
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,440
- Move.
- What's going on?

410
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,010
Cha Ji Hyun is here.

411
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,940
- The beloved actress?
- Nam Ju's mom?

412
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,440
Exactly. My goodness!

413
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,650
See that? What is our role here?

414
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,150
Being amazed.
Screaming out reactions.

415
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,380
Providing quick information.

416
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,720
Okay, let's start
with the reactions.

417
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,890
Give it a go.

418
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,460
What are you doing?

419
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,730
Come on, stamp your feet
a little more.

420
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,570
- That's Nam Ju's mom!
- All right!

421
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,170
Ms. Cha!

422
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,810
- Ms. Cha!
- Cha Ji Hyun!

423
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,050
- Cha Ji Hyun!
- You're so pretty!

424
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,620
- Ms. Cha!
- Ms. Cha!

425
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,030
Nam Ju was the one
who changed the camp location?

426
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,200
Well, yes. Nam Ju insisted...

427
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
that we should go somewhere
within the country.

428
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
Why did he suddenly do that?

429
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,240
Many people are saying...

430
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,740
this school causes social disharmony
because of our prestigiousness.

431
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,510
It could've been worse
if they had traveled abroad.

432
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,040
Nam Ju made a perfect decision
during this time.

433
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,510
Yes, of course. That's Nam Ju.

434
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,620
He'll probably be as smart
as his older brother.

435
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,550
Hee Ju is one smart kid
because he took after me.

436
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,260
Let's use this year's photos
for our public relations.

437
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,860
Let's leave out everything
we took abroad from last year.

438
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,330
Yes, sir.

439
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,200
What about Nam Ju's birthday party?
Should we prepare it here?

440
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,870
What are you going to do?

441
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,500
We're planning
on holding a small party...

442
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,770
with a few close friends of him.

443
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,610
You don't have to prepare anything.

444
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,540
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,560
What are you doing?

446
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,240
Why do you draw these things?

447
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,510
To remember.

448
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,580
I want to know...

449
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,350
where I came from...

450
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,550
and where I'm headed.

451
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,310
Ju Da, I'll give you a hand.

452
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,950
Look at Do Hwa. My gosh.

453
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,820
Do Hwa, didn't you forget something?

454
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,820
Like what?

455
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,620
You forgot your wings.

456
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,190
You're my guardian angel.

457
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,370
Listen to those cheesy lines.

458
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,300
It must be tough for him,
don't you think?

459
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,470
It's not so bad, though.

460
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
He's with Ju Da all the time.

461
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,380
I always had to look for you.

462
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,210
Haru.

463
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
- Watch your mouth.
- What?

464
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,720
Don't say such things
while looking at me with those eyes.

465
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,950
I'm willing to let you off,

466
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,390
but a girl like Sae Mi would think
you two start dating from today.

467
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,990
I see.

468
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,260
There's so much to teach you.

469
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,400
Where am I going to begin?

470
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,880
I like the rooftop the most...

471
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,450
in this school.

472
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,720
- Why?
- Because my favorite color is blue.

473
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,890
It feels like
my sad feelings all fly away...

474
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,360
when I look up into the blue sky.

475
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,370
Looking good.

476
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,840
Nice view.

477
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,340
I was wondering
what you two were doing here.

478
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,639
Is this your secret date spot
or something?

479
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,010
A date?

480
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,409
Do Hwa helped me out, that's all.

481
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,880
Is this why you said you wanted
to be just friends with me?

482
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,980
It's not like that.

483
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,080
Hey, Nam Ju.

484
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,350
That's enough.

485
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,020
I warned you.

486
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,659
I said I hate it when
other people touch my things.

487
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,060
Nam Ju.

488
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,260
Why are you suddenly like this?

489
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,159
The rooftop will remain closed
as of today.

490
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,639
Nam Ju.

491
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,020
It feels like
my sad feelings all fly away...

492
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,219
when I look up into the blue sky.

493
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,930
Nam Ju!

494
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,670
Why don't we say hi to Nam Ju
while we're here?

495
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,510
It might be embarrassing
for him at school.

496
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,710
Let's go.

497
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,710
Okay, then.

498
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,690
Why are you following me?

499
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,890
Why didn't you stay with Do Hwa?

500
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,160
Nam Ju,

501
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,200
you shouldn't be like that.

502
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,800
Isn't it enough to just bully me?

503
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,770
- Why are you bullying him...
- Did you follow me to say that?

504
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,740
It's my fault for thinking
that we became friends.

505
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,310
Why are you...

506
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,780
Why are you so clueless?

507
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,480
What more can I do?

508
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,220
What are you talking about?

509
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,420
Do you really have no idea,

510
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,920
or are you only pretending?

511
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,500
Isn't this funny?

512
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
What is?

513
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,010
How everyone is so serious.

514
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,910
Even if the sky turns black
and chairs are floating around,

515
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,680
they still have no idea because
they have to say their lines.

516
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,480
No matter what you say
in the shadow,

517
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,250
they won't remember
in the next scene.

518
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,020
Because they aren't aware
of themselves.

519
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,690
How stupid.

520
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,660
But I seem more stupid
for liking such a stupid girl.

521
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,760
- That's your character.
- I've become self-aware,

522
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,830
but why am I still the same person
as my character...

523
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,700
that the writer gave me?

524
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,170
It's not fair.

525
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,250
Will things change between us...

526
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,780
if Ju Da becomes self-aware?

527
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,120
Has anything changed for you
since you became self-aware?

528
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,390
I want to know more about myself.

529
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm jealous of you.

530
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,170
There are things you want
to know and do.

531
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,670
If you don't have any character,
that means anything is possible.

532
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,040
It's really sad
how you have to play a certain role.

533
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,870
My role is...

534
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,510
just to watch her.

535
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,250
Why isn't it coming?

536
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,750
- Why won't it come?
- Is it today?

537
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,190
- When will it come?
- Please come.

538
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,790
I'm his number one fan
in Seuli High School.

539
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,190
I'll get it, won't I?

540
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,560
- Hey, wait.
- I'm so nervous.

541
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,930
- His birthday is tomorrow.
- It didn't come?

542
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,130
They said it'd be sent soon.

543
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,830
What's with everyone?

544
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,300
I finally got it.

545
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,870
An invitation
to Nam Ju's birthday party.

546
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,700
What is this?

547
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,110
"You're invited to a reception..."

548
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,540
"to celebrate
Oh Nam Ju's birthday..."

549
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,510
- My goodness.
- Isn't this great?

550
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,880
Dan Oh, take a picture of me
with Nam Ju.

551
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,910
Where did you get this?

552
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,850
- What?
- Where is the other one?

553
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,980
- Where?
- Did you see it?

554
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,820
Hey, where is the picture panel
that was standing here?

555
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,490
The picture is a little worse
than how he looks in real life.

556
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,820
Why do you care so much
about some panel?

557
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,720
Hey! "Some panel"?

558
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,360
The moment Nam Ju's picture
got printed on the panel,

559
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,030
the panel became alive
with Nam Ju's life.

560
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,300
It's like Nam Ju's magic.

561
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,200
You might as well take it home.

562
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,870
Yes, I will.

563
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,270
Do you like him so much?

564
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,440
Yes, I like him the most
in this world.

565
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,170
- Why?
- What?

566
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,910
There's no reason
because we're meant to be.

567
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,180
I just like him.

568
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,010
Don't touch him.

569
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,050
"Meant to be"?

570
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,820
- Don't talk casually to me.
- My gosh.

571
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,960
A birthday present for me.

572
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,800
Please take good care of this.

573
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,500
My woman likes strawberries.

574
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,770
Let me make a formal announcement.

575
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,640
From now on,
Ju Da is the only woman for me.

576
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,050
Oh, no.

577
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,850
Ju Da's stage is...

578
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,620
This is unfair.

579
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,690
If the main characters announce
that they're officially dating,

580
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,060
what will happen to me?

581
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
I help out the female lead
and let the male lead take glory...

582
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,630
just like
all supporting characters do.

583
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,200
It's so obvious.

584
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,230
- I'll help you.
- You know how it is.

585
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,570
Everything will happen
as the writer planned.

586
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,940
Hey, we should
at least give it a try.

587
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,310
How are we going to change that?

588
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,500
Why won't you go?

589
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,560
I don't want to.

590
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,800
You said you'll change
the story with me.

591
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,170
Why are you suddenly doing this?

592
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,240
Because it might be dangerous.

593
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,270
For whom? Me? You?

594
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,310
That stage has nothing to do
with you anyway.

595
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,840
I just want to change something.

596
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,810
Why is everyone telling me
that I can't?

597
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,780
You also know...

598
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,050
that I don't have much time left.

599
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,820
I need you to change the stage.

600
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,690
It's something that only you can do.

601
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,490
Please?

602
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
Dan Oh.

603
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,830
We need to talk.

604
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,040
Hey, that hurts.

605
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,740
What's with you?

606
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,110
Why are you all like this?

607
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,680
I don't think
Dan Oh has anything to say to you.

608
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,950
Why do you care?

609
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,430
Hey.

610
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,870
Hey.

611
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,170
I have something to say to her.

612
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,080
What are you looking at?

613
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,250
I'll go to the birthday party.

614
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,490
I'll help you.

615
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,960
Dan Oh.

616
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,000
Are you here to see Kyung?

617
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,930
Sae Mi, you know how Kyung
got mad at me in the classroom?

618
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,900
When? Did he get mad at you again?

619
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,110
I knew it. It wasn't the stage.

620
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,640
What's his problem?

621
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,040
How great does he think...

622
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,810
He is handsome, indeed.

623
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,850
But still, he's this tall...

624
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,250
Maybe taller than this?

625
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,020
He's even tall.

626
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,890
You should be more understanding.
He's handsome, you know.

627
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,960
Everything is changing...

628
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,230
bit by bit.

629
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Kyung's here!

630
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,070
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

631
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,110
He's so handsome!

632
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,610
- He looks great in blue!
- I know!

633
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,710
My gosh!

634
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,250
Good luck, Kyung!

635
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,990
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

636
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,990
Good luck!

637
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,690
You first.

638
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,570
What was that?

639
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,240
What kind of serve was that?

640
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,870
Kyung, good luck!

641
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,310
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

642
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,980
- Did you just see that serve?
- You're so awesome!

643
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,620
- This is so boring for me.
- Good job!

644
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:54,980
Happy now?

645
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,030
Give me your racket.

646
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,730
Give it to me.

647
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,430
Is this an antique or what?

648
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,470
From now on, play tennis with me.

649
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,010
Why should I?

650
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,040
I'm going to keep you in check.

651
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,480
I need to know
what kind of guy you are.

652
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,860
Can you stop already?

653
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,970
- Hey.
- What?

654
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,370
Is something going on?

655
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,710
It's bothering me.

656
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,610
What is bothering you? Dan Oh?

657
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,950
Hey, be good to her.

658
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,450
She's really ill.

659
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,390
Even Haru is helping her
so she'd live.

660
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,590
Aren't you being too harsh?
You're her fiance.

661
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,500
Kyung, aren't you being too cruel?

662
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,070
I'm the second best, okay?

663
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,870
The third best has no right
to ignore me like that...

664
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,240
although we're in the shadow.

665
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
"Shadow"?

666
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,180
On stage, Nam Ju bothers me.
In the shadow...

667
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,450
Was it that upsetting
when I told you to be good to her?

668
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,950
What?

669
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,250
Hey, Haru.

670
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,490
I'm glad you're here. I'm so upset.

671
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,360
Do Hwa.

672
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,460
Do you know him?

673
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,130
He's Haru from your class.

674
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,630
Right, you won't remember.

675
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,000
"Haru"?

676
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,180
Kyung, our PE teacher wants you
to write some candidates' names...

677
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,950
on this soccer team list.

678
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,120
- Why should I?
- You're the head.

679
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,620
You should do it.

680
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,060
Okay.

681
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,860
- Hold on.
- Yes?

682
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,140
Thanks.

683
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,410
(Candidate Names: Haru)

684
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,810
I'm going to hang it in my room.

685
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,880
- Really? Look at this.
- You've got to hear this!

686
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,980
- What is it?
- Did you get one?

687
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,120
Nam Ju.

688
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,050
Did you not invite him?

689
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,220
- Do you like coffee?
- I'm going to dress like this.

690
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,720
- Like that?
- It looks neat.

691
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,990
Is he in our class?

692
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,890
- Do you not know him?
- Who is he?

693
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,360
I don't like it.

694
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,470
(You first.)

695
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:03,840
(Oh, okay.)

696
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,440
(What kind of serve was that?)

697
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,590
(You first.)

698
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,690
(Oh, okay.)

699
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,160
Eight ham and cheese sandwiches
and milk tea to-go, please.

700
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,870
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

701
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,780
Here are your delicious sandwiches
and milk tea.

702
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,810
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

703
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,220
Nam Ju.

704
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,220
Why are you here?

705
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,790
Make sure you come.
I have something to tell you.

706
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,470
Bye.

707
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,120
I'm sick of watching.

708
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,060
I want to confess my feelings
for her at least once.

709
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,410
- Where are you going?
- Don't talk casually to me.

710
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,150
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

711
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,450
Hey, guys.

712
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,350
Oh, my. It's so private
and exclusive.

713
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,620
My gosh, guys.

714
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,890
I am currently
at Oh Nam Ju's birthday party!

715
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,020
He's the most popular guy
at Seuli High School.

716
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,690
Cameras are banned.

717
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,890
I'll just film a little bit...

718
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,090
- and turn it off.
- Come on.

719
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,060
Hold on! Sae Mi, wait for me!

720
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,630
I think you got the wrong idea.

721
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,500
- I'm with her.
- No, he's not!

722
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,100
He's not with me.

723
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,300
- Sae Mi!
- Come on in.

724
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,270
You need to scan my barcode.

725
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,780
Hey, look.

726
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,080
His outfit is very flamboyant.

727
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,120
It's too much.

728
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,150
What could I do? That was
the most ordinary-looking one...

729
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,220
out of my brother's clothes.

730
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,020
What's up with his taste?
It's so weird.

731
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,690
- Hey.
- Hello, Haru.

732
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,360
- My gosh, look at you.
- Look at you.

733
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
Goodness, you look...

734
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,530
so great. You look great.

735
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,530
- You look great.
- Good.

736
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,370
All right. Hey, focus.

737
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,500
You all remember the storyboard
I told you earlier, right?

738
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,410
- Yes.
- No matter how small it may be,

739
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,340
we must change something. Okay?

740
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,940
But...

741
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,810
do you think the scene on the stage
will change?

742
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,280
When the stage starts,

743
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,880
everything goes back to its places.

744
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,550
Buddy, so are you telling me
that you'll just watch...

745
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,290
Nam Ju publicly announcing
his feelings for Ju Da?

746
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,790
- Never.
- Right?

747
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,220
Then, you ought to do
something about it.

748
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,060
We don't know
how and which scene might change.

749
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,230
But we can try
to change the scene together...

750
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,040
Darn it. No.

751
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,210
Go inside.

752
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,010
Hello?

753
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,450
- Hey.
- Who is he?

754
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:12,890
Do you go to Seuli High School?

755
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,920
Which grade and class are you in?

756
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,630
- Junior, Class Seven.
- Your name?

757
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,130
- Haru.
- Let me check your invitation card.

758
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:28,970
Junior, Class Seven?

759
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,670
Do you know who he is?

760
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,750
- Hey, you can't go in.
- Toss him.

761
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,150
How dare you try to enter here?
You're a nobody.

762
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,850
Hey, do a better job
securing the area.

763
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,960
My goodness.

764
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,360
Congratulations. You look dashing.

765
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,800
Darn the stage. Darn my violin.

766
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,970
You're here, Do Hwa.

767
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,370
- Hello.
- Hi.

768
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,470
My gosh,
you still look beautiful, ma'am.

769
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,640
You're always so sweet.

770
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
I bet only my son looks that sad...

771
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,550
on his birthday.

772
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,520
He must be nervous.

773
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,290
I heard
that you will play the violin today.

774
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,860
Yes, it's my best friend's birthday.

775
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,860
I ought to.

776
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,790
Thank you. Good luck.

777
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,830
Okay.

778
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,230
- Happy birthday to your son.
- Sir.

779
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,300
- Hello.
- Happy birthday to your son

780
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,930
Thank you. Please go upstairs.

781
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,800
Letting go of a woman I like...

782
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,400
and playing the violin in tears...

783
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,340
is the role
the writer set up for me.

784
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,510
- Do you want it?
- I told my dad to get it for me.

785
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,620
Who are you looking for?

786
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:50,850
Just someone.

787
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,120
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

788
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,660
You were never interested
in what I did before.

789
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,630
You have something to do. Look.

790
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,500
- Kyung.
- Kyung.

791
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,270
That's the character
the writer gave you,

792
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,170
so do your best to hang out
with the girls today. Okay?

793
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,570
- Have fun!
- Dan Oh.

794
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,470
- Why did you come with her?
- Kyung.

795
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,610
Hey, Dan Oh!

796
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,910
Stop playing.

797
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,750
I don't want to play it either.

798
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,650
I heard this song relaxes people.

799
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,920
You think I need to relax?

800
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,290
Aren't you the one who's nervous?

801
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,760
I'm going to tell Ju Da
my feelings for her today.

802
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:38,730
What's the look on your face?

803
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,070
I thought you two were just friends.

804
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,470
How do I look?

805
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,870
Check out the look on your face
in the mirror.

806
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,560
Why weren't you in the green room?

807
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:22,710
Who is this?

808
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,950
Your face looks familiar.

809
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,320
My gosh, happy birthday to your son.

810
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,700
In the end, the scene is going
according to the storyboard.

811
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,590
Open it.

812
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:11,790
No one in the world...

813
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,730
has the same shoes.
That's the only pair.

814
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,810
Today is your birthday.

815
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,850
Your presence here...

816
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,620
is a birthday present for me.

817
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,420
There.

818
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:44,930
How beautiful.

819
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,830
The shoes look beautiful.

820
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,300
See you at the party.

821
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,850
Hello.

822
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,920
Please take good care of this.

823
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,720
My woman likes strawberries.

824
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,760
I will count on you.

825
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,160
- Okay. Please don't worry.
- Okay.

826
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,330
Mr. Oh Nam Ju specifically
ordered this birthday cake.

827
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,100
- Let's take good care of it.
- Yes, sir.

828
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,400
Hey, you. Take this.

829
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,920
Unbelievable.
Don't eat like you've starved.

830
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,860
Sae Mi, this is so good.
It tastes divine.

831
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,720
- What? Which one tastes divine?
- It's divine.

832
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,500
Kyung, you look so handsome.

833
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:00,600
You look so hot in your outfit.

834
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,440
How do I look?

835
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,080
I wore this to match your outfit.

836
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,450
Yes?

837
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:18,220
How do I look?

838
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,220
Get out of my way.

839
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:21,790
Darn it.

840
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,560
He paid no attention to you.

841
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,460
What? Go away!

842
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,700
This is all ruined.

843
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,870
Come in.

844
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:07,970
Put them over there and leave.

845
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:08,970
Hey.

846
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:14,510
Not everyone can enter this place.

847
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,450
What's going on?

848
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,010
I don't think
he's supposed to be here.

849
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,780
When did you get in?

850
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,250
- Earlier.
- Do Hwa.

851
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,320
Do you know him?

852
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,190
What's your problem?

853
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,130
Do Hwa, now.

854
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:37,700
Go to Ju Da now.

855
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,980
Hey, Do Hwa.

856
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,050
Ju Da.

857
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,210
What's all this?

858
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,650
You look so pretty today.

859
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,150
I look awkward in this, right?

860
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,290
I guess outfits can change you.

861
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,290
No.

862
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,590
You were always pretty
even without a fancy dress.

863
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,630
Ju Da.

864
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,570
I need to tell you something.

865
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,170
What is it?

866
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,040
I like you.

867
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,780
Everyone, you've been waiting
for a long time.

868
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,180
I give you...

869
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,020
the man of the hour, Oh Nam Ju.

870
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,660
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

871
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,460
- Nam Ju!
- Oh Nam Ju! Oh Nam Ju!

872
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,360
- This isn't good.
- Oh Nam Ju!

873
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,430
- What's going on?
- Nam Ju is gone.

874
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,270
Oh Nam Ju...

875
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,130
- Where's Nam Ju?
- Where is he?

876
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,540
(Yeo Ju Da)

877
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,380
Our star will always appear last.

878
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:35,050
Hey, Nam Ju is gone.

879
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,050
- What?
- What?

880
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,620
The star is always late.

881
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,990
I don't think so.
Look at Ms. Cha's face.

882
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,990
Nam Ju is going to appear
a little bit later...

883
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,690
- as he gets ready...
- Follow me.

884
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,130
to make a perfect entrance.

885
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,460
So please wait
for a little longer...

886
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,600
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

887
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,770
- What was that?
- Darn it.

888
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,240
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

889
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,310
Dan Oh, where are you going?

890
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:03,880
What is she doing?

891
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,780
- What's going on?
- I was startled.

892
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,880
What is this? What's with me?

893
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,830
This is definitely the scene
that I saw on the storyboard.

894
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,950
- What was that?
- My goodness.

895
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,720
- That was the cake.
- Oh, gosh. What will he do?

896
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,590
- He should've been more careful.
- My goodness.

897
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,900
- Oh, no.
- He ruined the cake?

898
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,530
Let me make a formal announcement.

899
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,440
Let me make a formal announcement.

900
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,640
- What about the cake?
- It's such a waste.

901
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,040
- The star isn't even here yet.
- Should we get the candles?

902
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,380
- Nam Ju isn't even here.
- I'll take care of this.

903
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,180
But the cake is ruined.

904
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,610
From now on,

905
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:15,980
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

906
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,590
- What?
- My gosh.

907
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,130
(Extra-ordinary You)
