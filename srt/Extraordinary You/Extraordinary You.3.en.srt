1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,620
This time, I won't...

3
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,510
let him go.

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,980
Hey.

5
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,660
Hi.

6
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,010
It was so hard for me to find him.

7
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,910
Why did it have to be now?

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,900
Hey, that's Dan Oh.

9
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,289
Are you ill again?

10
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,870
I guess so.

11
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,180
"I guess so"?

12
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,630
It's as if you're
talking about someone else.

13
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,240
I have no power.

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,100
I can only do
what the writer tells me to do.

15
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,240
Wait, am I listening to Korean
right now?

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Maybe.

17
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,090
Was that English? Hey.

18
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,570
Should I call Kyung?

19
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,370
I had to go to the hospital
from school...

20
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,130
in that important moment
just to talk about Kyung?

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,740
He probably won't come.

22
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,470
Of course, he won't.

23
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,710
That jerk.

24
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,270
Are you all right?

25
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,740
Yes, I'm all right.

26
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,840
Gosh, the wind. Get it away.

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,180
I don't care if he comes or not.

28
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,490
I can't think of more lines.

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,590
Lines?

30
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,490
I guess that's all we had to do.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Bye.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,030
Hey, you've been really odd lately.

33
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,240
She speaks like
she's someone else recently.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,710
What's all this talk
about a writer and lines?

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,310
She needs to make some sense.

36
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,970
Dan Oh, I think
you're in the wrong character.

37
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,520
Kyung likes someone
who's naive and pure,

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,210
not a girl who's eccentric.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,620
Bye.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,090
You took this way too far.

41
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,490
And you put your back
next to all the guys you meet too.

42
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,620
That's not cute at all.

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,720
Even if you learned to date
through books,

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,800
that's a bit too much.

45
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
What?

46
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,690
It's a bit too much.

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,170
What?

48
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,490
What is it?

49
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,460
What? What now? It's too much.

50
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,930
What did you just say?

51
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,110
Your back touch.

52
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,270
It's not that great.

53
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,740
Of course, you might start to like
someone who has a great back...

54
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,210
like me.

55
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,780
Goodness.

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,860
But do you remember me
bumping my back to you?

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,890
You said you'll find the guy...

58
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,020
who'll change your life
with his back.

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,930
Dan Oh, you're kind of dirty.

60
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,870
Why? What are you doing?

61
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,030
Shut up and follow me.

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,740
Who knows
when the scene will change?

63
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey. Hold on.
What's wrong with you?

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,740
Why... Why are you so strong?

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,900
Are you really sick?

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,920
You lied because you didn't want
to go to school, right?

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Do Hwa.

68
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,810
What... What is it?

69
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,589
My heart belongs to someone else.

70
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,860
You know who she is.

71
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,650
How should I explain this?

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,260
Are you insane?

73
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,630
You're suffering from memory loss
these days, right?

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
One blink of an eye,
and a day or a week has gone by.

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,980
You teleport to school and home.

76
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,500
Time and place are a mess.

77
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,240
How... How did you know?

78
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,290
It's because you've become aware
of yourself.

79
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Aware of myself?

80
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,560
Hey, everyone is aware
of themselves.

81
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,230
We're characters from a comic book.

82
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,820
Maybe you're sick up here
and not your heart.

83
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,600
Watch. Once the story resumes,

84
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,870
everything will fall back
into place.

85
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,110
Bye.

86
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,240
The story will start soon.

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,180
Everything will fall back
into place.

88
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,240
My gosh. Hey, Dan Oh!

89
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,659
Hey, Do Hwa.

90
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,560
- Bye.
- Am I your deliveryman?

91
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,600
Buy your own clothes.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,560
You've grown into a nagger,
haven't you?

93
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,630
I thought you only grew in height.

94
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,409
Mom is worried. She wants to know
when you'll come home.

95
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,500
Here. By the way, is Dan Oh...

96
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,909
How is this bag here?

97
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,350
Watch. Once the story resumes,

98
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,550
everything will fall back
into place.

99
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,140
Oh, right.

100
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,160
I have a question.

101
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,060
How's Dan Oh at school these days?

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,450
I thought she was improving,
but her condition isn't that great.

103
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,100
Her heart is having problems again.

104
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,260
She needs to go through
several checkups.

105
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,130
I'm worried about her.

106
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,560
Can you keep an eye on her?

107
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,910
Could you do that for me?

108
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,350
"Hi, do you remember me?"

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,920
No, there's a high chance
that he won't.

110
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,620
"Hi."

111
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,580
"Hi. Hello."

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,030
What if I run into him? Hold on.

113
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,659
I'm not a main character.

114
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,490
I'm just an extra,
so it won't matter.

115
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,690
Hey, you.

116
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,930
Were you my classmate?

117
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,330
Do you remember me?

118
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,440
You helped me when I fell
down the stairs...

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,870
and blocked the ball
when we were playing dodgeball.

120
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,860
You don't remember me, do you?

121
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,790
What? You don't even have a name.

122
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,890
Dan Oh.

123
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,300
I heard you were hospitalized.

124
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Yes.

125
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,310
I'm over here.

126
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,200
Right. Yes.

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,110
You're so out of it. No wonder
you fell down the stairs.

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,680
You can't act recklessly
when you've just been discharged.

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,180
I'm sure you played a part
in making your heart ill.

130
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Thanks for being worried about me.

131
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,530
- What is it?
- I know you like me,

132
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,790
but I'm surprised that you
interpreted...

133
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,060
what I just said like that.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,320
I know you're not worried about me,
you punk.

135
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,760
It's just a darn line of mine.

136
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,320
I wasn't worried.

137
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,740
Our families
will be having dinner soon.

138
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't want your heart condition
to ruin the dinner.

139
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,670
Take care of your health.

140
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,830
I will.

141
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,940
- Kyung, wait up!
- Me too!

142
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,370
Where are you going?

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,240
What do I lack so much that
I have to continue liking him? Gosh.

144
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
He's not here.

145
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,260
(Seuli High School Student Photos)

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,910
What? There he is.

147
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,980
Is everything just a coincidence
like what Dried Squid said?

148
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,550
At this rate, I should be
helping him,

149
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,940
not receiving any help myself.

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,060
- Let's go!
- Nam Ju!

151
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,320
Nam Ju!

152
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,430
- Let's go!
- Oh Nam Ju!

153
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,770
Oh Nam Ju! Oh Nam Ju!

154
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,640
Kyung!

155
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,050
Nam Ju, you're so amazing!

156
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,910
- Let's go!
- Kyung!

157
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Perfect!

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,610
Here!

159
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,260
- Yes!
- Oh, yes!

160
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,160
Go, Nam Ju!

161
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,760
Nam Ju!

162
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,430
My gosh! Did you see that?

163
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,760
- Did you?
- Yes.

164
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,090
Darn it.

165
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
Nam Ju!

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,910
Milky-white-skinned, Oh Nam Ju!

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,880
I love you, Oh Nam Ju!

168
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,610
Did you see Nam Ju put that ball in?

169
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,610
Yes.

170
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,520
How amazing.

171
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,760
I hate that only the main character
receives the spotlight.

172
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,080
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

173
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,820
He is the star, so it's natural
that he receives the spotlight.

174
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,060
Nam Ju looked so dazzling just now.

175
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Right.

176
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,430
Let's go!

177
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,320
- Sae Mi.
- What?

178
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,590
Do you see him?

179
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,040
Oh, my. Who is he?

180
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,360
Do you not know number 13?

181
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,730
I didn't know such a tall
and handsome guy was in our class.

182
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,410
Do you know his name?

183
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,050
Him? I know. He's...

184
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,150
What was his name again?

185
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,660
You probably don't know
since he's just an extra.

186
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,180
He's even more trivial than I am.

187
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,700
Let's go!

188
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,070
Nam Ju, let's go!

189
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,470
Nam Ju!

190
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,020
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

191
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,930
I need to hurry and look for Dan Oh.

192
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,060
But why do I want to play
the violin so badly?

193
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,380
What? What's wrong with me?

194
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,160
Do Hwa.

195
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
Is something wrong?

196
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,460
This might be out of line,

197
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,860
but if you're struggling
with anything,

198
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,220
you can always tell me.

199
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,360
I know I don't look like it,

200
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,730
but I'm a great listener.

201
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
What?

202
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,250
This is odd. This is very odd.

203
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,070
This is extremely odd.

204
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,110
Wait. I can finally speak again.

205
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,390
Hey, are you okay?

206
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,850
- There are flowers behind you.
- Flowers?

207
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,260
No, that's not important right now.

208
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,590
Ju Da, have you seen Dan Oh?

209
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,800
You seem pretty relaxed these days.

210
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,960
Did you find the guy?

211
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,540
I did, but he is a very trivial one.

212
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,230
The writer didn't even
draw him properly.

213
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,880
Look at this. He doesn't have
any facial features.

214
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,940
Oh, dear.

215
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,980
Could an even more trivial extra
be able to change your fate?

216
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,260
I told you that it was
just a pipe dream.

217
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
The storyboard didn't change.

218
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,480
Just give up and accept...

219
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,000
this world and your position.

220
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,930
Giving up is not an option.

221
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,670
I'll consider this taking a break.

222
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,900
My heart needs to rest as well.

223
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,000
I found you.

224
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,230
This sounds familiar.

225
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,330
Dan Oh!

226
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,880
Since when was it so difficult
to find our cafeteria?

227
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,100
Every time I got near,
it teleported to another place.

228
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,110
And when I located it again,
it disappeared.

229
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,310
This is much quicker...

230
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,550
than I expected.

231
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
And two characters, at that?

232
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,920
Is he also aware of himself?

233
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,320
Yes, I knew something was off.

234
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,560
I should've gone to the hospital
for my memory loss.

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,270
But I was on the rooftop,
playing the violin.

236
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,500
One moment, I'm doing fine
and chatting with my friends.

237
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,670
Then suddenly, I'm playing
the violin while crying.

238
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,960
Poor you.

239
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,170
Your character is old-style as well.

240
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,970
You seem like a cheerful person
in front of others,

241
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,970
but you are hurting deep inside.

242
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,880
How is it possible that
this is the world of comics?

243
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,050
- Everyone reacts that way at first.
- Everyone reacts that way at first.

244
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,680
Explain this to me.

245
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,920
Tell me in a way
that I may understand this.

246
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,660
What is that?

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,430
Don't be so startled.

248
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,330
This is the world of comics.

249
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,930
Fine, let's say that it is.

250
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,510
But my character is
totally lame then.

251
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm not a crybaby. No main
character would cry like that.

252
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,020
Everyone has
the same misunderstanding.

253
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,710
There's no doubt that they think of
themselves as the main character.

254
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,450
Wait, are you and I supposed
to get together?

255
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,430
No. I thought you liked Baek Kyung.

256
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,090
They cannot think for a second
that their life might exist...

257
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,450
for other people.

258
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,060
It was all a ruse.
You were faking it.

259
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,090
It's me whom you like.

260
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,200
Is that why you wanted
to see my back that day?

261
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,230
("Secret")

262
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,010
- Read this.
- What is it?

263
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,650
Reading that once is much better
than hearing about this 10 times.

264
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
It's Ju Da.

265
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,350
Ju Da...

266
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,220
Wait. No, hold on.

267
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,000
No, no.

268
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,140
We're not the main characters.

269
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,840
Nam Ju and Ju Da
are the main characters.

270
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,810
I knew it. Their names were unusual.

271
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,610
"Oh Nam Ju" and "Yeo Ju Da".
How did I miss that?

272
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,210
Right. I found it the weirdest
that Ju Da was...

273
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,030
in every moment of my life.

274
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,090
Before I realized it,
I started to like her.

275
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,720
How should I put it? It's the fate
of a supporting character.

276
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,130
I'm dreaming, right?
This has to be a dream.

277
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,140
Darn it.

278
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,310
What's that?

279
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,470
It will depend on
whose perspective you see this.

280
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,940
Do Hwa, look at the world
from your perspective,

281
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,520
then you'll be the main character.

282
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,350
I will change my predetermined fate
no matter what.

283
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,500
I don't want to stay
as an extra until the end.

284
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,880
Dan Oh.

285
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,470
How's your heart pain lately?

286
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,110
What's wrong with me?

287
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,210
What's wrong? Are you all right?

288
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,180
Nurse Kim, please escort Dan Oh out.

289
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,110
Dan Oh, it's all right.
Go to the treatment room.

290
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,350
Okay.

291
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,430
Sir, please sit down.

292
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,460
Actually, the numbers from
her last test don't look too good.

293
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,430
We're monitoring
what's called, BMP numbers.

294
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,250
When her heart is overworking,
the numbers go up.

295
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,750
It means that there's
a lot of damage to her heart.

296
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,810
I think you need
to prepare yourself.

297
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,810
Dan Oh takes after you a lot.

298
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,910
Her looks and personality too.

299
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,450
You two like
and hate the same things.

300
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,050
Remember how long
you chased me because you liked me?

301
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,310
Goodness.

302
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,230
I have never seen a woman
proposing to a guy with flowers.

303
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,890
Dan Oh takes after
that part of you too.

304
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,000
She's been chasing after Kyung too.

305
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Honey.

306
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,480
What am I going to do about Dan Oh?
My heart breaks for her.

307
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,510
Can you help her live, honey?

308
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,520
Dan Oh doesn't have much time left.

309
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,990
There's not much the doctor
at the hospital can do for her.

310
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,630
Fine. That's been my set-up.

311
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,550
I've had a weak heart
and been in pain the whole time.

312
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,070
I'm okay. I'll be okay.

313
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,350
Nothing changes in this world.

314
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,380
Never.

315
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,090
If I change the stage,

316
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,270
everything will change too.
It's okay. I can do it.

317
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,300
I can do it.

318
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,370
Even if I wanted to change it,
I can't ever meet him.

319
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,520
What good is it
if I know how he looks?

320
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,880
I can't believe
no one crossed paths with him.

321
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Where will we have our camp
this year?

322
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,490
Two years ago, we went to Egypt.
And last year, Switzerland.

323
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,350
I want it to be Manhattan, New York.

324
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,660
How should I put it?
That city suits...

325
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,970
It perfectly suits
the honorable side of me.

326
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,040
Why are you laughing?
Women go crazy for that.

327
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,210
I think you're way too chatty.
That's your problem.

328
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,510
Get your hands off me.

329
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,810
- That's your problem.
- Hey.

330
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,980
- That's Number 13.
- Several women like me, you know.

331
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,780
There are several, yes.

332
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,280
Right? So you're falling
for my charms too.

333
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,050
You probably don't have several
women. You have none!

334
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,140
You have zero women. Clear.

335
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
Is that a new technique?

336
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,260
Not being aware of yourself
could make us happier.

337
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,130
Why is she working so hard at it?

338
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,600
What?

339
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,150
I didn't know
she could look like that.

340
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,030
Why is he going all gooey
after her right next to me now?

341
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,530
She's cute.

342
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,920
Are you serious with that line?
I hate it.

343
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,890
Wait, I can move.

344
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,130
Come on, I can't see anything.

345
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,940
Go away.

346
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,980
What are you doing?

347
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,170
You're the other guy
in the love triangle,

348
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,950
but you look completely free.

349
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,250
Because I'm the other guy.

350
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,050
My role is to follow
after the main character.

351
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,580
You adjusted pretty fast.

352
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,810
Is that so?

353
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,120
- That's him, right?
- What?

354
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,260
The back you're looking for.

355
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,500
What's his name?

356
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,590
- He doesn't have one.
- What?

357
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,470
He's not on the character list.
And he's not drawn in full either.

358
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,240
I can't even look for him
in the comic book.

359
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,310
Look how handsome he is. It makes
no sense that he's an extra.

360
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,720
She's driving me crazy. Why...

361
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,980
Why is she so cute?

362
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,610
She's so cute.

363
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,410
- Don't mind him.
- I feel nauseous.

364
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,300
Hey, what is it? Why are we hiding?

365
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,960
You're right. It's not like
I did anything wrong.

366
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,090
Gosh, you go crazy
when it comes to handsome men.

367
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,160
That's not true.

368
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,590
It was because I was hoping that
he might be able to change my fate.

369
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,210
You said he was an extra
without a name.

370
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,480
He can change your fate?

371
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,950
Hey, Ju Da. Let me help you.

372
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,290
Pick it up.

373
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,080
No, you pick it up yourself.

374
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,670
Right. This is weird!

375
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,480
Why do I see Number 13
on the storyboard?

376
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,050
He's a nameless extra.

377
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,880
I must check one more time...

378
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,760
if Number 13 holds the key
in changing my fate or not.

379
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,310
I knew it.

380
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,760
There's no way the writer
would give me the answer key.

381
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,800
However, I'm good at games
even without the answer keys.

382
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,700
Follow me.

383
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,070
Number 13.

384
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,900
You might not remember this later,
but listen up.

385
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,070
I have a heart that might stop
at any time...

386
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,570
and had my crush for 10 years.

387
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,340
Don't you get sick of me already
just by listening to this?

388
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,910
But that's my set-up.

389
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,650
But I think I might be able
to change my fate if you help me.

390
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,920
Later, Ju Da and I will be moving
these boxes to the science lab.

391
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,470
The story is that I will knock
over the boxes because of Nam Ju.

392
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,630
Am I their love bridge or something?

393
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,360
Everything I do is
used for the main characters.

394
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,240
I don't want to do that anymore.

395
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,280
So stay between the crowd
and wait for the right moment.

396
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,450
Then hold onto the boxes
so that they don't fall over.

397
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,570
If I keep changing the story,

398
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,580
I'll be able to make a future
that I want to live.

399
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,810
If this plan succeeds,

400
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,990
I'll take responsibility
and make you more than an extra.

401
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,290
Do you get it? Okay?

402
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,030
Why would you never answer me?

403
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,890
"Okay, I'll help you."

404
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,160
"Let's change our fate together."

405
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,940
Can't you say that to me? Please?

406
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,600
I have no idea what's on your mind.

407
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,810
I mean, open your mouth like this
and say, "Yes, okay."

408
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,050
Is that so difficult?

409
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,640
Like this. Open your lips.

410
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,160
Hey.

411
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,160
Dan Oh, focus. This is important.
It's an important moment.

412
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,240
- When is Do Hwa coming?
- Kyung is here.

413
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
He's here.

414
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,220
Ju Da. Let me help you.

415
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,620
I can manage.

416
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,500
Thank you, Dan Oh.

417
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,390
Add dry ice in there.

418
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,160
Is this enough?

419
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,940
Okay, nice position.

420
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,370
Great job, Number 13.

421
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,070
What is this?

422
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,870
- What is it?
- Hey, Dan Oh.

423
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,790
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,790
- Pick it up.
- Okay.

425
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,790
No, you pick it up yourself.

426
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,730
No way.

427
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,030
What did you just say?

428
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,560
Do people at our school
always have to do as you say?

429
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,390
Dan Oh was trying to help me.

430
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,540
Really? But didn't I tell you
that you're pretty arrogant?

431
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,810
The one who's arrogant is...

432
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,950
you.

433
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,610
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

434
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,380
- What did she say?
- Seriously?

435
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,950
It was a success.

436
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,190
What?

437
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,390
If you were trying to
get my attention, you succeeded.

438
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,660
Good, at this rate...

439
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,250
- Did it get on her skin?
- My gosh.

440
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,340
Hey... Hey, are you okay?

441
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,310
- What happened?
- What was that?

442
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,810
Look away!

443
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,860
I didn't exactly drop these,

444
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,630
but can I say the story changed,

445
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,600
or did it not change?

446
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,800
What should I wear for this camp?

447
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,500
- Anything.
- Which type will Nam Ju like?

448
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,740
- Exactly.
- Maybe a chiffon dress?

449
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,870
- A sexy off-shoulder...
- No.

450
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,680
- Dan Oh, let's go in there.
- Wait...

451
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,740
- Come here.
- I...

452
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,280
These are so pretty.

453
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,920
This color is perfect
for my cool-toned skin.

454
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,380
Dan Oh, this is mine.

455
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,420
Dan Oh.

456
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,450
Doesn't this remind you of Nam Ju?

457
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Right.

458
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,260
Recently, Nam Ju got
a new keyring on his bag.

459
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,230
I'll make a surprise gift for him.

460
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,460
Goodness.

461
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,330
Is that for Kyung?

462
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,330
Kyung is such a lucky guy.

463
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,000
There's no woman who is
as faithful as Dan Oh.

464
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,100
Right?

465
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,170
Faithful?

466
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,180
Gosh, I hope Nam Ju loves it.

467
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,950
Sure.

468
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,290
This scene is awfully long.

469
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,350
Do I still have to do something?

470
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,090
Isn't that Yeo Ju Da?

471
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,560
What are you doing? Come on.

472
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,030
My gosh, no way.

473
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,370
Is she working a part-time job?

474
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,040
My role in this scene was...

475
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,380
to see Ju Da working
her part-time job.

476
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,250
Just bring it, will you?

477
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,680
Stop making excuses.

478
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,220
Sir, that sandwich is
rather popular,

479
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,820
so we don't have any in stock today.

480
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,250
If you come back tomorrow...

481
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,490
If you don't have any,

482
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,060
make some, and bring them to me.

483
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,630
The customer is the king.
Don't you know that?

484
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,790
Forget it.

485
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,200
Where's the owner?

486
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,560
Tell the owner to come out.

487
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,700
Oh, then how about
some cheese sandwich?

488
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,030
That's pretty popular too.

489
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,500
Cheese sandwich?

490
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,170
How dare you?
Don't look at me like that...

491
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,280
- That's enough.
- What is this?

492
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,140
Are you the owner here?

493
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,910
Are you okay?

494
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
Thank you, Do Hwa.

495
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,550
If it hadn't been for you...

496
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,820
Why do you always
let people do that to you?

497
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,920
Think about what happened today.

498
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,720
Why didn't you report him...

499
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,590
or run out and scream for help?

500
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,300
And why did you carry
the tools for our experiment?

501
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,530
That's why you hurt your hand.

502
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,440
Thanks for your concern,

503
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,200
but I'm fine.

504
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,670
You're the only one for me.

505
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,540
My guardian angel is you,

506
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,640
Lee Do Hwa.

507
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,780
Gosh, is this what Dan Oh said
about those lines?

508
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,580
It's so cheesy.

509
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,390
You look the most gorgeous
when you smile.

510
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,560
I'm not sure if that was planned...

511
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,490
or if I really meant that.

512
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,930
Thanks for your help today.
I'll go inside.

513
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,930
Ju Da.

514
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,340
Hey, Nam Ju.

515
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,510
Is your hand all right?

516
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,280
Do Hwa, why are you here?

517
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,080
I had to do something to help Ju Da
with my handsome face...

518
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,010
and slender body.

519
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,620
You owe me one.

520
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,550
Bye.

521
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,540
Dan Oh, do you want to
go with me today?

522
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,600
Sure, I'm all for it.

523
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,770
Dan Oh.

524
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,380
Do you want to quit school
and travel the world with me?

525
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,050
Dad, do you know
what I wanted to do the most...

526
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,220
when I was in the hospital?

527
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,890
Going to school.

528
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,460
Going to school, going to class,

529
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,320
and making friends
just like everyone else.

530
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,630
While we're on the subject,

531
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,360
I really want to go
to this summer camp.

532
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,630
I've never even been
on a field trip before. Please?

533
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,400
- Summer camp?
- Yes.

534
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,300
May I please go this once?

535
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,510
Okay, you may.

536
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,840
Really? All right!

537
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,110
But even if
you give me your permission,

538
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,780
it's no use if the writer
doesn't decide to draw me.

539
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,980
- What?
- What?

540
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,690
No, nothing. Thank you, Dad.

541
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,060
You're the best.

542
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,990
- Come on.
- Why?

543
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,700
I thought it was going to be Paris.

544
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,760
What? We're going somewhere
domestic for the summer camp?

545
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,000
Man, I just renewed my passport.

546
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm sure Nam Ju had a good reason.

547
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,700
Oh Nam Ju?

548
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,240
Nam Ju insisted that
we have to go somewhere in Korea...

549
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,570
for this year's summer camp
to the principal.

550
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,640
He said he'll pay for all the cost.

551
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,780
Isn't he so generous?

552
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,710
Really? Nam Ju said that?
He's so amazing.

553
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,210
I still wanted to travel abroad.

554
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,480
Nam Ju is the best.

555
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,620
"Nam Ju is the best. He's the best."

556
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,090
Are you mimicking me again?

557
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,750
Are you making fun of me again?

558
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,190
My dear Dan Oh,
you're working hard as an extra.

559
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,560
You're completely in your character.

560
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,430
I thought you were going to
try to change your destiny.

561
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
I did.

562
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,700
You chanted it all the time.

563
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,200
But nothing's going my way.

564
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't know when my heart
will stop beating either.

565
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,670
If you can see the future,
why can't you control it?

566
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,710
I can see it, but I can't change it.

567
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,110
If I had such power,
I could've been less humiliated.

568
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,550
What? Did something happen
between you and Ju Da yesterday?

569
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,950
I set the situation...

570
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,850
and left the scene
at the right time...

571
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,960
just like an extra would.

572
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,420
And that's the result of my deed.

573
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,590
(This year's summer camp
will be free.)

574
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,690
The entire school needs
to help the main characters...

575
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,900
with their love story, right?

576
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,330
Sure thing. They are the bosses.

577
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,110
I thought you were always
in the cafeteria.

578
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,680
Don't you know that
I pretty much live in the library?

579
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,850
You talk as if
you're a student here.

580
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,650
You see, this book keeps returning
to its original place.

581
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,720
Right, how's Do Hwa doing?

582
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,190
He seems to be doing all right.

583
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,090
He adapted fairly quickly.

584
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,420
I'm the one who's struggling.

585
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,060
But haven't you been
extremely confident lately?

586
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,760
I was before I overheard
the chat at the hospital.

587
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,940
(Nurse Kim, please escort
Dan Oh out.)

588
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,409
(I think you need
to prepare yourself.)

589
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,810
I guess you know as well that
I don't have much time left.

590
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,790
Don't give me that look.
I'm going to change my fate.

591
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,929
He was never around
when I looked for him.

592
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,060
Who are you talking about?

593
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,670
It's the guy I mentioned last time.

594
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,770
The key to changing my fate.

595
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,739
So? Did it change?

596
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,370
I guess not.

597
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,710
Who knows?

598
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,139
It's not that easy, you know?

599
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,080
Anyway, I'll be going now.

600
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,680
I should at least try.

601
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,130
Number 13!

602
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
Hey!

603
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,850
Once the page flips,
I'll be good as new.

604
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,880
Number 13!

605
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,420
Number 13!

606
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,090
Are you injured? I know my way
around the nurse's office.

607
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,390
I'll find it for you.

608
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm relieved that it's not serious.

609
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,810
But then again, we're mere extras,

610
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,850
so we'll be all healed up
by the next scene.

611
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,410
It would be wonderful
if you could change my fate...

612
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,010
with that handsome face of yours.

613
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,250
Number 13.

614
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,550
You better remember me next time.

615
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,090
My name is Eun Dan Oh.

616
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,960
Eun Dan Oh.

617
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,600
- He's going.
- He is.

618
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,970
- We're going too.
- Darn it.

619
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,810
(List of Summer Camp Attendees)

620
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,840
(Yeo Ju Da, Oh Nam Ju,
Shin Sae Mi, Eun Dan Oh, Baek Kyung)

621
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,180
(Kim Ae Il, Kim Yang Il,
Ahn Su Chul, Park Yang Yi)

622
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,020
Are those who are not up there
forbidden to attend?

623
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,990
Su Chul is going as well.

624
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,020
Hey.

625
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,530
My gosh.

626
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,730
Hey.

627
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,260
Just like his wound,

628
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,130
I'm sure he's forgotten everything.

629
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,000
It hurts to know
that I'm forgotten every time.

630
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,040
Hi, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

631
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,720
Number 13 lacks in many ways.

632
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,680
He doesn't even have a name
to begin with.

633
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,820
This is great.

634
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,030
Wait! Number 13.

635
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,030
Hi, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

636
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,770
Can you help me take these books
to the library?

637
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,300
I'll carry this one.

638
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,940
It's over there.

639
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,710
I'm Eun Dan Oh, number 7.
I'm a junior in Class 7.

640
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,640
- Stop it. I'm sweating.
- Darn it.

641
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,910
- Endure it.
- Let's speed up.

642
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,910
I don't want to.

643
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,680
Gosh.

644
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,380
Hi, do you remember me?

645
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,620
My name is Eun Dan Oh.

646
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,370
That means that she was wishful.

647
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,380
In that sense, becoming a flower...

648
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,050
means that their relationship
was fulfilled.

649
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,550
Do you get it?

650
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,850
- Yes.
- Yes.

651
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,590
Nothing's changed,

652
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,920
and he doesn't seem
to remember me either.

653
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,430
So would it be weird of me
to feel like...

654
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,900
something is gradually changing?

655
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,750
Chairman Eun suddenly postponed
the investment.

656
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,690
Darn it!

657
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,830
Haven't I told you numerous times
to take care of Dan Oh?

658
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,360
I am.

659
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,630
If you are, then why haven't you
visited her at the hospital?

660
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,840
She must've told her father
about how disappointed she was.

661
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,770
Don't you know how much
he cherishes her?

662
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,910
It would not be an exaggeration
to say...

663
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,550
that the fate of my business lies
in her hands.

664
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,520
How many times do I need
to repeat myself?

665
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,950
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sick of your apologies!

666
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,370
You're useless.

667
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Let's go.

668
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,520
No way. I'm really here.

669
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,490
Dan Oh!

670
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,890
What should I do?
I left my red dress at home.

671
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,760
I wish we were strangers.

672
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,690
Are you emigrating?
What is all this?

673
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,400
Are you not doing
a live broadcast today?

674
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,570
You should upload videos of me.

675
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,800
I prepared these for our class.

676
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,840
What's up with that Polaroid camera?

677
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,300
Show me some interest, will you?

678
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,210
I'll be the photographer in charge.

679
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,780
Is that so? Forget about that.

680
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,510
These are more expensive
than your camera,

681
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,080
so do take good care of them.

682
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,250
Let's go.

683
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,750
Why should I?

684
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,120
It feels like a dream
to be traveling with you.

685
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,720
Me too. I'm loving it.

686
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,890
I was never allowed to attend these
due to my heart condition.

687
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,890
I'm sure I'll be busy
acting as the love bridge.

688
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,690
But I still love it.

689
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,660
- You must be loving this!
- I do!

690
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,070
What do you love? What is it?

691
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,140
Everyone gets one!
Let's eat a sandwich!

692
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,910
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

693
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,810
Let's go.

694
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,150
We're here!

695
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,220
- We're here!
- We're here!

696
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,350
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

697
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,200
Nam Ju said hi, didn't he?

698
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,270
- He's the only one I love.
- Sae Mi.

699
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,930
I'm not Sae Mi.

700
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,470
Come here. Try this.
Everyone, come have some.

701
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,140
Goodness.

702
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,240
Forget it, I don't eat
these kinds of foods.

703
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,740
Don't act all posh.
Just have one bite.

704
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,110
No, thanks.

705
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,980
I only eat the organic dishes
that my chef...

706
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,450
makes.

707
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,590
See? Isn't it good?

708
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,090
I'm only eating it
because he wants me to.

709
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,990
I knew you'd like it. Dig in, guys.

710
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,230
This is good.

711
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,930
Dig in.

712
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,030
- Pay me just 13 dollars.
- This is so good.

713
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,770
- Isn't it good?
- Who's the chef?

714
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,770
The lady over there.

715
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,430
- It's good.
- I know.

716
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,820
Dan Oh, stop. Stop.

717
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,880
You'd better stop.

718
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,760
What are you doing?

719
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,820
I see. This is it.

720
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,490
This is why I came to the camp.

721
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,100
Gosh, just take it and get lost.

722
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,060
It's a gift.

723
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,510
Do you expect me
to carry something like this?

724
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Well...

725
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,180
Don't buy me garbage like this.

726
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,320
- Kyung.
- Kyung.

727
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,930
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

728
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,090
Hey, Dan Oh. Don't cry.

729
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,460
There are other fish in the sea.

730
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,900
- There are other guys out there.
- Don't cry.

731
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
What's wrong with you?

732
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,800
- My goodness.
- Don't let this shock you.

733
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,510
- I'm okay.
- Look at her.

734
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,180
Don't mind me. Just have fun.

735
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,910
I guess she lost her mind
or something.

736
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,650
- Good luck.
- Okay.

737
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,210
- Good luck to me!
- Good luck.

738
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,990
What do they sell at the snack bar?

739
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,990
Hey.

740
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,620
- Give that to me.
- Hey.

741
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,630
- Come on.
- What do I do?

742
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,060
Oh, no.

743
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,800
Your eyes are red.

744
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Are you all right?

745
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,770
I can't believe this writer.

746
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,200
You're using me to show
how kind Ju Da is?

747
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,410
My grandma often gets sick,

748
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,310
so I'm pretty good at folk remedies.

749
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,210
If you have a weak heart,

750
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,880
you need to have
good blood circulation.

751
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
Give me your hand.

752
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,690
Hey, Ju Da.

753
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
Here.

754
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,520
What's this?

755
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,430
That's... What was that called?

756
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,600
It's something with sausages.

757
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,830
It's sausage with rice cake.

758
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Why are you giving this to me?

759
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,940
It's good, so I want you to have it.

760
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,400
No, if you won't eat it,
I'll throw it out. Give me.

761
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Gosh.

762
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,040
Give it to me. Give me that.

763
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,510
- I got this because I want this.
- Wait.

764
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,410
I'll share this with Ju Da.

765
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,710
Don't worry.

766
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,580
Thank you, Dan Oh.

767
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,150
If I didn't have scenes like this,

768
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,320
I wouldn't have been able to come
to the camp like Number 13.

769
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,660
My life exists
for the main characters.

770
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,430
Checking the microphone.

771
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,830
1, 2, 3. Let's get started.

772
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,930
Ladies and gentlemen.

773
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,070
I welcome you...

774
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,900
to our camp.

775
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,180
Dan Oh, come on out.

776
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,560
I really like school trips,
but I really hate that.

777
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,910
You're pretty good.

778
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,370
Let's keep dancing.

779
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,820
- Look.
- It's the ocean.

780
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

781
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,690
He's really not here.

782
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,990
Darn it.

783
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,120
Dan Oh, you're scaring me.

784
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,230
Hey.

785
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,730
- Are you all right?
- What?

786
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,660
I'm talking about
the incident with you and Kyung.

787
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,400
I don't care. I was on the stage.

788
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,940
Even so, I would've gotten hurt.

789
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,270
My friend, if you get hurt
by every tiny thing,

790
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,910
you won't be able to survive
in this cruel world of comics.

791
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,210
Enough about that.
Have you seen Number 13?

792
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,380
- Your back?
- Yes.

793
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,610
Of course, he didn't make it here.

794
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:08,980
He wasn't on the list.

795
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,920
Gosh, that's so cruel.

796
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,420
So a nameless extra isn't...

797
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,890
even allowed to come
to this summer camp?

798
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,350
That piece of...

799
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,260
Why not? No one but us
will remember what I said.

800
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,490
- This is so unfair.
- I know that. I know that well.

801
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,330
Gosh, you're like
a completely different person.

802
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,360
This is scary.

803
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,530
I'm so happy for you
that you're not.

804
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,530
Well,

805
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,170
- it's not always a good thing.
- Piece of trash. I should...

806
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,500
- Hey, everyone is watching.
- skin you and eat your eyeballs.

807
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,410
You little... Come on,
let me curse out the writer.

808
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,610
Be quiet.

809
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:36,740
I could just...

810
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,010
Where is he?

811
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,910
He's really not here.

812
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,450
The weather is great.

813
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,220
What's that?

814
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,720
Gosh, you didn't buy this?

815
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,820
No.

816
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,460
They come in different sizes
and shapes,

817
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,520
but it all has the same effect.

818
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,490
Please do us the honor.

819
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,860
She's leaving. Ae Ri.

820
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,600
- Ae Ri.
- Split it with me.

821
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,870
If two people face each other
and break the stone,

822
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,130
you're left with a piece that shows
how much you like each other.

823
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,070
Isn't that so romantic?

824
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,770
So it's just a stone.

825
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,170
That's not all.

826
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,340
If you make a wish to the stone
and make a tower with them,

827
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,750
that wish comes true.

828
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,750
Here.

829
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,390
I will root for you
and your love for Kyung.

830
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
- I don't need this.
- Who knows?

831
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,930
Your wish might come true.

832
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,930
Happy?

833
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,970
That's Dan Oh.

834
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,310
Number 13...

835
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,180
is here.

836
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,380
What's wrong?

837
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:53,690
Hey, Do Hwa.

838
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,120
Have you seen Kyung?

839
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Kyung?

840
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,160
Is that a line?

841
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,430
Tell Kyung that I'm looking for him
if you see him.

842
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,900
I think this time, I'll really be
able to change my fate.

843
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,030
- Sae Mi.
- What?

844
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,030
Give me that.

845
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,970
Hey, you said you didn't want it.

846
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,070
- It's Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju!

847
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,780
- Nam Ju!
- Goodness.

848
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,550
- Nam Ju.
- Do you want it?

849
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,120
- Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju, I'll buy it for you.

850
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,850
- Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

851
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:27,850
- Ring this up, please.
- Ring this up, please.

852
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,290
Do Hwa?

853
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,960
Why are you buying this?

854
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,100
What about you?

855
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,760
Must I report to you
about everything?

856
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,500
You don't need to,

857
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,040
and I don't need to either.

858
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140
Here.

859
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,310
- Do Hwa.
- Hey, you're here.

860
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,310
What is it?

861
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,420
It's nothing big.

862
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,990
Do you know what this is?

863
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,320
- That's...
- Relationship Stone.

864
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:02,860
Give me your hand.

865
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,760
Break this with me.

866
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,070
Hey, Number 13!

867
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,050
When did you get here? How? Why?

868
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,180
No, that's not important.

869
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,420
Heart disease and 10-year-crush
are my set-ups.

870
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,690
If we change the story,

871
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,650
we can be more than extras.

872
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,760
Later, I'm going to be
in the water over there.

873
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,490
Whether you grab my arm or trip me,

874
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,290
you should stop me
by any means necessary.

875
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,530
Okay? Yes?

876
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,840
"Okay. I got it.
Let's change our fate together."

877
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,040
Yes, yes. I feel exactly
the same way with you.

878
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,370
Let's do this together.

879
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,050
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

880
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,080
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

881
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,750
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

882
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:10,190
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

883
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,030
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

884
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,960
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

885
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,530
Why are you here, Kyung?

886
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,730
Dan Oh was looking for you.

887
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,840
I don't care.

888
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,300
I'll step out for a bit.

889
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,610
Okay.

890
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,510
- Do Hwa.
- Yes?

891
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,180
I've been meaning to ask you this.

892
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,550
Do you like Ju Da?

893
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,950
What are you talking about?

894
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,090
She's just a friend.

895
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,930
I'm spitting out words
that I don't even mean.

896
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,160
But why is she smiling like that
in front of you?

897
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,700
I wonder if there are girls...

898
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,200
who would not smile
in front of me.

899
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,500
These are the lines
Dan Oh told me about.

900
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,410
Do Hwa.

901
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,180
You know me, don't you?

902
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,110
I move according to how the story
is fixed in the comic book.

903
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,710
I can't stand it
when other people touch my things.

904
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,580
That's my fate.

905
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,450
No exception
even if you're my friend.

906
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,950
Stay away from her.

907
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,460
If you're sick,
you should just stay at home.

908
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,360
Why did you come to the camp?
It's annoying me.

909
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,330
Figures. This is your hobby.
Tormenting me.

910
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,910
Happy?

911
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,650
I'm...

912
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,880
really happy.

913
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,850
This stone is supposed to break
as much as you like the other one.

914
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,490
See? You have the bigger piece.

915
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,900
What are you doing?

916
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,370
I don't have any wishes,
and your wish is too obvious.

917
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,440
Stop wasting your time.

918
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,330
Okay, am I going to drown now?

919
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,630
Where's Number 13?

920
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,730
It's now. Yes, right now.

921
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,140
- Isn't that Dan Oh?
- You have to hold me back now.

922
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,370
- That's Dan Oh.
- What is she going to do?

923
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,090
What? What is this?
It's just like the storyboard.

924
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,620
Why is he just standing there?
Hey, Number 13!

925
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,530
Hey, wait. I'm going in now. I'm in.

926
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,760
- What's with her?
- What is she doing?

927
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,730
- Go get her.
- What is she going to do?

928
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,370
Stop her! Dan Oh!

929
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,100
The water is up to my knees now.

930
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,400
I don't want to live my life
as it was planned.

931
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,370
Please save me.

932
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,580
Save me. Save me, Number 13.

933
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,150
It didn't change. I can't do it.

934
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,280
I can't.

935
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,350
After all,

936
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,920
I can't change anything.

937
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,630
What was that? What's with her?

938
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,130
Come on out.

939
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,540
I thought it could change.

940
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,930
Hey.

941
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,670
Man, mine is much bigger.

942
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,570
This is kind of awful.

943
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,470
Give it back to me. Give it back.

944
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,850
I'll think about it
if you follow my lead.

945
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,850
(Please make Baek Kyung like me.)

946
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,650
I'm going to make it happen.

947
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,160
We did it. Look.

948
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:23,330
We did it.

949
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,400
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

950
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,670
What did you wish for?

951
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,480
It's a secret.

952
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,390
(Please make Baek Kyung like me.)

953
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,970
I think you need...

954
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,140
to prepare yourself.

955
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,280
Can you help her live, honey?

956
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,110
Dan Oh doesn't have much time left.

957
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,330
Nothing changes in this world.

958
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,130
Never.

959
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
Stop it.

960
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,960
It'll fall down anyway.

961
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,460
A tower like this...

962
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,230
can't make my wish come true.

963
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,740
I thought it was you.

964
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,680
I thought you could
help me change this.

965
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:36,620
I was wrong.

966
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:22,870
(I want to live.)

967
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,350
("Secret")

968
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,790
Eun Dan Oh.
