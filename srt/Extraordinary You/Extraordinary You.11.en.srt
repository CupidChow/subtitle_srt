1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,070
I miss you.

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,910
I do.

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,110
I miss you, Haru.

5
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,120
Haru...

6
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,040
Dan Oh.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,610
Haru.

8
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,500
I missed you.

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
I like you.

10
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,140
What?

11
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,250
I like you, Dan Oh.

12
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,830
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,350
Wasn't it difficult to come
all the way here?

14
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,990
No, it must've been harder
for you...

15
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,360
since you had to wait for me.

16
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,660
I told you...

17
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,660
that I wasn't going anywhere.

18
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,500
And no matter where you were,

19
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,110
that I'd find you.

20
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,750
I wish time would stop.

21
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,120
I wish the next stage...

22
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,590
wouldn't come.

23
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,900
(Eun Dan Oh)

24
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,830
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

25
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,310
(Dan Oh, where are you?)

26
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,650
(Dan Oh, where are you?)

27
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,730
Let go of me. I have to go.

28
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,290
Where are you going
in this condition?

29
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,530
To see Haru.

30
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,600
Dan Oh.

31
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,030
Kyung.

32
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm ready to take my medicine.

33
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,170
Okay.

34
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,210
Bibbidi bobbidi boo.

35
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,450
I'm done.

36
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,590
What is this?

37
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,090
This?

38
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,660
My mom said all flowers
have meanings.

39
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,400
Here.

40
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,770
What do these flowers mean?

41
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,600
"Dan Oh is stupid."

42
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,350
(Light pink roses mean,
"Only you know how I feel.")

43
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,659
(Light pink roses mean,
"Only you know how I feel.")

44
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,050
Dan Oh.

45
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,350
Get up.

46
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,280
- Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh!

47
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,850
It's been ages
since I've seen you at school!

48
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,790
I've missed you.

49
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,960
Hold on. You look better.

50
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I do?

51
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,800
Seeing how your cheeks are rosy,

52
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,270
our hospital visit
helped you recover!

53
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,600
You're right!

54
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,870
What would you have done
without us?

55
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,200
Thanks, guys.

56
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,210
Don't you ever get sick again, okay?

57
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,470
- Don't be sick!
- Back off.

58
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,910
This isn't your time to join us.
Let's go.

59
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,410
Don't be sick.

60
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,150
I have so many viewers!

61
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,220
- Let me see.
- Here.

62
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,020
Catch up.

63
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,790
Dan Oh.

64
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,530
Haru.

65
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,200
Good morning.

66
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,320
Let's go inside.

67
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,130
Dan Oh.

68
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,290
Why can't I get you out of my mind?

69
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,900
That's ridiculous.

70
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,770
How could I like her?

71
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,910
She bothers me.

72
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Dr. Lee told me...

73
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,640
that holding hands is good
for blood circulation.

74
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,910
It's good for your heart, your eyes,
and will make you smarter.

75
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,440
That's why I held your...

76
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
That's not why.

77
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,510
I just like it.

78
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,350
Come on, now.

79
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,620
- You're so straightforward.
- Haru. Dan Oh.

80
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,020
- Hello, Do Hwa.
- What's going on between you two?

81
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,620
What? What do you mean?

82
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,290
Count me in too.

83
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,560
Don't have fun without me.

84
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,430
- Wait.
- What?

85
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,300
I want the two of us to be alone.

86
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,640
- You...
- Well...

87
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Right. With me,
it's just the two of us.

88
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,140
And if you join us,
it would be the three of us.

89
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,780
Haru sometimes gets
his numbers wrong.

90
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,680
Right. There are more things
he doesn't know than just numbers.

91
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,380
Take this.

92
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,820
("A Rose for You")

93
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,380
I got this just for you.

94
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,650
You should study
how to win over girls.

95
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,690
That way, your love can blossom.

96
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,030
Shall I...

97
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,760
study?

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

99
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,400
Are you all right? Oh, no.

100
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,940
Hey, you two...

101
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,410
Okay. Bye, Do Hwa.

102
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,710
- Bye.
- Let's hurry.

103
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
When did that happen?

104
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,750
Thank you.

105
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Hey.

106
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,750
What just happened?

107
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,390
It stings.

108
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,010
Why did Do Hwa bring a romance
comic book out of nowhere?

109
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,550
No way.

110
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,020
There's no way Do Hwa figured out
what's going on between us, right?

111
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,160
No way.

112
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,190
That cannot be.
He wouldn't have noticed it.

113
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,890
Dan Oh, you didn't make
it obvious, right?

114
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,430
I probably didn't. I didn't.

115
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,530
It's all right.

116
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,740
Dan Oh, you must be going crazy.

117
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,440
How could you think about Haru
all day long?

118
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,740
- Don't make that face.
- For goodness' sake.

119
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,610
Who was that?

120
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,150
Don't make that face in front of me.

121
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,290
There you go again.
You want to pick a fight with me.

122
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,030
I thought it was odd that
you were being nice to me lately.

123
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,330
- It's odd?
- Yes, totally.

124
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,530
You were right.

125
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,530
Haru can change the stage
however he wants.

126
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,940
So you like anyone
who can change the stage?

127
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,040
Yes, that's right.
It started that way at first.

128
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,510
When I was with Haru,
the stage changed.

129
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,250
I wanted to change
my character's terminal disease.

130
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
So what then?

131
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,750
What will you do
after you change it?

132
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,180
It doesn't change the fact
that both of you are...

133
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,050
What? We are just extras?

134
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,690
Yes. That's true too.

135
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,690
I'm still an extra
and have the same set-up.

136
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,930
But I don't care now.

137
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,900
Now, Haru is special to me.

138
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,400
Remember what I told you? I'm
the classmate of Nam Ju and Ju Da,

139
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,800
your fiancee,
and an extra in "Secret".

140
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,540
Before all that, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

141
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,010
When I'm with Haru, I become myself.

142
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,240
He makes me the main character
every moment I'm with him.

143
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,580
I don't care what kind of role
I play in this world.

144
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,910
Haru and I are happy enough
outside of the stage.

145
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
- Hey, what's happening?
- What are they doing?

146
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
He blew a kiss with his hand.
What's wrong with him?

147
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,570
- Just go.
- My gosh, what are they doing?

148
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,510
- What's he doing?
- What?

149
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,640
I've never met a woman like you.

150
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,510
Really? Never?

151
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,410
Well, yes.

152
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,820
- Should I take responsibility?
- Responsibility?

153
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,820
My mom told me not to do things
that make me responsible for.

154
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
She told me to be careful
about everything.

155
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,260
Fine. I'll take responsibility.

156
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,660
Everyone, I'll take care
of him forever!

157
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,130
Hey, it's Nam Ju.

158
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,830
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

159
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,630
What was that?

160
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,900
He looks so handsome.

161
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,430
- Nam Ju's magic.
- Magic.

162
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,070
You said you'd take responsibility.

163
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,370
Look at this.

164
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,210
Hey, I'll tell you what.

165
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,010
- Come on.
- Look at his face.

166
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,280
- You keep doing that.
- Stop it.

167
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,010
Hey, I got into a fight
with guys from Class Two.

168
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm sure you are aware of...

169
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,320
how important this is.

170
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,120
Even if you're just a shell, go.

171
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,190
Hold on.

172
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,430
I'm telling you.
I really did that yesterday.

173
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,700
You're laughing?
Is this funny to you?

174
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,170
- Your buttons are coming off.
- That's not important.

175
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,240
- It's important.
- No, it's not.

176
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,400
- It's important.
- Just stop it.

177
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,770
- Hey.
- It's important.

178
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,770
Hey, will you just go home today?

179
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,680
- Everyone, get out.
- What?

180
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,650
I just want to be alone with Ju Da.

181
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,910
Get out, everyone.

182
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,520
What is it?

183
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,160
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

184
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,490
Ju Da, let's talk.

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,160
I have nothing to talk about.

186
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,570
Don't just avoid me.
Let's just talk.

187
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,540
Can't they just leave the classroom?

188
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,640
What? Why are we all here?

189
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,010
Hey, it's Nam Ju.

190
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,640
Whatever he says
becomes a lesson at this school.

191
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,180
- It becomes a rule.
- No, a lesson.

192
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180
- You're so stupid.
- Hey, Ju Da is crying.

193
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,320
Goodness, that witch.
She always cries in front of Nam Ju.

194
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
Nam Ju is naive too.

195
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,150
He can't handle women's tears.

196
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,820
Can't you tell?

197
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,790
Ju Da is figuring out her place now.

198
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,490
Did you mean
everything you said to me?

199
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,160
There's nothing between us?

200
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,530
Nam Ju.

201
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,670
You and I don't belong together.

202
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,510
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Here.

204
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,870
Go. I don't want you
to see me like this.

205
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,310
You look awful when you cry.

206
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,780
- What?
- It's not like you.

207
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,440
Then, what am I like?

208
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,650
You always smile.

209
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,349
I'll put a smile on your face again.

210
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,390
I said I should keep
a distance from her.

211
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,030
My gosh, I almost played it again.

212
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,830
Wait, did you just smile?
You just smiled, right?

213
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,470
Do Hwa.

214
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,100
My gosh, no. Don't say
that I'm your guardian angel.

215
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,440
Ju Da, I didn't know
you could laugh like that.

216
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,880
I guess I can.

217
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,040
I didn't know
I could laugh like that.

218
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,680
Something seems off
about you lately.

219
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,350
Is that so?

220
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,990
So you like anyone
who can change the stage?

221
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,790
When I was with Haru,
the stage changed.

222
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,530
I wanted to change
my character's terminal disease.

223
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,330
She liked him
because he could change the stage?

224
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,570
It drives me insane...

225
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,280
whenever that jerk
meddles with my stage,

226
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,780
and whenever he tries to come in
between Dan Oh and me,

227
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,580
and whenever she shows him
a face that she never showed me.

228
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,620
I'm about to lose it.

229
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,360
I'll make sure I find...

230
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,560
whatever you're hiding...

231
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,560
and whatever you pretend
to be clueless about when you know.

232
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,300
You don't seem to visit often...

233
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,800
when I'm waiting for you.

234
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,840
My apologies.

235
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Let's go.

236
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,350
Is he your son?

237
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,990
I apologize for the belated
introduction. I am Jun Hyun.

238
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,300
I must be on my way.
Please excuse me.

239
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,070
Don't let the Prince wait too long.

240
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,710
We can't have two suns
under the same sky.

241
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,440
Don't you know it's treason
to contempt the Royal Family?

242
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,850
Contempt?
That's an overstatement, my lord.

243
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,350
I just wanted to know
which sun you'll choose to follow.

244
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,790
You led an upright life, one of
integrity for all of your days.

245
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,060
I'm sure many subjects will
follow your lead.

246
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,730
Stay away from the Prince.
This is my final warning.

247
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,300
You're worried about my future too.

248
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,800
I am ever so grateful.

249
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,010
He will end up
getting blood on his hands.

250
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,940
Are you that furious?

251
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,480
Are you furious to see
the crowning of the Crown Prince,

252
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,350
whose only qualification is
his royal bloodline?

253
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,320
What you just said is...

254
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,260
treason.

255
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,300
The palace is only filled
with His Majesty's people.

256
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,300
If you do not stab him first,

257
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,470
you will be stabbed.

258
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,340
I am considering
taking you up higher.

259
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,910
In order to do that,

260
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,740
you need a sturdy rope.

261
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,320
- A rope?
- It's Eun Mu Young.

262
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,790
All of the subjects, high and low,

263
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,360
are all Eun Mu Young's
loyal followers.

264
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,330
Find his weakness...

265
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,860
and make him take your side.

266
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,340
Would you like a drink?

267
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,200
If you couldn't take that drink,
how could I do that?

268
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,070
Who would even imagine...

269
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,270
that the Queen Dowager
would poison my mother...

270
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,480
because she was afraid
to lose the King's love?

271
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,880
You are just like...

272
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,050
the Queen Dowager.

273
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,760
Including how you keep
a court lady close with you.

274
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,970
Your Majesty, I truly hope...

275
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,140
you will remain healthy.

276
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,610
Are you afraid...

277
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,040
of Prince Kyung?

278
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,980
I apologize for my bad manners,
Your Majesty.

279
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,820
However, why do you think
I did that?

280
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,330
You have taken the throne already.

281
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,060
You can only leave...

282
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,600
once your life ends.

283
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,000
If you must,
just leave your shell up there.

284
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,140
There cannot be...

285
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,810
any mistakes in your life.

286
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,080
Because this throne is
the foundation of this country.

287
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Because I am your mother.

288
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,550
Because you and I
must live our lives...

289
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,450
in peace.

290
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,570
Do you really think something
this amazing really exists?

291
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
I mean, we're in a comic book,

292
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,540
so it means everything here is
made by the writer too.

293
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,250
But the writer can't be that smart.

294
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,550
Were we made
by a writer who isn't smart?

295
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,550
Of course.

296
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,050
How can someone like
you and me be extras?

297
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,520
Here's my wish.

298
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,360
- What is it?
- To see a sky full of stars.

299
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,100
There aren't any stars
in the sky we see here.

300
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,640
I'm sure I can see that
before I die.

301
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,870
You aren't going to die.

302
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,680
You must have forgotten
because I seemed too healthy.

303
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm terminally ill.

304
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,450
Dan Oh.

305
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,280
We can always change
something like that.

306
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,350
I told you that
I'll change your story.

307
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,730
The period from when a star shines
until it ceases to shine is...

308
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,730
just a moment out in the universe.

309
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Those stars have
a limited amount of time,

310
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,970
but those stars come together
to create the infinite universe.

311
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,710
I'm sure the end of my life has
a certain significance too.

312
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,810
I believe you are
that significance, Haru.

313
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,280
But it's a little sad
that I can't see these stars myself.

314
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,130
It must have been difficult
to find it.

315
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,830
Thank you.

316
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,040
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

317
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,510
and for remembering my wish.

318
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,290
Haru.

319
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,860
What's on your mind?

320
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,730
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

321
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,970
If we ever see some stars,

322
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,170
the light must have gotten here
from a faraway place.

323
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,740
I just read in a book...

324
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,480
that light can travel
at 300,000km per second.

325
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,550
I think...

326
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,450
we have been running
toward one another...

327
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,790
from a place further away
than what we're aware of.

328
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,670
I want the two of us to be alone.

329
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,940
"I want the two of us to be alone."

330
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,310
My gosh.

331
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,820
He wants to be alone with me.

332
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,190
Alone.

333
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,590
My gosh, where did he
learn all these lines?

334
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,190
Haru, you.

335
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,500
But you're too much.

336
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,400
You always say those things
like it's nothing...

337
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,600
when my heart is about to...

338
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,010
So this is how it feels...

339
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,050
to like someone.

340
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,120
I had no idea when I was
just a bridge between them,

341
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,480
but Nam Ju and Ju Da,

342
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,550
I think I'm starting to understand
why you two are so cheesy.

343
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,160
Eun Dan Oh,
a terminally ill high school girl.

344
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,430
I wonder how much time I have left.

345
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,770
I hope I can spend
all of my leftover days with Haru,

346
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,540
except for the pages of "Secret".

347
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,840
I want those pages to remain
only for Eun Dan Oh.

348
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,950
What does he want to do with me
when we're alone?

349
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,990
Excuse me.

350
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,530
Where's the teachers' office?

351
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,530
Thanks.

352
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,540
Found you.

353
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,540
Hi, Haru.

354
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,010
Hi, Dan Oh.

355
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,220
Haru, when you
call out my name like,

356
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,360
"Dan Oh."

357
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,060
It feels like my heart will burst
when it's already weak enough.

358
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,260
But it's not fair because
you don't seem that nervous.

359
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,940
I get...

360
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,710
really nervous too.

361
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,010
Dan Oh.

362
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,210
What brings you
this early to school?

363
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,680
Su Chul nagged at me...

364
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,450
from the morning
saying I'll be late.

365
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,890
Hey, you're the one who's at fault.

366
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,520
Hey, this is really suspicious.

367
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
What is?

368
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,120
Are you two dating or something?

369
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,230
Yes.

370
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,230
Dating? No way.

371
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,760
Dan Oh likes Kyung.

372
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,830
How can you be so clueless?

373
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,870
He just said yes.

374
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,470
They looked at each other
like that too.

375
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,770
You have no idea
what women are like.

376
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,640
- Let's go. I'm sorry.
- Didn't you see them?

377
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,810
Did anyone?

378
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Why?

379
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,510
Hey, gosh.

380
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,020
You're really tiny,
but you're really strong.

381
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,020
Nam Ju, have a safe trip.

382
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,790
And stay healthy. Don't get sick.

383
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,160
- Make sure you eat well.
- Are you his mother?

384
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,990
Y3 will keep Seuli High School safe.

385
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,460
- Bye.
- Nam Ju, stay in touch.

386
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,060
I can't believe Nam Ju is
leaving Seuli High School.

387
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,660
My heart is broken.

388
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,970
Ju Da.

389
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,270
I'm really leaving.

390
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,110
Nam Ju.

391
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,550
Don't worry about me.

392
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,020
I want to know
what I'll be like without you.

393
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,960
- You without me?
- It might be fun too.

394
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,890
Goodbye.

395
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,260
- Hey.
- What was that?

396
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,460
- What did she say?
- My gosh.

397
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,770
See? I told you
she doesn't like him.

398
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,370
- What did she say?
- Nam Ju...

399
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,199
Let's take a look at "The Stars",
a short story by Alphonse Daudet.

400
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,610
It expressed the romantic love
of a shepherd boy...

401
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,909
who is in love with a lady
by using stars.

402
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,350
Everyone, think of
someone you like...

403
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,280
as you enjoy the last paragraph.

404
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,780
"I began to think..."

405
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,460
"that the prettiest
and the most brilliant star..."

406
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,760
"lost its way and came
to sit on my shoulder to sleep."

407
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,100
I want to see the stars
in a vast field like this...

408
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,100
with my beloved.

409
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,340
That's my wish.

410
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,070
Haru.

411
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,909
Haru.

412
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,720
Why are you staring at me?
You might poke a hole on my face.

413
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,290
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

414
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,090
You must have liked the stars
a long time ago too.

415
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Let's go.

416
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,110
What's that?

417
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
None of your business.

418
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,850
Man, how can you say that to me?

419
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,280
You became so different
in just a few days.

420
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,290
You were once a friend
who listened to everything I said.

421
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Of course,

422
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,760
that's still your character,
isn't it?

423
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,230
You're really annoying
when you are...

424
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,260
aware of yourself.

425
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,890
Do you still refuse...

426
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,390
to side with me?

427
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,230
You must keep
the order of the Royal Family.

428
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,030
I will take you down...

429
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,260
to fix the wronged order.

430
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,760
I will protect His Majesty
to the very end.

431
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,710
Good for my brother.

432
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,350
He has so many faithful subjects.

433
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,020
You're the only one...

434
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,720
who's loyal to me.

435
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,590
That's why...

436
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,730
I'll make sure
Eun Mu Young takes my side.

437
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,600
Go find out more about Eun Dan Oh.

438
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,980
Father!

439
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,220
Why are you running up to me?

440
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,390
I told you to keep your elegance.

441
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,160
Yes, Father.

442
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,590
What is this?

443
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,160
You can open it inside.

444
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,400
Let's go inside. The wind is cold.

445
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,910
My lady!

446
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,580
My lady! My lady!

447
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,780
My lady, wait for me.

448
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,510
My lady!

449
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,900
We have to go.

450
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,110
Who are you?

451
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,750
- You are skilled.
- Answer me.

452
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,380
I cannot.

453
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,550
Why are you following me?

454
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,950
- Just because.
- Answer me!

455
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,990
Because I need to protect you,

456
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,760
my lady.

457
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,930
Is this his name?

458
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,870
I wonder what kind of person he is.

459
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,800
How could I meet him again?

460
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,110
Should I wait at that place?

461
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,080
I should have told him
that Eun Mu Young has no weakness.

462
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,090
I heard it again.

463
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,370
Will he not come today either?

464
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,850
I knew she would be here.

465
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,850
I can see through her quite easily.

466
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,330
I must stop him.

467
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,860
Master.

468
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,200
What are you doing?

469
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,110
You ruined everything.

470
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,210
Tell me why you did that!

471
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,850
Where is this sound coming from?

472
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,230
I knew I would not be able
to see him here.

473
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,470
I can see through her quite easily.

474
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,450
It is happening again.

475
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,600
Excuse me.

476
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,350
Are you all right?

477
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,190
They say that three encounters
mean it is fate.

478
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,290
You and I have already met twice.

479
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,130
Do you remember me?

480
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,170
Master.

481
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,840
Your name.

482
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,040
Please tell me your name.

483
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,220
We will meet again one day.

484
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,290
What is bound to happen
will happen no matter what.

485
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,200
The Prince is busy.

486
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,430
I know.

487
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,100
I knew he would not like flowers.

488
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,840
Why is he so busy all the time?

489
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,480
Do you like flowers?

490
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,350
Yes, I do.

491
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,880
I knew it.

492
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,090
I am going to walk to the end
of this path.

493
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,320
Will you join me?

494
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,320
1, 2, 3, 4.

495
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,720
I have to take two additional pills
after my discharge.

496
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,400
("Secret")

497
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,550
You told me that I existed
before "Secret".

498
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,860
The forgotten memories of the past
keep coming up.

499
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,590
Every time I remember a scene
from the past,

500
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,630
a wave of emotions consumes me.

501
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,600
My heart aches.

502
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,340
I feel anxious and sad.

503
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,310
Even in the past,
Kyung was Dan Oh's...

504
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,370
Fiance?

505
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,340
Our writer lacks creativity.

506
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,050
The writer keeps using
the same characters.

507
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,610
The settings may have changed,
but the stories are similar.

508
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,980
That's why regaining your memory
is painful.

509
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,050
You need to stop the person
who's changing the stage...

510
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,690
even if it's Dan Oh.

511
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,060
Don't make the same mistake again.

512
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,330
- "The same mistake"?
- You are only provoking...

513
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,930
the writer by changing the stage.

514
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,840
Do you still want to keep going?

515
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,740
Solely because of Dan Oh?

516
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,770
What happened to Dan Oh and me...

517
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,240
in that story?

518
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,080
You two...

519
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,650
will never be together.

520
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,320
That's what the writer had decided
from the very start.

521
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,160
Ju Hwa told me...

522
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,900
that Dan Oh's recent check-up result
didn't look too great.

523
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,170
Make sure you treat her well.

524
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,600
(Lee Do Hwa)

525
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
(Eun Dan Oh)

526
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,580
(Baek Kyung)

527
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,590
What?

528
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,760
Hello? If you have nothing to say,
I'm hanging up.

529
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,920
Dan Oh.

530
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,860
When are you visiting
the hospital again?

531
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,100
I'm not sure. Why?

532
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,760
You know why...

533
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,900
I hate going there, right?

534
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,640
I do. I won't call you.
You know what? Tell the writer...

535
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,170
that I don't want you
to come either.

536
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,840
Do you think
I like having you there...

537
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,010
What? Hello?

538
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,540
Hello?

539
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,250
He called me out of the blue...

540
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,850
and asked me
when I'll be going to the hospital.

541
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,080
He keeps doing things
he never did before.

542
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,590
Could it be...

543
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:37,330
(The death anniversary
of Kyung's mother)

544
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,140
Jun Hyun.

545
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,040
My dear, Jun Hyun. Take this.

546
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,610
I almost left it here
if you didn't bring it for me.

547
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,810
My gosh. Your tie is always crooked.

548
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,550
You're just like Jun Hyun.

549
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,050
The apple never falls far
from the tree.

550
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,150
He should take after
my good quality.

551
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,850
Why is he clumsy like me?

552
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,690
I got a lot of nice traits from you.

553
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,000
- You're not coming?
- Well,

554
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,130
it's about Dan Oh.

555
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,040
It looks like she was very sick.

556
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,600
The sicker she gets,
the better for us.

557
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,810
Chairman Eun's soft spot for her
will be greater.

558
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,580
I get that
you're not aware of yourself,

559
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,950
but can't you at least think like
a human being outside the stage?

560
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,080
What on earth are you talking about?

561
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,020
No wonder. That's why he treated
Mom at the hospital like that.

562
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,350
Do you know what today is?

563
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,420
Oh, right.

564
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,790
I almost forgot.

565
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,530
Empty your schedule this evening.

566
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,200
What's today?

567
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,530
Goodness.

568
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,530
Today is Mom and Dad's
wedding anniversary.

569
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
Right.

570
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,540
Of course, you wouldn't remember.

571
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,010
You.

572
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,580
Don't ever utter the word,

573
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,650
"Mom" in front of me.

574
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,850
How dare you be so rude?

575
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,110
What? You'll hit me again?

576
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,820
It's a good day.

577
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,150
Why...

578
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,990
Why don't you try
to control yourself?

579
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,060
Unbelievable.

580
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Kyung.

581
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,430
Kyung.

582
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,500
I'm sorry about today.

583
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,110
Forget it.

584
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,440
I'm sure they are not treating you
this way because they want to.

585
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,940
You don't know anything.

586
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,680
You don't know
how I was always alone...

587
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,850
outside the stage.

588
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,090
Just go.

589
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,430
I also...

590
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,330
know that.

591
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,870
Let's learn about
a traditional Korean poem...

592
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,500
that talked about one's feelings...

593
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,370
how desperate he or she sought
for love a very long time ago.

594
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,410
The title is...

595
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,910
- "Jeongseokka".
- "Jeongseokka".

596
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,340
That's it. That's the title.

597
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,150
I'm sure you guys also break up...

598
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,510
when things don't work out.

599
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,820
- Yes. We break up all the time.
- Yes. He does.

600
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,290
Right. But in this poem,

601
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,090
before there is
an impossible situation...

602
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,620
Why isn't he answering his phone?

603
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,160
Dan Oh.

604
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,030
Do Hwa.

605
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,400
Who is she?

606
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,670
She's a transfer student
in my class.

607
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,500
My teacher told me to give
her a tour of the school.

608
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,840
- I see. Hello.
- Hi.

609
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,940
Which school are you from?

610
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,140
What? Well...

611
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,610
I don't think she has her set-up.

612
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,780
"Set-up"?

613
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,780
But you have a name.

614
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,810
It's time for lunch.
We should hurry today.

615
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,180
When they serve stir-fried
dried squid,

616
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,580
the line is pretty long.

617
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,090
- That's true.
- See you later.

618
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,150
- Okay.
- I like stir-fried dried squid.

619
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,390
Which way is to the cafeteria?

620
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,760
- Cafeteria?
- Oh, right.

621
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,760
- Have you seen Kyung?
- Kyung?

622
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,130
I'm not sure. I don't think
I saw him today. Why?

623
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,400
He's not at your hideout?

624
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,700
This isn't the first time to skip
school when he doesn't feel like...

625
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,800
coming to school.

626
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,970
That's true.

627
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,990
- Hey.
- Ma'am.

628
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,520
See? This is what he does.

629
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,790
He skips classes.

630
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,360
You don't know how mean he is to me.

631
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,260
He's such a jerk and a bully.

632
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,400
But seeing how he came
to see you today,

633
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,330
I guess he's not a jerk, after all.

634
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,870
Here.

635
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,780
How did you know?

636
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,350
Know what?

637
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,920
That it was my mom's death
anniversary today.

638
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,990
She passed away
around this time of the year.

639
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,260
When the autumn leaves
changed into beautiful colors.

640
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,690
I remember
how you cried a lot that day.

641
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,800
My gosh, when you were young,
you cried easily...

642
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,140
and you were pretty cute.

643
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,800
I don't know
how you turned out this way.

644
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,870
Dan Oh.

645
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,640
I only have you.

646
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,250
What do you mean?

647
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:24,910
Someone who remembers me...

648
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,850
on the stage and outside the stage.

649
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,890
Gosh. Did you just find that out?

650
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,760
You're the only person
who really knows me.

651
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,000
You only smiled in front of me.

652
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,530
I realized too late how precious...

653
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,680
Let's go.

654
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,650
I'll give you a ride.

655
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,650
What?

656
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:13,830
Bye.

657
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,930
Are you...

658
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,000
really going to die?

659
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,270
Why? You can't wait until I'm gone?

660
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,170
You might live
if the surgery goes well.

661
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,570
Don't you know my set-up?

662
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,610
You believe in my set-up than me.

663
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,940
It's because I believe in you.

664
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,750
Fine. All right. It was a nice way
of consoling me.

665
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,290
"Successful surgery".
That's quite optimistic.

666
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,250
Get home safe. Bye.

667
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:49,800
Things aren't too late...

668
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:51,770
between you and me.

669
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:59,070
What's happening now?

670
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,610
It hurts. Gosh, what's going on?

671
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,750
Dan Oh, are you in a lot of pain?

672
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,110
Just a bit.

673
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,190
Okay.
Your fever has gone down a bit.

674
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,420
You just took your medicine.
Once you get some sleep,

675
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,660
you'll be fine.

676
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,160
Don't go to school today.
Let's just rest at home.

677
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,860
No, I can still go.

678
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,490
I must go to school.

679
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,270
Will I end up at the hospital again
after this scene?

680
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,440
Haru will be worried.

681
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,840
Oh, no.

682
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
Hey!

683
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,380
You're dead meat.

684
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,860
Dan Oh is sick again.

685
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,860
There's nothing I can do.

686
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,010
Here's my wish.

687
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,240
To see a sky full of stars.

688
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,750
There aren't any stars
in the sky we see here.

689
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,290
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

690
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,660
and for remembering my wish.

691
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,480
Why am I...

692
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,080
so heartbroken?

693
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,490
Why...

694
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,560
do I feel so anxious?

695
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,200
I miss you,

696
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,070
Dan Oh.

697
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,790
Hello, Haru.

698
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:40,770
How are you?

699
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,300
Are you feeling better?

700
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,110
The writer is unbelievable.

701
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,280
The writer got totally hooked
on my terminal illness.

702
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:49,850
Look at me. I'm so healthy.

703
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,350
Did you wait a long time for me?

704
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:53,850
If it means I'm waiting for you,
it doesn't matter how long.

705
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,480
I'll always wait for you.

706
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,090
(If it means I'm waiting for you,
it doesn't matter how long.)

707
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,160
(I'll always wait for you.)

708
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,490
(I will make my own answer.
With you.)

709
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,100
I'm sure this was in...

710
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,230
Haru. I missed you!

711
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,240
Me too.

712
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,600
Why? What is it?

713
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,270
- Be careful.
- Okay.

714
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,840
- Right here?
- Yes.

715
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,040
Can you count to 10 right here?

716
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,070
Okay.

717
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,610
1, 2,

718
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,680
3, 4,

719
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,650
5, 6, 7,

720
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,150
8, 9,

721
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,090
10.

722
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,960
Okay.

723
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,580
It's so pretty.

724
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,990
They seem like real stars.

725
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,690
They're so pretty.

726
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,130
It's so pretty.

727
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,470
They're like real stars.

728
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,610
Dan Oh.

729
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,910
Yes?

730
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:11,590
You know,
this might be a funny story.

731
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,120
Okay. I love funny stories.

732
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:17,090
We may have...

733
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,930
known each other a long time ago,

734
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,000
much longer than we know.

735
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,530
A long time ago?

736
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,570
Yes.

737
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,140
Much longer than
what we're aware of.

738
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,610
What was that?
It's not funny at all.

739
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,620
I will do anything for you.

740
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,820
- What?
- That thing you like.

741
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,560
Creating your own fate.

742
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,090
I'm not going to change it anymore.

743
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:54,030
I don't think we're doing things
only as the writer wants.

744
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,700
I think that's why...

745
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,070
you found...

746
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,870
this nameless me.

747
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,210
From now on,

748
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,440
no matter where you are,

749
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:12,450
I will find you again.

750
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,290
I think I know...

751
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,260
why you were my beginning.

752
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:31,770
Haru.

753
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,540
Thank you.

754
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:41,140
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

755
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,850
And...

756
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,020
for remembering my wish.

757
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,000
(Extra-ordinary You)
