1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,360
I will make my own answer.

3
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,700
With you.

4
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,420
Haru?

5
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,170
Dan Oh.

6
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,470
Hey, Dan Oh.

7
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,750
Kyung just left.

8
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,450
Kyung?

9
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,220
You only remember me...

10
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
as Kyung's fiancee
who has a heart condition.

11
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,000
Is that all?

12
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,200
Should I know more than that?

13
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
No.

14
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,110
You don't have to do that anymore.

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
He was usually quiet in class.

16
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,670
He's no joke.

17
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,740
He successfully does a smash
by 95.92 percent.

18
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,110
Wow, you can only see
Kyung and Haru on the court.

19
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,110
You're right.

20
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,150
- My gosh.
- It was amazing.

21
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,410
Hey.

22
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't think Kyung ever gets tired.

23
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
- Tell me about it.
- Hey.

24
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,990
Quiet.

25
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,660
Dan Oh.

26
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,280
I thought it was about time
you got it taped again.

27
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,750
Give it to me.

28
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,950
Sure. I'll leave first.

29
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,950
Hey, let's go.

30
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,820
- Okay.
- I'll win next time.

31
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Let's make a bet.

32
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,660
Seriously? Fine.

33
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,570
This is so awful.

34
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,070
Did you only pretend
as if you like Dan Oh...

35
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,570
just to use her?

36
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,670
Kyung, you're human garbage!

37
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,380
Do Hwa, don't you know that
the stage and shadow are different?

38
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,520
If the writer drew that,
I can't help it.

39
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
I have to do it
even if I don't want to.

40
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,450
That's true.

41
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,950
But it was just the worst,

42
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,950
so I couldn't help myself.

43
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,320
You need to step it up.

44
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,890
At least Dan Oh is self-aware.

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,260
If you keep changing the story,

46
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,900
what will happen to Nam Ju,
who has no idea?

47
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,330
Fine, I feel bad for him as is.
Happy now?

48
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,700
Have you ever
wanted to change the story?

49
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,310
Are you really okay playing
a character who betrays his fiancee?

50
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,010
Poor Dan Oh.

51
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,310
I never really thought about it.

52
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,890
("Secret")

53
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,460
But someone is making me
want to change it.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,370
Have you ever
wanted to change the story?

55
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,810
Are you really okay playing
a character who betrays his fiancee?

56
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,890
Young man, it's not lunchtime yet.

57
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,690
I was wondering why Dan Oh was
in the cafeteria all the time.

58
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,390
What?

59
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,430
- What do you mean?
- Hey.

60
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,460
You aren't even surprised.

61
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,000
I guess you already knew
that I became aware of myself.

62
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,270
What should I call you?

63
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,010
Dried Squid Fairy? Right.

64
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,580
Or should I
just be casual with you...

65
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,750
just like Do Hwa?

66
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,190
That's not something I want to hear
coming from you.

67
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,960
Let's be nice to
other self-aware characters.

68
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,830
It's already frustrating enough to
be with idiots who never remember.

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,270
I mean, the thing with Haru too.
This comic book world is...

70
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,440
quite intriguing.

71
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,370
Are you worried about something?

72
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,370
No.

73
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,870
Come on, you are.

74
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,140
What is it?
Is it about that friend of yours?

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
The girl whose heart races
whenever she sees a boy?

76
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,080
Her heart began to stop.

77
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
No way, it didn't stop.

78
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,510
You're completely lovestruck.

79
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,450
All right, everyone.
Let me guess why she's lovestruck.

80
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,950
Don't be suspicious.

81
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,020
There is only one person
that you set your eyes on.

82
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,690
It's...

83
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,890
- Kyung!
- Kyung!

84
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,840
- Bye.
- Hey, wait.

85
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,370
I'll take the questionnaire
to other people.

86
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,440
I have to go.

87
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,820
Do we have to use this?

88
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,120
We have to add triethylamine.

89
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,190
You can look at this.

90
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,330
- You can get it anywhere.
- What are you doing?

91
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,130
You should just kiss him.

92
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,760
- No way.
- Look.

93
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,000
- What is it?
- Haru, this is the weight...

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
- of my love for you.
- Hey, wait. Haru.

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,370
Haru, look.

96
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,110
Haru, you look great
in the white gown.

97
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,070
- Haru, can you help me?
- No.

98
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,310
- Hey.
- Stop.

99
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,580
Haru doesn't like someone like you.

100
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,510
- Whatever.
- Move.

101
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,720
- Stop it.
- He doesn't like a girl like you.

102
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,820
Okay, fine. I know.

103
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,020
Everyone, come and get
the experiment equipment.

104
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

105
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,890
- Oh, right.
- My gosh.

106
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,330
Look at this.

107
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,890
Stop it, you're so annoying.

108
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,470
I can do it too.

109
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,950
You make me concerned.

110
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,180
I know you don't remember,
but don't do that.

111
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,920
What do I not remember?

112
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,090
Don't make me think you're like
the old Haru, not even for a second.

113
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,820
Don't make me think that way.

114
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,090
Please. Please don't do that to me.

115
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,040
Are you in my group?

116
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,810
No.

117
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,110
Then what are you doing here?

118
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,310
Just because.

119
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,480
"Just because"?

120
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,720
Is that part of your character?

121
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,950
Part of my character?

122
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,990
Then take better care of her.

123
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,440
- Haru!
- Haru.

124
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,340
Who are you eating with?
Do you want to eat together?

125
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,040
Just looking at his face
makes me full.

126
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,210
- He's so popular.
- Let's go to a cafe together.

127
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,680
- He is?
- Yes.

128
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,580
He's not as handsome as Nam Ju,

129
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,850
but he is handsome, indeed.
He stands out.

130
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,420
He and Kyung got close
through the tennis team.

131
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,060
He's the only one
who's as competent as Kyung.

132
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,330
There are rumors
that he may be a part of A3.

133
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,460
Without my knowing?

134
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
What?

135
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,330
Why do you look broken-hearted?

136
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,040
- Me?
- Yes, you look broken-hearted.

137
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,900
What's wrong?

138
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,580
Isn't he good-looking?
I know he is.

139
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,580
I should go first.

140
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,810
Dan Oh.

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,650
Let me go.

142
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,230
He said, "Ae Sam".

143
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,460
I thought you hated your name,
saying it was tacky.

144
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,830
Weren't you going to change it
after your graduation?

145
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,400
Hold on. Don't talk to me.

146
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,900
I want to cherish
this moment forever.

147
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,070
What?

148
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,710
I've made up my mind.

149
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,610
I'm no longer going
to have a crush on Kyung.

150
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,040
I know you struggled because of me.

151
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,710
From now on, he is yours.

152
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,450
You only started liking him
not too long ago.

153
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,650
Haru is like a green grape.

154
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,960
From today on, I'm going
to like Haru.

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,290
What? Haru?

156
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,960
My gosh! What's wrong with you?

157
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,830
No. Haru is... He is...

158
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,030
What?

159
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,070
Just take care of Kyung.

160
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,900
I'll take care of Haru.

161
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,240
Let's go see him.

162
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,210
My gosh!

163
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm filming right now.

164
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,910
Everyone thinks you're a ghost.

165
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,320
Hey, why are there so many comments?

166
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,920
Hey, guys!

167
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,590
It's been a long time.

168
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,460
Thank you for the gifts.

169
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,990
No!

170
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,700
No, we're ready to accept gifts.

171
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,200
Hey, they left.

172
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,830
Dan Oh!

173
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,600
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

174
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,700
Sae Mi, what should I do?

175
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,910
(Hong Rui Zhen)

176
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,580
Is it tasty?
You can only feel better...

177
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,110
once you have something good.

178
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,050
It's because of Kyung, isn't it?

179
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,590
When it comes to love,
things don't work out at times.

180
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,820
Nam Ju and I are
in a similar situation.

181
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,460
But all these struggles...

182
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,430
are needed in order
to reap true love.

183
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,670
So don't worry.
Kyung will come back to you.

184
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,540
You've been at it for a decade.

185
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,240
I don't even know
how much time I have left.

186
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,570
A decade is nothing.

187
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,210
A decade is half our lifetime.

188
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,780
How is that nothing?

189
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Look at them.

190
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,920
Haru lets the girls do
whatever they want.

191
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,660
It's the same person,

192
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,330
but he has completely forgotten
about me.

193
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,600
My gosh, look at her smiling.

194
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,800
We need to do that too. Dan Oh.

195
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,570
How do I look?

196
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,570
I gave him that name.

197
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,180
Hey, being depressed
doesn't suit you.

198
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
Should I hit Kyung for you?

199
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,410
Should I show him what I've got?

200
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm going to ignore him from now on.

201
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,660
You've turned from just
an ordinary extra...

202
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,970
to an extra who is controlled
by the writer.

203
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,200
It must be worse.

204
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,340
Get the evidence.

205
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,910
Get a photo of Nam Ju
and her together.

206
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,950
I apologize.

207
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,450
Thank you so much.

208
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,360
You're always working so hard.

209
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,590
Good luck.

210
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,740
It is worse to be an extra...

211
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,970
who is controlled by the writer.

212
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,910
Hello.

213
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,180
Aren't you Yeo Ju Da?

214
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,690
I should send you a pair.

215
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,060
It's okay.

216
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,060
You've received enough already.
One more item won't hurt.

217
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't worry about it.

218
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,470
Right, I heard you're close
with Dan Oh.

219
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,840
Kyung is so smart.

220
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
He found himself
a great future wife.

221
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,680
It'd be wonderful
if Nam Ju had a girlfriend as well.

222
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,110
Do you have anyone
you could introduce to him?

223
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,080
Perhaps, someone who is...

224
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,050
similar in status to him.

225
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,650
Mother!

226
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,820
Hey, Sae Mi.

227
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,860
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

228
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,560
Goodness, you're looking
more lovely from head to toe.

229
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,370
They say girls get prettier
when they're in a relationship.

230
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,300
Do you have a boyfriend?

231
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,070
I'm still looking for one.

232
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,610
There's no need to look far.

233
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,080
You should come over sometime soon.

234
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,240
I'd love that.

235
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,310
All right.

236
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,810
Oh, my. Time flew.

237
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,920
I'll see you at home soon.

238
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,320
- Yes, ma'am.
- Bye.

239
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,590
Ju Da.

240
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Yes?

241
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,660
About your shoes...

242
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,330
I'll send you a pair today.

243
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,460
Come on, now. You're a student
at Seuli High School.

244
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,670
Mother, let me walk with you.

245
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,460
Nam Ju, when are you coming here?
Should I go there?

246
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,360
Your mother said
I must visit your house.

247
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,460
So I...

248
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,700
Hello? Hello?

249
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,410
Ju Da, do you know what this means?

250
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,580
How would she know that...

251
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,980
when she's not even taking
special classes?

252
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,690
What's the point of studying
another language...

253
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,820
if she will never go abroad?

254
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,720
What does that mean?

255
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,990
It's something nice.

256
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,700
Ju Da, isn't that your flower?
It's withering.

257
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,829
Oh, no. Poor thing.

258
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,200
- It's withering.
- There's something on your back.

259
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,339
- Is she stupid or what?
- What does it say?

260
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,470
She has no clue.

261
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,310
Look.

262
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,220
"May I have some money?"

263
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,550
It's not funny.

264
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,760
"Beggar"? How childish.

265
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,090
"Worn out shoes".

266
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,890
You guys are like her shoes.

267
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,030
Who is it? Who stuck this on her?

268
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,500
Sae Mi?

269
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,170
Is it you again?
I'm very disappointed.

270
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,440
"Disappointed"?

271
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,210
You're disappointed in me?

272
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,240
Let's go.

273
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,850
Nam Ju.

274
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,720
That little...

275
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,430
Thanks for helping me.

276
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,170
Don't make me look so miserable.

277
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,700
- What?
- I know...

278
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,040
that we're
from two different worlds.

279
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,710
So stop pitying me.

280
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,140
- When did I pity...
- I don't want to have hope...

281
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,610
and get hurt.

282
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,950
I don't know where you got
that idea from,

283
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,490
but I've never pitied you.

284
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,090
- But...
- Let me prove to you...

285
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,590
how sincere I am...

286
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,660
right now.

287
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,940
Is Haru still someone else?

288
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,940
Come here.

289
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,440
How about doing
what you did before...

290
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,210
when he was still called Number 13?

291
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,210
No.

292
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,020
There was a butterfly effect.

293
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,550
Make small changes, okay?

294
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,390
Will you let the story
go this way?

295
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,290
- And you?
- Me?

296
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,860
Nam Ju made a fuss before leaving.

297
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,630
It was for Ju Da's stage.

298
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,030
Did Shin Sae Mi pick on her again?
Because of the scholarship?

299
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,660
That writer is unbelievable.

300
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,970
If you're not creative,
at least be nice.

301
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,140
Forget it. I'm going
to stay out of this now.

302
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,970
I don't want to make it
harder for Ju Da.

303
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,940
I can't stand seeing
my close friend...

304
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
and the girl I like
having a hard time.

305
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,910
In the end, both of us...

306
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,280
Let me make a formal announcement.

307
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,450
Hey, isn't this Nam Ju speaking?

308
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,690
I guess he's going
to make a big announcement.

309
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,460
Does it have to do with
what happened with Ju Da earlier?

310
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,790
Hey, can't you tell?

311
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,690
He's making the announcement for me.

312
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,460
Nam Ju is going to publicly
apologize to me.

313
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,030
From now on,

314
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,370
Ju Da is the only woman for me.

315
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,770
- What?
- What did he just say?

316
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,770
No way!

317
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,110
- I told you so!
- Gosh, I have a headache.

318
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,240
Hey, are you all right?

319
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,280
- Let's film this.
- Hey, film her.

320
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,350
In the end, both of us
caved into the writer.

321
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,250
The story will happen as planned
no matter what.

322
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,620
- Goodness.
- Unbelievable.

323
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,690
- Hey, film Sae Mi.
- What happened?

324
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,540
You heard the announcement, right?

325
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,840
The stage between Nam Ju and Ju Da.

326
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,250
How could he say
the exact same line?

327
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,250
That's no fun.

328
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,420
The story is going as planned.

329
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,750
Let me make a formal announcement.

330
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,690
Let me make a formal announcement.

331
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,260
From now on...

332
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,790
From now on,
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

333
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,930
From now on,
Ju Da is the only woman for me.

334
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,370
But if you still want
to change the story,

335
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,470
I'll help you.

336
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,870
Only Haru can change it?

337
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,080
That's too bad.

338
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,910
He remembers nothing.

339
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Tell me...

340
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,750
how we can change the story.

341
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,120
Haru is the only one
who can move freely on the stage.

342
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,160
You can't help me change my fate.

343
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,460
The story will happen however
the writer intended no matter what.

344
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,680
- Isn't this good?
- Should we do that?

345
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,840
I want to go all-in with this.

346
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,280
Aren't they Dan Oh and Kyung?

347
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,980
My gosh, you have such good eyes.

348
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm the class president
of Class Seven.

349
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,790
I can spot our classmates
even 1km away.

350
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,190
Good going.

351
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,490
A prestigious private school,
Seuli High School,

352
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,920
with the highest acceptance rate
into the Ivy League schools...

353
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,630
is becoming a place for dating.

354
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,460
But don't they make a nice couple?

355
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,800
- Focus on your studies.
- Focus on your studies.

356
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,730
Let's study hard.

357
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,230
Wait up for me.

358
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,910
Hurry up.

359
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,370
Okay.

360
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,380
("Trumpet Creeper")

361
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,590
My goodness, I'm sorry about that.

362
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,860
This is why people
shouldn't be greedy.

363
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,660
"Trumpet Creeper"?

364
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,930
What are you doing?

365
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,530
- You dropped it.
- Is that all?

366
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Pardon?

367
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Nothing.

368
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,990
Why are you sitting here
out of all seats?

369
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,230
Forget it. I'll leave.

370
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,200
No, stay in your seat. I'll go.

371
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,770
She's on my mind.

372
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,710
Am I tired?

373
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,460
Dan Oh, I'm thinking of adding
a few more medications.

374
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,130
I already have a lot.

375
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,200
No, I don't want to.
I'm not sick at all these days.

376
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,260
Dan Oh.

377
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,800
Why are you getting mad at me
all of a sudden?

378
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,100
He's just worried about you.

379
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,870
You'll take the medication, right?

380
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll get going then.

381
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,520
I wonder...

382
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,390
how much time I have left.

383
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,790
(Hani Hospital)

384
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Dad.

385
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,970
I'm sorry for throwing
a tantrum earlier.

386
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,980
No, I'm sorry...

387
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,210
for not being able
to do anything for you.

388
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,610
All right. I'll comply.

389
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,880
Dad, I'll take
all of my medications.

390
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,950
Can you make my wish come true
in return?

391
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,260
Tell me anything.

392
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,960
I'll do anything you ask of me.

393
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,690
Shall I go and get a star
from the sky for you?

394
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,400
It's nothing like that.

395
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,100
I want to...

396
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,470
get married.

397
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,370
No, I won't.

398
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,370
I won't get married.

399
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,240
I did not mean
what I just said at all. Not at all.

400
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,980
I'm going to live
a long life with you.

401
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,350
All right.

402
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
You and I should live
a long life together.

403
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,750
I know how you feel.

404
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,160
Because of my small heart,
you've been worried about me...

405
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,760
every single day
ever since I was young.

406
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,760
I love you, Dad.

407
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,870
If I get to have another life,

408
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm going to be your daughter
in my next life again.

409
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,440
I'll be your dad
in my next life too.

410
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,920
Dan Oh, you're not ready yet?

411
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,350
I'm coming.

412
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,420
Make sure you look pretty.

413
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
What?

414
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,660
Why?

415
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,730
I said, I'm coming.

416
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,230
Why are you so surprised?

417
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,840
I can come by if I want to.

418
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Wait...

419
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,440
This isn't even a stage.

420
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,810
(Kyung)

421
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,210
You didn't throw it away.

422
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,450
Give it to me.

423
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,620
Stop laughing.

424
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,950
It was embarrassing to carry it
around all day on Sports Day.

425
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,960
Hurry up.
Let's go to school together.

426
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,130
Right, wait.
I have to take my medicine.

427
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,960
I promised my dad
that I won't forget to take them.

428
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,930
"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?

429
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,540
Do you still remember that?

430
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,180
You're still the same...

431
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,240
if that spell still works for you.

432
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,390
Is it that tough
to take your medicine?

433
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,120
Hey, try taking them
every single day. Gosh.

434
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,190
You gave a tough time
to doctors and nurses...

435
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,390
because you never wanted to
take your medicine as a kid.

436
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,200
You remember that?

437
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,670
I'm the one who cast that spell
when you took the medicine.

438
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,970
"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo".

439
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,440
When the fairy gave the carriage
and dress to Cinderella,

440
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,210
you said you just wanted
a healthy heart above all things.

441
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,740
My gosh.

442
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,110
You were really scary.

443
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,420
I can't believe you remember that.

444
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,550
You said you might become healthy...

445
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,450
if I cast that spell.

446
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,960
It's all just set up anyway.
A set-up.

447
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,960
I remember everything.

448
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,740
I remember you within the story...

449
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,440
and out of it.

450
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,980
I'm relieved to hear that.

451
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,050
You're the only one who remembers...

452
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,920
what I'm like outside of the story.

453
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,960
And...

454
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,430
Haru?

455
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,200
Thank you.

456
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,700
It would've been really painful
if it hadn't been for you.

457
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,940
I'm going to try
to accept this world as it is.

458
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,450
I'll try to forget Haru...

459
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,380
and how I tried to change the story.

460
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,220
I'll forget about
how rude you were in the past.

461
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,260
We might be late. Let's go.

462
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,720
Hey, Haru!
Don't turn your back on...

463
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,190
That hurts! Let me go.

464
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,020
We were really close.
You're making me sad.

465
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,930
We were close?

466
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,230
Same face, different guy.

467
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,030
Forget it. I give up too.

468
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,080
I'll pick you up tomorrow too.

469
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,680
No.

470
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,720
You have to practice with me
tomorrow morning.

471
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,390
You can practice with another guy.

472
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,150
You can obtain the answer by
a method that Gauss came up with...

473
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,020
when he was in third grade.

474
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,350
He found out
if you add all the numbers...

475
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,460
between 1 to 100, it's always 101.

476
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,130
Don't you think Gauss is a genius?

477
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
- You're right.
- Yes, you're right.

478
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,300
Let's take a look.

479
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,740
All right, come and take one.

480
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,880
Yes, take a look around.

481
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,650
You can take a look around.

482
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,550
I haven't seen you in a while.
Take a look around.

483
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,170
What's this flower?

484
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,909
It's a flower
called trumpet creeper.

485
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,840
It may be expensive,
but women love that sparkly thing.

486
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,280
That flower means,
"Even if the world falls apart..."

487
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,550
"and the earth splits up,
I will only wait for you."

488
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,820
I'll take this.

489
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,800
- Did you fall asleep?
- What?

490
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,310
Get up. Let's go practice.

491
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,810
Okay.

492
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,920
What's this?

493
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,320
Dan Oh gave it to me.

494
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,090
Dan Oh?

495
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,990
What's this flower called?

496
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,840
No, forget it.

497
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,340
Why do you want to know?

498
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,880
Why do you want to know
what it's called?

499
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,280
It looked like the one
I saw in my dream.

500
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,520
In your dream?

501
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,650
It's nothing. Let's go.

502
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,450
Ju Da.

503
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,850
Why aren't you going
to the music room?

504
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,890
Nam Ju.

505
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,320
There's something
I want to do with you.

506
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,390
- Something you want to do?
- Whoever wins a game of...

507
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,230
- rock-paper-scissors gets a wish.
- A wish?

508
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,560
Rock-paper-scissors.

509
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
I won.

510
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,300
Tell me. What's your wish?

511
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,470
I want you to be...

512
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,040
more like yourself.

513
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,210
And because you're the coolest
when you are yourself,

514
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,650
A3 shines the brightest
when it's A3.

515
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,290
There's no meaning anymore
if one of you is gone.

516
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,760
I hope...

517
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,530
you can be good friends
with Do Hwa again.

518
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,930
What if I won just now?

519
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,900
I bet you'd still do me a favor.

520
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,570
I know what your wish
would have been.

521
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,300
"Granting Ju Da's wish".

522
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,820
Darn it.

523
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,220
Hey, don't blame the game
for your lack of skills.

524
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,340
Do Hwa.

525
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,770
Am I not allowed to come here
on top of the rooftop?

526
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,810
Fine, I'm leaving.

527
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,480
Here I go again.

528
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,750
Your absence is quite big.

529
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,820
Someone said that...

530
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,220
A3 shines the brightest
when it's the 3 of us.

531
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,420
- Who said that?
- My woman did.

532
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,190
"My woman"?
I just can't get used to that.

533
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,700
- I got it for now.
- "For now"?

534
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,230
Both Ju Da and A3 are dear to me.

535
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,100
Let's compete in good faith.

536
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,970
You're no match for me
once I play the violin.

537
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,810
You're right. A3 shouldn't disband
that easily.

538
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,880
A3 shines the brightest
when it's the 3 of us.

539
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
He's repeating the same thing.

540
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,950
Gosh, that wasn't necessary.

541
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,290
- I can feel your sincerity.
- What?

542
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,760
At times, since you always repeat
what you say,

543
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,960
you sound like a broken stereo.

544
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,230
But I can feel your sincerity
this time.

545
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,130
Are you that touched...

546
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,770
that I let you back into A3?

547
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,140
I had forgotten.

548
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,900
You're a very precious friend
of mine,

549
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,140
whether you're self-conscious
or not.

550
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,940
Kyung, you too.

551
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,580
We share many childhood memories.

552
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,080
I get it, but don't get all touchy.

553
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,420
Take care of Ju Da.
She's a nice girl.

554
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,920
My feelings for her won't subside
in a day.

555
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,860
But I truly hope that
you two will be happy.

556
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,540
Why did you call me?

557
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,880
Take this.

558
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,880
What is this?

559
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,480
Just this and that.

560
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,790
I thought you'd like it.

561
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,430
And this.

562
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,690
What? Aren't these...

563
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,030
I was reminded of them
while talking with you this morning.

564
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,430
I gave you that every time
you took your pills.

565
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,330
It's been a long time.

566
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,800
You said eating them
made you happy.

567
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,470
You're right. I did.

568
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
And...

569
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,440
There's one more.

570
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,040
"One more"?

571
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,810
There he comes.

572
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,670
- Thanks.
- Why is he here?

573
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,540
I told him to buy me some flowers.

574
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,370
It seems like...

575
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,140
we're close.

576
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,120
Thanks.

577
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,550
Do you have something to say?

578
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,350
No.

579
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,290
Then why do you look like you do?

580
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,090
Leave.

581
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,070
Don't bother.
He won't remember this anyway.

582
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,930
So this must've been
how you and Haru felt...

583
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,800
towards me.

584
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,040
The two of you were aware
of yourselves...

585
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,250
while I wasn't.

586
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,350
He's not Haru.

587
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,000
Right.

588
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,540
Not anymore.

589
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,940
Go.

590
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,610
Dan Oh.

591
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,310
Haru?

592
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,920
This one's good.

593
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,880
This is the stage.

594
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,850
Kyung has many rackets.

595
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,190
(List of Kyung's Gift)

596
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,820
He only uses this model.

597
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,560
It seems like we're close.

598
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,670
So this is how he's used on stage
since he doesn't remember anything.

599
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,130
I think this one's good.

600
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,800
The writer is so cruel.

601
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,370
Both to me and Haru.

602
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,110
They all look the same to me.

603
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,140
(Easy Grip Tennis Racket)

604
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,950
It'll feel different
if you give it to him.

605
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,910
Really?

606
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,980
(Easy Grip Tennis Racket)

607
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,420
Excuse me.
Please wrap this up nicely.

608
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,520
Okay.

609
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,390
I'm sure Nam Ju would've refused.

610
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,560
And I couldn't trust Do Hwa's taste.

611
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,130
Thanks, Haru. I'm glad
I asked for your help.

612
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,440
You must really like Kyung.

613
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,680
I have to.

614
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,710
Why?

615
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,620
It's my set-up.

616
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,290
I must do it
whether I like it or not.

617
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,650
If you don't want to like him,

618
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,920
then you can stop, can't you?

619
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,690
If you don't like
what's already determined,

620
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,800
then you can change it.

621
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,930
I won't ever do that again.

622
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,240
I don't want to lose him again.

623
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
Lose whom?

624
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
Haru.

625
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,880
"Haru"? Me?

626
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,550
Yes. You.

627
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,980
But...

628
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,550
It's not you.

629
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,990
You're not Haru.

630
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,130
That is my name.

631
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,500
Since when? Tell me.

632
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,710
See?

633
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,940
Why do you keep saying
that I'm not Haru?

634
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,810
Why do you keep saying
that I can't remember?

635
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
If you don't want to like him,

636
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,800
then you can stop, can't you?

637
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,040
If you don't like
what's already determined,

638
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,880
then you can change it.

639
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Thanks to you,

640
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,990
I think my day can change.

641
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,530
Can I call you Haru?

642
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,240
He has no idea what happened to him
because of me.

643
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,330
(Oh Nam Ju)

644
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,370
Nam Ju?

645
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,240
Hey, where are you?

646
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,240
I'm doing something.

647
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,410
I wanted to see
my girlfriend's face.

648
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,980
Your girlfriend? Who is that?

649
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,480
It's you.

650
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,620
You never asked me out.

651
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,620
What more do you need...

652
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,720
when I have announced it
to the entire school?

653
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,460
Then let's do that thing
that you like.

654
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,500
The winner makes a wish.

655
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,230
First, let me hear it.

656
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,070
Don't be so harsh. You already know
what my wish is.

657
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,800
So what's your wish?

658
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,110
It's of course...

659
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,840
I'll tell you once I'm ready.

660
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,480
Once you're ready?

661
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,710
My wish needs to be prepared.

662
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,000
(Certificate of Scholarship)

663
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,010
Don't forget that...

664
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,240
Serinne Foundation is also paying...

665
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,480
for your grandmother's hospital fee.

666
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,530
This is hard.

667
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,440
(Friends)

668
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,270
(Lee Do Hwa)

669
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,270
"Yeo Ju Da,"

670
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,240
"goodbye now."

671
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,650
(Yeo Ju Da, goodbye now.)

672
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,860
Do you want to play
Rice Barley Game?

673
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,820
Let's go.

674
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,090
- Barley.
- Barley.

675
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,260
- Barley.
- Barley.

676
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,260
- Rice.
- Barley... Darn it.

677
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,730
- What was that?
- Let me go next.

678
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,160
Hello, Do Hwa.

679
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,370
- Rice.
- Rice. Hey.

680
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,600
- Give me your hand.
- Come on.

681
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,900
- Don't hit me hard.
- Okay.

682
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,100
- Stop it. It didn't hurt that bad.
- It didn't hurt that bad.

683
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,010
Do Hwa.

684
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,440
What? I'm really sad right now.

685
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,610
Where's the comic book?

686
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,110
I'm going to stop reading it.

687
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,080
If I do,
it will only break my heart.

688
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,450
I need to read it.

689
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,250
Why?

690
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,550
So you don't have it, do you?

691
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,300
("Trumpet Creeper")

692
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,410
(I prepared them.
I heard that you like flowers.)

693
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,080
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

694
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,110
Dan Oh?

695
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,050
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

696
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,820
How is this nothing?
She looks just like Dan Oh.

697
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,020
How much of it did you read?

698
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:19,790
You didn't finish reading it.

699
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,110
- Look at the couple of our school.
- Give it back.

700
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,880
- Find bad photos of Kyung.
- Show me other photos.

701
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,280
He picks a fight with me
whenever he sees me.

702
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,850
Give it back now!

703
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,850
"Give it back."

704
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,360
- "Give it back."
- "Give it back."

705
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,490
Where is that?

706
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,490
- You'd better give it back.
- I'd better give it back?

707
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,690
You are indeed Kyung's fiancee.

708
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,560
Look how rude you are.

709
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,330
- I don't want to.
- No.

710
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,200
- Give it back now.
- No, no.

711
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,330
- No.
- No.

712
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,870
- That's enough.
- Who are you to butt in?

713
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,770
Are you a villain?

714
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,010
You're looking out for her
because Kyung is your friend?

715
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,880
- How annoying.
- My gosh, hey. Let's just go.

716
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,280
We're leaving?

717
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,520
We're leaving?

718
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:23,990
Dan Oh.

719
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,960
I told you to stop.

720
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,030
Stop pretending to be
the old Haru when you're not.

721
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
Hey.

722
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,370
Dan Oh!

723
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,840
Dan Oh!

724
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,380
My name is Haru.

725
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,880
- I know.
- But why do you keep saying...

726
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,150
that I'm not Haru?

727
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,650
Why do you keep popping up
in front of me?

728
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,890
Why do you keep making me
worry about you?

729
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,820
Who on earth are you?

730
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,930
See?

731
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,500
You're not Haru.

732
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,730
- What?
- You remember everything.

733
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,400
You remember that I said
you are not Haru...

734
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,610
and what happened in the shadow.

735
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,440
You're aware of yourself again.

736
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,010
What?

737
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,580
Except for your memories with me.

738
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,020
You asked me who I was.

739
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,880
I am a nobody.

740
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,390
I'm an extra
who's waiting for the day I die.

741
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,860
Actually, this turned out well.

742
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,760
Don't remember me.

743
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,760
I'm not going to change anything
from now on.

744
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,580
By the way,
Kyung still hasn't called you yet?

745
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,850
- This punk.
- He's almost here.

746
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,250
He'll be here soon.

747
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,460
You're late.

748
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,460
Well, I was going
to be summoned anyway.

749
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,130
It was a hassle to come here
on my own.

750
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,630
You're late. You ought to apologize.

751
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,200
Don't make a joke
as soon as you join us.

752
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,200
Joke?

753
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,570
I'm sure Dan Oh understands
it's not a joke.

754
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,740
Sit down.

755
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,750
I'm sorry.

756
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,110
You won't even remember it
even if I apologize.

757
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,580
Have you gone mad?

758
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,450
Darn it. I'm so sick of this.

759
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,360
Is that all you want to say
in the shadow?

760
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,460
I heard that you ran into
Chairman Oh of Serinne Fashion.

761
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,060
Yes, I ran into him a while ago.

762
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,870
I prepared this for Dan Oh.

763
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,740
I love you
the most in this world, Kyung.

764
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,080
I'm right here, Dan Oh.

765
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,280
Right. Your father
might be disappointed.

766
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,610
That's not possible.

767
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,480
You always say this to me.

768
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,580
"Your happiness is my happiness."

769
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,350
And this is my happiness?

770
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,620
I can't ever win, can I?

771
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,420
I must address you
as my in-law pretty soon.

772
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,490
Thanks to you,

773
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,990
I have a good, reliable son.

774
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,430
Thank you so much.
I didn't prepare a present for you.

775
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,130
You gave it to me a long time ago.

776
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,870
I thought you threw it out.

777
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,840
You still had this?

778
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,010
Of course.

779
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,650
My 10-year crush is finally over.

780
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,950
It is true that little strokes
fell great oaks, right?

781
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,350
As if having a small heart
isn't enough,

782
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,090
I'll end up marrying a man
I don't even love.

783
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,900
It looks like you're about
to walk down the aisle.

784
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,260
I can even marry him tomorrow.

785
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,160
(Eun Dan Oh)

786
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,630
(Eun Dan Oh)

787
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:37,740
(Haru)

788
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,610
"Haru".

789
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:47,150
(Haru)

790
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,470
("Trumpet Creeper")

791
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,610
Dan Oh?

792
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,450
("Trumpet Creeper")

793
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,580
"Trumpet Creeper"?

794
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,650
("Trumpet Creeper")

795
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,230
I should have burnt it
a long time ago.

796
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,920
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

797
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,050
I can even marry him tomorrow.

798
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,130
What's with your face?

799
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,970
You look completely different
from the stage.

800
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,630
I'm just tired.

801
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,600
Do you know trumpet creeper?

802
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,540
Trumpet creeper?

803
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,880
This flower is called
trumpet creeper.

804
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,040
Oh, that?

805
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,380
You already know that
the writer chose that, not me.

806
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,580
Then...

807
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,550
what about how you said
you can marry me tomorrow?

808
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,720
That wasn't something...

809
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,920
I wanted to say either.

810
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,630
I hate this.

811
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,800
Why do you hate it?

812
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,570
You like me.

813
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,710
Like I said,

814
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,110
I was just set up to like you.

815
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,080
So you don't have to put on an act
in the shadow.

816
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,690
Where will I be on the next stage?

817
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,320
At a hospital? Or at a wedding hall?

818
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,560
I don't care what it is,
but the real Dan Oh isn't there.

819
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,300
You never showed your real self...

820
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,570
in every single moment
you were with me?

821
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,270
Then...

822
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,380
what about when you were a kid
in that hospital?

823
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,380
Are my memories of you...

824
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,450
real or fake?

825
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,390
I have no idea.

826
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,160
But I do know this for sure.

827
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,360
Everything that Dan Oh does
on stage from now on is...

828
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,400
all just what the writer wants.
Nothing more, nothing less.

829
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,780
If all these people are fake,

830
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,620
where are they all headed?

831
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,160
They all have their stories...

832
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,960
and the things that are
precious to them,

833
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,930
but they have no choice
but to do whatever the writer wants.

834
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,680
If I remained as Eun Dan Oh,
just an oblivious extra...

835
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,750
inside a romance comic...

836
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,860
Then I would've been
just a nameless Number 13.

837
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,300
This time, I'll change your story.

838
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,320
Dan Oh.

839
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,460
I'm sorry.

840
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,590
I came a bit too late.

841
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,170
Dan Oh.

842
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,610
Look at me.

843
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,780
I'm right here.

844
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,530
I won't go anywhere.

845
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,760
(Extra-ordinary You)
