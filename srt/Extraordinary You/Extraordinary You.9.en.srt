1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,270
Can I call you Haru?

3
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,940
Haru.

4
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,740
Haru.

5
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,800
Dan Oh.

6
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,750
If I remained as Eun Dan Oh,

7
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,020
just an oblivious extra...

8
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,990
inside a romance comic...

9
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,130
Then I would've been
just a nameless Number 13.

10
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,320
This time, I'll change your story.

11
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,470
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,870
I came a bit too late.

13
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Dan Oh.

14
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,410
Look at me.

15
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,020
I'm right here.

16
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,230
I won't go anywhere.

17
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,080
I still don't understand...

18
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,080
why you disappeared
and why you lost your memory.

19
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,490
I'm not really sure either.

20
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,890
But I came back.

21
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
Whatever.

22
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,659
You don't even know
how much time has passed.

23
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,570
No one knew who you were.

24
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,870
Someone else was
sitting in your seat.

25
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,670
Your name was gone from the roster.

26
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,480
And although you came back,
you seemed like someone else.

27
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,080
You didn't remember anything
that happened between us.

28
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm not going to change my fate.

29
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,860
I thought I would
never see you again, Haru.

30
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,730
It's all my fault.

31
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,100
If you hadn't saved me
out of the swimming pool...

32
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,010
Dan Oh.

33
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,710
Even if I went back to that time,

34
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,620
I would have saved you again
thousands and hundreds of times.

35
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,960
So don't say you're sorry.

36
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,670
Let's go. I'll walk you back.

37
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,070
No, I don't want to go.

38
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,740
What if you don't remember me again?

39
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,350
What if you disappear again?

40
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,220
Let's stay together, please.

41
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,590
Let's stay together
until the next stage.

42
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,740
Dan Oh.

43
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,420
Look at me.

44
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,590
I won't let you go.

45
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,770
Never.

46
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,670
I'll never let you go.

47
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,600
It's beautiful here.

48
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,740
("Secret")

49
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,500
- You're really Haru, aren't you?
- Hey.

50
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,310
This is the 10th time you asked him.

51
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,610
And what's my name?

52
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Lee Do Hwa.

53
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,650
Yes, this is it.

54
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,650
You say my name the same way,
but that's how the real Haru sounds.

55
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,950
Where have you been, my friend?

56
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,620
Hey, take this. Have it all.

57
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,990
- What?
- Think about it.

58
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,960
You suddenly took on
a different role from an extra,

59
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,330
then you had to remember
everything again.

60
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,130
It must've been such a toll, my man.

61
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,230
Hey, man. I'll open these for you.

62
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,630
- No way, I will.
- No, I will.

63
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,030
- No way.
- No, I'm doing it.

64
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,070
- No, I want to do it.
- I'll open it for him.

65
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,740
Gosh, you're eating so much.

66
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,440
Drink this.

67
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,970
Have some of this. Have more.

68
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,580
He looks so scrawny.

69
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,610
What?

70
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,810
Haru...

71
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,480
- I'm fine.
- Don't lie.

72
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
I know you're not fine.

73
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,890
Thanks to the writer's fickleness,

74
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,890
I could've lost a close friend.

75
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,789
I really can't get used to this.

76
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,130
I think he lost his memory...

77
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,600
because he got a new role.

78
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
And he regained his memory...

79
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,430
I'm sure of it.
It was his subconscious.

80
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,970
Deep in your subconscious,

81
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,140
you desperately wanted
to remember her.

82
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,240
Really?

83
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,370
Do you like her?

84
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,880
You should've told me sooner.

85
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,910
Guys! Haru is back! He's back!

86
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,250
Dan Oh, join me.

87
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,280
Haru is back!

88
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,450
Guys! Haru is back!

89
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,150
Hurry!

90
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,990
He's back!

91
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,670
Dan Oh, what are you doing?

92
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,010
Is there anything you want to do?

93
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,340
Just say it.
I'll do anything for you.

94
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,880
Do you crave any food?

95
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,480
I want tteok-bokki! Many YouTubers
are eating tteok-bokki these days.

96
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,550
You know that you should order...

97
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,880
extra cheese
and Chinese glass noodles, right?

98
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
Of course, I do.

99
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
- Is that tasty for you?
- What?

100
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,990
You have no idea.

101
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,060
Tell me the truth.
You've never had tteok-bokki, right?

102
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,630
It's only because I chose not to.

103
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,070
My mom banned me from eating
anything too salty.

104
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,970
You're a good daughter
during times like this.

105
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,340
Say it, and I'll buy it for you.

106
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,570
Hurry, this is your chance.

107
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,110
Tteok-bokki with extra cheese
and Chinese glass noodles.

108
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,910
Shall we all go have tteok-bokki?

109
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,080
What?

110
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,580
- Why?
- It didn't sound like you just now.

111
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,150
What do you mean?
It totally sounded like him.

112
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,620
Let's go before he changes his mind.
Let's go!

113
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,990
All right, let's go.

114
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
Writer, not here.

115
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,830
Dan Oh, why are you here?

116
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,100
I have no idea.

117
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,560
Kyung wanted to meet me here.

118
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,530
Kyung? I knew it.

119
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,870
- Hey, Ju Da.
- Hello.

120
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,370
You can leave
after cleaning the place.

121
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,770
I just came, though.

122
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,540
We sold all our sandwiches.

123
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,240
- What?
- Someone bought them all.

124
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,650
They bought all of them?

125
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,650
They also paid to use the store.

126
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,760
Why is the writer taking so long?

127
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,000
Excuse me, but we are closed
for the day.

128
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,470
I believe you should open up now.

129
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,240
You see, I bought
all of your sandwiches.

130
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,970
This is it. It's time for some
cheesy, romance storyline.

131
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,980
It's good.

132
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,080
- Right?
- Yes.

133
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,780
You can have it.

134
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,920
Attention, everyone.

135
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,490
I've prepared
a belated, welcome-back party...

136
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,460
for Do Hwa's return to A3.

137
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,030
Do Hwa, my woman congratulates you.

138
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,030
- Your woman?
- Yes, my woman.

139
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,470
What's wrong? Have you forgotten?

140
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,440
A3 shines the brightest
when you're all together.

141
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,540
My gosh, this is too childish
for me.

142
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,710
Enjoy.

143
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,580
If you enjoy the food, you won't
gain weight. So enjoy.

144
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,310
Give me a minute.

145
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Ta-da.

146
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,460
This is my special sandwich
just for you.

147
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,430
It's your welcome-back gift.

148
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,460
Thanks.

149
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,170
I believe this is for me.

150
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,970
Why would my woman make this
for you?

151
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,870
You keep saying, "my woman".

152
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,740
Are you two officially a couple?

153
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
- Didn't you hear the announcement?
- That's why I'm asking.

154
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,440
Did you forget about our fair
and square competition?

155
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,580
Did Ju Da accept your feelings?

156
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,980
Don't tell me you're doing this
without her consent.

157
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,020
That is...

158
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,390
I'll cut it in half.

159
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,920
Friends shouldn't fight, okay?

160
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,740
You humiliated me.

161
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,410
Gosh, you're so childish.

162
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,550
Where are you going?

163
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,880
When did you prepare all this?

164
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
Ju Da and I will soon...

165
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,020
I know. You will date soon enough.

166
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,120
The Nam Ju I know will
make her happy for sure.

167
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,430
You know well.

168
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,500
That's why I gave her up.

169
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,470
I'm so sick of the stage.

170
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,970
It's so cheesy for me.

171
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Give that to me.

172
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,890
I keep changing
the background photo,

173
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,950
but it keeps coming back.

174
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,220
I like it.

175
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,530
- What?
- I like the photo.

176
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,730
You always whined
about how you hated it.

177
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,270
Hey, what are you doing?

178
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,170
You begged me to take this photo
for your background photo.

179
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,540
That happened on the stage.

180
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,680
You said you didn't know
whether the Dan Oh in my memory...

181
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,950
was real or fake.

182
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,880
But I wish she was real.

183
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
What?

184
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,620
There must be a reason why...

185
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,820
everything's going back
to how it was before.

186
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,860
("Trumpet Creeper")

187
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

188
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,600
Dan Oh?

189
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,010
"Trumpet Creeper".

190
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,430
("Illustrated Wild Flower Book 365")

191
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,640
(Trumpet creeper)

192
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,640
"Trumpet creeper".

193
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,080
(Trumpet creeper)

194
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,570
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

195
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,270
I'm looking for something.

196
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,370
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't remember a thing.

197
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,040
There must be a reason why
this happened to you.

198
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,750
Don't provoke the writer
and live a quiet life as an extra.

199
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,820
No, thanks.

200
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,060
There's someone I want to protect.

201
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,390
Then you should regain
your memory first.

202
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,860
I am.

203
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,190
I see.

204
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,900
Good luck with that.

205
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,050
It was his subconscious.

206
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,220
Deep in your subconscious,

207
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,160
you desperately wanted
to remember her.

208
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,970
Dan Oh, snap out of it, will you?

209
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,980
I wonder what you're thinking of.

210
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,480
What?

211
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,450
Tell me.

212
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,320
About what?

213
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,460
Don't if you don't want to.

214
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,560
Sae Mi.

215
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,030
What does it mean
when you keep thinking...

216
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,030
of someone in your subconscious?

217
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,630
That means you like them.

218
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,830
Is that so? I like him?

219
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,070
Should I tell you how to tell
if you really like someone or not?

220
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,710
Yes.

221
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,510
Imagine kissing him.

222
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,180
- What?
- Just trust me and do it.

223
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,870
- Gosh. Do you have a death wish?
- Really? That bad?

224
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Come on.

225
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,270
If you can imagine kissing him,
it means you like him.

226
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,710
If you don't even want
to imagine it,

227
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
it means you're friends with him.

228
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,310
I see. Yes, I understand.

229
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,720
So did your subconscious
tell you to kiss Kyung?

230
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,850
My goodness, no!

231
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,120
- Come on.
- Come on.

232
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,550
A strong denial means...

233
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,190
A strong affirmation.

234
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,220
That's not true. It really is not!

235
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,230
Move.

236
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,530
"That's not true. It really is not!"

237
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,830
Oh, my.

238
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,470
"Trumpet creeper"?

239
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,540
Where have you been?

240
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,280
I was on the stage just now.

241
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,080
You were?

242
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,820
I think Nam Ju is going
to confess his feelings to Ju Da.

243
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,990
He's ordering the students
to set up an event.

244
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,890
Although I know everything,
I pretended to be clueless.

245
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,090
I said a few lines
just how the writer wanted.

246
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,260
Like a guy in a romance comic book.

247
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,890
Hey,

248
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,930
you said you read all of romance
comic books in our library, right?

249
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,060
Almost.

250
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,170
Then,

251
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,500
have you ever read a book
that seemed similar to ours?

252
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,600
Similar?

253
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,340
Like the characters
and the drawing techniques.

254
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,940
Of course.

255
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,110
Did you...

256
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,610
read the book too?

257
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,250
Even the lines are exactly the same.

258
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,120
You know how romance books are.
They are about the same.

259
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,690
There are the heroine, male
protagonist, and deuteragonist.

260
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,790
I'm not talking about Nam Ju here.

261
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,930
Darn it. I thought you actually did.

262
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,100
Shouldn't you get going?
The bell just rang.

263
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll get going.

264
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,880
Hey, this is going to be fun.

265
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,950
I must have blown so many balloons.

266
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,350
I can't even breathe.

267
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,750
Balloons, seriously?

268
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,490
It's not a birthday party
for an elementary school kid.

269
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,920
I should just finish off Nam Ju!

270
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Do what to me?

271
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,900
We're making sure that
the preparation is going smoothly.

272
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,860
Thank you
for entrusting this to us.

273
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Just trust us.

274
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,340
Hey.

275
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,140
Should we tip Sae Mi off?

276
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,770
Hey, what should we do?
Should we tell her?

277
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,880
No. Let's save it.

278
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,410
It's our last card to play
when time is crucial. Hang in there.

279
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,220
Hey, are we playing a game here?
Hey, Sae Mi!

280
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,480
Hey, stop.

281
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,350
Stop what?

282
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,390
If you do,
you'll end up getting sick.

283
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,590
Gosh. Did you guys cause
trouble again?

284
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,520
No, it's not us. It's Nam Ju.

285
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,530
What did he do?

286
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,360
Nam Ju looks handsome as always.

287
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,670
All right, everyone. Take your seat.
Let's begin our class.

288
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

289
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,750
This piece was...

290
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
composed by Beethoven.

291
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,290
This variation is in F major,
and the opus number is 34.

292
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,120
Let me tell you how variations work.

293
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,690
They add their own style to
the songs of the past generation...

294
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,360
and come up
with various musical expressions.

295
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,530
They do not limit themselves
to the conventional styles of music.

296
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,070
And by doing so, they are
looking for the joy of music.

297
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,070
This doesn't sound fun, right?

298
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,270
No.

299
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,170
Do you want to play hooky?

300
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,170
Play hooky?

301
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,750
- Sir!
- Yes. Do you have a question?

302
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,450
I need to go to the nurse's office.

303
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,720
Dan Oh, are you not well?

304
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,050
- Kyung, where are you?
- He's not here yet.

305
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,720
- Sir.
- Yes.

306
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,760
I can take her to the nurse.

307
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,090
You?

308
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,470
My gosh. No way.

309
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,800
- He grabbed her hand.
- Goodness.

310
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,300
Dan Oh is holding his hand.

311
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,600
Where are you going, Dan Oh?

312
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,410
Me? To play hooky!

313
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,740
- What?
- Play hooky?

314
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,440
- Where are they going?
- They are playing hooky!

315
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,710
- Where are you going?
- Wait.

316
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,180
- Where did they go?
- They're playing hooky.

317
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,680
- Come back.
- Sit down.

318
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,350
Sae Mi's eyes were about to pop out.

319
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,320
Right. Did you see their faces?

320
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,960
Sae Mi's eyes went wide when
she heard we were playing hooky.

321
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,930
This is nice.

322
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,470
Exactly.

323
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,340
I can't believe
I'm playing hooky with you.

324
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,700
This is fun.

325
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Same here.

326
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,810
You really got it back.

327
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,810
Doesn't it hurt?

328
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,720
No, not at all.

329
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,690
I feel relieved
now that I saw your scar.

330
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,360
It feels like you're back
to the Haru that I know.

331
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,600
Haru.

332
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,730
Haru.

333
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,470
What?

334
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,970
Just because. I like it.

335
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,710
I didn't know that every day
of my life was so precious.

336
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,640
I'm not going
to change anything now.

337
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,950
This is the last time
I will pull a stunt like this.

338
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,980
I will not...

339
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,050
try to have you
during my stage again.

340
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,490
If this is the last time,

341
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,820
should we go further?

342
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,660
Farther? To where?

343
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,700
My gosh, the weather is great.

344
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Right.

345
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,900
There are so many antiques here.

346
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,970
Right.

347
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,310
Let's go inside here.

348
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,410
Sure.

349
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
- Let's go.
- Okay.

350
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,860
This store is connected too.

351
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,960
Isn't this your diary?

352
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
What?

353
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,270
This is Su Chul's Polaroid.

354
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,270
These tennis balls...

355
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,400
They are Kyung's.

356
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,610
Hey, haven't we seen this before?

357
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,580
Yes. At the camp.

358
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,360
It was under the bench.
Why is this here?

359
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,570
I thought this was a new place.

360
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,140
Everything is in the writer's world.

361
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,840
But even the writer...

362
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,040
wouldn't know we're here right now.

363
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,310
When I think about that,

364
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,850
this moment feels very special.

365
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,350
A scene of our own
that the writer would never know.

366
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,960
- This feels like playing hooky.
- Yes.

367
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,990
A special moment.

368
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,600
Hey, you are awful at this game.

369
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,400
- Gosh.
- You're dead again?

370
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Gosh.

371
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,270
I let you win.

372
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,340
Sure. Let's go with that.

373
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,910
Let's play one more round.

374
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,910
This is really good.

375
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,410
It's my favorite.

376
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,490
Haru, you should eat this.

377
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,360
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Time is up.

378
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,290
Stick out your tongue.

379
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,870
I'll take a photo and brag about it
to my friends.

380
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,870
Haru, you hold this.

381
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,170
Let's take a photo together.

382
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,570
I don't want to.

383
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,170
Come on, don't be shy.

384
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,240
This is all part of making memories.

385
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I won't take it.

386
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,110
No, look at the camera.
Right there.

387
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,350
Come on, look at the camera.
This is all about our memories.

388
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,290
In 1, 2, 3.

389
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,290
It's done.

390
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,090
(Menu)

391
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,490
(Set as Wallpaper)

392
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,630
I hope the photo
doesn't change this time.

393
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,200
Change? What changes?

394
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,500
It keeps changing back
to the photo I took with Kyung.

395
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,370
There isn't a day
when he doesn't show up on my stage.

396
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,810
Now, he's on your stage too.

397
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm really happy that you have
a role in our comic book.

398
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,120
But you're bound to listen to Kyung
because of your set-up.

399
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,820
I don't care what my set-up is
when it comes to protecting you.

400
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,460
What nonsense are you talking about?
I think I need to protect you now.

401
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,060
Tell me if Kyung bothers you.

402
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,160
I won't let that slide.

403
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,760
What will you do then?

404
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,000
I'll teach him a lesson. You know?

405
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
I'll use my fist to do that.
Just like this.

406
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,940
- Like this?
- Yes.

407
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,840
I should give him the clout.
A hard one at that.

408
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,280
Dan Oh, your fist looks so scary.

409
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,810
It really hurts.

410
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,950
- Really?
- Yes, do you want to get one?

411
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Aren't I strong?

412
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,520
Yes, you are.

413
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,190
What is it?

414
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,260
My gosh, what a relief.
It's really there.

415
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,230
I keep wanting to check...

416
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,400
if you still have your scar or not,

417
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
if you're really Haru or not.

418
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,770
You have to keep your promise.

419
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,810
- My promise?
- Don't ever disappear by yourself.

420
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,990
But how did this scar come back?

421
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,860
There was something weird
in the library.

422
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,770
Wait, is it something
that looks like a black hole?

423
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,200
I've seen that too.

424
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,470
It's okay. I'm sure it's nothing.

425
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,870
It's probably one of those
weird things you see in the shadow,

426
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,440
like how chairs fly
and clocks run backward.

427
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,710
But I'm so glad
that you got this scar back.

428
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,220
I really love this.

429
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,050
It's proof that
you're the real Haru.

430
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,390
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,050
I'm sorry. It just happened.

432
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,230
Let's go.

433
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,010
Haru.

434
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,880
Haru...

435
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,990
Fine, I'll stop fooling around.

436
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,790
Did you think I would really stop?

437
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,890
You're completely wet!

438
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm... I'm sorry.

439
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,150
I'm sorry.
I was just fooling around.

440
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,760
I've never felt like this before.

441
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,600
I feel like I was born again
thanks to you, Haru.

442
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,300
I've never felt like this before.

443
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,640
I feel like I was born again
thanks to you,

444
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Haru.

445
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,950
I'll cut my class again next time.

446
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,800
There will be a next time, right?

447
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,400
- Haru!
- Wait for us.

448
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,670
- Let's walk together.
- Hey.

449
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,040
Are you troubled, my friend?

450
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,340
It's just...
Have you ever felt like...

451
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,850
something new that you've seen is
already familiar?

452
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,150
It's called deja vu.

453
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,750
Although something happens
to you for the first time,

454
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,520
you have an odd feeling
or see an illusion...

455
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,620
that makes you think you've
already seen it or experienced it.

456
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,020
It's French, and it means
"Already seen it."

457
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,290
- In English, "Already seen"...
- My gosh.

458
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,590
He's saying that it's nothing.
It happens to me too.

459
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,600
- No way, it's deja vu.
- No, it's not.

460
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,960
My gosh. It is.

461
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Hey, Haru.

462
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,500
Take my bag to the court.

463
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,510
That's your character.
You do to whatever I say.

464
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,940
We'll take it there.

465
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,610
Yes, it's on our way,

466
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,710
and it's only 500m away.

467
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,650
Yes, we're all friends in
the same class. We can do...

468
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,720
Is this fun to you?

469
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,260
Take your own bag.

470
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,530
Your character always bullies
and hurts people.

471
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,600
Is there a reason behind that?

472
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,330
- What?
- You need to fix that.

473
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,640
What's with him?

474
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,150
What's with those arrogant eyes?

475
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,390
I knew it was weird.

476
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,460
You said you weren't self-aware,
but you kept getting in my way.

477
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,389
You returned to that cheeky jerk.

478
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,030
Or did you pretend like you weren't
self-aware to make a fool of me?

479
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,940
You must be quite anxious.

480
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
What?

481
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,550
Why?

482
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,250
Are you scared that
I returned to my old self?

483
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,719
That jerk.

484
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,900
Hi, Dan Oh.

485
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,469
Dan Oh, your fiance is here.

486
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,900
My fiance?

487
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,880
- You surprised me.
- I hate her.

488
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,350
Dan Oh, I hate Ju Da so much.

489
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,650
I liked him first.

490
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,180
I was always by Nam Ju's side.

491
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,490
- Right.
- Why does she lead him on?

492
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,460
She already knows
that Nam Ju likes her,

493
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,260
but she just keeps leading him on.

494
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,030
I would just give up
if they started dating.

495
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,030
What?

496
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,730
Aren't they dating?

497
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,500
It's driving me insane because
it's just Nam Ju who's doing that.

498
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,230
Ju Da didn't give him an answer,

499
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,540
but Nam Ju was
made to look like a fool...

500
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,670
because he announced her
as his official girlfriend.

501
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,140
It's not like
we require an answer for that.

502
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,440
Fine, I did bully Ju Da.

503
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,340
But Nam Ju ran at me
before I did anything.

504
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,450
Does he have a tracker on her?

505
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,920
I always end up looking like a jerk.

506
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,320
You can't help it, Sae Mi.
You're the villain.

507
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,150
Hey.

508
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,890
- The villain?
- Yes.

509
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,960
Me?

510
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Is there a villain
who gets their spot taken?

511
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,400
- Sae Mi.
- I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

512
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,330
Sae Mi, wait up!
Why did she leave this behind?

513
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,640
That wasn't necessary.

514
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,710
No, you need to tell them
what their role is...

515
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,010
for them to understand.

516
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,210
Haru.

517
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,650
He seems to remember everything now.

518
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,250
I'm relieved. I was worried.

519
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,520
Are you the real Dan Oh right now?

520
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,150
Are you happy that he's back?

521
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,560
I can't tell the difference.

522
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,530
You keep switching back and forth
between the real and the fake you.

523
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,830
Of course, I'm real.

524
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,960
He disappeared because of me,
but now, he's back.

525
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,100
Is that it?

526
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,830
- What?
- Is there nothing more?

527
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,940
Dan Oh, is the seat
next to you vacant?

528
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Yes.

529
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,950
Why are you sitting here?

530
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,310
What's wrong with you?

531
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,080
I told you. They need to know
when they're crossing the line.

532
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,120
How am I crossing the line?

533
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,190
You're sitting right in front of me.

534
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,120
Think about your role.

535
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,160
I don't care...

536
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,560
about such things.

537
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
You.

538
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll watch and see
if you say the same thing...

539
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,270
during the next stage.

540
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,250
I thought he was becoming nicer,

541
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,020
but he's back to being rude.

542
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,550
Don't mind him. Let's eat.

543
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,690
Okay.

544
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,960
Eat up.

545
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,790
- You too.
- Okay.

546
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,200
Are you okay?

547
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,930
About what Kyung said earlier...

548
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,940
I really do wish this scene
would end so you'd forget.

549
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,510
"Scene"?

550
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,440
He's rude to me as well,
so do understand.

551
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,540
Look at you,
siding with your fiance.

552
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,350
It's not like that. I'm concerned
about you.

553
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,050
I know.

554
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,320
No matter how rude he is to me,

555
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,750
my love for Nam Ju
will never falter.

556
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,920
I'm relieved.

557
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,760
Lucky you.

558
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Why?

559
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,390
Your 10-year unrequited love
has finally come true.

560
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,100
I have to learn from you.

561
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,330
Compared to your unwavering love,
I'm just a teeny...

562
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,330
He's not it.

563
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,170
What? What do you mean?

564
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,310
The guy I like isn't Kyung.

565
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,440
Then?

566
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,380
Ha...

567
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,850
"Ha"? "Ha"?

568
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,520
Haru?

569
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,550
Our classmate, Haru?

570
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,650
Haru from the tennis team?

571
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,720
- Kyung's sidekick?
- Yes.

572
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,860
Dan Oh...

573
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,030
I know you won't remember this,
but I thought you should know.

574
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,700
You're my best friend, after all.

575
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,860
Dan Oh...

576
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Don't be so touched.

577
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,100
This is too ridiculous.

578
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,640
How could you like
your fiance's sidekick?

579
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,270
- Wait.
- My friend is a cheater.

580
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,440
- No, I'm not.
- Dan Oh is a cheater.

581
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,610
Sae Mi. Sae Mi.

582
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,780
Sae Mi, breathe.

583
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,950
Nam Ju and Ju Da?

584
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,560
"Seuli High School's
Official Couple"?

585
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,960
Oh, my gosh. What is all this?

586
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
"Seuli High School's
Official Couple"?

587
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
"1-day Anniversary?"
That's so cheesy.

588
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,770
So what? Nam Ju is so romantic.

589
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,400
- Hey!
- Why?

590
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,370
I'm feeling dizzy.

591
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,870
Sae Mi, should I teach Ju Da
a lesson?

592
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,070
- Grab my hand.
- Okay.

593
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,980
Lucky Ju Da.

594
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,510
Will she become the daughter-in-law
of Serinne?

595
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,380
What? "Daughter-in-law"? Come here.

596
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,080
- Hey!
- We shouldn't let that happen.

597
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,590
There are four candidates
for Serinne's daughter-in-law.

598
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,420
- What?
- Exactly.

599
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,260
And she was the last one to show up.

600
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,760
But doesn't she look pretty there?

601
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,460
Ju Da, I will destroy you!

602
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,370
I will destroy you!

603
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,300
I will!

604
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,050
Hey, stop them!

605
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,850
Guys, who said Sae Mi
should know about this?

606
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,490
- It wasn't me.
- From what I remember,

607
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,620
it was him.

608
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,150
It wasn't me.

609
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,590
Whoever it may be,
if Nam Ju finds out,

610
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,730
- we're dead meat.
- We're dead meat.

611
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,490
Ju Da.

612
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,430
Nam Ju was looking for you.

613
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,960
He wants you to come
to the science room right away.

614
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,070
He does?

615
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,130
Thanks for letting me know.

616
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,170
- Go on, now.
- Okay.

617
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,080
It took me days to prepare this.

618
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,850
- What should we do?
- Be quiet.

619
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,950
Nam Ju!

620
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,490
We will put in our best effort
to prepare it all over again.

621
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,190
Right. Something this trivial will
only take a few all-nighters.

622
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,790
- Right?
- Yes, we can do it.

623
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,860
Hey.

624
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,930
"Something this trivial"?

625
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,860
Wait, that's not what I meant.

626
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,330
- I want it done by tomorrow.
- "Tomorrow"?

627
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,500
If it isn't done by then,
you better be prepared.

628
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,410
Especially you.

629
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,450
Nam Ju?

630
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,790
How stupid are you
to be this gullible?

631
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,400
Would you go anywhere
if Nam Ju told you to come?

632
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,900
Ju Da, do you even have any pride?

633
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,070
Sae Mi, you told me earlier
that Nam Ju was looking for me.

634
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,500
And why exactly would he?

635
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,910
What?

636
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,640
Look at that face. You look naive...

637
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,410
and feign innocence.

638
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,250
You purposely kissed him,
didn't you?

639
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,290
You're frightening.

640
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,920
That's not it.

641
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,260
You obviously know
that Nam Ju likes you,

642
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,290
yet you play the field with Do Hwa.
It gives me the creeps.

643
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,290
It's admirable how you have
both guys under your thumb,

644
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,760
claiming to be just friends.

645
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,000
I mean, it's creepy.

646
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,330
Don't you pity Do Hwa?

647
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,300
He was almost banished from A3.

648
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,700
We won't stand still.

649
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,570
- Guys...
- How dare you?

650
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,040
Ju Da.

651
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,180
Does the world seem so rosy
since Nam Ju is good to you?

652
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,520
Do you feel like
a Seuli High School student...

653
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,150
since you're wearing our uniform?

654
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,720
That uniform doesn't suit you.

655
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,060
See these shoes you're wearing?

656
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,370
These shoes suit you the best.

657
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,870
Know your place.

658
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,970
Let's go.

659
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,910
Ju Da.

660
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,780
Take some time in this dark room
and realize where you stand.

661
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,160
Open up.

662
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,100
Open up. Open this!

663
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,400
Take some time to self-reflect.

664
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,100
We'll see you later.

665
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,300
Let's go.

666
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,000
Didn't you hear something?

667
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,140
I'm not sure.

668
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,840
Do Hwa. I have something to say.

669
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,150
Don't beat around the bush
and just say it.

670
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,050
Like you predicted,
Ju Da didn't give me an answer.

671
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,380
Come to think of it,
I was too selfish.

672
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,320
But then again, I wasn't going
to force her to go out with me.

673
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,360
I was going to make a confession.

674
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,030
Then why are you confessing it
to me?

675
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,330
I just wanted you to know.

676
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,200
I already did.

677
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,170
I was going to confess today,

678
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,030
- but I postponed it to tomorrow.
- Why?

679
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,770
I don't know who did it,
but the auditorium is a mess.

680
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,540
I told the boys
to restore everything by tomorrow.

681
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,510
Hey! Where's Ju Da right now?
Can you reach her?

682
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,610
Not yet. She's not checking my text.

683
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,280
She could be in danger.

684
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,580
Go on and look for her.

685
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,180
Never mind. Let me.

686
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,820
Even if I went, you'd be the one
finding her on stage.

687
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,650
What do you mean
by Ju Da is in danger?

688
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,820
- Explain it to me.
- Romance comics are the same.

689
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,760
Who do you think caused that mess
and bullied her?

690
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,290
- What?
- I'm sure they locked her up...

691
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,700
in a classroom or something.

692
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,600
I have no idea
what you're babbling about.

693
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,570
Hurry up and go.
The stage will begin anyway,

694
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:51,870
but make it happen quicker.

695
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:52,940
Darn it.

696
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,580
Nam Ju?

697
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,280
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

698
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Do Hwa...

699
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,450
Why couldn't the writer speed up
the scene?

700
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,120
Soon, Nam Ju will be here.

701
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,320
Let's stay together until then.

702
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Let's leave right now. I'm scared.

703
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,760
Even if we leave right now,

704
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,400
the next scene will be...

705
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,030
I can't believe them.

706
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,570
They just won't stop bullying you
over your shoes.

707
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,380
I hope you won't remember
what happened.

708
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,420
"Remember"?

709
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,260
I wish you could only remember
the good things.

710
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,390
Nam Ju?

711
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Where were you?
I was about to go insane.

712
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,530
- Nam Ju.
- Okay. No one...

713
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,030
No one can bully you ever again.

714
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,770
You are...

715
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,570
my girlfriend.

716
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,420
Are you going home?

717
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,750
Give it back.

718
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:21,290
You said you only set a photo
you took with me as the wallpaper.

719
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,060
What are you doing?

720
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,360
Why do you keep trying
to pick a fight with me?

721
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,630
Pick a fight?

722
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,530
You don't need to do that
in the shadow.

723
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,170
I get that we have our parts
to play on our stage,

724
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,840
but you bully Sae Mi and Haru.

725
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,410
Stop hurting my friends.

726
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,680
You said the same thing
that jerk said.

727
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
What?

728
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
Bye.

729
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,650
Where do you want
to have our wedding?

730
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,160
Dan Oh, you're only 18.

731
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,860
Stop talking about the wedding.

732
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,460
We should follow
what the elders decide.

733
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,530
I want to have an outdoor wedding
on a sunny day.

734
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,160
I want to invite my friends.

735
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,400
And I have to do it before I die.

736
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,070
Hey.

737
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,970
Don't say something like that.

738
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,510
It's annoying.

739
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,880
Do you find marrying me
that annoying?

740
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,210
You accepted, so I thought...

741
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,710
No, that's not what I meant.

742
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,920
Dan Oh, are you all right?

743
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,620
Get on my back.

744
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,990
Hospital again?

745
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,830
I'm sorry.

746
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,340
Why don't you explain to him
what happened in detail?

747
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,670
We were going home together...

748
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,240
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

749
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
No.

750
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,680
It's not your fault, Kyung.

751
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,790
Dan Oh's days are numbered?

752
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,330
According to Ju Hwa,
she might not last a year.

753
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,660
That is why she wanted to rush
marrying Kyung.

754
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,960
I gave it some thought,
and I don't think it's fair to you.

755
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,830
And it will be painful
for Kyung too.

756
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,670
Chairman Eun, why don't we
make Dan Oh's wish come true?

757
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,940
Kyung knows that Dan Oh is sick...

758
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,980
and that she doesn't have much time.

759
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,610
Kyung already knew?

760
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,780
Yes. Well,

761
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,880
I don't think Dan Oh could
have hidden it even if she tried.

762
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,050
This marriage isn't just for Dan Oh.

763
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,360
Kyung desperately wants it too.

764
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,860
It doesn't matter
how much time she has left.

765
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,860
Kyung also...

766
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,160
wants to give the best memories...

767
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,970
to Dan Oh.

768
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,580
- Why are you here?
- Well...

769
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,250
Your dad called us.

770
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,590
We heard Dan Oh is very sick.

771
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,120
What's so funny?

772
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,620
I just thought
you were so consistent.

773
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,460
You're a nasty woman who only
thinks about money on and off stage.

774
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,630
Are you worried...

775
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:15,660
that Dad might...

776
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,900
hand me over all of his shares
after I marry Dan Oh?

777
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,270
How dare you come here?

778
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,110
My mother died
in this very hospital.

779
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,910
If you took my mom's spot,
behave yourself. Don't be greedy.

780
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,080
You punk. How dare you run
your mouth like that here?

781
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,980
What if Chairman Eun sees you?

782
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,220
Are you all right?

783
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,000
The three of you...

784
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,500
look happy
given that you're a fake family.

785
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,140
You look like a real family.

786
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,680
But how come you were
never kind to me and my mom?

787
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,340
I told you to watch your mouth.

788
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,650
You're a hypocrite
to take advantage of a dying girl.

789
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,750
- You brat.
- Dad.

790
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,450
Jun Hyun.

791
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,090
Nothing about this family...

792
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,360
seems right.

793
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,290
Come back here.

794
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,560
Come back here!

795
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,170
Kyung! Kyung!

796
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,830
Kyung.

797
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,340
Don't follow me!
You're making me crazy.

798
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,070
Kyung, can't...

799
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,840
- Can't we just live like this?
- What?

800
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,250
He's not always violent like that.

801
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,780
Once you marry Dan Oh...

802
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,650
What do you know, punk?

803
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,490
All you can do is follow your rule.

804
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,930
Your character always bullies
and hurts people.

805
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,360
Is there a reason behind that?

806
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,530
I get that we have our parts
to play on our stage,

807
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,170
but you bully Sae Mi and Haru.

808
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,840
Stop hurting my friends.

809
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,810
This feels awful.

810
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,910
Kyung.

811
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,780
Please don't change anything.

812
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,060
Hospital and medicine.

813
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,770
I was better off when I was
the bridge between Nam Ju and Ju Da.

814
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Are you all right?

815
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,580
Thank you.

816
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,450
My family told me yesterday...

817
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,050
that our wedding will be moved up.

818
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:54,390
Do you really want to marry me?

819
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,830
- Yes.
- Don't.

820
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,660
I'm giving you an out for your sake.

821
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,630
I don't care
if I get married or not.

822
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,670
But you'll get hurt.

823
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,470
I'm fine.

824
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,800
You're Kyung.

825
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,570
The love of my life.

826
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,350
It looked like you waited
for your stage to be over.

827
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,110
There's nothing I can do
of my own accord.

828
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,580
I can't talk or move
the way I want to.

829
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,650
I know that you hate the stage too.

830
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,750
It's Haru.

831
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,020
What were you doing?

832
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,330
Nothing.
I was just taking my medication.

833
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,670
Haru has returned.

834
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,310
What's happening? Why?

835
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:45,470
How?

836
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,380
Did he...

837
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,550
remember everything
including the past?

838
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:57,920
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

839
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,990
Dan Oh?

840
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,360
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

841
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,130
How is this nothing?
She looks just like Dan Oh.

842
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,160
No way.

843
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,200
Even Kyung?

844
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,270
Where's that book?

845
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,240
- What book?
- "Trumpet Creeper".

846
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,010
The book you took from me
the other day.

847
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,280
I can't seem to find it
no matter how hard I look.

848
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,950
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

849
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,280
This is odd.

850
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,020
I keep getting a feeling
that there's something in that book.

851
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,560
Once I find that book,

852
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,730
you will have to talk to me.

853
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:07,020
("Trumpet Creeper")

854
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:26,510
At this rate, it will turn out
exactly like the previous book.

855
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,510
What on earth
is the writer thinking?

856
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,360
If I wished that you would not
get your memories back,

857
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,160
does it make me a horrible man?

858
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,760
It sounds like there's something
I shouldn't remember.

859
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,670
This flower is in my memories.

860
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,770
I thought it was a dream,

861
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,640
but it wasn't.

862
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,510
Will it happen in the future?

863
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,180
Or did it already happen?

864
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,020
That's why I couldn't give you
an answer about your beginning.

865
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,190
The secret about your beginning...

866
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,220
doesn't exist here.

867
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:17,960
Is that why I could remember Dan Oh?

868
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,800
You said that the trumpet creeper
symbolizes waiting.

869
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,470
I think I know
why I kept seeing this flower.

870
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,370
It was telling me
to remember Dan Oh...

871
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,880
and to wait until Dan Oh...

872
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:37,750
finds me.

873
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,260
Will it happen in the future?

874
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,260
Or did it already happen?

875
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,260
It happened before,

876
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,530
and it'll happen in the future.

877
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,070
(Baek Kyung)

878
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,780
(Eun Dan Oh, Haru)

879
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,750
You used the same characters
over and over again,

880
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,480
and the lines are the same too.

881
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,820
It'll be weirder
if they didn't become self-aware.

882
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,120
I burnt the book,

883
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,390
but there is something
that I just can't stop.

884
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,640
If they find out the entire story,

885
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,880
we might have to see
that tragedy once again.

886
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:53,460
I don't mind you bringing me
into many different works,

887
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,490
but you're very cruel.

888
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,760
If you're going to do this,
just make me oblivious again.

889
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,070
(Haru, Baek Kyung)

890
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:12,970
(Haru, Baek Kyung)

891
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,840
Kyung is all fired up today.

892
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,850
He'll only stop
once someone collapses.

893
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,810
He always goes crazy
once something ticks him off.

894
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:23,350
- No one can stop him.
- Bo Tong might end up dying.

895
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,760
- Why?
- It's Kyung.

896
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,190
How dare you...

897
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,360
open my locker
without my permission,

898
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,800
go around with Dan Oh,
and be friend to Do Hwa?

899
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,800
Some might think that you're me.

900
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,300
Why is that?

901
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,600
If the writer created this world,

902
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,470
why are you the only one
who gets special treatment?

903
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,270
I want to know that too.

904
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,540
Why does the writer
keep putting me with you?

905
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,780
I'll find the answer.

906
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,830
- Go, Kyung!
- Go, Kyung!

907
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:08,730
- You can do it, Haru!
- You can do it, Haru!

908
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,630
Stop it, that's enough.

909
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,820
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

910
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:34,220
Oh, gosh. Did Kyung get hurt?
Oh, no.

911
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,720
He made Kyung fall over.

912
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,960
Haru, I knew it!
You were so awesome.

913
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,900
He lost after making me
look like this?

914
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,670
There was a 99.854 percent chance
that Kyung would win.

915
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,410
It doesn't matter who wins
if two friends are playing.

916
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,980
They both showed great manners.

917
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,980
- That was great. Give them a hand.
- Yes.

918
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,010
One more time.

919
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,250
The game is over.

920
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,920
Don't you dare move another inch.

921
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,860
You can't win against me.

922
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,590
- Why not?
- Because you can't!

923
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,290
Because that's my character?

924
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,530
Let's play again until I win.

925
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,200
Let's go again.

926
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:20,570
Let's play again! Again!

927
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:21,800
- My gosh!
- Goodness!

928
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,610
Something bad might happen
at this rate. Someone stop him.

929
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,210
- My gosh.
- What are you looking at? What?

930
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,720
Do you think you're something
just because Dan Oh is nice to you?

931
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,990
Do I have to remind you again she's
just an extra who has a crush on me?

932
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,260
I don't care
what you say or do to me.

933
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,330
But...

934
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,900
don't ever hurt Dan Oh in any way
no matter where you are.

935
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,100
I can't stand to see her get hurt,

936
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,340
be concerned about you,

937
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,210
or have a tough time because of you.

938
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,840
You're just an extra
who never gets a scene without me.

939
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,210
What can you do?

940
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,880
I'll change the story...

941
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,280
if I must.

942
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,450
You'll change it?

943
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,820
You'll change the story
which has been drawn already?

944
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,220
It hasn't been drawn yet.

945
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,890
It's still getting drawn.

946
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,490
The pages that the writer
didn't fill in are still empty.

947
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,160
How can you be sure?

948
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,370
How can you be sure if
the writer is still drawing this...

949
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,130
or if the writer finished it
already?

950
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:30,570
Stop talking nonsense
and saying you'll change the story.

951
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,710
Just stay out of
Dan Oh and my story.

952
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,710
Do you like...

953
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,910
Dan Oh?

954
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,350
- What?
- Forget about your character.

955
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,690
Do you like Dan Oh?

956
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,190
Who are you to ask me that?

957
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,360
Because I do.

958
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,890
I like Dan Oh.

959
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,360
Hey!

960
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:27,930
Say that again?

961
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,760
Please let me go.

962
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,570
You don't know where you came from.
Why are you trying to leave me?

963
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:33,670
You're right.

964
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:37,610
I'm a bloke who doesn't even know
where I came from.

965
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,410
However,

966
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,080
if there is no answer
to my beginning,

967
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,450
then I will create my own answer.

968
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,450
Don't you dare take another step.

969
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,990
You cannot leave me
because you aren't supposed to.

970
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,290
That's your fate.

971
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,460
That's the reason why you were born
and existed to this day.

972
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,070
I will leave.

973
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,500
Say that again.

974
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,540
Say it again! Again!

975
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,680
You're in love
with Eun Mu Young's daughter.

976
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,920
