3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,740
I need...

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,050
to change the stage.

5
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,710
Man, my brother has one odd taste.

6
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,250
But you look kind of similar to him.

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,050
He's the only guy who would
dress like that in this world.

8
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,519
The writer would have no idea...

9
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,250
that this is you
even if the stage begins.

10

won't make Dan Oh's heart better.

- Dr. Lee?

Hello.

15
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,470
I thought he was Dr. Lee
because of his outfit.

16
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,270
Is he your friend?

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,970
He's very handsome.

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,200
Right.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,570
Don't stare at her like that.

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,310
You stand out
because you're too handsome.

make the extra look too good?

This is so inconvenient.

23

Hurry up.

- Just go.
- You can come with me too.

25

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,760
But the drawings...

170
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,860
Are happening in real life.

171
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,860
It feels like
someone is watching us.

172
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
I am sure you were aware of it
as well.

173
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,200
No.

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,270
You felt it.

175
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,370
You felt that absurd things
were happening to you.

176
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,610
But there is one thing
that you do not know.

177
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,620
If you die in a place
that is not in this book,

178
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,290
you still exist,

179
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,890
but your memories disappear.

180
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
My story will end soon.

181
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,460
But I hope
you can change your story.

182
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,880
I don't want to read it with you.

183
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,690
If I do,

184
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,090
I think it will infuriate me.

185
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,500
Stop acting as if you don't know.

186
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,000
You read the book,
"Trumpet Creeper", here.

187
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,140
The scar on your hand.

188
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,740
Have you thought
about why you have it?

189
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,280
The writer gave you a hint,
so you can remember...

190
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,050
the consequence you faced
after changing the stage.

191
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Shall I tell you?

192
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,020
You killed her.

193
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,890
You killed Dan Oh.

194
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,390
I guess you didn't know.

195
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,630
Right, you probably didn't.

196
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,530
If you knew,
you wouldn't be with her.

197
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,030
You were the one
who tried to kill Dan Oh.

198
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,370
So you didn't see
how Dan Oh died in the story?

199
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,900
In this story, the writer has
no reason to kill Dan Oh.

200
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,740
Hadn't you changed it,
she could have been...

201
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,340
healthier with the surgery.

202
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,710
Everything is repeating
in the world of comics.

203
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,580
I can only put up
with this messed-up story...

204
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,150
because I have Dan Oh.

205
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,220
So stop it...

206
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,120
before you put Dan Oh
in bigger danger.

207
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,110
He said that
I was definitely getting better.

208
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Dan Oh.

209
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,550
My gosh, Haru is so amazing.

210
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,980
How could he completely
change the stage?

211
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,520
Change? Haru did?

212
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,650
He was worried about you.

213
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,220
A small action of Haru,
trying to stop your surgery...

214
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,030
No, this is pretty big.

215
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,490
I'm so envious.

216
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,030
What?

217
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,530
Were there not
that many empty pages before?

218
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,150
(Thank you.)

219
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,480
Right.

220
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,020
I doubt that the writer would heal
my heart problem that easily.

221
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,760
If the story goes on as it is,

222
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,990
will I die?

223
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Haru!

224
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,650
Hello.

225
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,720
Are you all right?

226
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Yes.

227
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,330
My heart has gotten
healthy overnight.

228
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,460
I found out
that someone changed my fate.

229
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,170
I wonder who that is.

230
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,300
Haru, thank you
for helping me change my fate.

231
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Dan Oh.

232
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,040
If our story...

233
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,240
is going according to
the writer's intention...

234
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,550
I'll try to change it to the end.

235
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,250
So you need to help me. Okay?

236
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,750
When we keep changing the story,

237
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,120
we can make our own fates
according to our will.

238
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,190
If we succeed,

239
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,560
I'll take care of you.

240
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,790
Number 13
and a terminally ill patient.

241
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,820
These are our characters.

242
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,490
If we change our stories, it'll be
a happy ending for both of us.

243
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,560
"Okay.
Let's change our fate together."

244
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,150
Here. Take them.

245
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,950
If I tie myself
to the previous story,

246
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,990
I feel like I'm losing out
to the writer.

247
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,690
- Dan Oh.
- Pretend that I don't know...

248
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,290
about this in front of Haru.

249
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,330
You told me not to tell him
about the surgery.

250
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,760
Why do you want to stay with him...

251
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,500
when you have to hide things
and hold yourself back?

252
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,470
What if something goes wrong
with you?

253
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm getting better
even without the surgery.

254
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,210
Good luck.

255
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,690
That's the same ring.

256
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,730
I guess some things are bound to...

257
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,530
It's my late mother's.

258
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,430
I wanted to give this to you.

259
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,900
No one asked me to do this.

260
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,000
It is coming from my heart.

261
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,400
And this scene
is right in front of Haru.

262
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,940
It's my late mother's.

263
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
Why are you giving me this?

264
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,910
I wanted to give this to you.

265
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,440
No one asked me to do this.

266
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,680
It is coming from my heart.

267
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,950
This stage is...

268
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,220
too cruel for me...

269
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,930
and for Kyung too.

270
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,930
We both know
how we feel about each other,

271
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,570
but we can only act
according to the writer's intention.

272
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,670
Kyung.

273
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm really happy...

274
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,040
that my love has reached you.

275
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,170
Baek Kyung.

276
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,740
It has always been you for me.

277
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,750
You're my beginning.

278
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,450
Kyung.

279
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,160
I'm your beginning, am I not?

280
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,860
I always liked Haru from the start.

281
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,160
He's my beginning.

282
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,030
It has always been you for me.

283
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,430
You're my beginning.

284
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Kyung.

285
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,810
What an honor.

286
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,540
You came to me, not Haru.

287
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,290
What are you doing?

288
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,690
I know how important this is to you.

289
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,960
That's why I can't accept it.

290
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,060
When I see you,

291
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,260
I'm reminded of my mother.

292
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,470
The hospital smell.

293
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,670
The sound of the heart rate monitor.

294
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,470
And her forced smile
in case I got worried.

295
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,410
Using you...

296
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,440
to continue this fake relationship
was torture.

297
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,810
I actually wanted to hate you.

298
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,680
But you were always sincere
when I wasn't.

299
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,820
No matter how much I pushed you...

300
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,020
and how angry I got at you,
you still liked me.

301
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,590
So I had no choice
but to like you back.

302
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,100
You'll leave anyway.

303
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I'll be the one
who will be left alone.

304
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,440
Kyung.

305
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,940
The only moment when I'm myself
in this bleak world...

306
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,080
is during the stage with you.

307
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,950
In the previous work
as well as this world,

308
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,780
during the scenes between you and me
drawn by the writer,

309
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,320
that's the real me.

310
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,820
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,190
- Why?
- I won't follow the storyboard.

312
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,560
Just like how I was hurt for being
in unrequited love on stage,

313
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,800
you will be hurt...

314
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,770
during the shadow in our future.

315
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,740
You didn't have to clarify that.

316
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,210
I'm really sorry.

318
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,110
What do these flowers mean?

319
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,140
"Dan Oh is stupid."

320
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,350
(Light pink roses mean,
"Only you know how I feel.")

321
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,830
My gosh, I'm so jealous of Dan Oh.

322
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,170
Who will put a ring on my finger?

323
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,340
It will be Nam Ju, right?

324
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
Did you just laugh?

325
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,510
You just laughed at me, right?

326
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,580
What was that?

327
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,320
Sae Mi.

328
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,720
Sae Mi, Nam Ju and I are
officially dating.

329
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,190
- What?
- What did she say?

330
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,730
I figured
you'll find out soon enough.

331
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,700
You know that
Nam Ju likes to declare things.

332
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,100
Unbelievable.

333
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,100
I gave this a thought...

334
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,610
and figured that
I feel sorry for you.

335
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,410
The only thing
you can do is bully me.

336
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,950
- You feel sorry for me?
- Even though I know...

337
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,750
that you can't do things
as you wish,

338
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,750
that still doesn't make the wounds
I got from you melt away.

339
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,520
I'm so glad...

340
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,960
I'm the main character...

341
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,560
and you're the villain.

342
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,960
Nam Ju.

343
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,470
I declare that...

344
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,340
Oh Nam Ju and Yeo Ju Da are
an official couple...

345
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,440
of Seuli High School.

346
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,940
- What?
- What?

347
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,510
So we don't have to
blow balloons anymore?

348
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,510
Come on, clap for them.

349
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,680
Let's give a hand for the official
couple of Seuli High School.

350
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,350
Hey!

351
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,480
If anyone messes with Ju Da,

352
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,090
I'll take that as a challenge
against me, the number one here.

353
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,290
Why? Because Ju Da is my woman.

354
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,460
- My gosh.
- That's huge.

355
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
- Ju Da, you.
- Didn't you hear him?

356
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,740
If you bully me from now on,
you'll be challenging Nam Ju.

357
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,510
Nam Ju.

358
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,750
- My gosh.
- You two look great.

359
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,710
- Goodness.
- What a great couple.

360
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,090
I don't feel bad for you.

361
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,260
- What?
- I've gone through too much.

362
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,930
They take out their feelings for you
by bullying me.

363
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,000
I can't just sit around anymore.

364
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,330
I won't let them bully you.

365
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,400
You won't let them?

366
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,770
Because I like you.

367
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,170
I'll do anything for you.

368
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,240
I don't want it.

369
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,410
I'm sick and tired
of getting your help.

370
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,040
That's not the right posture.

371
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,540
Do Hwa.

372
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,710
I'll help you.

373
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,950
Okay, first of all,
fix this on your left shoulder.

374
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,250
And take this hand and put it here.

375
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,520
The bow.

376
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,690
- Like this?
- Yes.

377
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,030
I believe 80 percent of playing
the violin depends on your feelings.

378
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,500
The same song may sound different...

379
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,770
depending on
the emotion of the performer.

380
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,510
Do Hwa, then you play it.

381
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,710
What do you want to listen to?

382
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,110
"Love's Joy"?

383
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,650
Do you know the kind of emotion
you need for that song?

384
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,850
I'm not sure.

385
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,850
Ju Da.

386
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,920
I like you.

387
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,590
That's the emotion.

388
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,750
Do you think we can be together
until the end of that song?

389
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,020
No. Probably not.

390
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,940
Ju Da.

391
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,510
What is this?

392
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,910
To celebrate how we became
an official couple.

393
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,210
I'm giving these back to you.

394
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,850
These shoes are yours
and yours only,

395
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,810
like Cinderella's glass shoes.

396
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,650
- Nam Ju.
- You said that...

397
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,320
Cinderella goes back to her life
after midnight.

398
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,090
And you came back to me.

399
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,320
You're Ju Da,
Oh Nam Ju's Cinderella.

400
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,060
Yes, hello?

401
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,830
Yes, that's me.

402
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,770
What? My grandma?

403
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,010
What is it? What's wrong?

404
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,480
It's too obvious.

405
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,350
Your mom will help me out
and she'll yell at me again.

406
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,990
My grandma is ill. I have to go.

407
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,660
- And the operation fee...
- I'll take care of that.

408
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,930
So I have to get your help again?

409
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,900
Why? Will you overuse
your power with money again?

410
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,400
Overuse my power?

411
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,500
Do you think money can solve
all of life's problems?

412
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,870
It's because I like you.

413
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,040
I'll do anything for you.

414
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,170
You don't even remember.

415
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,280
(Dan Oh's Bucket List)

416
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,290
You killed her.

417
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,260
You killed Dan Oh.

418
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,490
The writer gave you a hint,
so you can remember...

419
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,730
the consequence you faced
after changing the stage.

420
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,730
If you knew,
you wouldn't be with her.

421
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,530
Haru.

422
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,240
- Haru.
- Yes?

423
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,510
Were you thinking about
something serious again?

424
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,310
Something like,
"Is she going to die?"

425
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,750
It's all because of the writer.

426
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,780
How can they use
the same characters again?

427
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,950
Writer, be honest. Okay?

428
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,220
I'm sure your readers
all complain to you. Right?

429
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,230
But because the writer was careless,
the stage changed many times,

430
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,230
the operation was canceled,
and I take way fewer medications.

431
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,730
I believe that you and I are...

432
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,070
changing this world this much
without the writer noticing us.

433
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,370
Eun Dan Oh won't die that easily.

434
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,770
I don't need this list either.

435
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,840
(Dan Oh's Bucket List)

436
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,280
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

437
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,050
You wanted to do things like these?

438
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,320
- Yes.
- Then should we cut class again?

439
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Okay.

440
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,850
My gosh, it's so pretty!

441
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,820
Dan Oh, calm down.
Go just a little slower.

442
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,230
Haru, thanks to you,
my world got a lot bigger.

443
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,330
Thank you.

444
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,400
The writer may be careless,

445
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,470
but they're pretty detailed
about these things.

446
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,840
- Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh!

447
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,500
Why are they here?

448
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,910
I called them.

449
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,910
- Haru, you're an idiot.
- I didn't feel like staying there.

450
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,180
- I'm glad.
- Why?

451
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,750
It's simple. Nam Ju and Ju Da
became an official couple...

452
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,320
after Dan Oh and Kyung...

453
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,150
My gosh! Be quiet.

454
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,590
Okay. Let's go and change things up!

455
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,590
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

456
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,690
Let's go!

457
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,060
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

458
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,400
Can you bring those?

459
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,400
This is so good.

460
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
It's great to have a meal out here.

461
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,240
Yes, really.

462
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,000
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

463
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,410
You go.

464
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,310
- Great job.
- Hey, the center is here, now.

465
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,080
So it's safe to put one here.

466
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,720
- I'll put it here just to be safe.
- Okay.

467
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
It's getting a bit wobbly now.

468
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,690
Come on, lie down.

469
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,190
- Indian bop!
- Indian bop!

470
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,260
Take this.

471
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,090
Haru.

472
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,000
No, you shouldn't shake
the handle around that much.

473
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,300
It's scary.

474
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:04,570
Wait, no. No, keep your eyes ahead.

475
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,410
You can't keep turning it around.

476
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,010
- Dan Oh, one second.
- Yes?

477
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,250
You need to hold me with your arms.

478
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,150
Like this?

479
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,820
- Yes.
- Okay.

480
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,240
Are you working the pedal?

481
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,010
Of course. Gosh, this is tough.

482
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,880
Why is this so hard?
I'm about to throw up.

483
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,080
Gosh, look at the pretty flower.

484
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,410
It's so pretty.

485
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,520
Sae Mi, you aren't doing it,
are you?

486
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,020
Look ahead. Be careful.

487
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,450
You aren't doing it!

488
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,860
No, I am.

489
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,930
Haru!

490
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,540
Dan Oh.

491
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,250
Dan Oh. Are you okay?

492
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,820
Yes, I'm fine.

493
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,989
I'm fine.

00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,500
(Guardian: Yeo Ju Da)

496
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,300
(Operating Room)

497
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Ju Da.

498
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,330
Nam Ju.

499
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,500
What will happen to my grandma?

500
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,880
She'll be fine.

501
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,690
The operation...

502
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,990
will go well.
I'll make sure that happens.

503
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,660
- Why?
- Because I like you.

504
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,730
- You always say the same thing.
- And Ju Da.

505
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,000
You can cry when you're with me.

506
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,630
I like how bright you are
and how you smile all the time,

507
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,830
but I like...

508
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,370
everything that you are.

509
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,210
I already know
Ju Da is at the hospital,

510
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,280
but I have to come
all the way here to check.

511
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,050
And I can only be on the scene
after Nam Ju gets there.

512
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,970
(Operating Room)

513
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,280
It's heartbreaking to realize...

514
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,010
that there's nothing I can do
for Ju Da.

515
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,540
Hey, Dried Squid Fairy?

516
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,810
Yes, I'm Dried Squid Fairy.

517
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,610
Hey, we don't have
dried squid on the menu today.

518
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,520
Why?

519
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,120
I have to get going.

520
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,520
I'm busier on my day off.

521
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,590
I wanted to be friends with you.

522
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,360
You seemed oddly familiar.

523
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,290
I'll visit the cafeteria next time.

524
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,630
It has been forever...

525
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,970
since I saw you smile like that.

526
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,170
I'm very glad.

527
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,790
Haru, do you know
how to change the setup?

528
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,600
You can change the stage
like it's not a big deal.

529
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,000
Never mind, you aren't the writer.

530
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,470
There's no way you can change that.

531
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,340
Oh, Ju Da's grandma
just got an operation.

532
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,980
- An operation?
- She was supposed to get it done,

533
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,780
and the operation went well.

534
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,250
But do you know what I did?

535
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,850
What do you think?
I just watched her.

536
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,850
Do Hwa.

537
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,350
You truly adore and think dearly
of her in the shadow.

538
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,090
Right? That's enough, isn't it?

539
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,030
Anyway, she was at our hospital,

540
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,790
and her doctor was my brother.

541
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,960
We should've done something
when we were there together.

542
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,630
How did you change it this time?

543
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,770
Can you tell me?
At least I can give it a shot.

544
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,800
I changed the charts.

545
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
The charts?

546
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,310
There were only two charts
that looked real.

547
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,380
The past subjunctive mood is...

548
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,250
easier to get if you memorize
the expressions in sentences.

549
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,720
Let's take a look.
"If it were not for..."

550
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,520
Ju Da's grandma got the operation...

551
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,090
on the day that
Dan Oh was supposed to get it.

552
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,190
(Medical Chart)

553
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,030
(Ok Kyung Soon)

554
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,100
(Eun Dan Oh)

555
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,070
Then that means
Dan Oh isn't entirely well.

556
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,540
The writer gave you a hint,
so you can remember...

557
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,050
the consequence you faced
after changing the stage.

558
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
Su Hyang.

559
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,000
Are you acquainted with Dried Squid?

560
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,100
- What?
- You two looked close.

561
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,370
And it seems like
you know something.

562
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,040
- Me?
- Oh, it's nothing.

563
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,170
It seems like
you might know something.

564
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,240
Kyung!

565
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,410
Go.

566
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,350
Just leave.

567
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,560
Do not mess with her.

568
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,090
I didn't mess with her.

569
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,360
Don't mess with us in this world.

570
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,100
"Us in this world"?

571
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,430
Just pretend like you never saw her,

572
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,530
and don't even say hi to her.

573
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,870
That's odd.

574
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,540
She isn't even aware of herself.

575
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,470
You killed her.

576
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,740
She died...

577
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,980
She died twice because of you!

578
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,990
She died twice?

579
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,590
It's very convenient...

580
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,160
to not remember.

581
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,100
You took away her self-awareness,

582
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,230
and you killed her again
when she returned.

583
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,930
I took away her self-awareness?

584
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,440
If you die on the stage,

585
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,540
you disappear completely
in the comic book.

586
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,410
But if you die in the shadow,
only your self-awareness disappears.

587
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,540
They end up
not remembering a thing...

588
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,750
and return to
just another character...

589
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,550
who moves
only according to the setup.

590
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,290
You go back...

591
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,290
to the time when you're
better off knowing nothing.

592
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,470
Hey.

593
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,420
- Are you in pain?
- That's odd.

594
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,180
I was fine on the stage,

595
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,050
but I'm still in pain in the shadow.

596
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,590
It's okay. I'll go see Dr. Lee.

597
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,730
Dan Oh.

598
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,840
Wait, what happened?

599
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,110
You fell down...

600
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,670
during P.E. class.

601
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,180
Why don't you lie down?

602
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,180
Lie down until you feel better.

603
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,620
Stay here.

604
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,180
I'll bring your bag.

605
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,980
(Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo)

606
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,790
Dan Oh.

607
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,490
Dan Oh. Are you all right?

608
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,660
Don't be so worried.

609
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
As you know,

610
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,500
my character on the stage is
a weak girl.

611
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,430
What's wrong?

612
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,740
Haru, can you bring me
the medicine from my bag?

613
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,740
Wait here.

614
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,150
You're still here.

615
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,450
Yes, Dan Oh is sick.

616
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,550
I see.

617
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,020
Do you...

618
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,250
remember everything?

619
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,690
About what?

620
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,120
How I and Dan Oh was...

621
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,660
in "Trumpet Creeper".

622
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,230
You were...

623
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,130
the same.

624
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,930
I think...

625
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,900
I was probably better than this.

626
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,570
When you die in the shadow,
you're no longer aware of yourself.

627
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,040
Then you'll lose all
your precious memories.

628
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,410
It'd be too sad...

629
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,180
to live as you're told to.

630
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,580
But when you're no longer aware
of yourself,

631
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,920
you won't be able
to feel sad about it.

632
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,560
You'll only feel the feelings
the writer allows.

633
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,130
That doesn't sound too bad.

634
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,630
At times, being oblivious...

635
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,170
is less cruel in this world.

636
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,670
I'll take you home.

637
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,280
I'm so happy these days.

638
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,120
My heart is finally starting
to get better.

639
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,760
And most of all, you're by my side.

640
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,280
- Please stop the car.
- Can you...

641
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,580
just go?

642
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,510
What? I will die?

643
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,180
Prince Kyung, his father,
and their gang...

644
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,780
are trying to frame your father
as a traitor.

645
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,850
I will save you...

646
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,250
no matter what.

647
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,530
I am finally starting
to have an appetite.

648
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,900
No matter what,

649
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,170
His Majesty should not eat
what you give him.

650
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,940
Why is my body not moving?

651
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,020
Your Majesty, do forgive me.

652
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,190
You must spit out what you just had.

653
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,890
I cannot escape death.

654
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,160
No matter what happens,

655
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,560
it will not be your fault.

656
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,330
You must not go down
the same path as I did.

657
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,770
Where is Haru?

658
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,080
She conspired against the King.

659
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,210
Kill her.

660
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,450
Yes, my lord.

661
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:26,930
Kill him!

662
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,800
Stop.

663
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,130
Do not stop!

664
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,170
Stop!

665
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,440
Father.

666
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,790
Prove it.

667
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,330
Prove that you did not deceive me.

668
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,030
Prove that you did not covet
my woman.

669
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,070
Prove...

670
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,500
that you serve me.

671
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:21,710
Stab her.

672
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,760
Haru...

673
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,850
Why?

674
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,060
My lady.

675
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,830
My lady.

676
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,700
My lady.

677
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,540
My lady.

678
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,640
Dan Oh.

679
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,910
Dan Oh!

680
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,190
I was the one...

681
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,330
who killed her.

682
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,150
This is fine.

683
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,790
Haru.

684
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,820
Haru.

685
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,500
Haru, what's wrong?

686
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,260
I'm not going to water
the flowers anymore.

687
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,260
No matter how well
I took care of them,

688
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,360
they withered if the writer wanted.

689
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,700
I couldn't do anything for them.

690
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,000
You couldn't do anything?

691
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,870
It's like how I can't do anything...

692
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,140
without you, my guardian,
and Nam Ju,

693
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,410
the most popular student
at our school.

694
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,240
You're a guardian, and he's
the most popular student.

695
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,080
Isn't that funny?

696
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,810
Why didn't I realize
how cringy that was?

697
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,150
It was worse for me.

698
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,880
Flowers blossomed around your face.

699
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,860
By the way, Ju Da.

700
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,860
Do you want to change
the story as well?

701
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,200
Just like Dan Oh and Haru.

702
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,170
They changed the story,
and it changed their set-up a bit.

703
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,600
What do you want to change?

704
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,440
Me?

705
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,710
What do you think I want to do?

706
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,690
I'm relieved. I truly am.

707
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,160
Your grandma pulled through.

708
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,460
You must've been worried sick.

709
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,060
Starting now,
I'll take care of her...

710
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,630
on the honor of A3.

711
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,870
What is this? It's so silly.

712
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,670
I thought this put
you in a good mood.

713
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,740
Starting now,
you'll only be in a good mood.

714
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,720
I don't like sweet things.

715
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
What?

716
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,960
But you definitely
liked them before.

717
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,830
What do you like then?

718
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,330
Money.

719
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,130
Don't be surprised.

720
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,770
But that doesn't mean
that you can buy my love with money.

721
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,440
I didn't want...

722
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:43,340
to feel the same way...

723
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,980
with the character
in the comic book.

724
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,750
But this isn't all that bad.

725
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,120
It's not fair.

726
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,150
Dan Oh, I think
your health is getting better.

727
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,260
It's the power of love.

728
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,860
Power of Kyung's love.

729
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,190
It's not that.

730
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,430
It's because Haru changed
the stage for me.

731
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,100
- "The stage"?
- Haru?

732
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,330
Haru?

733
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,700
Haru!

734
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,840
Dan Oh.

735
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,670
Are you all right?

736
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,240
Haru.

737
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,250
You were never able...

738
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,120
to protect Dan Oh.

739
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,990
Haru...

740
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
Haru.

741
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,190
Haru.

742
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,490
Why are you avoiding me?

743
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,190
I don't know what to do.

744
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,430
If the scenes we changed so far...

745
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,070
have been hurting you all along,

746
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,200
what am I supposed to do?

747
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,650
My health is getting so much better.
I'm almost fully recovered.

748
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,690
So you knew.

749
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,490
Seriously. Dr. Lee tells
everyone about my condition.

750
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,100
Congratulations
on your recovery, Dan Oh.

751
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,470
I love you the most in this world.

752
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,970
I feel like I'm dreaming.

753
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,510
Why?

754
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,680
My heart is all better now,
and you like me.

755
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,180
I'm happy,

756
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,720
but I'm scared at the same time
because I'm too happy.

757
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,960
Sorry.

758
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,760
You're healthy now.

759
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,100
You don't need him to change
your terminally-ill fate...

760
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,440
- anymore.
- Haru isn't someone...

761
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,640
who can change my fate.

762
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,670
Haru is my fate.

763
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,990
(Congratulations
on your recovery, Dan Oh.)

764
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,760
Haru!

765
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,960
It's about Dan Oh.
She's at the hospital.

766
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
What are you talking about?

767
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,060
In the book, it said
she completely recovered now.

768
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,100
My brother told me
that she's severely ill.

769
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,840
What? Why isn't
that drawn in the book?

770
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,740
Hey, Haru!

771
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,660
Dan Oh.

772
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,960
If you die on the stage,

773
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,600
you disappear completely
in the comic book.

774
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,070
But if you die in the shadow,
only your self-awareness disappears.

775
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,970
Then you'll lose all
your precious memories.

776
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,840
It'd be too sad...

777
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,680
to live as you're told to.

778
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,610
- Stab her.
- I cannot.

779
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,610
Haru.

780
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,180
I...

781
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,680
I killed you.

782
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,940
How's Dan Oh?

783
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,240
How's she?

784
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,910
I wasn't going to change the story.

785
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,250
I just...

786
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,950
couldn't change anything.

787
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,730
Just like in the previous story,

788
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,460
my character hasn't changed.

789
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:39,990
Dan Oh.

790
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:42,190
Dan Oh.

791
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,920
Dan Oh.

792
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,520
I saw you in the comic book.

793
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,660
Your heart is healthy now.

794
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,770
So you'll be fine.

795
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,900
When we move onto the next scene...

796
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,420
Dan Oh.

797
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,190
Dan Oh.

798
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,760
Dan Oh, wake up.

799
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,990
Dan Oh.

800
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,230
Please...

801
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,740
Please let the next stage come.

802
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,410
Please.

803
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,910
Please skip over to the next scene.

804
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,150
Please... Please let Dan Oh live.

805
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,760
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

806
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,430
What are you doing after school?

807
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,400
Why?

808
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,330
Just asking.

809
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,370
Are you asking me out?

810
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,770
Something like that.

811
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,890
Dan Oh.

812
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:12,170
Dan Oh.

813
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:56,850
(Extra-ordinary You)
