1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,930
From now on,

3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,360
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

4
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,800
- No, Kyung!
- Kyung, you're awesome!

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,340
- Dan Oh, get away from him!
- All right!

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,940
- Dan Oh!
- Really?

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,070
Come on, Dan Oh.

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,710
- All right!
- Yes!

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,780
- Hey, Dan Oh!
- All right!

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,780
- Are you serious?
- Looking great!

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,950
- Come on, get closer.
- No way.

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,220
- This is amazing.
- This is insane.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,350
What is it?

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,090
Dan Oh, I'll accept...

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,820
your sincere love.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,290
If this is some kind of a joke,

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,930
you need to stop.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,090
I'm not joking.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm going to try to like you...

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,470
as of now.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,070
- You're awesome!
- My gosh.

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,340
- This is huge.
- Goodness.

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,210
- My gosh.
- Come on, Dan Oh.

24
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,640
This is insane.

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,270
Let me go.

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,310
You're looking at me,

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,680
but why does it feel like
you're talking to someone else?

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,590
You.

29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,590
Don't you dare toy
with people's feelings.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,630
"Toy"?

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,400
Isn't that what you're doing to me?

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,030
You used to cry because of me
and now...

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,700
How could I not be upset
by what you have just said?

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,340
That wasn't me.
It was what the writer wanted.

35
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,240
- What?
- I've never liked you willingly.

36
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,010
Say it again.

37
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,550
Repeat what you just said.

38
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,220
Kyung, I've never liked you.

39
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,350
The pain will slowly
get worse and worse...

40
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,380
if you make a mess of the stage
in order to find your answer.

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,290
Stop Dan Oh.

42
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,390
Haru!

43
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,230
The stage changed.

44
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,200
Once the story begins,
everything needs to fall into place.

45
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,240
So why weren't
Nam Ju and Ju Da present?

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,910
Why? Why?

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,050
I'm sure there's something
between Do Hwa and Ju Da.

48
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,680
That's why the story changed,

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,050
and Kyung and I became
the main characters.

50
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,290
You and I changed the story!

51
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,450
Stop Dan Oh.

52
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,390
That's the reason why you exist.

53
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,590
The stage has changed.

54
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,030
Soon...

55
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,900
No.

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,970
Ju Da. I need to tell you something.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
What is it?

58
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,810
I like you.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Me too.

60
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,690
I like you.

61
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,460
We're friends.

62
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,329
"Friends"? That's what
the writer intends.

63
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,930
But I chose to like you.

64
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,700
This can't happen.

65
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,570
Why not?

66
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,710
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel right.

67
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,280
Think carefully about how you feel.

68
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,620
About how I feel?

69
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,880
Ju Da.

70
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,520
Please remember...

71
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,190
this moment.

72
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,610
(Yeo Ju Da)

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,270
Ju Da.

74
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Nam Ju.

75
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,950
You're late.

76
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,880
I was about to go.

77
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,920
There's no need.

78
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,760
The party is over.

79
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,730
Nam Ju!

80
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,770
Ju Da!

81
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,970
Are you okay?

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,010
What happened?

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,310
What is it?

84
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,250
- What's going on?
- What is it?

85
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,880
- Nam Ju!
- What?

86
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,680
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

87
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,520
It was a mistake.

88
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,190
Well...

89
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,630
Let me escort you.

90
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,330
- This way.
- I'll see you next time. I'm sorry.

91
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,730
Nam Ju.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,070
Why don't you brag...

93
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,540
in front of everyone
about how disrespectful you are?

94
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,580
Mother.

95
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,650
If your father was here,
he would've gone ballistic.

96
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,680
Do you think this is a joke?

97
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,050
Until when...

98
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,420
am I supposed to manage
all of this singlehandedly?

99
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
You're just afraid
of getting kicked out.

100
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,030
- What?
- Don't use...

101
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,090
your son's birthday party
for your fame.

102
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,960
- How dare you?
- I am sick...

103
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,970
of everything.

104
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,470
You...

105
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,510
Everything's changed, right?

106
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,280
Right?

107
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,340
Stop Dan Oh.

108
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,010
That's the reason why you exist.

109
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,970
(Your love for me never mattered
and never will!)

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,170
Isn't it basic etiquette
to make sure the book...

111
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,770
you borrowed is given back
in good quality?

112
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,510
I guess you were surprised
while reading.

113
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,880
But then again, I was startled
as well.

114
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
It's a cliche romance comic,

115
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,850
but I can no longer predict
the ending.

116
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,120
Just like you said,

117
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,260
the pain worsens every time
the story changes.

118
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,160
I told you so.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,830
So why are you enduring the pain
and helping her?

120
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,540
Because Dan Oh knew my name...

121
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,340
when I didn't.

122
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,280
I keep seeing these flowers that
I've never seen before.

123
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
What's strange is,

124
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,020
they always appear when she's there.

125
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,090
What's even stranger is,

126
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,090
both the flowers and she...

127
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,330
seem familiar to me.

128
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,900
I believed she'd tell me...

129
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,600
why I felt that way...

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,010
and where I began.

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,340
She won't be able
to tell you anything.

132
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,910
She's just an extra
who's running out of time.

133
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,480
The writer created this world.

134
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,320
And you guys are just two
of the countless extras.

135
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,090
There are neither answers
nor meanings.

136
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,660
The writer will get rid...

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
of any extras who will interfere
with the story.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,270
Then...

139
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,070
- will Dan Oh...
- She has a name and a role.

140
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,310
She's different from you.

141
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,980
There are levels for extras.

142
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,010
You're the only one...

143
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,550
who'll disappear.

144
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,300
- Haru.
- It's pretty.

145
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,270
Dan Oh!

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,770
Congratulations.
Kyung was so amazing.

147
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,410
Is your love finally coming true
after 10 years?

148
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,710
Are you two really getting married?

149
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,780
Did he say that you are truly
the only girl for him?

150
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,610
Tell us how you seduced him.

151
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,750
"Seduced"?

152
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,950
It only worked
because she was sincere.

153
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,890
It's just like my feelings
for Nam Ju.

154
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,290
- Lucky you.
- You are amazing.

155
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,290
- Tell us.
- How did you do it?

156
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,820
She has a name and a role.

157
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,330
- Did you guys kiss?
- Did you?

158
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,860
- She's different from you.
- Did he confess his love?

159
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,600
There are levels for extras.

160
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,900
- Where did you kiss?
- Tell us.

161
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,000
You're the only one...

162
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,840
who'll disappear.

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,900
- My gosh!
- Seriously?

164
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,940
- You kissed?
- They did?

165
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,680
Hey, Haru!

166
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,660
- Haru.
- Dan Oh!

167
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,530
I didn't know such a handsome guy
went to our school.

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,830
Who is he?

169
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,470
You're making my heart flutter
by staring at me like that.

170
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,370
I thought Nam Ju was your only love.

171
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,110
The slot for my second love
is still available.

172
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,340
Hey, look at how many likes
I'm getting!

173
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,210
- I'll take care of this.
- But the cake is ruined.

174
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,180
- From now on,
- Your video is very popular.

175
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,010
- No way.
- Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

176
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,480
Oh, my. Dan Oh, look at this.

177
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,320
Gosh, his lines and actions
were totally Nam Ju's style.

178
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,820
Look at him hugging her!

179
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,660
My gosh. I can't believe
how close you guys have gotten.

180
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,800
Gosh, Kyung is quite direct.

181
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,430
The entire school is going crazy.

182
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,270
All the kids in my class ask me...

183
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,630
if Kyung has really set his mind
on you.

184
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,470
Only men know how other men feel.

185
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,470
In my opinion, this is a done deal.

186
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,370
- See? Look at his eyes.
- But...

187
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,770
wasn't this too sudden?

188
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,510
I mean, I'm happy because Dan Oh
isn't in one-sided love anymore.

189
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,880
Up until a while ago,
he was seeing other girls.

190
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,850
Did something happen
between you two?

191
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,790
- Something did happen!
- Oh, my!

192
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,690
We really did it this time.

193
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,990
Ju Da.

194
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Nam Ju.

195
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,870
- Nam Ju.
- Hi, Nam Ju.

196
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,880
No way. He and I
have matching bracelets.

197
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,380
- Stop lying.
- What's wrong with you?

198
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,980
I'm serious.
I have the same one at home.

199
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,250
- Where did you buy it?
- You don't know anything.

200
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,450
Where did I buy it? Why do you ask?

201
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,290
You're not going to talk to Ju Da?

202
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,390
Why do I feel bad for those two?

203
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,890
You've been hassled by everyone
today because of me.

204
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,790
Hey, that's not your fault.

205
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,730
I changed it
because I wanted to change it.

206
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,370
I'd feel better once I told her
about my feelings, but...

207
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Anyway, where is Haru?

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,840
I don't know. He's been acting weird
since this morning.

209
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,540
Was the changed story
too shocking for him?

210
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,860
- Just tell us.
- What happened?

211
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,360
- Everyone, I don't even know.
- You tell us.

212
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,900
- Dan Oh.
- Go away. Stop.

213
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,330
- Dan Oh.
- Hey, go away. Get lost!

214
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,100
- Hey, stop it. That's enough.
- What happened?

215
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
- We have a problem!
- What is it?

216
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,300
We don't have a goalkeeper.

217
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,610
- I can do it. I'll do it.
- Let me do it. Me, me.

218
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,610
What about him?

219
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,280
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

220
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,610
- Is he in our class?
- Hey, you!

221
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,310
- You startled me.
- Do you want to play soccer?

222
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,910
- My goodness.
- I guess he can't hear us.

223
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,550
- He can't hear us.
- Don't even try.

224
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,280
- I'll go get him.
- Kyung.

225
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,650
- Do you know him?
- Do you know him?

226
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,820
- Hey.
- Get him to join us.

227
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,420
- Get him to join us.
- Let's go.

228
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,860
The guys want you
to play soccer with us.

229
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,860
Do you not have friends?

230
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,800
- I do.
- I see. Is that so?

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
But why are you alone then?

232
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,140
You don't hang out with A3
all the time.

233
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,470
I'm not that close with them.

234
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm really close with someone else.

235
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,210
The girl I'm engaged to.

236
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,210
You know her too, right?

237
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,150
Yes. Dan Oh.

238
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,080
I see. You knew?

239
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,220
Right. The whole school knows
she had a crush on me.

240
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,820
Should I let you in on a secret?

241
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,190
I'm just toying with her.

242
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,100
Are you serious?

243
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,800
She'd even die for me
if I'm a bit nicer to her.

244
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
But who on earth are you?

245
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,010
You won't know even if I tell you.

246
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,380
I see.

247
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,420
Is that so?

248
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,050
Dan Oh!

249
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,490
You're quite the trickster.

250
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,990
How dare you pull that stunt
at Nam Ju's birthday party?

251
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,320
Have you gone mad?

252
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,590
I guess faking your condition
worked on him.

253
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,360
What are you doing? What is this?

254
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,190
- Where are you going? Hey.
- Stop her.

255
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,830
This is pathetic, Dan Oh.

256
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,700
You should just keep
having a crush on him.

257
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,300
That kind of role
suits you perfectly.

258
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,240
That kind of role suits me?

259
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,270
- Yes.
- Aren't you embarrassed at all?

260
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,570
You begged him for love.

261
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,580
What?

262
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,050
- Look at her.
- She's pretending to be sick.

263
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,510
Hey, Dan Oh.

264
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,750
Dan Oh, you little...

265
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,120
What are you doing?

266
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Who are you?

267
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,890
Are you all right?

268
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,230
Move. Dan Oh, come with me
to the nurse's office.

269
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,760
- Kyung.
- Kyung.

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Oh, no.

271
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
What's your problem?

272
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,440
No, I'll take her.

273
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,820
Let's stop for a second.

274
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,120
Are you sure you're okay?

275
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,720
I think you have a fever too.

276
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,190
No. I'm...

277
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,830
I'll be fine
once I get some fresh air.

278
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,860
I promise.

279
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm in it too.

280
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,980
Can you let me keep this?

281
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,650
You acted as if you didn't
know me this morning.

282
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,990
What was that earlier?

283
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,860
You made my heart pound.

284
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,960
I just had something to think about.

285
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,060
I get it. Changing a scene
on the stage happens rarely.

286
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,230
I can understand
how confused you must be now.

287
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,839
But I still think
I'm creating my own moments...

288
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,810
to my heart's content.

289
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,880
What was that? Why did you smile?

290
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,690
You are right.

291
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,560
I'll just follow my heart too.

292
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,430
I'll keep going...

293
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,430
regardless of the price
I have to pay.

294
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Right?

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,500
Trust me and follow my lead
just like you've been doing so far.

296
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Okay?

297
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,710
Hey, wait up.

298
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,290
("Flower")

299
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,660
What about Dan Oh?
Why are you here alone?

300
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,430
I guess you are scared.

301
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,570
You told me that I would disappear.

302
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,800
Everyone would be scared then.

303
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,710
Exactly. It would've been nice
if you listened to me.

304
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,510
Your hand wouldn't have hurt.

305
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,410
And the story
wouldn't have changed either.

306
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,580
An extra in a romance comic
isn't that bad.

307
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
There's a lot to observe too.

308
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,450
Anyway, I'm glad.

309
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,820
You won't play along
with Dan Oh's plan, right?

310
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,920
It wasn't something I could stop.

311
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,760
I couldn't keep
my distance...

312
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,530
from her.

313
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,570
I will stay on Dan Oh's side.

314
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,130
What?

315
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
I started to want a different fate
for my character too.

316
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,010
- You...
- I don't want to be an extra...

317
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,910
that can vanish whenever, wherever,
and however the writer wants.

318
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,140
I decided to be the only person
who can change...

319
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,810
someone's fate.

320
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,190
If there's no answer
as to how I came to this world,

321
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,720
I will...

322
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,890
make my own answer...

323
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,700
with Dan Oh.

324
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,460
(If there's no answer
as to how I came to this world,)

325
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,090
(I will make my own answer.)

326
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,600
- I'm home.
- Dan Oh.

327
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,270
Come here.

328
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,040
What? What is it?

329
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,610
You forgot to tell me something.

330
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,210
I forgot something? No way.
I don't forget things.

331
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,280
Baek Kyung. Go ahead.
Brag all you want to me.

332
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,450
I don't know. I'm so tired.

333
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,780
My gosh, you're shy.

334
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,190
From now on,

335
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,000
- Dan Oh is the only woman for me.
- I can't watch this.

336
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,600
(Baek Kyung is too good for her.)

337
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,330
"Baek Kyung is too good for her."

338
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,070
"Eun Dan Oh chased after him
for a decade."

339
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,700
"She's almost a stalker."

340
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,510
My gosh,
these comments are infuriating!

341
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,210
The story has changed,

342
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,210
but is my set-up, my crush
of 10 years, still the same?

343
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,150
"Baek Kyung can do
so much better than her."

344
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,190
"Eun Dan Oh is too good for him."

345
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,930
My gosh.

346
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,210
Goodness.
What's wrong with this?

347
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,250
It's broken. It's definitely broken.
It's totally busted.

348
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,960
It's so noisy. Be quiet.

349
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,510
Leaving without saying goodbye?

350
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
It's me.

351
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,300
I want more information
on one of the students.

352
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,910
Nam Ju.

353
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,340
Why? Do you have
something to say to me?

354
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,020
Well, you know, on your birthday...

355
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,180
Oh, before you go on,
I have something to say to you.

356
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,260
You can stop running errands for me.

357
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,690
It got annoying.

358
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,540
Hey, you need to be quiet today.

359
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,970
Try to take a hint.

360
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,350
Hi.

361
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,830
(Heart rate: 123,
Normal heart rate: 65)

362
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,300
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

363
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,770
Yes. No. No, it's...

364
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,470
I think this is broken. It's broken.

365
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,340
Yes, it's broken.

366
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,980
Are you sure you're okay?

367
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,810
Yes, of course. Of course, I'm okay.

368
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,820
Let's go.

369
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,060
Oh, no.

370
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,730
Dan Oh, you must be broken.

371
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,370
Are you okay?

372
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,840
Hey, Do Hwa.

373
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,910
I wish I wasn't
aware of myself like you.

374
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,480
Then I wouldn't have to be
in so much pain right now.

375
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,990
Do Hwa.

376
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,190
- Going to see Ju Da?
- No.

377
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,990
You don't need
to be conscious of me anymore.

378
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,760
- What?
- Use her as your errand girl.

379
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,270
I don't need her anymore.

380
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,500
Hey.

381
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,940
She's not a thing.

382
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,570
Why are you overreacting?

383
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,710
You said she's just a friend.

384
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,680
I can't stand
the way you talk about Ju Da.

385
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,220
- Who do you think you are...
- Because I like Ju Da!

386
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,990
I told you to
stop crossing over the line.

387
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,690
You said she's just a friend.

388
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,730
Answer me!

389
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,630
How many times do I have to tell you
that I like her?

390
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,570
I let you slide a few times
even though you were cheeky...

391
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,470
only because you're my friend.

392
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,780
I'm only holding myself back
because you're a friend.

393
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
- Are you thinking about Kyung?
- What?

394
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,790
No.

395
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,960
You can't fool me.

396
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,520
You look like you're thinking of
someone you like.

397
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,060
Me? No way.

398
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,130
Okay, let's say you weren't.

399
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,400
Sae Mi, this is what happened
to a friend of mine.

400
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,830
She keeps thinking of this guy,

401
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,340
and her heart races
whenever she's with him.

402
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,140
Does this mean she likes him?

403
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,510
And your friend must be Eun Dan Oh.

404
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,040
No, it's not!

405
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,250
- He's coming.
- Haru?

406
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,620
Hey, Kyung, let me make
an official announcement.

407
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,120
Here's your only woman, Dan Oh!

408
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,790
- Over here!
- Let me go.

409
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,100
This is getting on my nerves.

410
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,490
Dan Oh.

411
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,190
Are you asleep?

412
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,840
Darn it. Just leave already.

413
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,240
Dan Oh.

414
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,050
Why do I keep
getting concerned about you?

415
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,550
What?

416
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,550
What? This isn't even the stage.

417
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,870
It makes no sense.

418
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,670
Me, with someone like her?

419
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,450
What's with him?

420
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,820
Everyone, listen up.

421
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,460
As of today, Lee Do Hwa...

422
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,060
isn't a member of A3 anymore.

423
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,330
- What?
- What?

424
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,590
- What?
- Do Hwa? Really?

425
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,430
I'm looking to add a new member.

426
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,500
- What?
- Do Hwa is out?

427
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,670
Hey, Ban Jang.
Do you want to be a part?

428
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,830
- Seriously?
- No way.

429
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,840
Then you?

430
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,500
You?

431
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,870
Okay, do you want to be a part?

432
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,310
Hey, curtains.

433
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,020
Yes, you. What's your name?

434
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,550
Do you want to be a part of A3?

435
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,960
- He must be insane.
- No way.

436
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,520
- Really?
- What?

437
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Nam Ju.

438
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,890
We need to talk.

439
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,600
Nam Ju! Hey, Nam Ju!

440
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,470
- Come on.
- Do Hwa is gone, then?

441
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,240
Did you and Do Hwa get in a fight?

442
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,310
If it's because of me,
it's a misunderstanding.

443
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
What misunderstanding?

444
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,290
Do Hwa and I are just friends.

445
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,190
- I...
- Hey.

446
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,690
Do you think you're a big shot...

447
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,360
just because I associated
with you a few times?

448
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,460
- What?
- Why do you care...

449
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,960
if Do Hwa gets kicked out or not?

450
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,300
Do you like him or something?

451
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,700
- Is that why?
- No, it's not like that. Never.

452
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,310
I...

453
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,610
Stop it.

454
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,540
I don't want to hear it anymore.

455
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,020
Man, that really hurts.

456
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,660
You can try to talk it out
with Nam Ju again.

457
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,590
He won't remember, and he'll repeat
the same lines again and again.

458
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,360
Oh, the same goes
for Ju Da, I guess.

459
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,370
But still, I like her.

460
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,700
I feel much better
after telling you that.

461
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,390
Do Hwa, what's going on?

462
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,820
You're so slow.

463
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,860
My feelings change
several times a day.

464
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,100
Isn't it scary?

465
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,400
What?

466
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,330
The fact that this is
a world of comics.

467
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,100
Depending on what
the writer intends,

468
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,000
this romance comic can suddenly
turn into a dreadful one.

469
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,640
The genre can change just like that.

470
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,580
Even the main characters can become
extras in a blink of an eye.

471
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,440
What is it? Is it because
you were kicked out of A3?

472
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,980
Don't be bothered.
It's such a cheesy...

473
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,480
Does it hurt a lot?

474
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,790
You're so slow.

475
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,100
When one thing changes,
other things change along with it.

476
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
That's why it's driving me crazy.

477
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,930
No one knows what will change.

478
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,800
But there is one constant.

479
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,940
- What is it?
- My feelings for Ju Da.

480
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,310
Gosh, that was awesome.
It was perfect!

481
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,350
I'm going to keep liking her
even if it's in the shadow!

482
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,280
That's right! Even the writer
can't change the way we feel!

483
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,420
- What's with him?
- I know, right?

484
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,890
What should I do?

485
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,190
- I got 8 questions wrong.
- 8?

486
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,130
What?

487
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,400
(English)

488
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,500
I got eight questions right.

489
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,930
- There's no difference.
- Don't be ridiculous.

490
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,000
What?

491
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,300
You aced it?

492
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,570
- What?
- He aced it?

493
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,980
- What?
- What is it?

494
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,810
How should I say this?
From the moment I saw you,

495
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,120
I knew we'd click.
We're both good-looking too.

496
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,080
Don't we have so many things
in common?

497
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,550
What? But you got zero percent
in English?

498
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,020
- What?
- No way.

499
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,520
- Are you from the Joseon period?
- He aced it.

500
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,100
I didn't know such a handsome guy...

501
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,530
- went to our school.
- "went to our school."

502
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,960
- Who is he?
- "Who is he?"

503
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,230
What was that?

504
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,640
Can... Can you hear me?

505
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,800
Sae Mi goes head over heels
for any good-looking guys.

506
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,510
I bet she has a weaker heart...

507
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,210
- than you.
- You're right.

508
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,040
Do you want your heart
to become weak as well?

509
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,110
- Who is he?
- Come here.

510
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,110
It's that guy...

511
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,420
whom Nam Ju suggested
as Do Hwa's replacement. Haru.

512
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,790
Stop it.

513
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,550
- Come here.
- Let me go.

514
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,700
It's marvelous.

515
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,630
During my past 20 years here,
I've never seen such a student.

516
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,900
I feel such deep sorrows
in the melody.

517
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,970
I didn't know such a handsome guy...

518
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,680
Yes, he's been a student here
for a long time.

519
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,510
Hey, what's your name?

520
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,830
Oh, my goodness.

521
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,570
That touch... That texture...

522
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,700
Have you learned this before?

523
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,740
No, I just let my hand lead me.

524
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,870
Unbelievable.

525
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,610
- I...
- Yes, he's a handsome guy.

526
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,850
wish there were more guys
like Haru at our school.

527
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,780
He's so handsome.

528
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,650
- What?
- Nam Ju will forever be...

529
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,120
my first love.

530
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,550
But for the other female students,

531
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,889
there should be more handsome guys.

532
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,790
Everyone, attention.

533
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,830
Look at Haru's painting.

534
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,860
How should I explain this?

535
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,000
- "Haru"?
- In these leaves,

536
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,270
there is a beat, a rhythm,

537
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,940
- and a soul.
- Beat, rhythm, and soul.

538
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,040
"Help me, please!"

539
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,270
"Please don't pick me!"

540
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,739
Doesn't it seem like the wild orchid
is screaming?

541
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,580
- Yes.
- Right?

542
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,179
- Yang Il!
- Yes?

543
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Yes?

544
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,850
Are you enjoying yourself?

545
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,120
Am I enjoying the weed?

546
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,250
Beat, rhythm, and soul.

547
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,590
Beat, rhythm, and soul.
What are those?

548
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,489
(Haru)

549
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,199
Isn't it so fascinating?

550
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,830
Did the writer intend
to write that...

551
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,900
or was it our doing?

552
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,370
What do you think?

553
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,480
Are you hot?
You're sweating a bucket.

554
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,050
I'm sweating?

555
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,120
I'm not sweating.

556
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,520
I've always had this.

557
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,120
Is it part of your character?

558
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
It seems to change with the stage.

559
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,320
Really? How so?

560
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,760
I don't know in detail but...

561
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,790
- Haru!
- Haru!

562
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,060
- Haru!
- Haru!

563
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,970
- Have this.
- This too.

564
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,100
Aren't you thirsty?

565
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,740
Is he your new love?

566
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,870
Can you give me your number?

567
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,270
I don't have one.

568
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,470
You don't have a phone?

569
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,310
No, Do Hwa gave one to me
several times.

570
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,880
But once the stage ended,
it disappeared with it.

571
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,010
- "Stage"?
- "Stage"?

572
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,950
Yes. Do Hwa gave it to me twice.

573
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,780
Why would you bother
to explain it to them?

574
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,390
- Go away.
- Why?

575
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,050
- Who gives you the right?
- Go.

576
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,860
Go away.

577
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,040
That was nice. What's the title?

578
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
It's what I feel...

579
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,980
for you.

580
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,380
What is it?

581
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,720
"Pleasure of Love".

582
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,890
I like you, Ju Da.

583
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,330
- Me too. I like you.
- "Me too. I like you."

584
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,490
- We're friends.
- "We're friends."

585
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,560
What?

586
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,020
Did you see us?

587
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,890
She said we were friends
for the seventh time today.

588
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,130
This time, it was
a romantic version...

589
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,760
like the ones you often see
in romance comics.

590
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,360
But Ju Da won't remember.

591
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,470
Still, I can't hide my feelings.

592
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,070
She's so beautiful.

593
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,870
Dan Oh.

594
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
(VIP Movie Ticket)

595
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
Hello?

596
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,760
Are you okay?

597
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,230
- I saw the story.
- What was it?

598
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,360
Why does Kyung keep doing that?

599
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,400
"Kyung"?

600
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,030
Did he bother you again?

601
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,900
I liked it better when he did.

602
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,640
But now, he's saying that
he likes me.

603
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,200
That's great.

604
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,270
I know it was part
of your character,

605
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,140
but you liked him
for the past 10 years.

606
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,840
How about you accept his...

607
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,380
- No, it's way too late for that.
- Right.

608
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,820
- You said it too late.
- I did.

609
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,390
You made a mistake.

610
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,760
- Right?
- Yes.

611
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,860
Dried Squid Fairy!

612
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,570
You're either at the cafeteria
or the library.

613
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,270
You should go out
and enjoy the sunlight.

614
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,540
Why are you here? Didn't you
tell me not to bother you?

615
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,010
(Dan Oh, it's all right.
Go to the treatment room.)

616
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,580
(I think you need
to prepare yourself.)

617
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,010
My time is limited.

618
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,220
It's so boring.

619
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,490
I admit that I was rude to you.

620
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,660
This is my apology gift.

621
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,700
They're my dad's favorites.

622
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,500
I stole them.

623
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,700
Italy.

624
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,170
- What?
- They're from Italy.

625
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,810
They're top-notch.

626
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,240
Forget it if you don't like them.

627
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,210
You can't take them back.

628
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,780
Since you gave them to me,
I'll use them well.

629
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,350
Did you read how chaotic it got?

630
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,350
Yes.

631
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,150
The stage changed, and people
remember Haru's name.

632
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,320
They remember him?

633
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,730
Yes. Didn't you know?

634
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,490
He even has a name tag now.

635
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,000
Are you sure about that?

636
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,800
Look, he's not here.

637
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,540
That can't be.

638
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,310
He was on stage too.

639
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,340
See? I'm right.

640
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,910
They say good things happen in bulk.

641
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,010
The story changed, Haru got a name,

642
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,580
and the others remember him.

643
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,590
I don't want to hear it.
You're trying to scare me again.

644
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,750
Anyway, I'll take it that
you've accepted my apology.

(VIP Movie Ticket)

646
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,050
Gosh, it's begun.

647
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,520
It's Baek Kyung's time.

648
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Dan Oh.

649
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,020
Hey, Kyung.

650
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,620
Do you have plans today?

651
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,660
Plans? No, I don't. Why?

652
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,200
Take it.

653
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,030
What's this?

654
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,340
It's a movie ticket.

655
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,210
I know what it says here.

656
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,240
I'm asking you out on a date.

657
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,410
What is this?

658
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,610
Do you not want to?

659
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,080
No. I'm just a bit worried.

660
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,620
About what?

661
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,760
Actually, I don't know
how you really feel.

662
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,160
You said you didn't like me
because I was sick.

663
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,230
And I think you only said...

664
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,190
what you said at the party
because I broke off the engagement.

665
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,600
Should we not go to the movies then?

666
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,800
No.

667
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
From now on, you will never...

668
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,340
want to break off the engagement.

669
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,940
Kyung.

670

(VIP Movie Ticket)

671
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,550
My gosh,
you're making me cringe too!

672
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,780
Goodness!

673
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,590
I'll go because
this is part of the stage.

674
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,320
You'd better not be late. My gosh.

675
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,720
Hey, Haru!

676
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,140
"Stage"?

677
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,340
You came home early today.

678
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,150
It looks like you had
a good day today.

679
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,320
I came from a meeting
with Chairman Eun.

680
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,890
Kyung, I heard that
you did a fine job this time.

681
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,790
Why don't we speed things up
to become Chairman Eun's in-laws?

682
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,990
What do you mean?

683
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,490
It looks like Kyung publicly...

684
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,430
announced that he was going
to officially date...

685
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,460
Dan Oh at Nam Ju's birthday party.

686
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,870
Pardon?

687
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,170
You should've done it sooner.

688
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,910
We're dining out tonight.

689
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,450
I have plans.

690
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,350
- Plans?
- With Dan Oh.

691
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,820
- Give me my wallet.
- Okay.

692
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,730
- Honey.
- Take it.

693
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,330
You should learn to be extravagant
if you're a man.

694
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,610
Give me some water.

695
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,780
Okay.

696
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,620
Kyung.

697
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,090
Did you mean what you said...

698
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,120
at Nam Ju's birthday party?

699
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,130
Why? Do you feel insecure
now that Dad complimented me?

700
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,160
And that I might steal your spot?

701
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,300
It's not that.

702
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,930
It's just that I like Dan Oh.

703
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,370
Your mother won't like that.

704
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,370
What if Dad hears you?

705
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,110
I hope you meant what you said.

706
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,880
Dan Oh is really kind.

707
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,250
Who are you to butt in my business?
Darn it.

708
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,020
I just thought...

709
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,860
Dan Oh might be part of our family.

710
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,030
Family, my foot. Are you...

711
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
my family?

712
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,040
- Of course.
- Hey.

713
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,070
Stop talking nonsense. Got it?

714
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,110
Darn it.

715
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,960
This is your first date.
You should dress up.

716
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,970
Come here.

717
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,940
As for this white dress,
the back is see-through.

718
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,700
And the front is see-through
for this one.

719
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,970
And this one is pink.
What do you think?

720
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,470
These are the best three options.
Let me take photos. Let me see.

721
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,640
All right. Wait.

722
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,310
Okay. Look over here. 1, 2, 3.

723
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,920
Gosh, you look so pretty.

724
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,220
Another one. 1, 2, 3.

725
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,650
Smile.

726
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,050
Take a look.

727
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,720
I bet you'll look pretty.
You'll totally look pretty.

728
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,690
You look pretty, right?

729
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,590
Hey, what is this?

730
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,430
My gosh, you look
so pretty in those!

731
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,860
It's perfect. All right.

732
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,200
Let me put some here and here too.

733
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,870
Don't you look pretty? Dan Oh.

734
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Listen up.

735
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,340
When you eat the popcorns,

736
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,910
make sure you brush his fingers
as much as you can.

737
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,510
- Brush his fingers?
- Yes.

738
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,080
When you drink Coke,
have only one straw.

739
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,350
- One straw?
- You got it, right?

740
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,450
An indirect kiss.

741
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,380
The moment he sees you,

742
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,450
he'll go crazy.
It'll be over for him.

743
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,250
Let me see you, Dan Oh.

744
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,790
(VIP Movie Ticket)

745
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,280
So this scene on the stage...

746
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,190
is about Kyung running away
after seeing me like this, right?

747
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,300
Where are you meeting her?

748
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,670
At the theater.

749
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,430
Driver Kim, take us
to the theater first.

750
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,070
Once you see her,

751
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,940
set up a meeting
with Chairman Oh's son.

752
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
Okay.

753
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,440
The meeting has to be
at Chairman Oh's house.

754
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,150
- Okay.
- Chairman Eun hasn't been...

755
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,780
that cooperative lately.

756
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,020
He'll only do something
when we please that girl.

757
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,360
Is it certain that she likes you?

758
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,630
Yes.

759
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,530
Then, push forward...

760
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,130
to marry her.

761
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,630
- Marry her?
- Why not?

762
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,600
You officially started dating her.

763
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,710
I don't think I can marry her.

764
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,470
You said I could quit
pretending to like her...

765
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,640
once the business wrapped up.

766
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,710
- What?
- How far...

767
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,450
are you willing to exploit your son?

768
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,880
Am I even your son?

769
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,050
You, brat.

770
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,690
Get off.

771
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,320
Get off the car immediately!

772
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,280
Hello?

773
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,010
Hey.

774
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,220
I'm not going to the theater.

775
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,450
- What?
- I'm not in the mood for movies.

776
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,520
Don't wait for me.

777
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,710
Darn it!

778
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,010
How could he
consistently be so rude?

779
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,330
I found you.

780
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,520
By the way, why did you come here?

781
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,450
Kyung was acting a bit weird.

782
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,820
He was? Why?

783
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,630
Just because.

784
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,430
Why does he have
such broad shoulders?

785
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,970
I think the screen got flipped
because we're in the shadow.

786
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,140
Right.

787
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,860
When you eat the popcorns,

788
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,030
make sure you brush his fingers
as much as you can.

789
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,970
When you drink Coke,
have only one straw.

790
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,210
You got it, right?

791
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,310
An indirect kiss.

792
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,250
Darn it. Why did you say
something like that, Sae Mi?

793
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,300
Why are you two together?

794
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,900
Why are you here?

795
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,030
I thought you were waiting for me,
but you watched the movie.

796
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,270
That doesn't matter.

797
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,400
You stood me up.

798
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,970
Of course, it matters.
I'm your fiance!

799
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,440
Don't talk to Dan Oh like that.

800
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,580
- What?
- She may be your fiancee,

801
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,220
but she's also my friend.

802
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,660
Dan Oh, let's go.

803
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,660
Why are you two together?

804
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,720
Why are you here?

805
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,390
I thought you were waiting for me,
but you watched the movie.

806
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,430
That doesn't matter.
You stood me up.

807
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,900
Of course, it matters.
I'm your fiance!

808
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,800
That's odd.

809
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,400
He was supposed to stand me up
in that stage.

810
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,540
Why did he come back?

811
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,690
I keep fading away.

812
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,790
She's different from you.

813
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,990
There are levels to extras.

814
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,060
You're the only one...

815
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,200
who'll disappear.

816
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,840
What is this?

817
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,470
You must be
highly interested in Dan Oh.

818
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,350
You do know that
she's my fiancee, don't you?

819
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,390
Man, you little jerk.

820
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:00,930
This is interesting.

821
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

822
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,480
- 2, 2, 3, 4...
- It's so cold.

823
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,850
I can't even go in.
Why was I brought here?

824
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:25,450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

825
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,460
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

826
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:38,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

827
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,070
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

828
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,770
I've been looking for you.

829
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,170
Why didn't you come
to the movies yesterday?

830
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,370
Something came up.

831
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,110
I see.

832
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,180
Why are you here?

833
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,850
Why? I came to see you swim.

834
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,580
Keep the towel on you.
You might catch a cold.

835
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,650
Okay.

836
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,230
Haru.

837
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,370
Let's go play over there.

838
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,750
I'm dressed like this
because I'm supposed to be weak,

839
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,620
but why are you in your uniform?

840
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,320
You're right.
I think the writer made a mistake.

841
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,060
The writer is quite sloppy at times.

842
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,460
Exactly.

843
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,040
Hey, what are you doing?

844
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,210
It looked like you were having fun.

845
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,480
Let's go.

846
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,690
I'm trying to hang out with
my fiancee. Stop bothering us.

847
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,060
Why do you keep bothering us?

848
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,410
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

849
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,880
- Who is he?
- Kyung!

850
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,110
- Kyung.
- What happened?

851
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,080
He pushed him in.

852
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,150
Let's go.

853
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,680
What was that?

854
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,690
Gosh.

855
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,330
Guys, let's all do a race
for some ice cream.

856
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,760
One person from each class
can be the representative.

857
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,970
- Let's do it.
- Sure.

858
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:56,640
The swimmer for our class is...

859
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,300
You just saw me swim.

860
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,170
- Me.
- Nam Ju!

861
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,970
- Hi, Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

862
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,110
- It's Nam Ju.
- Really?

863
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,650
That's amazing.

864
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,920
Then who wants to swim
from your class?

865
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,450
I will.

866
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,260
Guys, shouldn't
someone else volunteer?

867
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,590
Hey, anyone else?

868
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,560
No, I'm going to do it.

869
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,470
You can do it.

870
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,600
I won't let you win.

871
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,170
It sounds as if
you let me win before.

872
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,820
On your mark.

873
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,230
And 1, 2, 3.

874
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,280
- Lee Do Hwa!
- Lee Do Hwa!

875
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,050
- Oh Nam Ju!
- Oh Nam Ju!

876
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,380
Oh Nam Ju!

877
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,360
Hey, it's Haru.

878
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,130
- Lee Do Hwa!
- Oh Nam Ju!

879
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,170
What? What's with his name tag?

880
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,040
Why is his name gone?

881
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,980
Why?

882
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,180
What's going on?

883
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,550
- Hey!
- What is it?

884
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,160
This way.

885
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,760
- Go over there!
- Go!

886
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,070
Hey! Go over there!

887
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,130
What's going on?

888
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,840
What about Haru? Where is he?

889
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,440
Mom.

890
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,190
Mom!

891
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,460
Mom!

892
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,930
Mom...

893
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:53,540
Mom...

894
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,830
Dan Oh.

895
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,140
Everyone who was by my side
ends up leaving me.

896
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,380
What do you think
will happen to you and me?

897
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,610
This is Haru's seat.

898
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,810
What are you talking about?

899
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,480
I've always been sitting here.

900
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,450
That can't be true.

901
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,980
This seat is for number 13...

902
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,980
Yes, it's for number 13,
Park Mo Beom.

903
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,120
It's me.

904
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,390
Anyway, are you okay?

905
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,350
Where's your uniform? Goodness.

906
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,960
Hey, you look... Hey.

907
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:54,960
(Seuli High School Student Photos)

908
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,970
(Number 13: Park Mo Beom)

909
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,170
No way.

910
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,420
Where's the book?

911
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,860
Haru is gone.

912
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,660
It didn't get twisted.

913
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,930
Everything ended up
coming back to its place.

914
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,830
Where's the comic book?

915
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:09,940
It's not here.

916
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,680
At this rate,

917
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,850
the next one will be...

918
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,780
("Secret")

919
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,360
Are you...

920
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,030
looking for this?

921
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,340
("Secret")
