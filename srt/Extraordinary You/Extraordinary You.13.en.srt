1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(English subtitles are available.)

2
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,940
Haru.

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,940
I don't care
what happened in the past.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,680
That story is already over.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,010
Who cares what happened
in the previous work?

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,950
We're here changing our fate
which the writer already decided.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,590
I'm sure of this.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,820
I knew it ever since I met you.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,030
That you'll be able
to change my fate.

10
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,740
Dan Oh...

11
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,450
I'm...

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,250
going to die?

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,990
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

14
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
One second.

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,130
I want to stay like this
for a second.

16
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,579
I do not want to marry Prince Kyung.

17
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,829
What is it?

18
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,960
You were always a few steps
before me.

19
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,900
But today, you made a weak move.

20
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,270
On the battlefield,

21
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,810
you only have one chance.

22
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
In order to kill your opponent,

23
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,050
you only have one opportunity.

24
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,360
You must always stay alert.

25
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,730
Always.

26
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,600
Yes, my lord.

27
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,579
The king's warrior must not have
many wounds on his hands.

28
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,020
I will hurry my marriage
with Eun Dan Oh.

29
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,160
I will become the king...

30
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,430
through Eun Dan Oh's blood.

31
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,220
You must run away. He will...

32
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,790
put you in danger.

33
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
My lady.

34
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,340
If I must change my fate,
then I will.

35
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,350
I will wait for you
as long as I need to.

36
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,620
I will find my own answers.

37
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Haru.

38
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,090
I want to do it with you.

39
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,030
If there is no answer
to my beginning,

40
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,460
then I will create my own answer.

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,470
I dare you to take one more step.

42
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,670
You cannot leave me. You should not.

43
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,110
That is your fate.

44
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,110
That is the reason
for your existence!

45
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,680
I will leave.

46
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,050
Say it again.

47
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,050
Say it again!

48
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,420
You are in love
with Eun Mu Young's daughter.

49
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,659
Eun Dan Oh.

50
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,850
My lady.

51
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,960
Will it happen in the future?

52
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,230
Or has it already happened before?

53
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,370
That is why I couldn't give you
an answer regarding your beginning.

54
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,770
Because your beginning...

55
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,410
didn't start here.

56
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,620
"Trumpet Creeper".

57
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,990
Don't tell me...

58
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,220
that the story is repeating itself.

59
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,130
Say no.

60
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,470
No.

61
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,240
My memory...

62
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,770
Everything that I've witnessed
in that world...

63
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,970
They're repeating themselves,
aren't they?

64
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,980
Perhaps, you are desperate...

65
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,780
because you've witnessed
her death already.

66
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,850
You won't be able to save her...

67
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,590
just like how you couldn't
back then.

68
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,520
Just...

69
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,660
let time pass.

70
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,930
How could I?

71
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,970
Haru.

72
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,470
I know a man like you.

73
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,980
He also tried...

74
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,280
to change his role and the story.

75
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Who are you?

76
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,870
Su Hyang.

77
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,840
Su Hyang. No...

78
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,410
No!

79
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,720
When the story changes,

80
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,390
you'll see things
that you don't want to see.

81
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,460
And you'll find yourself
surrendering to the writer.

82
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,500
If you change Dan Oh's stage,

83
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,930
it will change more
than just her fate.

84
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,970
It will also change the fates
of those related.

85
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,970
It will only bring...

86
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,580
misfortunes.

87
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,610
You were never able...

88
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,450
to protect Dan Oh.

89
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,100
It's just a surgery.

90
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,060
You've gone under the knife
many times.

91
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,100
What should I do?

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm terrified.

93
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,610
Come on, this is only
a part of the story.

94
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,210
It's okay. It's okay, Dan Oh.
It's okay...

95
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,100
Am I already dying? That can't be.

96
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,740
Thank goodness. I thought
I was in the operating room.

97
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,340
Dan Oh, how does
mid-November sound?

98
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,140
What?

99
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm talking about your surgery date.

100
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,250
My surgery date?

101
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,250
We'll have to see
what your results say,

102
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,720
but if we need to do it,
let's do it around that time.

103
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,850
No, this can't be. I can't.

104
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,090
Let me talk to your father first.

105
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,590
Until then, don't forget to take
your medication, eat well,

106
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,230
and stay healthy, okay?

107
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,140
I can't believe he talked
about scheduling my surgery.

108
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,750
Will my heart stop sooner
than I expected?

109
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,360
But still, my heart kept me alive
for the past 18 years.

110
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,760
Well done.

111
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,470
I'll have to receive surgery, right?

112
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,330
Don't be so weak.

113
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,740
Why isn't this stage ending?

114
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,510
I knew it.

115
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,940
Kyung.

116
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,450
While in the midst of deciding
whether or not to receive surgery,

117
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,790
I'll also have to put up
with his hurtful comments.

118
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,590
The writer is so wicked.

119
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,260
By the way,

120
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,060
I'm sorry...

121
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,470
for making you visit the hospital
once again.

122
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,930
Don't get mad.

123
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,210
When I broke off the engagement,
I wasn't throwing a tantrum.

124
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,110
I...

125
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,250
need to get surgery.

126
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,980
You don't want to hear about this,
right? I'm sorry.

127
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,620
But...

128
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,220
this surgery must be different
from the other surgeries.

129
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,960
Do you know
why I wanted to marry you?

130
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,100
Because I wanted to live.

131
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
When I was young,

132
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,970
there were only two things
in my life.

133
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,080
The square-shaped ceiling I saw...

134
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,180
when I lay down on the hospital bed.

135
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,380
And you, Kyung.

136
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,320
That must have been why...

137
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,120
I thought you were my only escape...

138
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,990
and my sick heart would...

139
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,090
all get better if we got married.

140
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,890
That must be
why I kept liking you...

141
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,730
without caring about
how you felt about me.

142
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,070
And I knew that you were having
a hard time with your family too.

143
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,570
- Hey, that's...
- People might think...

144
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,370
that you hurt my feelings.

145
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,510
But in fact...

146
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,610
I'm sorry...

147
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,450
for hurting you.

148
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,380
So we should...

149
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,830
break off...

150
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,730
our engagement.

151
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,200
Take care, Kyung.

152
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,320
Gosh. Why is this so sad?

153
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,590
This weak version of Dan Oh
isn't the real Dan Oh.

154
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,630
Right?

155
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,960
Why do I feel so...

156
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,100
Dan Oh.

157
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,740
Gosh. In all of my scenes so far,

158
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,340
I think I had the most lines, right?

159
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,880
Are you really...

160
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,640
getting surgery?

161
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,020
Yes.

162
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,320
- When is it?
- I don't know yet.

163
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,390
The writer will decide on it
and let us know soon.

164
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,730
Gosh.

165
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,930
Why do you look so serious?
It doesn't suit you.

166
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,370
It was hard dealing with me, right?

167
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,630
You despise coming to the hospitals.

168
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,340
But...

169
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,110
But just hang in there a bit longer.

170
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,710
I don't think you'll ever have
to come back to the hospital.

171
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,220
I can feel that
I really don't have much time left.

172
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,470
You can't help in the stage

173
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,100
on the stage
since that's your character.

174
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,370
But during my remaining time,

175
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,380
let's try to get along
in the shadow.

176
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,380
You're my friend.

177
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,980
The guy Dan Oh from the world
of comics liked for a long time.

178
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,710
You won't even shake my hands?
Goodness.

179
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,750
You're so mean! You're the meanest.

180
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,320
Anyway, I'll get going.

181
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,110
Despite my heart problem,

182
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,510
I only had happy memories.

183
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,280
There was a long list of what
I wanted to do once I got healthy.

184
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,020
(Dan Oh's Bucket List)

185
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,880
(Going on a trip with Dad,
cooking for Dad, eating sausages...)

186
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,630
(Going to a concert
with Sae Mi and Su Chul)

187
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,810
What does he like, by the way?

188
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,980
We spent such a long time together.

189
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,280
But all I know about him
is his set-up.

190
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,360
My life as an extra...

191
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,060
was just starting to get better.

192
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,380
Whether we're on stage
or in the shadow,

193
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,120
let's meet there on October 10.

194
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,890
If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

195
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,620
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

196
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,580
It's no fun, isn't it?

197
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,680
Well, I have a favor to ask you.

198
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,650
Can you hide that for me?

199
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,560
Hide it when it could go back
to its place any minute?

200
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
I don't want Haru...

201
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,560
to worry about me
because of my surgery.

202
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,130
Oh, right. Please keep this
a secret from Haru.

203
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,370
I want to spend my remaining time
with him and have fun.

204
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,840
Why him...

205
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
out of all people?

206
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,640
Because I like him.

207
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,250
Don't you think
an 18-year-old high school girl...

208
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,380
in a romance comic book
ought to have her first love?

209
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,050
My real first love...

210
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,060
that my set-up doesn't hold
sway over.

211
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Haru, hello.

212
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Hi.

213
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,370
Hey. Move out of my way, everyone.

214
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,040
Here comes my future wife!

215
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,210
- Here comes his future wife.
- Here comes his future wife.

216
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,580
- "Future wife"?
- You guys look great.

217
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,150
Gosh, what's wrong
with men in our school?

218
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,820
What do you mean?
Kyung started all this.

219
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,120
Goodness!

220
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,620
But how long have they been crazy
in love like that?

221
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,160
He proposed to her with a ring
the other day.

222
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,590
"I will declare it
on the honor of Y3."

223
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,590
"Y3"?

224
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,760
Who would like them?
They are like A3 copycats.

225
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,530
Well, Y3 isn't that bad.

226
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,860
Come on.

227
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,270
The stage between Kyung and me...

228
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,370
became the stage
between Yang Il and Il Jin.

229
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,140
We don't know...

230
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,310
what else will change
when one thing changes.

231
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,440
But I'm still glad...

232
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,350
that things are going
the way you wanted.

233
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,880
The way I wanted?

234
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,560
All right, return to your seats.
The class will begin soon.

235
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,260
- Okay.
- Have a great class.

236
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,360
She's starting class!

237
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,560
- You too, Dan Oh.
- Okay.

238
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,790
She'll start now.

239
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,500
Dan Oh.

240
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,900
Did you take your medication?

241
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,400
I can manage on my own...

242
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,640
Can you please keep this
as a secret from Haru?

243
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,040
What?

244
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,820
I think I started to have feelings
for Dan Oh.

245
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,890
Of course, you do.
She's your fiancee.

246
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,830
I was always annoyed
whenever I saw her.

247
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,360
I couldn't take how my father,

248
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,830
who would do anything for money,

249
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,940
uses a girl who might die at
any moment to get investments.

250
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,340
But I think
I liked her from the start.

251
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,580
I just got rebellious
and was mean to that sick girl.

252
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,920
What am I saying to you?

253
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Hey.

254
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
We're friends.
That's why you can tell me that.

255
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm sorry that things are like this
even after you changed the stage.

256
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Do you get it now?

257
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,210
Dan Oh and I share many stories
that you have no idea about.

258
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,280
Even now, there's a side of her
that you don't know.

259
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,750
But I know everything.

260
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,020
I'm always a part of Dan Oh's story.

261
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,640
Haru, why do you look so serious?

262
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,870
If you become ill
or something happens to you...

263
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,940
in a scene that I'm not in...

264
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,280
I think my heart is more in pain
because of that long face you make.

265
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,520
Okay, repeat after me. Smile.

266
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,990
You have to smile at me like this
whenever you see me,

267
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,090
okay?

268
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,090
Try it again.
Let me check if you can do it well.

269
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,860
Smile.

270
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,530
See? It's great to see you smile.

271
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,700
Your turn.

272
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,140
I'm good at it. Smile.

273
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,940
You're cute.

274
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,550
Smile.

275
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,820
That's a huge smile.

276
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,660
In English, a big smile.

277
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,610
Found it.

278
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,070
Gosh, it's like a treasure hunt.

279
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,610
Let me see it too.
You can't be the only one.

280
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,640
One second. Do Hwa. Hey, Do Hwa.
I really can't show you this.

281
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,380
Hey. Hey, I'll get in trouble.

282
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,020
Come on, let me read it.
If you can do it, why can't...

283
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,850
I knew it.

284
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,850
I told you to hide it for good,

285
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,920
but if Do Hwa can find it,

286
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,260
that means just about anyone
can find that if they want.

287
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,830
Dan Oh, I hid it the best I could,

288
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,490
but Do Hwa is just too good.

289
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,130
It's as if he smelled it to find it.

290
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,670
My childhood dream was to become
Do Hwa the great detective.

291
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,100
- How can you hide it up there?
- I mean...

292
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,870
- Dan Oh, you're...
- Yes.

293
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,140
I don't know
if I'll get the surgery,

294
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,780
- and I don't have a date yet.
- Right.

295
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,340
That's why you hid it.

296
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,550
Forget it.

297
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,380
If any of you bring up
the surgery to Haru, I'll kill you.

298
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,620
Oh, you're worried that
he'll be worried. Okay.

299
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,590
Don't tell Haru, all right?

300
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,870
Smile.

301
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,110
Smile. Smile?

302
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,850
Smile.

303
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,520
- Is he Snow White?
- Looking handsome.

304
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,620
- You shine brightly.
- Seriously.

305
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,690
Isn't that Sae Mi's mirror?

306
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,060
- What is he doing?
- He's good looking.

307
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,850
It's as if our backs have
magnets on them.

308
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,120
Exactly.

309
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,520
What were you up to?

310
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,820
- Thinking about you.
- What's with that line?

311
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,090
You sound like Nam Ju.

312
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,560
What were you up to?

313
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,930
Thinking about you too.

314
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,830
What's with that line?
You sound like Ju Da.

315
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,870
In this world, Nam Ju and Ju Da are
the main characters,

316
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,830
and we're just extras.

317
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,440
But in Eun Dan Oh's world,
you're the male lead.

318
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,740
Before, it was hard to see you
unless I go around looking for you.

319
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,780
But I'm so happy that
I can meet you without doing that.

320
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,220
I like you a lot.

321
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,390
Me too.

322
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,630
What has gotten into him?

323
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,930
What's going on with this story?

324
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,700
Why is your hand so cold?

325
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,700
You don't have to mind me.

326
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,540
I promised Chairman Eun...

327
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,110
that I'll protect you.

328
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,810
Why are you doing this to me?

329
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,380
I'm going to admit it.

330
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,850
Admit what?

331
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,110
My feelings.

332
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,650
It's true that I stayed by your side
because of President Baek.

333
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,520
But not now.

334
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,690
I want to stay by your side.

335
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,690
I admit that...

336
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,530
I like you.

337
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
Let go. The stage is over.

338
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,410
Why are you so shocked?

339
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,610
You're the one
who held my hand at the restaurant.

340
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,140
Hey, that was on the stage.

341
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,950
I'm your fiance, even in the shadow.

342
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,450
This can...

343
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,590
never change.

344
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,660
And I now admit that I like you.

345
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,360
This isn't the stage right now.

346
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,570
Hey!

347
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,910
- Why?
- You...

348
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,170
I like Dan Oh.

349
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,840
And it's not my character.
I mean it.

350
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,380
Oh, and you know that...

351
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,450
she's my fiancee, don't you?

352
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,750
The writer wants to put an end
to Dan Oh's one-sided love too.

353
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,020
Things are going
according to the plan for us.

354
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,490
What do you think
will happen to you?

355
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,060
One thing I'm sure of is...

356
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,430
that you won't end up with Dan Oh.

357
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,530
As I said, you're just an extra.

358
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,170
That has nothing to do
in the time that Dan Oh and I spend.

359
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,710
Oh, is that so?

360
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,940
What can you do for her?

361
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,350
Oh, changing things? But how?

362
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,050
You have no idea how the story
will unfold from now on.

363
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,550
And Dan Oh needs someone...

364
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,390
who already knows the story.

365
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,510
Excuse me.

366
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,090
Could you give me a hand?

367
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,290
My real first love...

368
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,300
that my set-up doesn't hold
sway over.

369
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,200
First love?

370
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,500
Thank you.

371
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,210
I heard you only give out food
when dried squid is on the menu.

372
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,570
Is that why
you're the Dried Squid Fairy?

373
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,980
I heard it from the other kids.

374
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,940
That's hilarious.

375
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,450
I love dried squid too.

376
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,280
Then I'll give you extra.

377
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,950
Thank you.

378
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,790
Su Hyang, did you take off
all the posters?

379
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,290
Yes, it's all done.

380
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,720
I'll get going.

381
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,520
See you again, Dried Squid Fairy.

382
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,530
Sure.

383
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,340
This is just too harsh.

384
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,740
I'm a bit grateful for the writer...

385
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,140
that she's not self-aware.

386
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,450
Goodness.

387
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,490
- Girls.
- Yes?

388
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,760
Nam Ju is looking for you.

389
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,460
- Nam Ju is looking for me?
- Yes.

390
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,790
Nam Ju!

391
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,430
- Nam Ju!
- Hey!

392
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,230
What? I don't think he's here.

393
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,370
Ju Da, are you sure
he called us here?

394
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,500
- He's not here!
- Darn it.

395
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,470
Sae Mi.

396
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,780
Why am I always smiling,

397
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
energetic, and kind to everyone...

398
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,450
even when you bully me?

399
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,080
- What are you saying?
- Whatever.

400
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,950
It's probably because
I'm the main character.

401
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,980
The main character?

402
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,460
How do you feel?

403
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,930
Isn't it scary?

404
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,300
Isn't it awful?

405
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,800
Sae Mi, do you remember?

406
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,200
You told me that Cinderella
married Prince Charming...

407
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,670
because she was of the nobility.

408
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,510
- So what?
- You're wrong.

409
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,080
Even if she was a beggar,
she would've married him.

410
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,150
Because she's the main character.

411
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,850
- Hey, Ju Da.
- You.

412
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,550
- Hey.
- What? Hey!

413
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,890
Hey!

414
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,060
- Hey!
- Open the door!

415
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,560
- Open it!
- You!

416
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,230
Girls, learn your place in there
before you come out.

417
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,260
- Hey, open the door!
- You!

418
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,330
It's scary in here!

419
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,130
I'm more scared of you!

420
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,970
- Hey!
- Ju Da, this is scary!

421
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,450
Do you want to
listen to it together?

422
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Sure.

423
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,400
Do you like this song?

424
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Yes.

425
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,040
But I like the version
you play better.

426
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,150
Ju Da.

427
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,380
Why do you keep making me hopeful?

428
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,250
What do you mean?

429
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,050
Why do you keep making me hope...

430
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,560
that you might like me?

431
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,760
Gosh, forget it.
You won't remember this anyway.

432
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,199
Can you be hopeful?

433
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,699
Please be hopeful.

434
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,370
I'll try to change myself too.

435
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,949
Here. Do you want to read it?

436
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,250
No way.

437
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,790
Goodness, Nam Ju.
You're cool. I give you that.

438
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,430
You know you've been chanting
that Nam Ju is cool, don't you?

439
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,230
Gosh, you totally sound
like a member of A3.

440
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,000
I don't feel as miserable...

441
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,930
to play the supporting character
than before.

442
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,870
But it feels weird
whenever I look at Ju Da.

443
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,500
- Why? What?
- It's inexpressible in words...

444
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,240
No, it's this thing.

445
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,180
Kyung is even weirder.

446
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,740
- Why?
- It's inexpressible in words...

447
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,610
No, it's this thing.

448
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,680
Gosh, I feel you.

449
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,490
Gosh.

450
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,060
Nam Ju and Ju Da are finally dating.

451
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,560
Let me see. What does it say?

452
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,290
Did he officially declare
that they're dating as of today?

453
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,500
Don't you think
the story is completely absurd?

454
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,560
The lines are horrible. The story
isn't persuasive. What is this?

455
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,800
Tell me about it.

456
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,970
My surgery and marriage are
all over the place too.

457
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,170
I mean, how can
high school students get married?

458
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,540
Who would read
a comic book like this?

459
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Writer, quit writing this!

460
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,740
- Quit!
- Quit!

461
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,810
- Cross!
- Cross!

462
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,940
- Quit!
- Quit!

463
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,450
Ta-da.

464
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,180
I brought her here from Paris.

465
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,250
I thought of you
as soon as I saw it.

466
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,550
She's so pretty.

467
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,860
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

468
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,630
I have something to say to you.

469
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,630
What is it?

470
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,860
It took me a long time
for me to tell you this.

471
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Go out...

472
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
with me.

473
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,370
What?

474
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,010
Well, should we start dating...

475
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,740
as of today?

476
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,810
Gosh.

477
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,360
This is 1,150 euros.

478
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
That's about 1,500 dollars.

479
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,430
That's very much like you.

480
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,800
- What?
- I said thanks.

481
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,570
Oh, okay.

482
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,310
It seems like there isn't
a lot of thought put into this,

483
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,870
but I keep reading it anyway.

484
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,580
This is why soap operas do well.

485
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,110
The first day of their relationship?

486
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,450
Hey, you always have
that book with you.

487
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,850
I just checked it to see
if it changed well.

488
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,420
Hey, shouldn't you thank me?

489
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,920
I saved you from embarrassment
by changing that stage.

490
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,860
Well, strictly speaking,
it was Haru.

491
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,990
But I helped out a little bit too.

492
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,600
I mean, you aren't a type
who can say such a cheesy line.

493
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,300
Gosh, it's horrible.

494
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,570
That's why I saved you, man.

495
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Hey, this is...

496
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,110
my stage...

497
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,940
and my scene.

498
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,740
What right do you people have...

499
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,440
to change the stage
no matter what I do there?

500
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,810
I was trying to help you...

501
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,610
Do you think
you can also change everything...

502
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,250
after you started
hanging out with Haru?

503
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,980
Hey, that's a bit harsh.

504
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,550
Don't be delusional.

505
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,690
It's really annoying.

506
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,200
You have no idea how the story
will unfold from now on.

507
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,600
And Dan Oh needs someone
who already knows the story.

508
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,740
Haru, Kyung is
way too sharp-tongued.

509
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,620
Haru, you have
always been so nice to me.

510
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,560
I can see why
Dan Oh likes you more than him.

511
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,360
You're good looking, nice,

512
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,430
and you can change the stage too.

513
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,070
Hey, Jun Hyun.

514
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,800
Change? Change what?

515
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,010
Your brother almost said something
really cute...

516
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,670
with A3's honor,

517
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,510
but Haru and I stopped him...

518
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,310
by changing the stage.

519
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,750
This is getting really interesting.

520
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,120
It's really sad
because you won't remember.

521
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,820
Haru, it's you and me, partner.

522
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,190
I asked Su Hyang for the USB...

523
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,490
and you did as I told you.

524
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,190
Excuse me.

525
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,500
Hello, I'm Baek Jun Hyun,
Kyung's younger brother.

526
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,370
- Yes.
- Aren't you new in the tennis team?

527
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,370
I've seen you often with my brother.

528
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,010
Just leave him alone.

529
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,680
That'll be better...

530
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,240
for you and everyone else.

531
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,020
Please get along with him
without getting into fights.

532
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,680
I ask of you.

533
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,420
What are you doing here?

534
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Kyung.

535
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,660
You really are awfully annoying.

536
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,190
How much more
will you meddle with this?

537
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,670
There is nothing more...

538
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
than an official announcement
that can capture a woman's heart.

539
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,150
- An official announcement.
- Right.

540
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,310
- No, women hate that.
- You're right.

541
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,320
I think it sounds great.

542
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,820
Announcing your feelings
in front of all of these strangers.

543
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,490
That's only possible because he's
truly in love and is determined.

544
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,290
- You're great.
- Great, my foot.

545
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,660
Everyone, listen up.

546
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,190
I hate getting asked out in public.
Okay?

547
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

548
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,700
We only accept them
when we also have feelings for them.

549
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,470
If you do as he says,
you will stay single forever.

550
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,770
- What?
- Quiet!

551
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,800
Just trust me.

552
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,300
You're all wrong.

553
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,040
- What?
- Yang Il.

554
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,310
You should be thankful to me
and Haru.

555
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,310
What?

556
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,050
Because we changed
the stage into an awesome one.

557
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,050
What?

558
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,080
Guys, he said steak.

559
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,650
- I see.
- You're amazing.

560
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,560
Kyung and Dan Oh's stage
was handed over to you.

561
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,160
You're their replacements.

562
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,790
- Replacements?
- Replacements?

563
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,290
Right, it's not easy to do either.

564
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,300
Who is that guy, Haru? Who is he?

565
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,970
You already know.
Someone who can bring change.

566
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,800
So you like anyone
who can change the stage?

567
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
It started that way at first.

568
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,310
When I was with Haru,
the stage changed.

569
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,440
Can you please keep this
as a secret from Haru?

570
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,680
Do Hwa.

571
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,550
Be quiet.

572
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,020
What do you mean? He's sharing
a valuable tip.

573
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,920
Get out of the way.

574
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,590
Kyung, do you want to join in?

575
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,390
Oh, right. You don't need to.

576
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,390
You don't need to do anything...

577
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,590
for the girls to be swayed.

578
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,790
You're so cute!

579
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,060
- Tell us the tip.
- Yes, tell us.

580
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,930
I'll buy you a steak.

581
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,970
- Get out.
- No.

582
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,340
Dan Oh and I share many stories
that you have no idea about.

583
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,970
Even now,

584
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,310
there's a side of her
that you don't know.

585
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,640
But I know everything.

586
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,650
I'm always a part of Dan Oh's story.

587
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,290
You changed the stage as you wished.

588
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,430
But guess what?

589
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,460
Thanks to you,
she'll be receiving surgery.

590
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,430
Surgery?

591
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,570
Dan Oh and Do Hwa were oblivious,
and you took advantage of them.

592
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,970
But then again,

593
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,170
Do Hwa had a trivial role
and was in one-sided love,

594
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,710
and Dan Oh had a heart illness.

595
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,780
I would've been tempted had you
said you'd change my fate too.

596
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,450
Did you have fun?

597
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,450
You'll no longer be able to change
anything since I found out...

598
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,660
how you changed the stage
as a mere extra.

599
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,560
I wonder how you changed it.

600
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,460
Was it through the storyboard
that Dan Oh read?

601
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,160
Or was it through that book?

602
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,430
"Trumpet Creeper"?

603
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,450
You're finally home.

604
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,450
What? Why are you here?

605
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,220
You're all that I have now.

606
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,450
My family and friends are all fake.

607
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,790
Everyone's fake to me.

608
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,530
Everyone whom I've cherished
left me.

609
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,830
I had hoped you'd never leave me.

610
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,300
That's why I didn't want
to like you.

611
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,800
I'm sorry, but don't do this.

612
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Then you shouldn't have liked me
from the beginning.

613
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,570
You know very well
that it wasn't intentional.

614
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,910
Are you bringing up your set-up
once again?

615
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,280
- Don't use such excuses.
- Excuses?

616
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,950
Are you telling me that the stage
is fake, the shadow is real,

617
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,550
and that you cannot control
your set-up?

618
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,650
How do you differentiate
what's real and fake...

619
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,920
when this is real to me?

620
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,550
I'd still be in love with you
had I not been aware of myself.

621
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,290
But as you know,
I can no longer do that.

622
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,890
Then you shouldn't have made me
like you!

623
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,260
You said the shadow was real.

624
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,570
Then that means my feelings
for you are genuine.

625
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,470
- Kyung, but I...
- I don't care...

626
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,540
about how you feel.

627
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,070
I don't know how Haru is going
to change your fate,

628
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,410
but I can do it as well.

629
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,780
- What?
- I'll change your fate...

630
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,510
so that you won't have to die.

631
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,410
I can change the story too.

632
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Just watch and see.

633
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,820
You'll come to me
whether it's real or not.

634
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,820
Try to convince me
that my feelings are fake.

635
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,540
But guess what?

636
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,170
Thanks to you,
she'll be receiving surgery.

637
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,640
Perhaps, you are desperate...

638
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,310
because you've witnessed
her death already.

639
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,320
You won't be able to save her...

640
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,050
just like how you couldn't
back then.

641
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,420
If the stories are similar,

642
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,230
that means Dan Oh is in danger.

643
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,170
You were never able
to protect Dan Oh.

644
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,340
Haru.

645
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,580
Dan Oh, are you getting surgery
for your heart?

646
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,040
How are you?

647
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,780
Kyung, that punk.

648
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,380
No, I'm very healthy.

649
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,520
The date hasn't been scheduled.

650
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,720
Haven't you read about it?

651
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,190
Really?

652
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,190
Of course. I'm totally healthy.
I have a normal heart rate now.

653
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,200
I'm relieved.

654
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,040
But when you surprise me like this,
my heart beats faster.

655
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,310
I'm sorry.

656
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,840
Let's go. Haru

657
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,920
Look at these shoes.

658
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,920
Do you think
these are the artist's...

659
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,930
or someone else's?

660
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,590
I think it's the artist's.

661
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,160
Had the artist not drawn the shoes,
there wouldn't have been a painting.

662
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,670
What do you mean? The shoes
are real, but the painting isn't.

663
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,940
The painting is the real one.

664
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,110
What we're looking at right now
is the painting, not the shoes.

665
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,940
You're boring me.

666
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,550
See? A masterpiece like this one...

667
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,450
goes beyond the shoes themselves.

668
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,190
It makes you contemplate
about existence.

669
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,790
Today, you will draw things...

670
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,060
that can be interpreted
in various ways.

671
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,930
Draw your own masterpiece.

672
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

673
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,430
- I want to draw Kyung.
- Me too.

674
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,370
- Gosh. I want this one.
- Fine.

675
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,270
Give me that too.

676
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,210
Are you okay?

677
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,840
Yes. I'm fine. I really am.

678
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,840
All right.

679
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,950
- What's going on?
- What do I draw with?

680
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,220
I don't want you to get hurt.

681
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,450
Then what should I draw with?

682
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,630
Are you okay?

683
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,830
Yes.

684
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,670
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,470
I'm sorry, Dan Oh.

686
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,470
- You must've been surprised.
- No, I'm fine.

687
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,440
- Should I protect you as well?
- No, it's okay.

688
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:07,810
I'm really fine.

689
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,220
- Are you?
- Yes. I am.

690
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,460
Look at them.

691
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,430
- My goodness.
- I'm fine.

692
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,530
I'm not.

693
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,430
You've become bolder
since they won't remember this.

694
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,200
You've become so touchy.

695
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,300
I heard there's no going back
on bases.

696
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,840
If you're already
hugging each other,

697
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,310
- have you kissed already as well?
- Let's go.

698
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,770
Move aside.

699
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,310
- Hey!
- Who is it?

700
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,810
- It's Haru.
- Hi.

701
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,080
Watch where you're going.

702
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,910
Fine, we will.

703
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,280
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

704
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,920
- We should've been more careful.
- Are you okay?

705
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,220
Are you hurt?

706
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,190
What's wrong with him?

707
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,220
I don't know.

708
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,660
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

709
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,330
Don't they suit me?

710
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,430
They're so comfortable.

711
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,040
- Really?
- They don't feel new.

712
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,500
They're so comfortable as if
I've been wearing them for a while.

713
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,610
Just like you.

714
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,440
I'm going to wear these
every time we meet.

715
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,680
Ju Da.

716
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,350
Don't tell me...

717
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,920
"Take your time to think
about how you feel right now."

718
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,120
Take your time to think
about how you feel right now.

719
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,390
Ju Da.

720
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,860
Please remember...

721
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,690
this moment.

722
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:30,430
"Please remember this moment."

723
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,670
- Are you...
- You asked me to remember.

724
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,640
And I asked you to anticipate.

725
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,440
I was suddenly curious.

726
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,350
"Why am I bullied
with no apparent reason?"

727
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,420
"And why do I feel like
it's natural?"

728
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,190
When those natural moments
started to feel unfamiliar,

729
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,620
I remembered your voice.

730
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,690
"Take your time to think
about how you feel right now."

731
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,760
Even though others
couldn't remember...

732
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,200
what they said to me...

733
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,370
and there were gaps in my memory,

734
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,400
I wasn't afraid.

735
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,140
Because you started to fill
those gaps.

736
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,780
I'm truly exhilarated but...

737
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,450
Please keep it a secret.

738
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,790
At least for now,
I want to stay this way.

739
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,420
I want to be remembered by only you.

740
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,900
Can you do that for me?

741
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,180
I promised to go home with Haru.

742
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,510
Whose stage is this?

743
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,190
What's up with my lips?

744
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,320
The writer made me look too ill.

745
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,400
Are you okay?

746
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,530
Yes. I'm fine.

747
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,170
I have a heart problem,
but I'm coughing?

748
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,640
This makes no sense.

749
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,080
Let's go home.

750
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,750
Will that be the last leaf?

751
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,790
Dan Oh, can't you see...

752
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,490
there's plenty of leaves
on the tree?

753
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,460
Gosh, I have to make it
this obvious that I'm crying?

754
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,130
If you do everything you want to do,

755
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,730
will that help cure your illness?

756
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,330
This is enough for me.

757
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,170
You told me that you liked me.

758
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,740
I don't hate you.

759
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,240
I hate that you're sick.

760
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,440
I don't hate you. I hate
that my father treats you as money.

761
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,510
And I hate that he's my father.

762
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,720
I heard it from Do Hwa.

763
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,250
You'll be getting the surgery soon.

764
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,490
I don't...

765
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,460
want the surgery.

766
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:18,100
Going to school with you
makes me so happy.

767
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,830
I hate that I don't know how long
I must stay in the hospital...

768
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,100
once I get the surgery and that
I have to wait for you to visit me.

769
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,070
I'll stay by your side all the time.

770
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
Gosh.

771
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,920
Seriously. This writer doesn't
know the middle ground.

772
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,460
Goodness, look at this.
I look awful.

773
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,430
Hey, I'll get going.

774
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,700
What is this?

775
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,380
Did you take your medication?

776
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,510
Taking the medication
probably won't do anything.

777
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,250
I wonder when the storyboard
for the surgery will begin.

778
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,020
The storyboard?

779
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,750
Yes. In the operation room...

780
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:17,860
Forget it. I might be able
to change it like last time.

781
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,590
Anyway, this lame set-up of mine...

782
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,830
is getting nothing like the real me
as time passes by.

783
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,670
I'm turning more into my character.

784
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,670
Someone once asked me...

785
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,110
why she had feelings
that the writer didn't draw for her.

786
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,080
But why do I get...

787
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,580
the feeling that the writer knows
more about my feelings than me?

788
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,620
I just...

789
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,790
know one thing.

790
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,450
If you die too,

791
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,460
I'll suffer from a wound
I'll never recover from.

792
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,960
I don't care
if you think I'm selfish...

793
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,160
because I have always
been selfish...

794
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,900
and continue to be.

795
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,370
Just like you've been doing so far,

796
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,370
could you let me win this time too?

797
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,840
Let's get the surgery,

798
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,610
Dan Oh.

799
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,630
Haru, I'm sorry.
Did you wait for long?

800
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,200
I always make you wait for me.

801
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,230
- Are you okay?
- You asked me...

802
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,370
if I was okay so many times today.

803
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,470
You were overprotective
and made a fuss when it was nothing.

804
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,610
I was worried
that you might be sick.

805
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,480
Just because my heart
might stop any minute,

806
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,750
it doesn't mean I have to spend
every moment of my life in sadness.

807
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,720
And it doesn't mean you need
to protect me all the time. Okay?

808
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,490
What's the genre of our comic book?

809
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,290
It's a romance comic book.

810
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:59,330
I'm happy enough for having a chance
to spend time with you like this.

811
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,330
Dan Oh's first love
in a romance comic book.

812
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,030
This is nice, you know?
I have my own first love,

813
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,670
not the one writer decided for me.

814
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,970
If you get the surgery,

815
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,040
our time together might be over.

816
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
I know.

817
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,510
You...

818
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,680
You might die.

819
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,720
Before "Secret"... So,

820
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,120
before this world began,

821
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,490
there was another story about us.

822
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,930
In that story,

823
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,900
I saw you die.

824
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:42,940
Haru.

825
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,100
Even if there was such a story,

826
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,340
we're here together.

827
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,670
That story...

828
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,640
That story is repeating
even in this world.

829
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,980
I can't.

830
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,690
I can't live without you.

831
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:01,390
I will change it no matter what.

832
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,120
- I don't want to change it.
- No, we must!

833
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,390
I...

834
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,930
I can't let you go.

835
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,830
I'll change it no matter what.

836
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,780
I'm scared that I might lose you.

837
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,790
I'm scared, Dan Oh.

838
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,580
Well, you know
the story you told me?

839
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,910
The story where I died in?

840
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,520
Don't pay too much attention
to the story in the past.

841
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,680
I just feel like the story is
repeating in our world too.

842
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,890
Is that what Dried Squid Fairy said?

843
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,220
There he goes again.
He's scaring you again.

844
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,190
Gosh. How will you survive
in this tough world of comics...

845
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:16,600
if you're that weak-hearted?

846
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,430
Dan Oh.

847
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,500
Since I was born
with a heart problem,

848
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:23,340
I didn't expect to live a long life
like the others.

849
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,440
But I don't feel good...

850
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,870
- about that surgery.
- I don't even know for sure...

851
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,440
if I'll get the surgery or not.

852
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,180
Besides, I won't die
just because I have the surgery.

853
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,550
I survived even after...

854
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:37,250
so many complicated surgeries
since birth.

855
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,590
No way. There's no way...

856
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,890
the writer would let me die now.
Don't you think so?

857
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,990
Do you...

858
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,460
want the surgery?

859
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,540
Tell me...

860
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,240
what you want.

861
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,640
Spending time with you like this...

862
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,480
until the stage starts.

863
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,420
Bye, Haru.

864
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,480
I really want to change it.

865
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,890
I want to live
just as much as anyone.

866
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,390
I don't know
how I should change the stage...

867
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,130
and what I should tell Haru.

868
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,270
Dear Writer,

869
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,510
please.

870
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,510
Please let me live a bit longer.

871
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,980
Please.

872
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,650
I'm begging you.

873
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,720
Please let me live a bit longer.

874
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,600
Please let me live a bit longer.
I'm begging you.

875
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,610
Please.

876
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,880
Dear Writer, please let me live.

877
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,520
Please let me live.

878
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,490
Nam Ju didn't have to be that cool.

879
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,830
- Do Hwa.
- Hey, Haru.

880
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,400
I'm just a mere character who
can't even change the stage himself.

881
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,500
How did you change the stage?

882
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,000
Is it because of
your ardent love for Dan Oh?

883
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,740
I get it.
Dan Oh's set-up is really sad.

884
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,010
Right. Did you hear? I heard it
from my brother yesterday.

885
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,740
He picked a date
for Dan Oh's surgery.

886
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,150
- What?
- Don't be so surprised.

887
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,780
Don't worry.
My brother is a great surgeon.

888
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,380
I think he's telling her tonight.

889
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,390
Tonight?

890
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,890
Do Hwa.

891
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,560
I need...

892
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,760
to change the stage.

893
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,430
I need to get my brother's clothes.
What else do I need?

894
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,500
The watch?

895
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,270
No, the tennis ball.
No, this isn't it.

896
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,400
What are you doing?

897
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,670
Oh, Kyung. I didn't change anything.

898
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,710
I didn't do it.

899
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,440
You're going to change it again?

900
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,980
This time, is it for Dan Oh?

901
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,480
What are you talking about?
You're one funny guy.

902
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,920
You don't have to tell me.
I'll find it.

903
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,520
It's already drawn anyway.

904
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,730
Dad.

905
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,460
Yes, I'm almost there.

906
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,400
Where am I going? To the hospital?

907
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,640
What is Dr. Lee going to tell me?

908
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,340
He made sure that I come with you.
It's scary.

909
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:55,510
Okay, Dad. I'll see you there.

910
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,650
Will I really get operated on?

911
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,970
Everything has been
drawn in this book...

912
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,240
as if someone is watching this.

913
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,920
My lady!

914
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,320
My lady.

915
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:14,220
You must run away.

916
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,690
He will put you in danger.

917
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,670
Explain this.

918
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,510
You will not remember it.

919
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,640
What?

920
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,650
Everything will collapse
at this rate.

921
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,110
Please stop your treason.

922
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,120
Please let Lady Dan Oh live.

923
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,620
- You.
- I already know...

924
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,920
this is far from what you hoped for.

925
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,150
So please...

926
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,360
Please remember.

927
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,630
If you do not, we might end up
pointing our knives at each other.

928
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,000
My lady.

929
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,940
My lady.

930
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:10,080
(Extra-ordinary You)
