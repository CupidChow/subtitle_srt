00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,120
The pain of unrequited love tasted sweet.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,809
But when we are together,

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,540
there's the pain of fearfully wondering when it will end.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,200
Maybe I'd be better off giving up.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,280
Kiyoi?

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,260
It's really him. This isn't a dream.

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,699
- Kiyoi?
- Don't be so creepy.

8
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,339
B-B-But I thought...

9
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,690
You'd never see me again?

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,700
Then why didn't you chase after me or call me?

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,310

- Do you know why

Well, that might be right.

- What?

17

Sorry, Kiyoi.

That's amazing. I'm freaking out.

69
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,399
- You're amazing too, Momo-chan, with all that influencer stuff.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,609
But Shima's way more amazing. She has 30,000 followers.

71
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:30,229
Wait, 30,000?

No, it's not that great.

73
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,879
But I guess the most impressive is Kiyoi-kun.

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,209
No. Shirota's the most impressive.

75

Me?

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,539
Well, that's true. Who would've thought Shirota would be with Kurata-chan.

77
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,699
When did this happen?

78
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,080
Right after high school.

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,629
Shirota-kun came to my part-time job.

80
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,930
That's when.

81
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,459
But I was really surprised. I thought Shirota-kun liked more flashy girls.

Yeah, I've changed since then. We both have though.

Yeah. I didn't know Shirota-kun was so sensitive and sweet.

That's how he is.

Tricks like prodding him or alluding to something

101

won't work on someone like him.

102

I know this.

how long you're gonna stay with me?

112
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,260
My entire life belongs to you.

Even if you don't need it.

114

Then why would I be with you?

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,010
You're not

looking at me.

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm not worthy of you.

119
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,319
You're the greatest.

120
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,840
You're handsome and have amazing talent.

121

That's true.

122
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:13,430
But I'm just a pebble rolling on the dirt ground.

123

I can't even interview for part-time jobs properly.

That's why I keep wondering if it's okay...

130
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,280
to be by your side.

131
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,710

Wh... Why?

136
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,500
"Why"?

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,559
I... I mean,

138
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,969
I'm just a pebble, and...

139
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:11,220
I don't care if you're a pebble or not.

140
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,149
What?

141
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,410
Sorry, but...

142
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,050
I won't let you have a one-sided love again.

143
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,680
Kiyoi...

144
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,359
even if you don't find a job after graduation,

145
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,029
I'm earning enough for both of us.

146
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,890
I can feed another mouth or two.

You don't like that?

149
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,980
Then I was lying.

150
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,649
I want you to be like a workhorse.

151
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:55,160
I'll throw you away if you cause me any trouble.

152
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,860
So creepy.

153

"If it's the same as until now,"

154
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,830
"then no."

155
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,260
When you said that,

156
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,680
it made me happy.

157
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,950
What?

158
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,089
Hey, are you making fun of me?

159
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,770
N... No.

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,589
All right. Pedal like a workhorse.

169
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:03,573
Okay.

170
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:06,129
I want this time to last forever.

171
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,519
- There are stairs.
- Okay.

172
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,438
So that photographer, Hiromi Noguchi...

173
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:19,913
Yeah?

174
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,159
I showed him everyone's photos,

175
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,520
and he asked why you're the only one who didn't submit anything.

176
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:30,603
He was pretty angry.

177
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,690
What?

178
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,410
He wants you to come alone and apologize to him.

179
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,413
What?

180
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:40,020
But this again...

181
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,940
Thank you so much.

182
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,689
Good work today.

183
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,660
Good work.

184
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,929
Do you like chocolate, Kiyoi-kun?

185
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,259
Sure, I don't hate it.

186
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,440
This year will probably be tough.

187
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,169
You'll probably get a ton.

188
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:58,079
I hope so.

189
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,010
You should tell your girlfriend, or she'll get angry.

190
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,719
I don't have a girlfriend. I have a boyfriend.

191
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, really?

192
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,989
Yeah. We're kinda...

193
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,833
living together.

194
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,840
That's nice.

195
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,350
But he's a weirdo.

196
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,859
We always fight.

197
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:25,050
But I'm still jealous.

198
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,939
I have someone I cherish too.

199
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,889
- Huh?
- Don't tell the CEO.

200
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,020
Okay. Is he in this industry too?

201
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,399
Yeah.

202
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,520
So I can't tell anyone, and we never get to meet.

203
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,460
And I hate him so much when we're apart.

204
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,079
But... I like him a lot.

205
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,600
Well, I don't know how it'll turn out,

206
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,259
and I keep getting suspicious about whatever he's thinking.

207
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,219
I know how that feels.

208
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,700
- Right?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,030
That's why I have to trust myself

210
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,560
and be true to myself.

211
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,080
I mean, we might never get to meet after tomorrow.

212
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,670
Excuse me.

213
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,330
Um, well...

214
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,180
I sincerely apologize!

215
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,879
Sorry, can you hold this?

216
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,620
Oh, well, um,

217
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,770
I came to apologize.

218
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,489
- Okay. There.
- Okay.

219
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,890
Okay then. Let's do a costume change.

220
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,130
Yes. Coming.

221
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,010
Here.

222
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,020
So? About what?

223
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,120
Um, I was the only one in my club that didn't submit a photo.

224
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,259
Oh, Kazunari Hira, huh?

225
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,010
He remembers my name.

226
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,489
It's over for me.

227
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:15,259
Hey, what're you talking about?

228
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,250
Like I said,

229
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,180
I was the only one who didn't submit a photo.

230
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,839
It was my decision, not Koyama, so...

231
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,779
Or I mean, our club president's not at fault.

232
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,679
I'm not angry about anything.

233
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,089
I did say I want you to come, since I'm too busy to go out.

234
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,409
Huh?

235
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,160
What a scary game of telephone.

236
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,700
Can I have that?

237
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,740
Oh, yes, go ahead.

238
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,680
You brought it.

239
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,170
Oh, yes.

240
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,350
It's good, right?

241
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,139
Yes.

242
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,450
Coffee's the one thing I brew carefully.

243
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,780
One of my assistants recently went back to the countryside.

244
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,340
It was really unfortunate.

245
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,369
Oh, was he talented?

246
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:35,360
It was like he was born to be an assistant.

247
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,020
But now I'm buried in work.

248
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,009
I have mountains of data to get through.

249
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,259
I have no time to eat or sleep,

250
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:50,080
so my instant food intake and blood pressure are skyrocketing.

251
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,679
Oh, um, so then...

252
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,369
I'll take my leave then.

253
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:02,319
My radar's going off. He and I don't match.

254
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,940
I can tell. I can tell. I can tell.

255
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,879
- Hira-kun.
- Y... Yes?

256
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,129
Will you be my assistant?

257
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,089
Your assistant?

258
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,820
I told you my situation earlier, right?

259
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,320
Um, what year are you?

260
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,149
I'm a senior.

261
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,200
- Got a job lined up?
- I haven't found one yet.

262
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,959
So that's why you entered the Young Photo Graphica.

263
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,739
How did you know?

264
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,319
I'm a judge.

265
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,230
You saw it?

266
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,410
It was such a childish photo.

267
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,299
You should've just chosen an empty place rather than erasing people.

268
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,789
Going out of your way to erasing people

269
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,639
made it very clear that you hate this world.

270
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,999
I'm so embarrassed.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,749
It's like he sees right through me.

272
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,890
What I felt from your photo

273
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,250
was tremendous selfishness and disgust.

274
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,140
You haven't succeeded at all,

275
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,740
but you think you're amazing.

276
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,399
But instead of showing it outright,

277
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,760
you make a shell by belittling yourself.

278
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,150
You look down on this world with youth, stupidity,

279
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,290
and ambiguity.

280
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,830
So do you want to be my assistant?

281
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:30,358
What part of that makes you want me to be your assistant?

282
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,825
You're just like the old me.

283
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,049
What?

284
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,909
So when can you start?

285
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:41,420
Well, you can leave once you find out what you want to take photos of.

286
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,280
I have something like that already.

287
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,230
I do.

288
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,820
You're late. You didn't even call.

289
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,809
I found something.

290
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,143
What?

291
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,630
I guess you could call it a job.

292
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,140
With Noguchi-san the photographer.

293
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,650
Noguchi-san? Do you mean Hiromi Noguchi?

294
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,040
He's doing Anna's photo book too.

295
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,819
I'll be his pupil...

296
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:21,690
His assistant, right?

297
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,300
Oh, yeah. That.

298
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,910
Noguchi-san's big in the industry.

299
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,389
He's flashy. Can you keep up?

300
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,780
There's a photo I want to take.

301
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,449
A photo?

302
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:45,420
A photo of you.

303
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,139
You're always taking those, though.

304
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,200
On the same set.

305
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,479
Whether it's a magazine or online,

306
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,130
I'll take your photo one day.

307
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,650
I want it to say "Photo by Kazunari Hira."

308
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,359
I don't care if it's in small print.

309
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,140
Just on the same set.

310
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,340
In the same space.

311
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,140
Is that okay?

312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,210
Why would you ask me that?

313
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,820
I mean...

314
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,090
Congrats.

315
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,440
Here.

316
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,149
Commander Duck?

317
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:39,239
It's not just to congratulate you,

318
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:43,800
but it's for Valentine's Day.

319
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,229
I'm so happy. I'll treasure it.

320
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,109
Oh no, I don't have anything.

321
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,509
But, um, I can't just touch Kiyoi's gift.

322
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:57,669
- It's fine. Just take it.
- Wait just a second. I'm gonna take a photo.

323
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,063
Here.

324
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,135
I think I'm gonna die.

325
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,599
What?

326
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,390
I'm so happy, I could die.

327
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,870
Every time I see this, I'll remember this feeling.

328
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,049
Come on, eat the chocolate.

329
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,049
We can't! I'm gonna save it.

330
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,750
Um, save it forever.

331
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,060
How do you save chocolate again?

332
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,440
Where...

333
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,960
Come on.

334
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,220

It's sweet.

340
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,000
Sorry, Kiyoi.

341
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,540
I can't wait any longer tonight.

342
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,390
♫ I want to be loved, my love is withering ♫

♫ Meet me in your dreams ♫

345
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,519
Fall has passed, and we greet the end of winter.

346
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
A new season begins.

347
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,359
Spring comes again.

348
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,370
Wait, tenfold?

349
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,737
They're hooked on you.

[Eternal]

351
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,399
Maybe it's from Mr. Suspicious.

352
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,199
No, something's different.

353
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,220
We're moving forward, albeit slowly.

354
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,330
We're standing side-by-side.

355
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,679
I wonder if the cherry blossoms are blooming soon.

356
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,980
Yeah.

357
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,310
I bet it'll be pretty.

358
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,890
Yeah.

359
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,080
Kiyoi under the blossoms, that is.

360
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,850
So creepy.

361
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,030
♫ I want to be burdened ♫

362
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,870
♫ With all good things ♫

363
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,169
Stop taking candids. Erase it.

364
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:45,519
Sorry. Don't.

365
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,789
Wait, why? Stop!

366
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,599
- How do I erase it?
- You can't!

367
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,179
- Erase it!
- The photos aren't erasable.

368
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,529
It's the end of our school days.
- Please!

369
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:56,916
Graduation is right around the corner.
