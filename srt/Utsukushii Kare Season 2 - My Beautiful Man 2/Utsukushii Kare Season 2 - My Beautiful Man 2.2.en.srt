"I like you."

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,057
Those are simple words, aren't they?

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,159
Ask before taking photos.

4
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:19,820
Oh, um, sorry.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,019
You just looked so nice.

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,390
Well, I guess that's fine.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,910
It's as if I could hear his heart through his eyes.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,950
When will he say he likes me?

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,090
Those are tea olives.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,070
Tea olives?

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,410
They have a sweet, acidic aroma.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,610
Does smelling this bring back memories?

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,443
Of what?

14
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,459
You're so creepy.

15
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,853
Oh, um, sorry.

16
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:09,633
Since this is a precious moment,

17
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,399
I wanted to...

18
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:13,340
Wanted to what?

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,060
Keep it forever.

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,719
Say it already.

21
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,190
What?

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,710
It's nothing.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,059
They're simple words, aren't they?

24

Say them already.

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,320
Hurry. Hurry.

26
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,029
Hira, are you really going to

27
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,805
stay with me "forever"?

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,797
I'm kind of thirsty.

29
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,625
I see.

What the hell?

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,819
I-I-I'm out of ginger ale.

Hey!

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,899
I'm sorry! I'll go out and get some now!

He's so creepy.

37
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,850
Why would you go alone?

38
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,939
But it can't be helped.

39
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:47,245
Being creepy is a part of Hira.

40
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,640
Why do I feel this way toward a guy like him?

What? Does Hira-san have an interview?

55
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,109
Wait, where did he get one?

56
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,159
A creative company like Koyama-san?

57
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,139
No, it's for a part-time job.

58
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,140
A part-time job? Now of all times?

59
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,230
I thought it'd be good practice for job hunting,

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,359
but I didn't pass.

61

What?

Oh, I got my part-time job too.

63

- Are you not eating?
- Yes.

64

Chief, Hira-san, what about you two?

Oh, um...

Sorry, I'm eating at home today.

Got it.

Well then, goodbye.

Oh, then I'll leave too.

Good work.

Yeah.

If that's the reason, then they're not worth your time.

You'll be fine, Hira.

Your photos are amazing.

87

About the stage play with Oba-san...

97
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:54,690
How was it?

98
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,880
You didn't fit what they were looking for.

99
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,019
But Oba-san really liked you, Kiyoi-kun.

100
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,629
They just couldn't change the character this time.

Sorry.

He says he wants to do his play with a new cast next year.

104
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:21,969
- Introduce me and...
- Why do you like stage plays so much, Kiyoi-kun?

105
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:23,589
Why?

106
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,849
I mean, rehearsals take up time

107
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,660
and dramas get your name out faster.

108
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,689
That's true...

109
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,473

I only have this gig today since I work at the same agency as her.

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,909
I heard from the CEO that you're getting lots of work.

117
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:00,259
It is a pleasure to be a part of your agency.

118
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,300
I don't like how you said that.

119
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,400
What?

120
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,190
Regardless of how you got it, there are lots of people who want the roles you've gotten.

121
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,790
Stay focused.

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,670
Sorry.

Um, could you be less creepy about it?

Oh, sorry...

Hey, isn't he Mr. Suspicious?

134
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,490
"Mr. Suspicious?"

135
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,299
Wait, please stand back.

136
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:54,430
- Please stand back.
- Sorry, sorry.

137
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,960
Sorry.

138

You're... always here, right?

139
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,510
Sorry.

Right,

Kiyoi-kun is great.

145
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,649
Anna praised him in a recent magazine interview,

146
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,100
saying he has great acting sense.

147
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,940
Kiyoi-kun also said in a behind-the-scenes video

148
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,029
that he's learning a lot from Anna's acting.

149
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,370
Yeah,

150
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,000
I get it.

151
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,920
Anna really is amazing.

152
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,990
When I was really depressed, I saw Anna's movie for the first time.

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,440
She really surprised me and touched my heart.

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,503
I see...

155
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:58,949
When I was ready to die at any moment,

156
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,869
I saw Anna,

157
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:04,440
and it was as if the screen sucked me in.

158
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,470
How do I put this?

159
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,280
It's like she took my soul.

160
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,416
I know how that feels.

161
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,210
Thank you.

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,390
Here.

Thank you.

166
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,459
It was a short scene, but it feels like we had a proper chat.

167
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,788
It was like we were just reading lines.

168
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:45,500
Yeah.

169
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,929
Movies are fun too, you know.

170
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:56,029
Um, it's not that I only want to do stage plays, but...

171
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,210
I know.

172
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,819
You just like plays, right?

173
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,480
Yes.

174
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,245
All those people giving you their undivided attention

175
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:09,269
give me such a rush in real-time.

176
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,820
An excitement that borders on fear.

177
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,149
You're fascinated by things that are ever-changing.

178
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,519
Well, but that kind of thrill isn't all that I want.

179
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,859
Is that right?

180
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:26,230
Yeah, in my private life.

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,790
Like in romance?

182
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,840
I guess so.

183
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,609
The one I'm with is... How do I put this?

184
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,230
They're always the same.

185
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,989
Sorry for talking about this with you, Anna-san.

186
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,139
It's fine. Let's just be casual.

187
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,749
- But you're my senior.
- I understand.

188
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,480
What?

189
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,570
That feeling of wanting things to stay the same forever.

190
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,110
Even though that could never be possible.

191
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,609
In your places, everyone!

192
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:07,140
Coming! Let's go.

193
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,640
Okay.

194
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,939
- Kiyoi-kun.
- Yes?

195
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,999
Tell me more later.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,290
Huh? About what?

197
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,479
The guy I like waits for me and makes food for me.

198
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,480
This is happiness.

199
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,569
Our feelings won't change.

200
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,019
They'll continue on forever.

201
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,620
That's what I believe,

202
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,280
but...

203
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,460
Hira...

204
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,452
I'm sorry!

205
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,886
What?

206
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,999
You're tired from work, yet I fell asleep first.

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,769
Geez, I'm such a bad person.

208
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,710
Of course you're not.

209
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,053
What?

210
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,975
Wait, Kiyoi.

211
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,410
Don't play dumb.

212
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,520
You know what I'm trying to do here.

213
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,860
You tried to wake me because I fell asleep?

214
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,240
Slap, slap?

215
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,960
Stupid Hira.

216
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,960
Stop messing around.

217
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,519
Answer it.

218
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,849
Oh, but, um...

219
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,820
Just answer it.

220
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,710
Okay.

221
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,940
Hello?

222
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,577
Yeah.

223
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,052
Who is it?

224
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,610
Right,

225
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,050
it's Koyama.

226
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,449
What?

227
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,879
He's giving me a referral for a part-time job.

228
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,540
I don't like that.

229
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,230
I'll try it out.

230
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,690
Koyama liked Hira.

231
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,249
Is past tense appropriate here?

232
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:34,730
Hira said he'd quit the photography club,

233
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,399
but I said to not worry about it.

234
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,639
But I'm not happy about my man being in the same club as

235
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,960
someone he has a history with.

236
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,970
I can't be mature about this.

237
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,519
Hello.

238
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,049
Oh, you're here.

239
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,020
Yes.

240
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,659
Irima-san, I heard you were cast in Oba-san's play.

241
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,060
Yeah, I wanted to rehearse on my own beforehand.

242
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,640
All right.

243
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,459
Oh, I saw your drama, Kiyoi. Nice work.

244
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,750
I sure know talent when I see it.

245
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,940
Thank you.

246
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,959
Oh, did you hear about Koyama? The older one?

247
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,260
Yeah.

248
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,360
He got a job.

249
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,430
It'll be tough for him to do both.

250
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,350
Yeah.

251
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,090
I wanted to do more plays with him,

252
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,260
but time sure is cruel.

253
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,119
Huh? What's up?

254
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,204
Oh, my brother asked me to get some stuff he left behind.

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,300
Long time no see.

256
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,780
Hello.

257
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,433
Oh, I saw your drama since Hira keeps talking about it.

258
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:18,360
He talks about me at university?

259
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,105
Hira keeps talking about it all the time,

260
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:24,000
so I ended up wanting to watch it.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,209
But it kinda pisses me off.

262
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,099
Is he saying he sees a side of Hira that I don't?

263
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,289
Is he asserting dominance?

264
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,152
I heard you're referring him to a part-time job.

265
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:36,260
Yeah.

266
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,349
Thanks for taking care of Hira.

267
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:43,390
But I'm surprised that he's doing a part-time job.

268
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,798
Isn't he doing it for you?

269
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,129
What?

270
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:50,159
Since you're working so hard,

271
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,940
he's making food for you every day, right?

272
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,500
I don't know how to feel about it, though.

273
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,110
What do you mean?

274
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,419
You're freeloading at Hira's house, right?

275
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,699
- "Freeloading?"
- Aren't you, though?

276
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,379
You make him do all the chores

277
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,709
while you only focus on whatever you want.

278
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,339
That's so unbalanced.

279
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,739
He's really not letting up.

280
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,609
Well, it can't be helped.

281
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,029
You don't seem like a good cook.

282
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,269
Huh? I can cook.

283
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,869
Really?

284
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:26,940
Well, if I have a recipe.

285
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,539
A hot pot dish?

286
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,749
It's super simple.

287
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,630
Wait, but...

288
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,380
Thanks.

289
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,660
Oh, also, um...

290
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,359
Cut the spinach.

291
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,389
Simmer the pork meat.

292
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:24,330
Reduce... the saké?

293
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,510
What does "reducing" mean?

294
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,020
Well, I guess you simmer it in saké.

295
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,050
Must be careful of food poisoning with pork.

296
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,760
I'll wash it.

297
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,660
It's looking quite good.

298
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,760
The sauce uses soy sauce and...

299
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,440
Grated radish?

300
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,859
Well, it'll taste the same even without grated radish.

301
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,330
I wonder how Hira will react.

302
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,399
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

303
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,010
Huh? That's...

304
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,679
- Come, hurry.
- Wait, hold on. Hold on.

305
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,039
- Hurry.
- My shoes!

306
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,220
Did... Did you make this, Kiyoi?

307
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,159
I felt like it today.

308
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,199
Wow, this is amazing.

309
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,219
Your cooking is on the same level as grapes from Olympus.

310
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,539
What's this guy going on about?

311
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,980
But I can tell he's impressed.

312
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,140
Let's eat.

313
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,050
Let's eat.

314
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,659
Stop eating!

315
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,009
Huh? Why?

316
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,419
Stop it!

317
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,759
- Stop it!
- Why? Why?

318
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,159
- Why?
- Why, you ask?

319
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,229
The spinach tastes like dirt, and it's actually gritty.

320
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:43,119
I didn't put any sand in it or anything.

321
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,960
And it reeks of saké.

322
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,690
High-grade sake of the gods.

323
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,750
It's the hot pot of the gods.

324
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,059
- Give it.
- Wait, why? Wait, wait. Why?

325
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,280
Hold on a second.

326
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,009
Ah, wait! Stop hogging this amazing food.

327
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,959
Wait! Come on, wait.

328
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,910
Please...

329
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,679
Cooking's hard, huh?

330
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,113
What?

331
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,100
You're incredible.

332
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm not incredible at all.

333
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,579
I'm like a small pebble.

334
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:34,870
You're my man. Don't call yourself a pebble.

335
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,559
Kiyoi...

336
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,030
I'm not dating a pebble.

337
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,150
S-S-Sorry, Kiyoi. It happened

338
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,790
again.

339
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,390
Submit an entry for Young Photo Graphica.

340
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,100
I can't. I can't. I can't.

341
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,069
Yes, you can.

342
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:10,889
And tell me about your part-time job.

343
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,309
Or how you're scared of job interviews.

344
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,139
Why are you telling him this stuff and not me?

345
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,040
But I mean,

346
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,880
I can't talk to you about such embarrassing things.

347
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,860
Get the grand prize and become a pro.

348
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,339
P-Pro?

349
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,719
If you do that,

350
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,010
you can leap into a world where interviews don't matter.

351
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,170
But someone like me...

352
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,010
I like your photography.

353
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,180
I look best when I'm in your photos.

354
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,710
Kiyoi...

355
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,050
Take photos

356
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,630
of me.

357
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,850
In the same industry.

358
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,460
I'm drunk.

359
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,220
♫ I want to be loved, my love is withering ♫

360
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,710
♫ I want to be part of your world ♫

361
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,360
♫ Meet me in your dreams ♫

362
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
Are you entering Young Photo Graphica?

363
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,300
- Yeah.
- What?

364
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,699
Hira, are you entering Young Photo Graphica?

365
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:54,300
- "Get the grand prize and become a pro."
-Whoa, that's amazing!

366
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,609
I'm trembling from his expectations,

367
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,280
but it's a ray of light peeking from between the clouds.

368
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,400
♫ I'm waiting for one word ♫

369
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,760
- Hira.
- Kiyoi and I

370
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,130
aren't a good match, by any means.
[Drink some water I'll be right back]

371
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:20,860
But if I can improve myself even just a little...

372
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,589
In order to be in the same world as Kiyoi...

373
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,397
[This drama is fiction]

374
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:32,269
[Next Episode]
If I can be by your side,

375
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:35,015
I must take on this reckless challenge.

376
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,660
Cheers sound like...

377
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,391
Eternal!

378
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:40,747
Are they friends?

379
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:45,081
The autumn of postponement has ended and the winter of judgment is upon us.
