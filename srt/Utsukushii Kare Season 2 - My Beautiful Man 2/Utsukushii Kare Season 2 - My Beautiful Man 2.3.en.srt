People in the past have suggested that I enter photo contests.

00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:25,129
Photography is how I escape reality. There's nothing I really want to convey.

What about one of Kiyoi?

Well, but Kiyoi is a celebrity.

Oh, right.

It's such an extreme stage play, but she still seems so pure.

56

Is purity born from ignorance?

You don't know anything, so you can't realize your sins.

00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,389
I'll get a part-time job.

170
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,381
- So, um...
- It's fine.

171
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,585
Just try again next time.

172
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,193
What? A-Are you not mad?

173
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,311
Why would I be mad?

174
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,466
I mean, I didn't meet your expectations.

175
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,892
You wanted me to win and become a pro.

176
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:42,373
I never said to do it in one try.

177
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:46,743
And who do you think you are, expecting to never fail? Are you a god?

178
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,475
That's not it, but...

179
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,186
Then change your mindset and try again.

180
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:56,960
I didn't win my first competition either.

181
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,661
There are a lot of photo contests.

182
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:06,607
You'll lose steam if you don't keep going, so keep sending them in.

183
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,389
But...

184
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,112
Don't psyche yourself out.

185
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:14,756
Well, I know that.

186
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:16,390
How's this one?

187
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,824
Look.

188
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:22,032
The Ihei Nomura Photo Contest?

189
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,664
They say it's a photographer's gateway to success.

190
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:29,029
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

191
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,776
- I can't, I can't, I can't—
- There you go again.

192
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:36,483
But that's one of the most prestigious photography awards out there.

193
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:39,343
They don't allow public submissions.

194
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:42,445
It's for people with some level of experience.

195
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,683
People in the industry take a survey

196
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:47,764
on photos published from that year as candidates.

197
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:49,664
Then a board selects the winner.

198
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:52,431
- Then get chosen.
- Me?

199
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,264
Yeah.

200
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:57,874
Well, awards aren't everything, though.

201
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:00,839
Thanks for the food.

202
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:07,218
Once again, I was moved by the King's disposition.

203
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:10,429
The shrimp croquettes are amazing.

204
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:14,418
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

205
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,856
Even though I failed, he didn't intimidate me.

206
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:24,303
How do I set my eyes on such heights like he does?

207
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,949
Here, too.

208
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:28,841
Got it.

209
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,614
No, there's no point in thinking about it.

210
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:37,202
I just have to do whatever I can within my means.

211
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:42,842
This little chestnut will create a future with Kiyoi.

212
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:45,402
This little chestnut...

213
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,948
will be the foundation of eternity.

214
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,213
Eternal.

215
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:14,061
Hey, why did you take the night shift?

216
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,421
Don't go collapsing on me.

217
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:23,508
Thanks.

218
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,233
You're kidding!

219
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,113
What happened?

220
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,693
Oh, um, K... Kiyoi.

221
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,637
Can you go out for a little bit?

222
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,355
Huh? Why all of a sudden?

223
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,521
- Naho-chan is coming.
- Naho-chan? Who's that?

224
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:42,144
Naho-chan is my cousin and used to live here with my grandpa...

225
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,713
So for now...

226
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,380
Come on, hurry up, Kiyoi, um...

227
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,042
- Why are you so flustered?
- Over here.

228
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:58,842
Kazuki!

229
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,303
Is that Naho-chan?

230
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:05,631
Sorry, I happened to be in the area.

231
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,118
No, it's fine.

232
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,910
Auntie told me to come check in on you too.

233
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,334
Oh, my mom?

234
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:15,696
It's been crazy lately.

235
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,777
Your husband's busy with work, right?

236
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,358
Naho-chan?

237
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,280
Let's not talk about me.

238
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:30,865
I was surprised.

239
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:33,956
Isn't that guy in TV drama?

240
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:36,840
The drama with Anna.

241
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,148
Oh, yeah.

242
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,389
I was surprised by how attractive he is.

243
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,648
He's attractive even up close.

244
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,973
And he has an aura.

245
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,515
Yeah, Kiyoi really is amazing.

246
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:53,165
He was a model in high school, and his agency sees potential in him,

247
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,780
so they're focusing on him a lot.

248
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,240
Oh, and look at this.

249
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:59,569
He's making a guest appearance on Starlight Cafe,

250
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,518
a show that only popular young actors can get on.

251
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:06,000
When you get the CD, it comes with autographed trading cards,

252
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,468
of which there are three types.

253
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:12,311
I can't bring myself to choose, so I think I'm going to have to try hard for a complete set.

254
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,676
Oh, and, um...

255
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:17,492
And...

256
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,390
You're more like a fan of his

257
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,820
than a friend, huh?

258
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,403
Yeah.

259
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:28,042
I guess I'm a fan.

260
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,661
You're a fan and a friend, right?

261
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,218
Oh, um...

262
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,561
I guess so.

263
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:42,491
He's... a friend.

264
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,822
A friend.

265
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:54,032
A friend.

266
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,647
Kiyoi doesn't eat cake, right?

267
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:10,346
Watch it.

268
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,502
Hey, Kiyoi.

269
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,585
Watch your manners.

270
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:20,143
Are you friends with Kazu-kun?

271
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,719
Let's clean up quickly and have dinner.

272
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,197
What did you talk about?

273
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,500
It seems my mom asked her to come to check up on me.

274
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,955
- Seriously?
- Oh, but it's okay.

275
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:57,615
I didn't tell her you're living with me.

276
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:01,092
Then how did you explain why I'm here?

277
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, I got a bit excited,

278
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,017
and she asked if I was a fan at first.

279
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,717
- What?
- But...

280
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:15,560
I was able to convince her that we were friends.

281
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,137
Okay...

282
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:23,355
So I told her we're friends,

283
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:30,400
but I actually...

284
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,000
Didn't like that.

285
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,510
Hira...

286
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,195
You and I being friends?

287
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:42,244
That's so disrespectful.

288
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,785
Kiyoi?

289
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,824
No, okay then.

290
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:56,433
That's good then.

291
00:18:56,433 --> 00:19:00,100
Your mom must be relieved to know

292
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,940
you have a friend.

293
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:05,552
Oh, sorry.

294
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:09,456
Are you worried about my parents?

295
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,601
Of course I am.

296
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,654
They're your parents, after all.

297
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,913
It's fine, Kiyoi.

298
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:25,350
You and my parents are totally unrelated.

299
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:29,032
Unrelated?

300
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,970
Yeah.

301
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,520
You'll never have anything to do with my parents.

302
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,499
So you don't have to worry.

303
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:43,485
Kiyoi?

304
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:48,028
I'll never have anything to do with your parents?

305
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,983
Never. I promise.

306
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,935
Kiyoi?

307
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:59,194
Do you have any idea how I feel right now?

308
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:00,592
I don't.

309
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,647
Don't just answer.

310
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:05,608
If you don't know, then think.

311
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,039
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,389
I don't want you to apologize.

313
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,279
But you're angry.

314
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,999
It's always like this!

315
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,717
When I get angry, you automatically apologize.

316
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,795
But you don't really understand what I was trying to say!

317
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,421
There's no way I understand!

318
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,848
How can a stargazer tell what the star is thinking?

319
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:28,834
Why are you in space all of a sudden?

320
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,459
There is no cross-over between you and me.

321
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,495
Different paths and dimensions.

322
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,313
That's why stars shine so brightly.

323
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:37,843
If I actually tried to understand,

324
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:40,234
it would only drag the star down.

325
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:43,163
So what I want to say,

326
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:46,932
is basically that...

327
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,480
I don't...

328
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,350
want to understand you.

329
00:21:01,154 --> 00:21:02,811
Kiyoi?

330
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,750
So in the end,

331
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,679
you don't intend to move toward me, huh?

332
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:29,460
Wait!

333
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,210
Why?

334
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:36,461
Why? Why are you stopping me?

335
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:42,853
B... Because...

336
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,200
You prefer

337
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,570
a one-sided love, right?

338
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,538
Then stay there.

339
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,010
I'm sorry

340
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,620
for falling in love with you.

341
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,126
Why is that guy...

342
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:31,062
Kiyoi and I will never be able to understand each other.

343
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:33,230
It's a cycle of crossing paths,

344
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,560
only to fall apart again.

345
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:42,068
We can't stop time the way photos can.

346
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,022
That's good.

347
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,677
How can you be so popular?

348
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:55,520
Kiyoi teaches me a lot of new emotions.

349
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,343
Get the grand prize and become a pro.

350
00:23:00,343 --> 00:23:01,659
Stop wavering.

351
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:03,374
Don't psyche yourself out.

352
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:06,380
I look best when I'm

353
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,270
in your photos.

354
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,950
I don't get it.

355
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,300
What should I do?

356
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,921
I can't recognize my own sin out of ignorance.

357
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,305
God, you should...

358
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:26,367
just kill someone like me.

359
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,997

[Next Episode]
The pain of unrequited love tasted sweet.

361
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:34,724
I have someone I cherish too.

362
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,314
- Yoshida!
- Are you getting married?

363
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,020
It seems Hiromi Noguchi is mad.

364
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,519
If you keep sulking like a kid, you'll never get closer to him.

365
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,087
Graduation is coming up.
