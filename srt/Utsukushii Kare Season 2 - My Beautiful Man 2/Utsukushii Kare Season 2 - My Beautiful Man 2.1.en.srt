00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,973
"I like you."

2
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:10,168
Such simple words.

3
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:13,660
But they always get caught in my throat.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,730
It's hard to say it out loud.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,140
"Kiyoi."

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,035
Just saying his name makes my heart beat out of my chest.

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:24,785
You said my name.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,399
It almost felt religious.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,120
I didn't mind dying

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,130
while entranced by this sweet emotion.

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,849
I was fine with simply watching.

12
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:43,430
Like the sweet, acidic tea olive,

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,260
it felt like one touch would make everything crumble.

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,060
And yet...

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,980
people are greedy.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,613
Can I...

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,170
touch you, Kiyoi?

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,400
If you mean how you usually do,

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,400
then no.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,439
Please forgive me.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,800
This sin of touching God,

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,360
pretending that it's courage.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,470
No,

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,500
it's fine if I'm not forgiven.

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,210
In exchange, I was able to get

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,280
Kiyoi all to myself.

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,850
This is a miracle.

Good morning.

Are... you angry?

Why?

The days come and go peacefully, and time moves forward.

62
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,940
Every day wanes and waxes, changing its shape.

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,780
I can hear the footsteps of graduation coming near.

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,480
Hira-san, do you take photos of the moon?

65
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:23,879
Oh, the full moon is pretty.

66
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,215
Oh, well, um, to be precise, it's...

67
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:32,770
I think Hira-san's photos are similar to Noguchi's in his early days.

68
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,503
What?

69
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,310
I respect Noguchi a lot more.

70
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,949
He's getting cocky again.

71
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,840
Hira-san, you should definitely be careful of this guy.

72
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,009
Oh, Chief.

73
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,280
You guys are too loud. I can hear you in the halls.

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,259
Hira-san was picking on us.

75
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,599
- Yeah, yeah.
- Watch it.

76
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,310
Fall, my senior year.

77
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,340
I kept going back and forth on whether to quit the photography club or not,

78
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,740
but I wanted to support Kiyoi, so I ended up staying.

Yeah.

The tall guy with the hat and sunglasses.

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,770
He looks suspicious, no matter what angle you look at him from.

117
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,340
Just as his nickname implies.

118

Why is he wearing sunglasses at night?

119
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,550
Maybe he looks like a fish if you take them off.

Are you watching that special report again?

You show up there more than on your drama on air.

It was my mom's specialty.

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,739
Don't! It's hot.

Um... No, I do!

170
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:32,570
Anywhere is fine if you're there. I'll definitely go.

171
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,039
Which one is better?

172
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,429
Well, you look good in anything.

173
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,509
In any outfit.

174
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,890
What?

175
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,130
You're the one wearing it.

176
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,690
What?

177
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,659
The dressing room is over there.

178
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,539
But this doesn't have sleeves.

179
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,829
Start to think outside the box.

180
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,290
Come on!

181
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,980
What?

182
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,760
Are you done?

183
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,103
Nice.

184
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,629
This looks cute.

185
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,000
Outer space?

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,540
What?

187
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,270
These clothes look really cute.

188
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,339
I tried not to stand out.

189
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,479
Or at least avoided being indecent.

190
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:30,610
That's how I thought casual wear should be chosen.

191
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,999
But now, I'm with the King.

192
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,399
The man who I've always admired,

193
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,060
who I've always looked up to, like a nun, was right by my side,

194
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,680
shopping with me.

195
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Looking good.

196
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,120
Nothing could bring me more happiness than this.

197
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,670
But...

198
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,280
Yeah, this is better today.

199
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,330
...it also brings me fear.

200
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,130
I'll buy everything we wore today.

201
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,500
It looks so good.

202
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,930
That brown.

203
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,299
They say the amount of happiness one feels is predetermined.

204
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:20,280
In that case, I may only have misfortune in my future.

205
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,699
Kiyoi might dump me.

206
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,259
Kiyoi might hate me.

207
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,010
Kiyoi might die before me.

208
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,819
What should I do then?

209
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:31,019
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Two coffees, please.

210
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,720
Two coffees is 800 yen.

211
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,689
- E-pay, please.
- Please pay there.

212
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,780
Okay, thank you.

213
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,349
Here you go, two coffees.

214
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:42,739
- Thank you.
- Thank you, too.

215
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,560
Hey.

216
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,740
Thanks.

217
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,770
I might not be able to live anymore.

218
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,099
Am I going to die?

219
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,700
What are you mumbling about, with that droopy face?

220
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,070
I was thinking about how you might die before me.

221
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,420
Creepy.

222
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,860
S... Sorry.

223
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,300
Don't live in your own world.

224
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,120
We're hanging out in this one.

225
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,469
Thank you for thinking about me.

226
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:13,789
Since I have a real celebrity teaching me,

227
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,499
even someone like me has become...

228
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,490
"Has become?"

229
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,409
better.

230
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:25,850
I get the feeling that I get the feeling that maybe...

231
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,609
You're tall, and your hips sit higher, too.

232
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,510
If you wear clothes that suit you

233
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,360
and change your hairstyle, you'll look nice.

234
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,379
Thanks for comforting me.

235
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,469
I'm not comforting you.

236
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,003
Also,

237
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,340
your face isn't half bad.

238
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,573
What?

239
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,790
Koyama-san was complimenting you,

240
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,769
and my theater troupe said you have eyes that leave an impact.

241
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,559
But a lot of actors have strange tastes.

242
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,460
How negative can you be?

243
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,830
I mean...

244
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,440
Regardless of how you usually are, you look cool today.

245
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,139
No way.

246
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,760
Do you think I'm lying?

247
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,439
- I don't.
- Then believe me.

248
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:27,170
The way you are now...

249
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,780
You're handsome enough for me to fall in love again.

250
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:33,719
"Fall in..."

251
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,680
That was a lie.

252
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,270
Don't get so carried away, Hira.

253
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,180
Okay.

254
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,419
- Thank you.
- Yes.

255
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,200
Please come in.

256
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,780
Oh, um, well...

257
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,789
Talking to models and actors is a bit...

258
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, you wanted to be alone with me?

259
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,200
No, not that. That's not what I'm thinking.

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,770
You're not?

261
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,630
It's just...

262
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,690
I... I don't fit in here.

263
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,499
But you came to the show's after party.

264
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,499
I was desperate.

265
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,270
Wow, so you're not desperate now?

266
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,540
Since you already have me?

267
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,210
Kiyoi's eyes...

268
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,550
"I can cast you aside whenever I feel like it."

269
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,470
That's what they're saying.

270
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,419
Fine, I'll go say no.

271
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,720
Wait, I'll go even if it kills me.

272
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,500
What is this?

273
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,139
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

274
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,269
Excuse me, sorry.

275
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,310
Kiyoi.

276
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,040
Thanks.

277
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,689
Hey. Did you bring a friend, Kiyoi?

278
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,679
You're usually alone.

279
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,313
Well...

280
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,539
Wow, so you're Kiyoi-kun's friend.

281
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:11,569
Well...

282
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:14,759
Hey. Are you a regular college student?

283
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,530
I thought you were an actor.

284
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,959
- I'm not.
- Hey.

285
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,980
What are you doing in college?

286
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,200
Studying.

287
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,759
You're funny, Hira-kun.

288
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,810
Not at all.

289
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,779
Are you in any clubs?

290
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,620
Ph-Photography.

291
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,549
Do you want to be a photographer?

292
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:35,699
No, that's not it.

293
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,869
What? But you're good, right?

294
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:40,550
Hey, come on. Aake a pic.

295
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,889
- Here.
- What?

296
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,939
Let's take a picture.

297
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,919
Oh, um, sorry,

298
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,520
I... I need to use the restroom.

299
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,700
Sorry. Sorry.

300
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,779
I can't do this.

301
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,989
"No, not at all, no way, wow, amazing."

302
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,469
I can't expect those five phrases and a stiff smile

303
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:12,879
to get me through this battlefield.

304
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:14,839
But...

305
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,820
I must do my best.

306
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,030
Hira-kun.

307
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,150
You made everyone mad.

308
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,449
They think you're rude.

309
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,099
Oh, I'm sorry.

310
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:36,030
They are upset you won't hang out with them.

311
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,000
But I know how you feel.

312
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,940
It's kinda boring here.

313
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,170
Do you want to get out of here?

314
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,449
You're blocking the restroom.

315
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,000
Come on, read the room.

316
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,390
Thanks, Kiyoi.

317
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,959
Kiyoi's probably thinking,

318
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,860
"I can cast you aside whenever I feel like it."

319
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,690
No, that's not it.

320
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,600
Those eyes are saying,

321
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,250
"I'm going to kill you."

322
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,130
Wait, Kiyoi.

323
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,530
K-Kiyoi.

324
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,999
What?

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Well...

326
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,550
What?!

327
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,969
S-Sorry.

328
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:51,969
About what?

329
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,680
Well,

330
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,220
for feeling out of place and bringing the mood down.

331
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,389
You weren't out of place.

332
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,200
Then,

333
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,830
I'm sorry for acting weirdly and making that girl mad.

334
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,740
What?

335
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,509
In front of the restroom, she said people thought I was rude.

336
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,219
Who cares if she's upset?

337
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,053
Get over here.

338
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,640
Hands up.

339
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,250
- Hands up!
- Oh, okay.

340
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,510
Kiyoi?

341
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,010
See?

342
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,529
Wh-Who's that from?!

343
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,469
The girl you flirted with at the restroom.

344
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,119
"Flirted with?"

345
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,019
Why're you so defenseless?

346
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,329
You're such an airhead.

347
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,619
T-That's...

348
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,709
That's not what happened, um...

349
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,349
Then why didn't you reject her?

350
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:40,249
She was all over you.

351
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:43,710
Um... I was so shocked.

352
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,000
I couldn't move.

353
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,779
S-Sorry.

354
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,750
Are you mad because...

355
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,990
that girl...

356
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,910
got close to me?

357
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,490
You idiot. Take everything off.

358
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,110
- Strip!
- Wait!

359
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,749
She touched you everywhere...

360
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,319
Sorry, Kiyoi.

361
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,640
I don't think it'll happen again, but if it does, I'll reject her.

362
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,650
I bet you were a bit happy.

363
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,479
Of course not. I didn't take her photo either.

364
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,270
Why?

365
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,250
I only want to take photos of people I like.

366
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,420
Only of you.

367
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,010
Who said you can be popular, Hira?

368
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh, um, sorry.

369
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,170
Today...

370
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
we're going to do it.

371
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,999
We can do it today, too?

372
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,920
Don't get cocky!

373
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,120
Kiyoi!

374
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,789
You can sleep more.

375
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,190
Isn't your shoot in the evening?

376
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,420
I went too far yesterday.

377
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,240
I'm acting a bit weird.

378
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,790
What?

379
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,600
I get weird when it's about you.

380
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,500
Kiyoi...

381
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,160
A full moon?

382
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,770
No.

383
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,590
It's the 14th night.

384
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,820
The 14th night?

385
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,970
It's right before the full moon appears.

386
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,030
Wow.

387
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,299
I like him, I like him,

388
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,260
and like him so much, it's never enough.

389
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,359
It feels like the 14th night of the moon.

390
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,780
It'll probably continue on, forever hurting my heart.

391
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,170
What are you thinking?

392
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,180
You're teaching me things that I never knew about myself.

393
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,599
Right back at you.

394
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,200
Me too?

395
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,219
This smell.

396
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:28,170
You're the one who told me about the smell of tea olives.

397
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,690
When we were in high school.

398
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,870
Kazunari Hira.

399
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,950
He really makes me act strange.

400
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,829
I actually wanted to show off how cool my man is.

401
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,959
But when it seems like someone will steal him away,

402
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,510
I'm painfully lonely.

403
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,210
What is this contradictory feeling in my heart?

404
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,200
I want to know.

405
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,040
Hira.

406
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,873
Yeah?

407
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,720
Don't go anywhere.

408
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,203
Okay.

409
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:29,991
[This drama is fiction]

410
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,672
[Next Episode]
I wanted to keep it forever.

411
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:36,469
Are you really going to stay with me forever?

412
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,380
If only this could last forever.

413
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,790
- This one.
- We can't stop time.

414
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,050
If we want to be together, we have to move forward.
