[Episode 7]

21
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:31,648
How long do you plan
to give me the cold shoulder?

22
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:43,416
Fine, I admit it.

23
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,849
My approach was a bit rough.

24
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:46,882
But if I had told you first,

25
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:49,416
then would you have agreed?

26
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:52,481
You also don't want Cindy Wang
to turn things around.

27
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,615
Right?

28
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,916
Mr. Cai told me

29
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,148
that you specifically recommended Xu Yazi

30
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:03,915
for the director position, right?

31
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,014
Why is it Xu Yazi, who doesn't get along
with Cindy Wang, of all people?

32
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:10,014
Isn't Lin Yingjun more experienced?

33
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,215
Otherwise,

34
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,415
Guo Shijie is also not bad.

35
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,215
Or are you worried

36
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,348
that Guo Shijie still harbors
some affection for Cindy Wang,

37
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,715
and might give in to her?

38
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,049
In the end,

39
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,182
you just don't want Cindy Wang
to make a comeback.

40
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:26,348
Right?

41
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,449
Yes.

42
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,215
I just want to cut off her path to recovery.

43
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:35,148
Do you have anything else to say?

44
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:37,115
I also want to say

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,982
that I really love you.

46
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:43,581
I do this for our own good.

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,648
Without Cindy Wang as a stumbling block,

48
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:48,648
you can fully

49
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,081
run on a smooth road.

50
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:52,715
Isn't that great?

51
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,249
Do a good job on Mr. Xi's project.

52
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,049
Prove with your ability

53
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,081
that you are stronger than Cindy Wang.

54
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,883
I'm definitely stronger than her.

55
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,749
I know.

56
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:08,883
In my eyes, you're the most capable woman.

57
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:11,281
Cut out this act.

58
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,049
I've already sent

59
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,281
Mr. Xi's project to Mr. Cai.

60
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,782
I made it clear

61
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,682
that once it's signed,
I'll personally retrieve it.

62
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:24,316
Good.

63
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:26,014
When the time comes, you can hand it to me,

64
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,883
or given to Zhou.

65
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,281
If I find no issue after reviewing it,

66
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,348
then send it to finance.

67
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,482
Then we can start taking action.

68
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,281
Don't be angry anymore.

69
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:40,782
Let's see if you dare not to tell me next time.

70
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:42,682
Fine, I'll tell you everything.

71
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,115
What else do you want to hear?

72
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:47,648
Don't be angry.

73
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,915
It's always like this.

74
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:51,148
No way, it's only the first time.

75
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,249
Is that so?

76
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:01,449
Then we

77
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,516
think positively.

78
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,081
At least you're successful in love.

79
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,848
Right?

80
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,915
Seems like that's the only way
to think about it.

81
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,549
Anyway, just have a good sleep now.

82
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,182
Tomorrow, when the sun rises,

83
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:18,816
you'll be a brand new Cindy, darling.

84
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:21,049
You can do it.

85
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:24,449
Bye.

86
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,114
But I really want

87
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,748
to be a manager.

88
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:37,416
Otherwise, being a director is also fine.

89
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:11,114
Why am I always the one being punished?

90
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:14,949
I was originally in that position.

91
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,981
Getting back in her original place,

92
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:19,382
and being the head.

93
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,049
Cindy has always been holding onto this hope,

94
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,449
and continuously going forward.

95
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,114
What Gao Shuangyun did

96
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:27,316
is

97
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:30,114
blocking Cindy's road to revival.

98
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:47,015
Yes.

99
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:11,515
- The usual set for me.
- Do you want it spicy as usual?

100
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:13,114
- Spicy, please, it's delicious.
- Okay, please wait.

101
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:14,615
Thank you.

102
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,715
Boss, I want the same as him.

103
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:19,449
Okay, coming right up.

104
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,282
Director Zhang, morning!

105
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,748
Even bump into each other at breakfast.

106
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:27,282
We must be really in sync.

107
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:29,348
I swear, it's a coincidence.

108
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,282
Would you believe that?

109
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,081
Of course not.

110
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,182
You obviously came

111
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:38,182
for our company's Cindy Wang, right?

112
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,214
I heard

113
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:41,981
that Cindy

114
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,081
has a former subordinate who got promoted,

115
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,949
and took her old position.

116
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,015
Didn't expect

117
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,549
that Director Zhang of Bosheng

118
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:57,049
actually has informants in our company.

119
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,015
You even know such trivia.

120
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,783
Although I haven't known Cindy for long,

121
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,882
but I know she is a talent.

122
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:08,015
You treat her like this.

123
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,783
Aren't you afraid she will leave?

124
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,214
I…

125
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,783
Cindy Wang.

126
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,248
I've observed her for quite some time.

127
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:17,916
She works very hard,

128
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,816
and her performance is also good.

129
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,848
But if she really wants
to achieve great things,

130
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:25,449
I'm afraid she still needs to be tempered.

131
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,515
If you really want to poach her,

132
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,214
then give her more good opportunities.

133
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,214
What if you really poach her?

134
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,449
Then it means I haven't
won her heart in my leadership.

135
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,149
Is that okay now?

136
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,649
Here comes the food.

137
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,816
- Good, please enjoy.
- Thank you.

138
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,882
We've known each other
for more than a day or two.

139
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,549
I know you are cunning and strategic.

140
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:52,816
But at this stage,

141
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:55,348
I don't have such intentions yet.

142
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,848
I see.

143
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:01,649
You know Cindy is a talent.

144
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,182
But you definitely
don't know her little secret.

145
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,715
Cindy Wang

146
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:09,348
is quite a spicy pepper.

147
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:12,748
If you want to pursue her,

148
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,683
then you must learn to handle spicy first.

149
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,214
Get used to it.

150
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,615
Give it a try.

151
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,481
Okay.

152
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:29,282
From now on, I'll learn more from you.

153
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:30,548
And follow your lead.

154
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:32,816
- Eat more spicy food.
- Come on.

155
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:43,149
Cindy, my dear.

156
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,716
I have a gift for you.

157
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,381
What?

158
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,115
Want to see it?

159
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:03,214
What is this?

160
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:06,415
Full of love.

161
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:17,014
I must reward you well.

162
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,248
Come on.

163
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:39,816
Why would I have such a dream?

164
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:42,248
And it was with him.

165
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,081
Shouldn't I dream of Zhang Shiping?

166
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:50,516
Maybe I wanted that lucky charm too much.

167
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:53,149
But for a lucky charm, I would…

168
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:54,683
Wang Cunfeng.

169
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:58,615
You really want that lucky charm
too much, don't you?

170
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,649
It can't be that coincidental, can it?

171
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,849
Good morning.

172
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,149
What's up?

173
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,649
What do you mean, 'what's up'?

174
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,181
Aren't you going to change clothes quickly?

175
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,316
You're going to be late for work.

176
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,316
I'm not going to work today.

177
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,782
Taking a day off for myself.

178
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,615
Then I'll take a leave as well.

179
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:36,548
Since you're not going anyway.

180
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,683
It's up to you.

181
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:40,982
What are you going to do today?

182
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:42,748
I'll accompany you.

183
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:44,349
No need, I…

184
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,615
I'm going on a date today.

185
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:48,149
With Zhang Shiping?

186

let me fight for my career,

How does he, that big architect,
have so much free time?

190
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,482
Whenever you say you want to have a date,

191
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:01,615
and he has time to accompany you?

192
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:04,381
That's why people want to climb up.

193
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:06,282
Apart from financial freedom,

194
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,282
there's also freedom of time.

195
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,782
Is that so?

196
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,181
Then I wish you both

197
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:13,516
a pleasant date.

198
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:14,982
Thank you.

Oh right, that…

You did that on purpose that day, didn't you?

203
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,048
What did I do on purpose?

204
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,149
I don't know what you're talking about.

205

just go like this.

00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:35,949
- It looks good.
- Goodbye.

00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,949
will it affect your work?

Don't worry.

My employees are all competent.

And furthermore,

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,248
they actually work more efficiently.

219
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,516
Can't deny that.

220
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:12,214
However, our company recently

221
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:13,548

Let's do a little test.

229
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,516
You write down three flavors.

The ones I've chosen

231
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:43,181
will all be flavors that you love to eat.

232
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,748
How is that possible?

233
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,883
You'll never find out if you don't try.

How do you know I like these flavors?

241
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,816
It's simple.

242
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:26,081
After several interactions,

243
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,248
I've found

244
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:29,214
you not only possess

245
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,115
the elegance of a mature woman,

246
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:33,181
but also the innocence
and cuteness of a young girl.

247
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,915
So, I chose

248
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,349
the slightly bitter matcha,

249
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,282
that a mature woman would like.

250
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:41,782
And the sweet and sour raspberry yogurt

251
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:45,081
that a young girl would probably like.

252
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,149
What about this blue ice cream?

253
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,816
It's purely to match your outfit today.

254
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,883
But honestly,

255
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,615

258
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,449
Guessing two out of three correctly

259
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,816
is already quite good.

00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:07,982
You can think of it

261
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:11,149
as my careful observation of you.

262
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,115

263
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,748

Has anyone told you
that you speak very profoundly.

265
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,849
Everything you say off the cuff
is a golden life quote.

266
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:30,748

And sometimes, I also feel like saying,

I actually sometimes think about

whether I should lose some weight.

298
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:52,683

everyone likes those who are really handsome.

300
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:57,014

maybe I'll become handsome too.

to the cloud and put through the process.

369
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,749
Okay, then…

370
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:43,582
The cloud has to be accessed from…

371
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,648
I mean what are you young people doing?

372
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,249
- Handling things is really unreliable.
- Yazi.

373
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:48,449
Yazi.

374
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,249
The higher-ups have instructed,
with the population decrease,

375
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,749
you can't scold young people.

376
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:55,082
Forget it, I'll do it myself.

377
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:57,182
What did we hire you young people for?

378
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,648
Are you thinking I'm not busy enough?

379
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,182
I'm sorry,
I'll definitely learn better next time.

380
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:02,416
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:07,249
Write quickly.

382
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,648
Chen is not here.

383
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:23,916
Business department.

384
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,516
Landscape Development.

385
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:29,949
- Yazi.
- Chen.

386
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,516
Do you need me for something?

387
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:33,416
There's a document
that needs the boss's signature.

388
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,082
Could you please pass it on, Chen?

389
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:36,782
- No problem.
- Okay.

390
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,481
Has the boss already signed this document?

391
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,749
Can I take it back to our manager?

392
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,648
Miss Gao mentioned it needs
to be submitted to the Vice President.

393
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:45,349
Zhou will come to take it.

394
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,648
Okay.

395
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,048
But you know.

396
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,715
Mr. Xi from Landscape Development

397
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,882
doesn't have a good reputation.

398
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,715
When you girls go out for social engagements,

399
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:54,416
be extra careful.

400
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,315
Okay, thanks, Chen.

401
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:57,815
That's it then.

402
00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:58,916
I'll be going then.

403
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,115
- Okay.
- Alright.

404
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,548
Landscape Development case.

405
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:06,749
When did Yun take on this?

406
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:10,749
Why didn't she tell us, strange?

407
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,615
Mom.

408
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:20,449
She is the one I mentioned to you before.

409
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:21,648
Cunfeng.

410
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,449
Wang Cunfeng.

411
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,648
Auntie, hello.

412
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:25,782
Nice to meet you for the first time.

413
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:26,815
Pleased to meet you.

414
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:29,315
Thank you.

415
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:32,548
Come sit here.

416
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:44,148
You were born in the year of the Dragon, right?

417
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,115
In that case,

418
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:51,315
you would be considered an older mother.

419
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:54,516
I'm thinking

420
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,048
you shouldn't work for others anymore.

421
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,882
Just quit your job.

422
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:00,082
This way you can take care of your health,

423
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:04,683
and then you can have a healthy baby.

424
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:07,481
You want me to have a child?

425
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,648
Silly girl.

426
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:10,683
We will get married in the future.

427
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:13,548
Of course, there will be children.

428
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,615
How I wish to hold a grandchild.

429
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:19,548
And if there is a daughter
who looks very much like you,

430
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:20,815
she must be very cute.

431
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,015
If

432
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:24,315
you have a son like Shipei from our family,

433
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:25,882
then how handsome would that be.

434
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:28,214
Why not, twins, one of each.

435
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,648
What do you think? Very good.

436
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,015
Do you know how good Shipei is? Do you?

437
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,949
- Mom.
- Why be shy?

438
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,582
The whole village knows.

439
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:38,349
You haven't tried, right?
It's okay, get him drunk at night.

440
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:42,416
Try again to see how good he is.

441
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:48,815
Then you'll know how energetic he is.

442
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:49,949
Alright.

443
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:51,115
I don't want to.

444
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:53,148
Don't.

445
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:02,449
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

446
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,916
- Then what are you doing?
- What are you two doing?

447
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,214
So, what are we doing now?

448
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:07,648
No, what are you guys doing?

449
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:09,615
We two are not doing anything,
it's you who is doing something.

450
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:12,282
What are you doing?

451
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:14,916
Luckily, it was just a dream.

452
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,449
It scared me to death, I thought it was real.

453
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:20,349
Wait a minute, how come you two are in my home?

454
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,282
You tell her.

455
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:23,282
You don't read or reply to the messages

456
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,782
when you're on a date.

457
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:25,815
I was wondering what happened to you.

458
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:28,916
I asked him to ring the doorbell,
but no one answered.

459
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,481
Yes, so I had to come over.

460
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:32,683
Then we both came in very nervously.

461
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:35,182
Then we found you fast asleep there.

462
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,082
Come on, tell me.

463
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,648
Tired from what?

464
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:41,381
Did you do something unspeakable?

465
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,349
Stop making things up in your head, okay?

466
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,048
I just fell asleep thinking about things.

467
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,916
So, I couldn't hear or see anything.

468
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,015
What were you just doing over there?

469
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:51,282
Don't.

470
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:53,115
Having a nightmare?

471
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:54,282
Not necessarily a nightmare.

472
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,282
It could be an exciting dream.

473
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:58,683
Don't.

474
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:00,381
Don't.

475
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,282
You're very boring.

476
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:05,115
Otherwise, what are you saying 'don't' to?

477
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,048
I don't want to tell you.

478
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:09,582
Don't tell me?

479
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,282
Or do you want something else?

480
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:14,015
Okay, get ready for work.
You're going to be late!

481
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:15,815
Then let me make you breakfast.

482
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,882
The kind of fried eggs we had last time?

483
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,782
There's no time, just buy something on the way.

484
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:23,148
You

485
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:25,582
made breakfast for her?

486
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,683
No, I haven't.

487
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:33,815
I…

488
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:35,349
I mean, last time.

489
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,582
The kind of fried eggs at the breakfast place.

490
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:39,481
And you're very familiar with it.

491
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,048
The layout of the same building
is pretty much the same.

492
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,282
Right?

493
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,449
Right.

494
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,683
Makes sense.

495
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:53,115
Do you want it fried?

496
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,349
There are no eggs.

497
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:07,148
Was everything you said last night true?

498
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:08,882
Of course, it's true.

499
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,449
Whether you're a senior officer or a manager.

500
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:12,683
In my eyes,

501
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:16,381
you are always the lovable Gao Shuangyun.

502
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:25,148
Don't lie to me.

503
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,048
Otherwise…

504
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,282
If I lie to you,

505
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:32,782
then I will be punished.

506
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,481
What are you doing? I was just kidding.

507
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,214
Are you okay?

508
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,749
I'm sad.

509
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:40,782
I've made the woman I love

510
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:43,648
feel uneasy.

511
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,849
Cheesy.

512
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,981
Want to hear something even cheesier?

513
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:50,048
Sure, you say it.

514
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,715
Cindy.

515
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:05,349
Could you take care
of this approval document again?

516
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:06,416
Thanks to your brilliant mind

517
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:09,648
for coming up with
this cloud-based document transfer plan.

518
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,015
Cut it out.

519
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:12,548
What are you getting at now?

520
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:14,349
It's only since I became director

521
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:18,349
that I've discovered
this truly has many advantages!

522
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:21,214
So, you've come to throw your weight around.

523
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,582
Now, I can clearly see Yingjun
and everyone's progress on their work

524
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,449
from the cloud.

525
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:28,648
Your plan

526
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:31,148
is perfect.

527
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:34,516
To be praised by Director Xu

528
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,849
is an honor.

529
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,249
Don't mention it.

530
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:45,782
These two could compete for an Oscar.

531
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:50,349
Meng Heng.

532
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:51,882
You need to learn more from Cindy.

533
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:53,516
How to operate this plan?

534
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:54,683
Don't act on your emotions.

535
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:56,782
Don't waste your internship time, understand?

536
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,949
I understand, thank you Yazi.

537
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,182
Okay.

538
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:10,182
I heard it.

539
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:12,015
Were you just laughing at us?

540
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:14,981
How could that be?

541
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:16,582
Speaking of that turnaround plan,

542
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:18,115
haven't you already gotten the hang of it?

543
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,115
I have long since…

544
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:23,249
Why does she want you to learn from me?

545
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:25,249
Didn't you take a leave yesterday?

546
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,715
She asked me to go through the procedures.

547
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:28,182
And then I just

548
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:29,715
pretended I didn't know how.

549
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,615
Why pretend you don't know?

550
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:33,048
She always complained about this plan.

551
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:34,782
And kept bothering you.

552
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:36,683
I just thought I'd let her experience

553
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:40,349
the hardship of running the procedures.

554
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:42,582
Really not sure if you're being petty,

555
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:44,315
or just sticking up for your friends.

556
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:47,249
But I like it.

557
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,249
I got it, Cindy.

558
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,315
Really? What are you laughing at, so happy?

559
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:54,449
I was telling Meng Heng to study hard.

560
00:27:54,449 --> 00:27:58,749
- Right, study hard.
- Okay.

561
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:01,249
Oh right, I actually had
something important just now.

562
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:02,782
Forgot to tell you.

563
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,849
I was thinking,
since you came up with this plan,

564
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,916
then you should carry it out well.

565
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,282
This Landscape Development case.

566
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:11,182
Why didn't you register it for Miss Gao?

567
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,782
What Landscape Development?

568
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:14,815
The development process.

569
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:17,015
The approval documents
have already been sent to Mr. Cai.

570
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,449
There's nothing on the cloud.

571
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,015
Or is it that

572
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:26,548
you and Miss Gao have some unspeakable secret?

573
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:28,683
I think there are no unspeakable secrets.

574
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:29,916
Maybe Miss Gao's too busy.

575
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,882
She forgot, I'll remind her again.

576
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,115
I see.

577
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,082
Okay, I will speak to Guo Shijie in a moment.

578
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:37,582
Also, the procurement department
needs to go to the sales center.

579
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,315
Could you help me
upload this to the cloud again?

580
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:40,582
Alright, Director Xu.

581
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:43,481
- Take care.
- Alright, I'm off.

582
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:53,249
What does what you have
to do have to do with me?

583
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:56,683
Yes, that's right.

584
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:02,315
Landscape Development.

585
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:08,449
Do you think Cindy Wang will ask Yun?

586
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:09,715
Given her personality,

587
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:13,481
she will definitely dig out the truth.

588
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:17,214
This move of yours,
using others to do your dirty work.

589
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,249
In the future,

590
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:20,048
you wouldn't use it on me, would you?

591
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,916
Wait until you climb higher
in position than me,

592
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,916
then you can worry about this problem.

593
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,249
Director Xu.

594
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:29,481
So, what do you think about Yun?

595
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:32,315
Why didn't she make
the Landscape Development case public?

596
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:33,683
Let me ask you.

597
00:29:33,683 --> 00:29:34,815
If you go to a bar,

598
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:38,214
would you openly confess to your girlfriend?

599
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:41,282
Are you implying that Miss Gao
is up to something?

600
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,849
I'm not sure about the specifics.

601
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,315
But one thing is for certain.

602
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:49,849
There's definitely something fishy
about this matter.

603
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,782
No, I think Yun

604
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:54,381
is not the type to scheme and plot.

605
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:55,381
Right or not?

606
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:59,182
Cindy Wang will reveal it to us.

607
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:01,315
There have been many transactions this month.

608
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:02,381
Youth Peace of Mind Loan,

609
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:05,749
really helped a lot of young people buy houses.

610
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,015
Look at these numbers.

611
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,782
Director Xu, you've arrived.

612
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:11,648
- Manager.
- Please come in.

613
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,381
Duomi, I'm going to lunch first.

614
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,416
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

615
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:23,416
Chen Duomi.

616
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,582
Do you have a copy

617
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,182
of the Landscape Development case?

618
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:29,481
Or the financial planning issued by your side?

619
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:31,849
Yes, they kept asking us to work overtime
to rush it a few days ago.

620
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:34,481
Really pressing, kept pressing.

621
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:36,182
Let me take a look.

622
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,148
No, why do you suddenly want to see it?

623
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,582
Wouldn't it be better to ask Miss Gao?

624
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:43,115
If I could ask her,
then why would I come to you?

625
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,349
Do you think there is a problem with this case?

626
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,981
- No.
- Yes.

627
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,882
If there's no problem,
then why are you investigating this case?

628
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:56,115
There might be, or there might not be.

629
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:58,249
Gao Shuangyun must have
her reasons for not wanting to talk.

630
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,416
As her secretary,

631
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,849
I need to grasp

632
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:03,849
the various situations
and progress of the case.

633
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,315
Are you satisfied with this answer?

634
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:07,648
Alright, it was just a question.

635
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,015
That's weird.

636
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:14,315
Right.

637
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:17,449
Here.

638
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:21,916
You're all here.

639
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,048
Haven't you gone to eat?

640
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,582
Yes, we are watching her eat.

641
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,481
We sisters are chatting.

642
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:29,849
Girl chat.

643
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:31,182
Girls.

644
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,256
Yes.

645
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:36,782
Duomi, this is

646
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:38,782
a supplementary document for the Landscape
Development case, approved by the boss.

647
00:31:38,782 --> 00:31:40,015
But the vice president

648
00:31:40,015 --> 00:31:41,782
is hoping that the payment to Mr. Xi

649
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:42,815
can be made a bit sooner.

650
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:44,214
So…

651
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:45,349
Thanks, accountant Chen.

652
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:48,249
Alright, no problem.

653
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:52,849
I won't disturb you girls gathering any longer.
I'm off to eat.

654
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:53,882
- Bye.
- Zhou, bye.

655
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:56,148
Bye.

656
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:03,976
[Account Book]

657
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,548
You don't want to publicize
the Landscape Development case.

658
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:18,315
Not delegating the work.

659
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:22,548
Do you want to hog all the glory for yourself?

660
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:24,214
Are you investigating me?

661
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:25,582
That's not surprising.

662
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:29,214
After all, you also drank with Mr. Xi.

663
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:30,715
Yes.

664
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,115
I just want to prove myself
through this project.

665
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,214
Is that not allowed?

666
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:35,315
No.

667
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:36,481
Wang Cunfeng.

668
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,349
Please don't forget
you're not Manager Wang now.

669
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:39,349
You are my secretary.

670
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:40,715
It's precisely because I'm your secretary

671
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:41,849
that I have the responsibility to remind you.

672
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:44,749
Please don't let others take advantage of you.

673
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:49,015
Look at these documents,

674
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:51,214
this is the procedure you requested
from the Works Department,

675
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:54,648
and the funds copy planned
by the Finance Department.

676
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:55,715
This one,

677
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,481
is the proposal signed by Mr. Cai.

678
00:32:57,481 --> 00:33:01,182
However, the Vice President
has added supplementary documents.

679
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:03,849
Initially, there are some items
that I don't understand.

680
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,582
You have already allocated the construction
plant's costs to Mr. Xi's company.

681
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,282
But on the supplementary documents
from Vice President Han,

682
00:33:08,282 --> 00:33:09,416
there was an additional brokerage fee

683
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:10,882
given to another company.

684
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:13,882
And the construction plant was designated.

685
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:17,815
So, you think…

686
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:19,182
I have no evidence.

687
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:20,949
But I have reasonable suspicion
of Vice President Han

688
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:24,282
- taking advantage of your case.
- You're overthinking it.

689
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:25,683
Vice President Han is not using me.

690
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:29,048
I know all this.

691
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,449
You know?

692
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:32,449
We're just trying to secure this piece of land.

693
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:34,615
That's why we decided
to pay Mr. Xi a little more.

694
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,148
It's just a procedural issue.

695
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:42,015
As your secretary and colleague,

696
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,182
I must remind you

697
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:46,048
that what you're doing is very dangerous.

698
00:33:47,182 --> 00:33:48,782
You're right.

699
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:51,548
Maybe we were too hasty.

700
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:54,048
I'll discuss it again with Han,

701
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:56,882
and see if it can be converted
into profit sharing

702
00:33:56,882 --> 00:34:00,115
without these misleading items.

703
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:01,516
Okay.

704
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:03,615
Then I'll go get busy.

705
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:06,049
Cindy.

706
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:09,815
Thank you for the reminder.

707
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,181
You've worked hard.

708
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,481
Kid, slacking off at work?

709
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:53,716
I'm not slacking off.

710
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,082
I'm just catching my breath.

711
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,481
I've been busy, only now
do I have time to drink water.

712
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:58,515
And,

713
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,916
I'm not a child.

714
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:05,848
How is it?
Did Cindy Wang give you a lot of work?

715
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:07,981
I'm not afraid of having a lot of work.

716
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,848
I'm afraid of the work being monotonous.

717
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:12,449
Otherwise, it's very boring.

718
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,716
No wonder you took Cindy as your mentor.

719
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:16,215
You know when she first joined the company.

720
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:19,382
She said the exact same thing to you.

721
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:24,148
Indeed, a great teacher
produces outstanding students.

722
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,515
Zhou.

723
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:34,549
Can I ask you a question?

724
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,215
Sure, what's up?

725
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:40,648
If the person you like

726
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:42,181
is a bad person,

727
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,082
then what would you do?

728
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:47,315
The one I like is a bad person.

729
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:49,148
You, do you know?

730
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,215
When you sincerely

731
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,749
fall for someone,

732
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,916
you won't see all of her flaws.

733
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:57,184
Instead, you'll love everything about her.

734
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:59,115
So, the person I like

735
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,848
can't possibly be a bad person.

736
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,615
No wonder people say

737
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,883
love is blind.

738
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:11,416
There's no such thing as good or bad.

739
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,181
The day you find yourself starting to despise

740
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,615
the flaws of the person you like,

741
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:17,481
it might mean you don't love her anymore.

742
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:18,716
Anyway, you're still young.

743
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:20,549
The world is so big, go and see more of it.

744
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,848
You understand what I mean, right?

745
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,348
Ask me anytime if you have questions.

746
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,528
- Okay.
- Okay.

747
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:27,716
Don't rest for too long, okay?

748
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:30,181
Okay.

749
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:45,115
Come in.

750
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:56,348
There should be no secrets between us, right?

751
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,049
Of course.

752
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,883
I have absolutely no secrets from you.

753
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:00,916
To me,

754
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,883
you can maintain your freedom.

755
00:37:04,582 --> 00:37:06,382
So, on the project with
the Landscape Development.

756
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:07,648
Shouldn't you let me know

757
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:10,749
if you meddle?

758
00:37:16,883 --> 00:37:19,315
This is…?

759
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,481
The procedure and financial plan I provided.

760
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,782
Compared with your supplementary documents.

761
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,449
There are obvious discrepancies.

762
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,648
It seems good to have a capable subordinate,

763
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,049
who can help you find problems,

764
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,916
and see the facts clearly.

765
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,815
Are you willing to hear my explanation?

766
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:42,049
I'm here to listen to your explanation.

767
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,082
The brokerage fee is transferred
to another company

768
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:47,883
as specified by Mr. Xi.

769
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:49,716
The amount was also agreed upon by him.

770
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:50,916
This money,

771
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,549
just takes a detour before

772
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:55,815
eventually ending up in his pocket.

773
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:02,981
That's what I told Cindy too.

774
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,916
See.

775
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,949
It shows we share the same sentiment.

776
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:11,848
But this is not good.

777
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:12,916
And I don't understand.

778
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,515
If Mr. Xi wants to take money
from his own company,

779
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,382
then why go through us?

780
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:18,148
What else could it be?

781
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,315
Isn't it just that Mr. Xi
wants to hide some private funds

782
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:21,582
to set up a private stash?

783
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:24,515
He doesn't want his wife to find out.

784
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,682
Originally, Mr. Xi wanted me
to keep it a secret for him.

785
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:35,815
Unexpectedly, Cindy found out.

786
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:42,249
If Cindy found out,
then it means the boss will know too.

787
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,949
You can't do this anymore.

788
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:46,014
Moreover, there are clearly
many ways to solve this.

789
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:49,249
Why make use of a third-party intermediary?

790
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:54,249
Yun.

791
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,515
Are you doubting me now?

792
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,348
We have been together for such a long time.

793
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,282
- How could I possibly deceive you?
- It's not that I think you are deceiving me.

794
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:03,515
Is it so hard to tell me about this earlier?

795
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:06,049
'We've been together for such a long time.'

796
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:09,249
The vice president said the gift
was for the client.

797
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:12,215
The client didn't show up.

798
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,449
Zhou.

799
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,981
In the end, it was Yun who showed up.

800
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:23,049
Could it be that Yun
is the vice president's girlfriend?

801
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:25,749
You don't tell me.

802
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:26,949
I didn't collude with you well.

803
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,648
Isn't it easier for others to find out?

804
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,082
Anyway, this matter now

805
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:32,749
isn't as complicated as imagined.

806
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:40,215
Cindy, who is Wang Cunfeng?

807
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:41,916
Why are you shouting so loudly?

808
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:42,981
No, I mean…

809
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,215
Is she your friend?

810
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,682
Otherwise, why would Fang Iris
ask me to give it to you?

811
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:47,481
You're the only one with
the surname Wang in the entire office.

812
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:50,682
How could you not know who Wang Cunfeng is?

813
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,481
So, your name is Wang Cunfeng.

814
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:56,549
Shut up!

815
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:57,582
No way, I think it's very cute.

816
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:58,648
Give it to me.

817
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,082
Your dad's name is

818
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:02,615
Wang Quanfu.

819
00:40:02,615 --> 00:40:05,049
Good fortune.

820
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:08,082
This package is wrapped so beautifully.

821
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:10,449
I don't know who sent it.

822
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,416
Hey, Shiping.

823
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,916
Did you receive the package?

824
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:21,782
I mentioned to you last time

825
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:24,782
that I wanted to introduce you
to someone very important.

826
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:26,249
So, this gift,

827
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:28,916
couldn't be the jewelry to wear

828
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,883
for meeting that person?

829
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:33,416
Do you really distrust my taste that much?

830
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:36,615
No, I absolutely trust your taste.

831
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:38,981
But this gift being sent,

832
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,416
is for you to give to that special someone.

833
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,282
You want me to give it to her?

834
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:46,049
But if you want to show some sincerity,

835
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:47,249
then shouldn't I

836
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:49,449
pick out the gift myself?

837
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,682
You trust me.

838
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,782
I'm the one who knows her likes the best.

839
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:54,815
Bring the gift when we meet tomorrow.

840
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:56,515
She's going to love it.

841
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:57,981
Presenting Buddha with borrowed flowers.

842
00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:59,449
I don't think this is a very good idea.

843
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:01,014
Cindy.

844
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:02,481
I sincerely hope

845
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:03,716
you can leave

846
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:05,883
the most perfect impression in her heart.

847
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:09,315
Listen to me, alright?

848
00:41:09,315 --> 00:41:10,582
Alright.

849
00:41:10,582 --> 00:41:13,382
See you tomorrow then.

850
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:19,416
Having to specify a gift for the first meeting.

851
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:22,416
This person must be difficult to deal with.

852
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:25,449
I think so too.

853
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,282
So, do you want to

854
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:30,115
hesitate a bit?

855
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:34,215
I'm a bit hesitant.

856
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,215
But knowing that this person is tough

857
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:38,249
actually piques my curiosity.

858
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:41,181
I'd like to meet this person.

859
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:48,582
What are you up to?

860
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:51,848
- Getting off work.
- Off work?

861
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:52,981
Or else?

862
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:54,782
You're not angry anymore, are you?

863
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:57,949
How dare I be angry with you?

864
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,549
That means you're angry.

865
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:01,883
Strange.

866
00:42:16,348 --> 00:42:18,848
Zhou.

867
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,082
Wait for me a second.

868
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:22,648
Zhou.

869
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:23,981
Wait…

870
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:26,181
Zhou.

871
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:30,181
Didn't you hear me?

872
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:55,315
Come on, be careful getting off.

873
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:58,416
Thank you.

874
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:25,682
Zhang Shiping.

875
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:34,215
Turns out he's a scumbag.

876
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:38,549
There's even a token of commitment.

877
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:59,014
Will she believe me if I tell her this?

878
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,883
How should I tell her so she will believe?

879
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:05,848
Why did I forget to take a picture?

880
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:21,449
[Lies sweet as sugar truth
painful as a bone-stabbing, heart-tearing]

881
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:23,848
Why did you like Miss Gao in the first place?

882
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:24,916
You have someone you like?

883
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,282
And just like you,

884
00:44:26,282 --> 00:44:28,049
I'm too slow to act and got heartbroken.

885
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:29,049
I don't hope

886
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:31,181
to make you feel like
have deceived you in any way.

887
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:33,348
So, I'm the only one he loves the most.

888
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:35,082
Do you guys remember that Cindy Wang?

889
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:37,549
It's shameless.

890
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:40,249
What are you doing?

891
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:42,315
[Take care]
Fang Iris and Mr. Cai.

892
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:43,981
Why would you meet with me alone today.

893
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,082
If there's nothing for him,

894
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,549
then do you think Han Xinzheng would do it?

895
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,848
Could Zhou be an accomplice?

896
00:44:48,848 --> 00:44:51,215
I went to see Mr. Xi.
