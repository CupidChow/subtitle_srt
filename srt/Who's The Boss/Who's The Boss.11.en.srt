[Episode 11]

21
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,062
Fang Iris, this little rascal

22
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:13,962
is basically a personal vendetta
under the guise of official duty.

23
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,195
So incredibly childish.

24
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,696
Who would have thought,
someone from the royal relatives

25
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:35,828
work so proactive

26
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,863
just because of a single word from you.

27
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,762
It's like a complete transformation.

28
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:42,462
Buttering up seems to be more important

29
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,529
than getting things done.

30
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,195
Do as much work as the money you get.

31
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,195
Trying to steal a chicken
only to end up losing the rice.

32
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,762
You've heard of it, right?

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,096
What do you mean?

34
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,762
I mean nothing else by it.

35
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:58,262
I just think

36
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:01,161
that the most important thing
between friends should be sincerity, right?

37
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:02,863
People who are insincere

38
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:04,496
will eventually get kicked to the curb.

39
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,461
And then…

40
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,162
If you can't learn to be a decent person,

41
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,028
then at least learn how to get things done.

42
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,761
So, are you saying I'm not sincere enough?

43
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,429
Or not doing my job properly?

44
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,561
No, I wasn't talking about you.

45
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,996
Maybe it's better to take the stairs.

46
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,362
Bye.

47
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,696
Who do you think you are?

48
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:32,929
An intern is being so disrespectful.

49
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,461
That Fang Iris must have taken
the wrong medicine.

50
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:47,232
Usually doesn't care, but now acting
like a human gatekeeper over there.

51
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,828
Really causing a ruckus.

52
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:51,429
- If she keeps this up, we won't need to work.
- I know.

53
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:52,796
Yazi.

54
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:54,395
The sustainable housing in Taoyuan

55
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:55,895
is just about to start construction.

56
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:57,162
But the main direction of the sales strategy

57
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,162
is already online.

58
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,295
Look.

59
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:07,295
The person in charge is Cindy.

60
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:13,261
I heard Director Zhang from Bosheng
really likes her.

61
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,362
Having a powerful backer
really makes a difference.

62
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,996
Becoming a secretary
and still getting cases to handle.

63
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,328
But that's fine.

64
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,496
Once a secretary,

65
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:23,095
always a secretary.

66
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,095
But I feel that Cindy

67
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:28,063
won't stay just as a secretary

68
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:29,629
for long.

69
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,194
Otherwise, what does she want?

70
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:32,761
Unless she changes jobs,

71
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:33,828
then otherwise, our business department now

72
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,595
has no place for her.

73
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,962
I've already been promoted to manager.

74
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:39,895
Guo, am I right or not?

75
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,996
Yes, Director Xu is much more communicative
than Miss Wang now.

76
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,429
Secretary.

77
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,696
Yes, Secretary Wang.

78
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,595
I want some coffee, does anyone else want some?

79
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:55,129
- Coffee.
- No, thank you.

80
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,362
Thank you.

81
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,395
- Hurry up.
- It's really true.

82
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:58,595
- Thanks.
- Hurry up.

83
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,796
- Yazi, I…
- What's the matter?

84
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,295
It's just that…

85
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:04,595
Now that you have a lot of power,

86
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,461
could you please promote me more?

87
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,496
Don't worry.

88
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:13,895
Follow me, and I guarantee you'll get
your hands on all sorts of designer bags.

89
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:15,229
Love you.

90
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:29,863
There's no position for Cindy Wang.

91
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,496
Doesn't that mean there's no place for me?

92
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,761
Others have become directors.

93
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,062
And I'm still there being what?

94
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,895
A perennial junior staffer.

95
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,629
Buttering up everyone.

96
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,761
Would you like some coffee?

97
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:47,895
You drink coffee.

98
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:52,096
Let me tell you, the coffee beans
bought by the welfare committee this time

99
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,928
taste not bad.

100
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,028
You can have a few more cups.

101
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,261
I didn't know that.

102
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:59,329
I just drink it for the caffeine.

103
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:00,928
Oh, right.

104
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,129
How did you prove

105
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,829
that you are Secretary Li
of the planning department?

106
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,562
A kind colleague brought me up.

107
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,829
What else could I do?

108
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:10,462
Today really isn't a good start.

109
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,329
If it weren't for Fang Iris
being some kind of royal relative.

110
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,562
Otherwise, I would have
cut her in half a long time ago.

111
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,795
Forget it, let's not talk about it anymore,
it's just infuriating.

112
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,261
Has your business department

113
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:26,329
had someone look at the Feng Shui?

114
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,562
Why does everyone pass
each difficult stage one after another?

115
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,161
And even Fang Iris

116
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:34,028
has taken a liking to your interns, you know.

117
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,329
Even if there really is good fortune,

118
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,695
it's only them that could be so lucky.

119
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:39,428
Me? I'm simply forgotten.

120
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,129
Why are you so unlucky?

121
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,996
You speak as if you're so aggrieved.

122
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:44,928
What's wrong? Tell me about it.

123
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:47,895
It's a long story.

124
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,362
It would take three days and nights to tell.

125
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,562
Oh, really?

126
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,161
You've prepared so many things.

127
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:59,695
Why? Is the planning department having a party?

128
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,195
Our planning department head is resigning.

129
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,028
We're throwing him a farewell party.

130
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:08,629
You're preparing everything by yourself?

131
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,661
No one is helping you?

132
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,729
Of course. This kind of thing,
just leave it to us junior secretaries.

133
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,428
Who would come to help us?

134
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,362
I can help you.

135
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,795
No need.

136
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:22,362
I can do it myself.

137
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,462
You go on with your work.

138
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,428
Alright then.

139
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,161
Good luck.

140
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,428
Okay.

141
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:40,462
I have a feeling that Guo Shijie
will be a breakthrough point.

142
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:44,695
Manager Wu should really like
this discovery of mine.

143
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:49,928
Yes.

144
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,695
Right, sorry.

145
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,329
We didn't handle this part well.

146
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,129
Sorry, it's our problem.

147
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,428
I'm sorry, really sorry.

148
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:04,928
What's with Lin Yingjun always taking leave?

149
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,428
Do you think I don't have enough to do?

150
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,428
Want me to deal with these matters?

151
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,863
What's the matter?

152
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,996
The site he's in charge of has been
complained about for construction noise.

153
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,161
But isn't this

154
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:18,062
the responsibility of the operations
and planning departments to handle?

155
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,661
Yes, but people from our department

156
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,096
have to take those from the operations
and planning departments to deal with it.

157
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,963
You contact the media reporters later on,

158
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,428
and ask them not to blow the news up.

159
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,963
And, by the way, ask the planning department
to buy some PR gifts

160
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:29,996
to placate the nearby residents.

161
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,496
- Me?
- Yes, you.

162
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:33,863
But I'm still busy
with the proposal you asked for.

163
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:35,428
Otherwise, Chen Han, you take charge.

164
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,629
Hurry up.

165
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,462
- If there's an issue, remember to call me.
- But I still have…

166
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:40,863
The capable bear more work,
thank you for your efforts.

167
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,195
I'm off to the accounting department.

168
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,428
Come on, hurry up.

169
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,428
Finished work!

170
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,496
Yes.

171
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,895
How about you?

172
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,829
I think you must be working overtime.

173
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,596
Working overtime.

174
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:23,028
So tired.

175
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,161
Get up and stretch a bit.

176
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,761
Have you eaten?

177
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,928
What did you have for dinner?

178
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,795
Just something simple like salad.

179
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,194
I already asked my assistant to buy it for me.

180
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:37,162
Director, your takeaway has arrived.

181
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:38,295
Come in.

182
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:44,728
Surprise.

183
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,295
I see you usually eat very healthy.

184
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,696
So, I ordered a healthy meal box for you.

185
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,194
But since you're working late,

186
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:55,428
I thought carbohydrates

187
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:56,696
are still very important.

188
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,095
So, I ordered a multi-grain rice.

189
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:01,063
But isn't the portion too much?

190
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:03,261
There are only two of us, can we finish it?

191
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:04,595
Moreover…

192
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:05,863
A kid's meal?

193
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,829
I thought Yi would come.

194
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:10,795
So, I bought portions
for both Yi and the nanny.

195
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,129
Thank you.

196
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,063
But Yi has a piano lesson today.

197
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:17,029
She can't accompany me to work overtime.

198
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,962
I was thinking,

199
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:21,394
I could win over Yi's heart with a small toy.

200
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,595
Why did you want to see me today?

201
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,029
Didn't you just give me a case?

202
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,029
Of course, I came to discuss it with you.

203
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,063
Alright.

204
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:37,496
Actually,

205
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:38,962
in the name of discussion,

206
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:41,662
but truly to be close to you.

207
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,662
I really thought you just came
to discuss the case.

208
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:49,428
After all, we're still in the stage
of getting to know each other.

209
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,162
It can't always be you
throwing the ball, right?

210
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:53,162
I need to make
surprise inspections occasionally

211
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,896
to see if it's like what Yi says,

212
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:56,662
that there are many aunties and sisters

213
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,361
who want to get close to her daddy,
the prince charming.

214
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:01,996
If you don't believe it,

215
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,761
then you're welcome to come
for a surprise check at any time.

216
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:06,761
You said it.

217
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,063
Your assistant is very pretty.

218
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,462
A kid.

219
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,595
So, you like girls with long hair?

220
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:25,361
Of course, the ones with short hair.

221
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,629
We're here.

222
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,529
We've arrived so quickly.

223
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,662
Your driving skills are really good.

224
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,761
I was so comfortable that I almost fell asleep.

225
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:50,996
Thank you.

226
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:53,029
No problem, it's just

227
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,228
this place is quite remote.

228
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:55,829
What are you doing here?

229
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,529
To see the night view.

230
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,194
Watching the night view

231
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,529
alone?

232
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,662
No, I'm with my friend.

233
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,194
Where's your friend?

234
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,129
He'll be here soon.

235
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,529
Okay.

236
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,063
Alright, then be safe on your own.

237
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,162
- Bye.
- Bye.

238
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,795
I think

239
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,629
I should stay with you

240
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:56,662
until your friend arrives.

241
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,496
Otherwise, it's too dangerous
for you to be alone like this.

242
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,795
Really?

243
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:00,795
Thank you so much.

244
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,595
You're really thoughtful.

245
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:04,162
It's nothing.

246
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,329
But you're here to see the night view.

247
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:06,428
Why run all the way here?

248
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,462
Aren't there closer ones?

249
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,496
You can see clearly
only where there's no light pollution.

250
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,261
Come on, I'll take you there.

251
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:14,428
But, but my car…

252
00:12:14,428 --> 00:12:16,295
- It's fine.
- Really?

253
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,194
Look.

254
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,394
It's beautiful, isn't it?

255
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,662
Not bad at all.

256
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,629
Look, do you see those three very bright stars?

257
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:29,996
- Where?
- Over there.

258
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:32,162
Those three.

259
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,261
Yes.

260
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:34,662
These three

261
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:37,761
are respectively Cygnus, Lyra,

262
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:40,095
and the one on the far right is Aquila.

263
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:41,595
Really?

264
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,996
How can you tell?

265
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:44,996
Really, look.

266
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,295
The brightest one in the middle, that's Lyra.

267
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,295
That star is Vega.

268
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:52,928
On the left, it is the third brightest star
in the Northern Hemisphere.

269
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,228
Do you really understand these things?

270
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:58,896
Look, that one on the left.

271
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,129
Do you see it? That one on the left.

272
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:05,280
♫ No matter who disapproves ♫

273
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:22,462
Fang Iris's friend is really disloyal.

274
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:24,095
I was there with her
waiting all night yesterday.

275
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,194
And in the end, the person didn't show up.

276
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:27,029
I ended up feeding the mosquitoes there.

277
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,361
Meng Heng.

278
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,629
You've been tricked.

279
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,795
Her friend is you.

280
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,561
Me?

281
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,261
Yes, you.

282
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,629
Her friend didn't come all night.

283
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,595
Did they send any messages?

284
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,561
No.

285
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,295
No, nothing.

286
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:51,295
So,

287
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:52,629
her friend

288
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:53,662
is you.

289
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:54,662
Right.

290
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,261
How could that be?

291
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,561
This is totally oblivious.

292
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:00,896
Our sister Fang,

293
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:03,095
has her ways, not bad.

294
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,896
Then, what did you talk about all night?

295
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:06,361
We didn't talk about anything.

296
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:10,728
No talking in the wilderness,
just a lone man and a solitary woman.

297
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:12,962
You didn't do something, did you?

298
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,462
Duomi, don't talk nonsense.

299
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,295
Fang Iris and I are really friends.

300
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:20,662
Friends.

301
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:22,496
Purely friends.

302
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,329
She's just joking.

303
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,629
Even if you two really aren't pure,

304
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,529
it's okay.

305
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,595
Your sister just wants you to be happy.

306
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,962
How many bites did you actually get?

307
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:42,728
Cunfeng, could you scratch here for me?

308
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,962
Can't you scratch it yourself?

309
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:45,761
I can't reach it.

310
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,361
- Your back?
- Yes.

311
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,928
How did you get bitten there?

312
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:51,962
Here.

313
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,029
Over here.

314
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,529
- A bit to the left.
- To the left.

315
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,795
Too much, in the middle.

316
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:56,795
The middle.

317
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,863
A little to the right.

318
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,261
- To the right.
- Left or right?

319
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:00,863
Yes, above.

320
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,029
Right, a little bit more to the right

321
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,394
Where is it?

322
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:05,629
- Up here, here.
- Here.

323
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:06,896
No, to the right.

324
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:07,896
Correct.

325
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:09,063
- To the right.
- Here.

326
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:10,795
This.

327
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,329
Scratch it.

328
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,095
You scratch it yourself.

329
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:38,394
Do you guys want to eat eggs?

330
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,496
Come on, I'll help you scratch.

331
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:46,361
Come on, let me tell you.

332
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,496
- Once moistened with saliva, it won't itch.
- Wait a minute.

333
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,561
Don't…

334
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,829
- Why?
- No need.

335
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:51,996
- No need, I'll scratch it myself.
- Isn't it very itchy?

336
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,295
No need.

337
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:58,261
Should I go to the hospital for a heart check?

338
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,228
[Business Department]

339
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,428
- The frequency will get higher and higher.
- No.

340
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,228
Don't keep looking at these baseless things.

341
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,561
Come on, you tell me.

342
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:16,329
When you were scratching
Meng Heng's itch today,

343
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,394
what were you thinking in your mind?

344
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,194
No lying.

345
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,329
I can read your brainwaves.

346
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:30,728
If you can read my brainwaves,

347
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,529
then do you still need to ask me?

348
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,696
True.

349
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,228
But as your good friend for many years,

350
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:39,863
I can tell something's off with you today.

351
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:42,029
Suddenly fussing over some eggs.

352
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:43,561
It's strange.

353
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,595
Yeah, when I ran into Meng Heng today.

354
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:47,496
I suddenly felt my heartbeat get really fast.

355
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,063
So, you think I should see a cardiologist?

356
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,962
Or a cardiac surgeon?

357
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,194
Is it possible that you simply
have a crush on him?

358
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,496
How could that be?

359
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:57,896
How could it not be?

360
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,661
Meng Heng is pretty good.

361
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,629
That's what you think.

362
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,195
I should like someone like

363
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:04,795
Zhang Shiping.

364
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:07,096
A mature elite.

365
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,394
Rich, handsome, and easy to communicate with.

366
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,696
The point is he already has a daughter.

367
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,795
So, he won't pressure me to have children.

368
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,129
Cindy, darling.

369
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:20,596
From my years of experience
in the battlefield of love…

370
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,161
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,661
From my years of experience
in the battlefield of love,

372
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,495
when it comes down to dating,

373
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:30,728
it's not about the conditions.

374
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,295
It's about pheromones.

375
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,429
Follow your heart.

376
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,696
Okay.

377
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,696
Think it over well.

378
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,328
I suppose I still like

379
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,661
someone like Zhang Shiping.

380
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,394
We're both elite members.

381
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,995
Successful elite members.

382
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:59,429
Truly a prime location.

383
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,696
Only six minutes to get on the highway.

384
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,661
And sales are close to eighty percent.

385
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,596
It's really quite good.

386
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:06,762
Of course.

387
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:10,661
But why is it you,
the director, who came today?

388
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,462
Where are Yingjun and Xiaoting?

389
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:13,728
I don't know what happened today.

390
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,795
They all asked for leave at the last minute.

391
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,895
Forcing me to take matters into my own hands.

392
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:22,495
There are quite a few people
coming to view the house today.

393
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:23,863
Director, I'll get busy then.

394
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,129
You go ahead.

395
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:34,195
Please, next time you need to ask for leave,

396
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,495
do it one day in advance.

397
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:37,295
That way, I can arrange things better.

398
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:39,661
Please, give a little thought for me, will you?

399
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:53,504
[The business group without Cindy]

400
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:11,008
[Reason for Leave]

401
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:13,629
Why did everyone take leave today?

402
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,762
Chen Han had a stomach ache this morning.

403
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:19,895
Guo Shijie just said

404
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,895
that the water pipe at his home broke.

405
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:25,495
What a coincidence.

406
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,462
Xu Yazi.

407
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,762
So many people took leave,
and you approved all their requests?

408
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:44,262
Yeah, they all said they had things to do.

409
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:46,929
No, you can't just approve
leave requests like that.

410
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,895
What if a supplier or customer
has a sudden issue?

411
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,228
Who's going to handle it?

412
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:51,962
Isn't it that everyone really had something.

413
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,462
I can't force them to come to work.

414
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,161
Can't you control your subordinates?

415
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:01,561
Who says?

416
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:02,895
I get along super well with everyone, okay?

417
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:04,228
And it's just a leave after all.

418
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:06,129
Why do you have to overthink it?

419
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,929
Or do you want to see me
unable to control everyone?

420
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,394
And then wait to make a joke of me?

421
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,161
I didn't mean that.

422
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,328
As long as you can handle it, it's okay.

423
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,394
Director.

424
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,895
- Come here, Guo.
- Thanks, Yingjun.

425
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,696
Drink a little more.
I made a small profit from stocks recently.

426
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:36,962
- Made a profit?
- Yes, I did.

427
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,895
But don't you have
to turn it over to your wife?

428
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,561
No, let me tell you.

429
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,795
Since last time,

430
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,495
after that terrible incident happened.

431
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:48,129
Cindy called my wife at home.

432
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:49,728
We had a gathering before,

433
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,029
and wanted to slip away.

434
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:52,029
So, I lied to Cindy saying

435
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:54,661
my wife demands that I be home
before eight o'clock.

436
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,462
I'm even more afraid to let my wife know

437
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,429
that I've also been investing
in the stock market.

438
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:00,362
That's my personal stash of money.

439
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:02,429
- A man still needs some money, you know.
- Personal stash.

440
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,795
- You get it.
- I've learned.

441
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,362
- Personal stash.
- Personal stash.

442
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:06,895
- Here's to you, bro.
- Come on.

443
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,629
Let's take a photo.

444
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:10,696
- Come on.
- Take a photo.

445
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:12,394
- Come on, come on.
- I want to be in the picture, too.

446
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:13,561
- Okay, ready?
- Okay.

447
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,295
One, two, three.

448
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:17,596
Okay.

449
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:20,561
Xiaoting.

450
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,629
Be careful not to upload the photo.

451
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,629
If it's discovered,

452
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:24,629
then we're doomed.

453
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,029
I know.

454
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:27,828
By the way, Yingjun.

455
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,429
Is this really okay with us?

456
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:30,962
Should we go back to work?

457
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:34,529
Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.

458
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,462
Since we've all taken our annual leave,

459
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,696
then why do we still make plans
with colleagues to go singing?

460
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,062
No, you rookies.

461
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:41,561
Let me tell you.

462
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,995
The beauty of it is,

463
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:44,561
while they're working at the office,

464
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:46,328
we're here singing and having fun.

465
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:49,029
Don't you think it feels great
just thinking about it?

466
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:50,394
- Awesome!
- Cool.

467
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,161
- Awesome!
- It's justified.

468
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,394
That's true.

469
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:56,362
Usually we cover for Xu Yazi,

470
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:57,995
today she's covering for us.

471
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,596
Right, come on, let's toast to Xu Yazi.

472
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,661
To Xu Yazi, cheers!

473
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:03,828
To Xu Yazi.

474
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:11,062
So, this is that group without me.

475
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,328
You guys are having a pretty lively chat.

476
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:15,828
Not really, it's them, okay?

477
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,262
Yeah, this is exactly
what I wanted to tell you.

478
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,929
It's quite obvious everyone
is annoyed with Yazi.

479
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:25,762
That's why they all read and didn't reply.

480
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:30,561
Do you think I should
tell Gao Shuangyun about this?

481
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:33,596
I should say it, right?

482
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:36,394
Everyone takes a leave together.

483
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:38,462
That's really exaggerated.

484
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:41,728
How is this different from a strike?

485
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:44,129
But if I tell Gao Shuangyun,

486
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,596
then won't it be questioning
Xu Yazi's work ability?

487
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,828
She already dislikes me enough.

488
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,362
If it's like this,
won't she dislike me even more?

489
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,161
I have an idea.

490
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:57,561
Maybe you can help sister Yazi,

491
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:59,262
and resolve this quasi-strike situation.

492
00:22:59,262 --> 00:23:00,696
What?

493
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:03,161
Anyway, it's just…

494
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,161
What are you doing?

495
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:20,429
Keep social distance, you know.

496
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,161
You could just say it like that.

497
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:24,629
What if she hears me talking like this?

498
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:25,629
No way, it's so far.

499
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:26,762
No, come here.

500
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:28,362
Come here.

501
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:37,629
Let's take half a day off together.

502
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,328
Nobody should get suspicious, right?

503
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:42,762
Everyone knows
we entertained guests last night.

504
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:43,895
It was all for work.

505
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:45,328
No one will doubt it.

506
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:50,529
Before entering the company,

507
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,295
do you want me to take you home first?

508
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:54,863
This bag here…

509
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,495
Didn't you say your bracelet was broken?

510
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:01,328
So, I just bought a new one.

511
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:05,161
You should just get the bracelet repaired.

512
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,029
Why buy a new one?

513
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,062
Repairing takes time.

514
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,661
I didn't want you to wait.

515
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,495
But you can't waste money like this.

516
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,096
How can it be a waste of money?

517
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,462
For the woman I love

518
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:18,795
is not a waste.

519
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:23,362
Aren't you afraid that this will spoil me?

520
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:26,129
But I like it when you're spoiled.

521
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:27,929
As you said.

522
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:33,888
[Gao Shuangyun]

523
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,394
This proposal is quite good.

524
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:41,228
But are you sure you want to do this?

525
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:44,161
I think this will motivate everyone's morale.

526
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,462
I'll go and suggest it to the boss.

527
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:50,696
But I don't know if it will be approved.

528
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:51,762
I know.

529
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:52,929
Thank you.

530
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:53,995
You're welcome.

531
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:00,495
Zhou, did anyone look for me this morning?

532
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:02,728
Vice President Chen of Qili called.

533
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:03,828
Please return the call.

534
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:04,929
Sure, no problem.

535
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:05,995
Oh, right.

536
00:25:05,995 --> 00:25:07,228
I just ran into Manager Gao.

537
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:08,429
She specifically instructed me

538
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:09,762
to give this to you.

539
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:12,462
Fearing you're too busy to have lunch.

540
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:16,429
Then could you

541
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,696
thank Manager Gao for me?

542
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:19,728
No problem.

543
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,096
Make me a cup of coffee, please.

544
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:22,328
No problem.

545
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,394
Rather than this,

546
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,929
it might be better
not to know that they are dating.

547
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:51,795
Come.

548
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:53,828
Don't worry, there won't be any problem.

549
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:56,762
I'm worried the boss won't approve it.

550
00:25:58,328 --> 00:26:01,295
The boss won his game this morning.

551
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,394
So, he's in a particularly good mood.

552
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,529
That's why I asked you to hurry over
and present the proposal.

553
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:08,394
Worthy of being you.

554
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:10,295
You have the boss completely figured out.

555
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:12,195
You've got a firm hold on the boss.

556
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,863
You're practically the underground boss.

557
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,295
Please don't say that.

558
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:18,129
Although we secretaries
know all the boss's movements.

559
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:21,096
At most, we're just a shadow.

560
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,394
A shadow must not loom too large.

561
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:23,863
Otherwise,

562
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:25,495
it'll be erased.

563
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:30,696
The most important thing
is that the matter proceeds smoothly.

564
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:33,129
I understand.

565
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:39,696
Let's go.

566
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:41,429
Chen, I'll go down first.

567
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,629
Chen, I'll take my leave too.

568
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:49,096
How is it?

569
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:55,495
In addition to the existing reward system,

570
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:57,228
any project completed
ahead of schedule in the future

571
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,962
will receive a bonus.

572
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:00,295
Especially the specialists.

573
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:02,661
Bonus Addition Calculation.

574
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:04,096
Yes!

575
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:05,161
Thank you, Miss Gao.

576
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:08,362
No need to thank me.
If anything, thank your CEO.

577
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,962
And also, thank you, Director Xu.

578
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:14,328
She fought for everyone's benefit.

579
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,394
Unexpectedly, Yazi.

580
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,129
You care so much for us.

581
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:20,762
- Thank you, Yazi.
- Thank you, Yazi.

582
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:21,795
It's nothing.

583
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:24,161
So, everyone should just work hard from now on.

584
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:26,561
- Understood.
- No problem.

585
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,795
Yingjun.

586
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:29,262
You also need to be careful.

587
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:31,328
You could get injured
when going to the site survey.

588
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:33,762
Take less leave and you'll earn more money.

589
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,328
Rest assured, it's a minor injury.

590
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:36,362
I'll work hard to make money.

591
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:38,161
Work hard.

592
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,529
Guo Shijie.

593
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,696
Guo Shijie, daydreaming?

594
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:44,195
You too.

595
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,161
I will work hard.

596
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,429
Thank you, Director.

597
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:49,462
You love to drink the most, always daydreaming.

598
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:50,696
Business department, keep it up!

599
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:52,629
Come on!

600
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:01,096
Yun said

601
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,328
the new bonus system
was actually your proposal.

602
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:06,728
You're welcome.

603
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,561
You know,

604
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:13,129
don't waste your thoughts
on such trivial matters.

605
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:16,596
Better just accept your fate
and stay in your current position.

606
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,995
Secretary Wang.

607
00:28:28,462 --> 00:28:31,096
Your words of thanks
are really special, you know.

608
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:32,429
I've taken them to heart.

609
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,362
Right, what you said is right.

610
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,863
I really shouldn't think about those nonsenses.

611
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:40,762
I should focus on my goal.

612
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:43,561
So, be careful.

613
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,295
Careful of what?

614
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,096
It would take just a snap
of my fingers to take you out.

615
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:54,762
It all depends on whether I want to or not.

616
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:05,828
Xu Yazhi in your sales department

617
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,462
is too ungrateful.

618
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,529
You help her like this.

619
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:11,062
How could she treat you like that?

620
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:13,561
Let her be, as long as she's happy.

621
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,129
She's happy.

622
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,394
And you?

623
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:19,362
Moreover,

624
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:20,995
it was clearly your proposal.

625
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,561
Why does she get the credit?

626
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,828
Let it go.

627
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,394
I'm not that happy about it.

628
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:28,328
But hasn't Chen said it?

629
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,995
Success need not come from me.

630
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,929
But where I am, things must succeed.

631
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:33,962
Anyway, the proposal has passed.

632
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:35,661
It's fine as long as someone does the work.

633
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:40,362
Our dear Cindy has grown up.

634
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,295
How could you think so maturely?

635
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:44,995
And be so open-minded?

636
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,661
What else?

637
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,228
With everyone taking leave like this.

638
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:50,195
Ending up with unfinished work,
isn't it me who's the most responsible?

639
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:51,696
I have to clean up everyone's mess.

640
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:52,728
I did it for myself.

641
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,728
Certainly not for Xu Yazi.

642
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,029
Yes, that's right.

643
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,295
With your personality,

644
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,962
you truly don't need to pick up the mess.

645
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,161
And having a bonus system is good too.

646
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,828
Anyway, I'm currently working
on the sales of sustainable housing.

647
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:10,929
How did you come up with this method?

648
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:12,495
Thanks to Meng Heng.

649
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,262
You mean

650
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:17,762
the Meng Heng that makes your heart race?

651
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:20,394
What are you talking about?

652
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:21,661
He just wears his headphones,

653
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:23,995
listening to everyone talking about the bonus.

654
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:25,696
Cindy used to dig into her own pockets

655
00:30:25,696 --> 00:30:27,096
to give them a bonus.

656
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:28,561
You know it's not much.

657
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:30,462
But it's the thought that counts.

658
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,195
Otherwise, how could I have thought
of such an effective method.

659
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,795
Right, and Meng Heng?

660
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,362
Why haven't we seen him all morning?

661
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:38,863
I haven't seen him either.

662
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:44,096
Where have you been?
Not a sight of you all morning.

663
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:47,895
I just went to be Fang Iris's hand model.

664
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:54,929
It looks great.

665
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:58,328
You've been tricked again.

666
00:30:58,328 --> 00:30:59,362
Again?

667
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:00,629
- Why
- I mean…

668
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:02,962
Did she do that to your hand too?

669
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,661
Like this, like this.

670
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:09,129
What's so strange about touching hands
while doing nails?

671
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,495
Fang Iris has opened a shop with her friend.

672
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,462
She asked me to go for practice.

673
00:31:13,462 --> 00:31:14,762
And how could I possibly be that foolish?

674
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:15,962
Tricked for the second time?

675
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:18,328
You're not foolish.

676
00:31:18,328 --> 00:31:21,096
You're just too far ahead so.

677
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:24,096
- Wisdom can't keep up with you.
- Wisdom can't keep up with you.

678
00:31:25,728 --> 00:31:27,462
Doesn't that still mean I'm foolish?

679
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,262
I'll poke you, you know.

680
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,362
Be careful not to spoil your nails.

681
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,096
- This little bear is really cute.
- What do you want?

682
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:34,394
You want to trick me too?

683
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,062
No, it's just very shiny.

684
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:39,776
Welcome.

685
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:41,762
- I brought them here.
- Thank you.

686
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,195
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

687
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:45,096
Thank you.

688
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:46,529
Yi, I'm telling you.

689
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,728
Iris's shop

690
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:50,462
is the place where you make your nails pretty.

691
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:51,762
Not only can you become pretty,

692
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:53,629
my nail polish is eco-friendly and non-toxic.

693
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,096
It doesn't hurt the nails or skin, you know.

694
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,762
Isn't it amazing?

695
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,629
But that's just nail polish, after all.

696
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:01,795
It's not that remarkable.

697
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:05,161
Right, it's not that big of a deal.

698
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:06,629
But you know what?

699
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:09,696
They can also paint on the nails, you know.

700
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:11,696
I've even seen

701
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,995
someone writing words on it.

702
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:14,828
And then opening it to show others.

703
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,429
Just like looking at a card.

704
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:17,661
Full of surprises.

705
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:18,795
Take a look.

706
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:23,661
Look, isn't this very cute?

707
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:25,195
You think it's just okay, right?
Okay, let's take a look

708
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,228
if there's a pattern of a prince charming.

709
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:28,728
There's one of a princess.

710
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,561
Or do you want both the prince and princess?

711
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,629
- Qbie, help them out.
- Okay.

712
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:37,661
Meng Heng, thank you.

713
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,029
You really stand by your friends.

714
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:41,228
Immediately brought people to support.

715
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,429
It's nothing.

716
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,795
I want to thank you, so,
I'll help you remove your nail polish.

717
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,962
No need, I can remove it myself at home.

718
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,262
Then choose one between nail polish removal
and eyebrow shaping.

719
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,362
I'm also quite good
at eyebrow shaping, you know.

720
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:58,262
No need, I…

721
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,728
I'll sit here and watch them.

722
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,328
Just wait till they finish.

723
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,195
Right, you have to wait for them anyway.

724
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:04,529
Let's go.

725
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:05,929
Let's go.

726
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:09,228
- Come, sit here.
- I'll look slowly.

727
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:11,029
Wait for me a moment.

728
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:14,995
Have you decided on getting a manicure,

729
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,295
or an eyebrow trim?

730
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,462
An eyebrow trim then, right.

731
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,596
Eyebrow trimming?

732
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:23,462
Look for the base color.

733
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:35,394
Cindy.

734
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:37,529
Don't move around.

735
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,529
It's hard for me to trim
when you're so far away.

736
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:41,462
Yeah, please don't move, okay?

737
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:43,129
I have an eyebrow razor in hand.

738
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,462
You'll ruin your looks if you keep moving.

739
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,394
Don't frown.

740
00:33:52,394 --> 00:33:54,195
Don't worry, I'm very gentle.

741
00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:55,495
I won't ruin your looks.

742
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,596
It's rare to look at a guy's skin this closely.

743
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:03,896
Actually, guys have delicate skin too.

744
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:06,361
It needs to be well cared for, right?

745
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:12,562
They are only a good match
if they are the same age.

746
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,295
Don't keep moving back.

747
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:16,495
Any previous heart palpitations

748
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:18,828
must mean there's a problem with my heart.

749
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:20,429
I should really see a doctor.

750
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,028
Thank you.

751
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:44,063
Miss Gao.

752
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,328
You're off work so late today.

753
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:52,429
Yes.

754
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:56,096
Vice President Han told me

755
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,429
that he has a social engagement today.

756
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,629
Don't you have to accompany him?

757
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:04,596
The Vice President indeed
has an engagement tonight.

758
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:07,429
But he usually doesn't ask me to join.

759
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,295
So, I just make use of this time

760
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:11,429
to deal with some work-related chores.

761
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,262
Plus, leaving work late
means no traffic jams, right?

762
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:18,194
You don't need to be nervous.

763
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:20,495
I'm not worried about Vice President Han.

764
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,896
But if he really had something,

765
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:26,661
you would tell me, right?

766
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:45,562
Then I'll go first, see you tomorrow.

767
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:46,629
Bye.

768
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,096
Actually…

769
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:55,063
The Vice President bought two bracelets.

770
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:57,429
Is the other one for someone else?

771
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:08,695
Miss, it seems like

772
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:10,661
someone is following our car.

773
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:12,194
Do you recognize her?

774
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:15,295
Yun.

775
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:17,194
Wait a moment.

776
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:18,462
Yun.

777
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,229
Big brother, could you please pull over for me?

778
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,262
Thank you.

779
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:23,495
Yun.

780
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:26,096
Yun, wait a moment.

781
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:28,495
Yun.

782
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:31,129
What's wrong?

783
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:33,328
Take a breath and speak slowly.

784
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:34,962
Listen to me.

785
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,028
Actually, the vice president bought two

786
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,862
identical bracelets.

787
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,361
One is for you, the other one…

788
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:43,096
I know that.

789
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:45,129
What?

790
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,429
You know?

791
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:48,661
The one I originally wore broke.

792
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:50,429
So, he bought a new one.

793
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:52,361
Afraid I would wait too long
for it to be fixed.

794
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:59,129
You came all this way just to tell me this?

795
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,929
I…

796
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,528
I've known it for a long time.

797
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,795
But still, thank you.

798
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,028
Okay.

799
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:15,962
Then if you're alright, go home and rest early.

800
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:20,762
Bye.

801
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:24,896
Be careful on your way back.

802
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:30,495
Big brother, let's go.

803
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,596
It's not like that.

804
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:41,762
The two bracelets were bought at the same time.

805
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:44,395
You've been deceived by the vice president.

806
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,096
Wait for me a second.

807
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:10,328
Yi has fallen asleep.

808
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:12,596
Do you want to let her sleep a little longer?

809
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:16,229
It seems she must have played very hard.

810
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,361
Cindy.

811
00:38:19,361 --> 00:38:21,929
Thank you for willing
to accompany Yi proactively.

812
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,528
It's a pity I have a social engagement today.

813
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,695
Otherwise, we could have gone together.

814
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:27,295
It's alright.

815
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:29,929
When us girls get our nails done,
you can only wait on the side.

816
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,629
Just consider it a little outing for us girls.

817
00:38:33,262 --> 00:38:34,462
And besides,

818
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,063
we haven't forgotten about you.

819
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,129
Could there also be a gift for me?

820
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:41,161
Yi has prepared a little surprise for you.

821
00:38:42,328 --> 00:38:45,795
What is it? You're really treating me
like a driver, aren't you?

822
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:47,762
Well then.

823
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:49,661
Did you prepare it for me?

824
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:56,429
Does making myself look beautiful count?

825
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:58,495
I did it in the afternoon.

826
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:00,528
French style.

827
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,028
How did you know?

828
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:04,161
I've done a little research.

829
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,695
And it's heart-shaped.

830
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,929
You're holding hands, aren't you?

831
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:13,129
You, you get it.

832
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:14,161
It's very beautiful.

833
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:16,395
You really went on holding hands.

834
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:46,752
♫ Secretly thinking of you ♫

835
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,824
♫ And secretly watching you ♫

836
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:52,896
Are you home yet?

837
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:54,929
Here we are, your daddy's here to pick you up.

838
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,495
Be careful getting off.

839
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:02,161
Remember to close…

840
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,129
- Daddy.
- My little princess is awake.

841
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:06,862
Did you have fun today?

842
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,661
- Yes.
- Really?

843
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:10,528
If you're happy,

844
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:11,929
then shouldn't you properly

845
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:14,429
say thank you to auntie?

846
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:16,495
Auntie Cindy, thank you.

847
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:17,795
You're welcome.

848
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,194
It's late,
you should head back and rest quickly.

849
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:20,528
I'm going home.

850
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:22,328
- See you next time.
- Okay.

851
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:24,528
- Say goodbye to auntie
- Auntie, goodbye.

852
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:25,828
Goodbye.

853
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:28,695
Go back carefully, goodbye.

854
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:29,695
Goodbye.

855
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,828
Where did you go to play?

856
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:33,063
I'm not telling you.

857
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,262
Why won't you tell me?

858
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:35,862
Because it's a secret.

859
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:45,395
Holding hands makes you that happy?

860
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:48,596
You saw it?

861
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:51,762
Anyone who's not blind could see it.

862
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:52,828
It's not exactly holding hands.

863
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,028
Just looking at the finished nails.

864
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:57,462
Actually, I think your nails
are prettier than mine.

865
00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:58,562
Camera, bring the camera.

866
00:40:58,562 --> 00:40:59,862
I'll take a picture for you.

867
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:01,194
To keep as a memory.

868
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:02,929
What's there to take a picture of?

869
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:03,962
Got it.

870
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:07,495
It's all thanks to Duomi.

871
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:08,828
Talking about some scheme.

872
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:11,429
You made me not choose the nail removal.

873
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:16,528
Wait a second.

874
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:18,762
Was I tricked again?

875
00:41:18,762 --> 00:41:20,229
You only know about it now?

876
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,295
Are you a dinosaur?

877
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:22,729
You're the dinosaur here.

878
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:24,980
[A new message]

879
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:33,028
This fingernail.

880
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:40,194
You help me see who sent it to me.

881
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:45,028
[Zhou, Meng Heng, are you free now?]
It's Zhou.

882
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:47,262
[Do you want to drink?]
He says he wants to ask you out for a drink.

883
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:48,596
[There's something I want to talk to you about]
Then he says there's something

884
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:50,429
that only you can know.

885
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,063
Since when have you been so close with Zhou?

886
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:54,629
Let me see.

887
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:55,929
Why is he asking you out for drinks?

888
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,962
What does he want to talk
to you about over drinks?

889
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,562
It's nothing. I'll take you back later.

890
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:02,161
Zhou.

891
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:04,262
Stop making a fuss.

892
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:26,429
Zhou, are you alright?

893
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:28,096
Bro, you're here.

894
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,795
I haven't arrived yet,
how come you're already so drunk?

895
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:32,495
You tell me.

896
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:35,562
How did it end up like this?

897
00:42:35,562 --> 00:42:37,328
- What's the matter?
- Why?

898
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:40,395
Why do I love her?

899
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:41,929
She loves him.

900
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,995
But he doesn't love her the same way.

901
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,295
- Why?
- You mean…

902
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:49,063
- Who?
- Her, just her.

903
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:51,729
No, the point is who is she?

904
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:53,528
It's her, the one we talked about last time.

905
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,395
No, what I mean is…

906
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:58,629
Who is he that doesn't love Miss Gao?

907
00:42:58,629 --> 00:42:59,962
That person…

908
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:01,528
Gao Shuangyun is in a relationship now?

909
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:03,161
What about Gao Shuangyun?

910
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:04,328
Keep your voice down.

911
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:05,562
I'll tell you.

912
00:43:05,562 --> 00:43:07,462
You should call her Yun.

913
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:08,762
Yun.

914
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:10,795
Yun is most afraid of loud noises.

915
00:43:10,795 --> 00:43:13,795
So, you need to be very, very, very quiet.

916
00:43:13,795 --> 00:43:15,828
That way she won't be scared.

917
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:18,361
So, who is Yun dating?

918
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:20,262
You're too loud.

919
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:22,361
Yun will be scared.

920
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:23,596
Zhou, you're not going to sleep, are you?

921
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,462
- Wake up
- Yun.

922
00:43:26,462 --> 00:43:28,762
- First answer me, answer before you sleep.
- Yun.

923
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:29,995
- Get up.
- Right now.

924
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:31,896
You two.

925
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:33,528
What do you want to ask?

926
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,762
Come to answer quickly.

927
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,295
- Yun is dating who?
- No, that's not it.

928
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:38,161
I'm Secretary Zhou.

929
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:41,495
I have a very strong professional ethic.

930
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,194
I won't tell you anything.

931
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:46,295
You are good, you are great.

932
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:48,429
- Meng Heng?
- You say I'm foolish.

933
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,795
I know who it is.

934
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:09,953
[Leverage the big picture with small benefits

935
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:12,262
[Next Episode]
She…

936
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:14,295
hopes we never see each other again.

937
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:18,028
Can it be?

938
00:44:18,028 --> 00:44:20,328
I don't know if I can ask the manager for…

939
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:22,729
Data that has already been completed.

940
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,361
If she knows what Vice President Han is like,

941
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,495
do you think she will continue to be with him?

942
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,695
You really are exaggerating.

943
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:29,028
Snatching credit to this extent.

944
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:31,828
We still haven't found a person for the head
of our planning department.

945
00:44:31,828 --> 00:44:34,194
We still have one last piece of the puzzle
that hasn't been placed yet.

946
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:36,194
Why did he choose to deceive you?

947
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:37,361
This bracelet…

948
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:38,929
