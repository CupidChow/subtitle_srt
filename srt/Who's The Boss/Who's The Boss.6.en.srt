- You dance so well.

00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,066
Okay.

00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,498
Let's keep the party going.

37
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,765
You still want to drink? Keep the party going?

38
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:44,932
I'll call a cab for you.

39
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:46,366
No need.

40
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,466
The driver is right here.

41
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,665
Right, I haven't been drinking.

42
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,399
Oh right, I forgot.

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,899
Do you two want to call a car first?

44
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,999
Sure, then we can share one on the way.

45
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,699
Okay.

46
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,800
Meng Heng, after you drop Yun,

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,966
you need to take Cindy back.

48
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,199
Okay.

49
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,032
I'll go drive the car over now.

00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:08,433
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

53
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,899
- Did you call a cab?
- Yes.

54
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,265
- Alright, let me know when you get home, okay?
- Okay.

55
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,398
- Are you guys really okay?
- Okay, no problem at all.

56
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:15,698
Meng Heng has given the manager
a ride home before.

57
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:17,198
So, he knows the way.

58
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,198

Where's the car?

62
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,198
He said he'll arrive
in another five minutes, almost here.

63
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:33,765
Okay.

64
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,899
- Take care when you guys head back later.
- Okay.

65
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,232
Call me when you get home, okay?

66
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:39,332
- Okay.
- I'm off.

67
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:41,332
Let's go.

68
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:45,198
- Is the car here?
- Not yet.

69
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,131
They're off now. Let's wait a little longer.

70
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,532
Meng Heng is going to get the car.

71
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:08,965

72

You're home.

74
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:15,633
Come on, get out of the car, be careful.

75
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,465
Alright, be careful, take it slow.

76
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,566
Okay.

77
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:24,765
- Be careful.
- I'm okay.

78
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:26,566
- Are you okay? Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

79
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,131
I can walk in a straight line.

80
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,232
I'll show you guys.

81
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,532
Great.

82
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:31,733
Stop messing around.

83
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,198
Forget it, I…

84
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:35,166
I'll take you upstairs.
You wait here for a moment.

85
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,666
- Can you do it by yourself?
- I can, no problem.

86
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,765
No need for support.

87
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:41,498
- Okay, I won't hold you, but walk properly.
- I'm very sober.

88
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,866
Which one is your house?

89
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,698
That one.

90
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,398
Be careful, stand properly.

91
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,566
Stand properly.

92
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,366
Okay.

93
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,965
Why did you change the password to my house?

94
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:13,566
It's my first time coming here.

95
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,566
Forget it, you're drunk,
I won't hold it against you.

96
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:23,766
Are you sure this one is your house, or…?

97
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,800
- This is my house.
- Or…

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,666
But it won't let me go home.

99
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,533
I'm dumbfounded.

100
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,066
A woman drunk is really scary.

101
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,399
I really should drink less.

102
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,732
Just tell me your password directly.

103
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:48,865
I'll press it for you.
Come on, what's the number?

104
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:51,632
Password.

105
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:53,999
What's the password?

106
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,698
I don't remember the password.

107
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,900
Gao Shuangyun.

108
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,732
Please, with the bit of sanity you have left,
think for a moment.

109
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:04,066
Is your password your birthday?

110
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:07,066
Or some other important number? Hurry up.

111
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:13,865
It's my dad's birthday.

112
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,433
It's my dad's birthday.

113
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,900
Your dad's birth…

114
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,632
Wasn't that just a few days ago?

115
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:29,900
Okay, be careful.

116
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,299
You didn't turn off the lights.

117
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,598
- The light's not off!
- You can go home now.

118
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,666
Right.

119
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,299
- Come on, be careful.
- You can go home.

120
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,533
I'll close the door. You walk carefully.

121
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,533
- Walk slower.
- Go home.

122
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,933
I'm home.

123
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:44,198
I mean, you…

124
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:59,066
Dad, brother.

125
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,198
Yun.

126
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,698
How did you get so drunk?

127
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,266
You didn't come for Dad's birthday either.

128
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,800
So, we came over to check on you today.

129
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,132
The company had an event today.

130
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,566
So, we celebrated.

131
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,766
She had a few drinks.

132
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,098
Is this the job you wanted?

133
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,632
The workplace you chose?

134
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,331
Look at yourself!

135
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:29,132
It's hardly different
from being a high-class socialite.

136
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,533
Since you have no special skills,

137
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,832
you've achieved nothing at work,

138
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:38,499
and you're not seriously looking
for someone to marry.

139
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,231
Considering how old you are now.

140
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,231
You're not even seeing anyone!

141
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,512
Uncle.

142
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,999
You fail at everything.

143
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,166
How did our Gao family
end up with someone like you?

144
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:04,732
This is exactly why

145
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:07,865
I chose not to attend your birthday.

146
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:10,900
So, as not to turn your 'Happy Birthday'

147
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,666
into an 'Unhappy Birthday'.

148
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,732
- Yun.
- You!

149
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,266
Some wood is just too rotten to be carved.

150
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,965
Excuse me, may I ask who you are?

151
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,266
I'm Miss Gao's secretary.

152
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,933
You can just call me Cindy Wang.

153
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,399
Hello.

154
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,800
Please take care of our Yun.

155
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,698
I…

156
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:02,632
I'm a bad person.

157
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,465
Gao Shuangyun.

158
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:12,499
Uncle didn't mean that.

159
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm a bad person.

160
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,399
I'm a bad person.

161
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,766
I am indeed a bad person.

162
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:59,966
Bad person.

163
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,899
She said not meeting her dad's expectations

164
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,365
is considered bad.

165
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,266
She has become a manager.

166
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,433
Still not enough?

167
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:26,833
Then if my dad knows that I…

168
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,165
Then wouldn't I just…

169
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:34,466
It's fine.

170
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,498
What now?

171
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,633
I just went to buy beef soup.

172
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,032
Buy one get one free.

173
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,131
Do you want to drink some?

174
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:59,433
How nice!

175
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,466
Why is it so heavy?

176
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,165
Because…

177
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,266
Both bowls are packed inside.

178
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,099
Then how are you going to eat it?

179
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:12,266
I…

180
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:14,532
Can I come in to eat?

181
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,198
Then you should have just said
let's eat together from the start.

182
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,833
Why so much preamble? Come on in!

183
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,298
So domineering.

184
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:31,933
[Tai Yue Xiaofang]
Where's the money you promised?

185
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,857
After all that, we still didn't get the case.

186
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:42,032
That's because you're not capable enough.

187
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,365
You should give what you owe.

188
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,698
Okay.

189
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,165
May our cooperation go smoothly,

190
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,800
only then can we continue to work hard.

191
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,298
[Yun]
Are you home?

192
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:10,066
Was just about to say goodnight to you.

193
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:17,399
Who is it, this late?

194
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:26,000
Is the celebration banquet over?

195
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:34,899
Don't ask anything.

196
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,698
You're drunk.

197
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,466
Right now,

198
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,633
I just want to hear you say you want me.

199
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,966
Use the crudest

200
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:16,466
and simplest way to say you want me.

201
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,599
Say you want me.

202
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,331
Say you want me.

203
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,698
Say you want me.

204
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,933
Say you want me.

205
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:53,365
I want you.

206
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:56,800
I want you.

207
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,566
Didn't I order cauliflower rice?

208
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,698
Why, is there no cauliflower?

209
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:30,232
Are you farsighted?

210
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,899
- No, this rice…
- Look closely.

211
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,899
There's the root on top.

212
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,633
- Is there?
- Yes, there is.

213
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,766
What a coincidence!

214
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:39,732
Are you stalking me?

215
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,365
Who's stalking you?

216
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:42,532
I arrived earlier than you, okay?

217
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:43,698
I didn't see you there.

218
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:46,131
Now you see me.

219
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,599
Let's eat together.

220
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,466
Go away, I don't want to.

221
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,732
How annoying.

222
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,131
Okay, let's get to the point.

223
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:03,099
So, you really didn't know
Han Xinzheng has a girlfriend?

224
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,833
When I entered the company,

225
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,732
I heard that he was already married.

226
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:08,833
Or did he…

227
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,933
When did he get divorced?

228
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,865
That's possible.

229
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:16,066
After entering the company,
I've never heard him talk about his family.

230
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:20,498
Do you girls often gossip
about others when you get together?

231
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,833
If you don't want to listen, then leave.

232
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,800
I want to hear it.

233
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,732
Did Zhou say who his girlfriend is?

234
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:31,000
He's very tight-lipped about it.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,266
True.

236
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,833
Could it be that Vice President Han
hasn't actually divorced?

237
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,365
What Zhou mentioned was a mistress?

238
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,665
Speaking of mistresses,

239
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,165
our company has a mistress.

240
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,165
Who?

241
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,933
Quick.

242
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:49,066
Fang Iris.

243
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,466
Wait a minute, how do you know?

244
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,000
Zhang Xiaoting from
the business department told me.

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,698
She said Fang Iris has a sugar daddy.

246
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,665
That's why she can change
her bags one after another.

247
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,732
I think we're not the parties
involved after all.

248
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,698
It's better not to jump to conclusions.

249
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,633
No, wait a minute.

250
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,266
Don't you think it's quite a coincidence?

251
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:05,599
Where's the coincidence?

252
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,933
It's suspected that there's a mistress
in the company,

253
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,833
then one is definitely the mistress.

254
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,266
Come on.

255
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:14,766
If Han Xinzheng had married earlier,

256
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,599
then he's even able to give birth to Fang Iris.

257
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:19,865
Then you really don't understand men.

258
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:22,232
So, you understand?

259
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,800
Men are the most devoted animals

260
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
in this world.

261
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Whether they're 30, 50

262
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,433
or even 80 years old,

263
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,933
they always like

264
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,365
young and pretty girls the most.

265
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,633
Nonsense!

266
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,966
You…

267
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,698
You're not old enough yet, are you?

268
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:44,433
So, are you saying at my age
I should like middle school students?

269
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,433
[Zhang Shiping]
Do I have to like elementary school students?

270
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:49,000
- That seems worth calling the police for.
- Why is he sending this to me?

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,532
You're just contradicting yourself.

272
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,599
No, it's not just you.

273
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,099
[Zhang Shiping]
I didn't expect our first photo together

274
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,800
would be taken under such circumstances.

275
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,299
[Cindy Wang]
Director Zhang sent a message in the morning.

276
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:07,566
It couldn't be just to share a photo, right?

277
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,498
[Zhang Shiping]
Are you free? Let's meet up.

278
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,432
It's baffling.

279
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:19,633
Then what's your type? Go on, say it.

280
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,928
[Cindy Wang]
Okay.

281
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,899
Alright, you go on and chat.

282
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,098
I have something to do, bye.

283
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,232
Wait a second.

284
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,765
We're going to watch a movie.

285
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,598
Director Zhang from Bosheng asked me out.

286
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:40,066
It could be about work.

287
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,331
So, I'll go first.

288
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:42,566
Then I'll see how the timing goes.

289
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:45,098
If the timing works out,
I'll meet you at the cinema, okay?

290
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,866
Today's a holiday, you know.

291
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,498
If he's calling you to talk about work,

292
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,598
then the appointment should be
with the Operations Department

293
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,765
discussing how to build houses.

294
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,265
Or maybe,

295
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:59,598
he might be interested in you.

296
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:00,932
Duomi, I'm serious.

297
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:02,299
You've never been asked out like this before,

298
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,466
have you?

299
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,498
Maybe he's just simply

300
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,066
interested in Cindy's abilities.

301
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:08,232
Wanting to invite her out
to a meal in particular.

302
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:09,899
- Sorry about that.
- Okay.

303
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:10,932
I'll find out when I get there.

304
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,633
You two stop guessing, okay?

305
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:14,765
Okay, I'll head off first.

306
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,066
- Wait a moment, I'll see you out.
- Okay.

307
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,432
No need.

308
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,598
Next meal is here.

309
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,633
Go ahead, hurry on.

310
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,098
Fine, I'm leaving now.

311
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,999
I'm off.

312
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:28,265
Don't be a third wheel.

313
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:29,299
Seriously.

314
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,633
I'm not so free to be a third wheel.

315
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,299
No, you might break up someone's relationship.

316
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:36,800
Something that might have a chance.

317
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,132
Why go and destroy someone's relationship?

318
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:40,331
Come on, drink.

319
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:41,800
Sorry, I'm went home to change clothes.

320
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,033
That's why I was late.

321
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,331
- It's alright.
- Thank you.

322
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:51,899
Director Zhang is going on a date later?

323
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,966
No.

324
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:56,999
Then what's this?

325
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,899
For you.

326
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,699
I'm not going on a date later.

327
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:03,699
I'm actually on a date right now.

328
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,832
You're on a date right now?

329
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:09,800
You're not going to confess to me, are you?

330
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,299
You're good.

331
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:22,466
Be my girlfriend.

332
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:25,533
Put this bouquet in the vase.

333
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,966
The colors match well.

334
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,633
Wait, never mind the vase for now.

335
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,765
We've known each other
for less than a month, right?

336
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,765
The number of days dating
and knowing each other

337
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:40,299
don't necessarily correlate.

338
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,800
No, what I mean is…

339
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,299
you probably don't know me well.

340
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,366
True.

341
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:51,899
But I've always trusted my own judgment.

342
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,665
Long before now,

343
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:56,033
I saw you

344
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:58,598
in my future.

345
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,165
Your future?

346
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:02,299
Me?

347
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,533
Is a perfect existence.

348
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,399
Thank you for your appreciation.

349
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,699
But I think

350
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,165
this is too sudden.

351
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,399
Don't

352
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:15,765
rush to say no.

353
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:17,999
Just give me the green light.

354
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,765
Let me have the chance to come to your side,

355
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,633
and pursue you.

356
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:26,665
Let's get to know each other,
and understand each other.

357
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,366
I believe time will prove

358
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,732
I'm right.

359
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:02,432
Are you hungry?

360
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,699
Shush.

361
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,066
Don't talk.

362
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:09,432
I want to hear the sound of your heartbeat.

363
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:15,331
Then did you hear

364
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:18,265
the sound of me needing to pee?

365
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,999

is the right thing to do?

524

And then, after you've given it your all,

525
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:13,533
just because of a minor mistake,

526
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,366
you get knocked to the bottom.

527

Is that right too?

being knocked to the bottom.

I call it laying low.

531

00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:28,533
that things are going to be different
from now on.

533
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:29,966

550
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:11,800
Duomi.

551
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,765
What needs to be entered here is…

552
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:17,033
keywords.

553
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,399
I'll improve next time.

554
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,533
However,

555
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,633
I think it should be you.

556
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:24,566
Look, you've also been flattering
Chen quite a bit.

557
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,466
And the boss should have
calmed down by now, right?

558
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:27,633
It's only right to promote you back

559
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,732
to your original position, right?

560
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,132
It seems so.

561
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:35,331
Also, the situation at my work recently

562
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:36,466
is not bad.

563
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,066
And, the relationship with my colleagues

564
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,399
has become really good.

565
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,533
It might also be
that fortune-changing plan of yours

566
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,765
getting affirmation.

567
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,899
Really?

568
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,132
Or it could be

569
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:50,199
the Vice President found evidence
of Lu Yicheng framing me?

570
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,932
Anyway, congratulations
on your triumphant return!

571
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,765
This is what they call a turn
from bad to good fortune.

572
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:02,432
Your future is now as bright
as if it were lit by ten lamps.

573
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:05,665
You're succeeding in both love and career!

574
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:06,699
What?

575
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,899
I haven't even started anything
with Director Zhang.

576
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:12,899
What do you mean
succeeding in both love and career!

577
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,066
Okay.

578
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:18,533
Aren't you going to the meeting room
to find Yingjun?

579
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,432
Let's go.

580
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:22,633
Let's go.

581
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:42,699
Why isn't it clean?

582
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:43,732
Zhou, please give

583
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:46,533
this approval document to Mr. Cai
tomorrow morning.

584
00:32:53,132 --> 00:32:54,299
I'm sorry,

585
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,566
I didn't see you were holding something.

586
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:57,966
Go and buy a new one.

587
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:01,466
Choose one you like, and I'll pay for it.

588
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:02,466
Vice President.

589
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:03,533
No, it's okay.

590
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,966
It's my fault. It's just my own carelessness.

591
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,633
It's just a cup. I wasn't paying attention.

592
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:10,098
You go and buy it.

593
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,932
It's okay, I…

594
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:15,732
Vice President, I see your dinner
with the Hua Chen clients

595
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:16,765
is going to be late.

596
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:17,765
Maybe you should go now.

597
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:20,533
I'll take care of things here.

598
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,265
Okay, then see how much it is,

599
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:23,866
and remember to report the expense to me.

600
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:25,699
It's just a cup, it's okay.

601
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,066
Vice President, take care.

602
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:43,098
Even if you buy the most expensive one for me,

603
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:47,132
it won't have the same sentiment.

604
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:04,066
As long as you can give me the green light

605
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:07,465
to allow me the chance to be by your side.

606
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:09,265
I believe time will prove

607
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:11,533
I'm right.

608
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:23,131
Gosh.

609
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:49,653
[Promotion]

610
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:55,033
Promotion is very important.

611
00:34:57,088 --> 00:35:01,432
[Promotion]

612
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,932
You're still here?

613
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:08,098
It's all soaked through.

614
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,131
Zhou, you haven't finished work yet?

615
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,033
What are you looking at?

616
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,598
Why did it break?

617
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:45,765
No, it's just…

618
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:48,332
I just accidentally broke it.

619
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:52,632
Then how did you accidentally smash it?

620
00:35:52,632 --> 00:35:54,265
No, it's just…

621
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,833
Today, when the Vice President
was about to give me something.

622
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,265
I didn't notice,

623
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:00,131
and I accidentally bumped into it.

624
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:02,765
And then the cup just…

625
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:07,833
It's okay, we can just buy another cup.

626
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:11,265
You don't understand.

627
00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:12,932
This cup

628
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:16,399
was a gift from someone very important to me.

629
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,965
Zhou

630
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:26,533
You're not falling for Miss Gao, are you?

631
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:58,465
He… did he come to take you to work?

632
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,632
- I'm…
- Yes.

633
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,366
It's not the kind of pick-up
you're thinking of.

634
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:06,432
I called his car.

635
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,199
I haven't formally introduced him to you.

636
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,965
Meng Heng is an intern at our company.

637
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,298
He's also a taxi driver.

638
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,932
I just decided to take advantage
of our colleague's preference to ride with him.

639
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,131
Oh, that's how it is.

640
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:18,932
Not bad, it's good for young people
to have such initiative.

641
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,866
It's right to get in touch with various aspects

642
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,000
of society.

643
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:26,199
However,

644
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,965
why are you here? Don't you have work today?

645
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:29,298
Of course I have to work.

646
00:37:29,298 --> 00:37:30,399
But no matter how busy,

647
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,432
I need to make some time to spend with you.

648
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:35,066
So, I came without an invitation.

649
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:39,799
Then…

650
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,000
Do I have the honor

651
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:45,732
to drive you to work?

652
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,932
You've already opened the door.

653
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:54,765
I'll see you at the office later.

654
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:56,332
Go to the office by yourself.

655
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:59,465
I… you…

656
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:03,332
- Thank you.
- Take care, okay?

657
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:13,899
You've worked hard.

658
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:16,499
Sorry to make you come
all this way for nothing.

659
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:30,765
Is money really that impressive?

660
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:36,465
Of course it is.

661
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,965
You hear the loud engine sound, don't you?

662
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:56,166
He just started to badmouth the car.

663
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:57,965
How is it so cute?

664
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,866
She just laughs at everything.

665
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,033
I used to have a heavy motorcycle.

666
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:02,499
And before that,

667
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,965
our car sound was also very loud.

668
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:08,000
Mocking the car is really too funny.

669
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:14,533
So, what about this car?

670
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:15,533
Really.

671
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,598
No way.

672
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,265
Meng Heng.

673
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:31,399
What are you doing?

674
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:34,399
I don't know, it seems to be broken, I…

675
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,833
What are you doing?

676
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,131
Sorry.

677
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:51,000
It's broken.

678
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,598
There's water in your hair.

679
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:56,879
There's a spot on your face.

680
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:59,183
Move closer a bit.

681
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,544
Look, it's all over your clothes.

682
00:40:00,544 --> 00:40:01,999
It's okay.

683
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,237
I'll close the convertible top.

684
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:06,456
There should be no problem now.

685
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:26,476
[Chen Duomi]
Guess who gave me a ride to work today?

686
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:33,711
Don't tell me it was Zhang Shiping.

687
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:43,068
In a convertible.

688
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:46,268
Did he kiss you?

689
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:52,616
Chen.

690
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,528
- Good morning.
- I've ordered Rose Four-Substance Drink.

691
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,007
I'll send it to you as soon as it arrives.

692
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:58,736
Thank you.

693
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:02,632
But please don't send me those things anymore.

694
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:07,066
Gold

695
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:10,265
always shines.

696
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,033
I won't wait for the elevator with you.

697
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,098
I'll take the stairs.

698
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:14,866
I need to exercise.

699
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:18,066
Mr. Cai's office is on the 11th floor.

700
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:22,965
That's so healthy.

701
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,932
[Chen Duomi]
You haven't entered the office yet, have you?

702
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:28,232
Conscience suggestion.

703
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:31,533
Take three deep breaths before you go in.

704
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,166
What do you mean?

705
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:38,932
Gold

706
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:40,799
always shines.

707
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,265
It couldn't be

708
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,699
the director's position…

709
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:06,332
- Congratulations Director Xu
- Congratulations.

710
00:42:06,332 --> 00:42:07,932
Congratulations Director, congratulations.

711
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:10,298
Thank you all.

712
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:12,932
From now on,
everyone should fully support Yazi.

713
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:14,033
She has just taken office.

714
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,799
If there is any discomfort,

715
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,833
then be gentle with her, okay?

716
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,965
She'll surely torment us

717
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:21,965
gently.

718
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:24,066
Guo Shijie.

719
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:25,131
Yazi.

720
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:27,298
I hope that under your leadership,
the business department

721
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:29,199
can unite together more wholeheartedly.

722
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,699
In fact, I just have
the additional title of director.

723
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:33,799
The work I do is still
the same as everyone else's.

724
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:35,232
We all learn from each other.

725
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:36,866
All in the same boat.

726
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:38,199
Okay?

727
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,033
- Okay.
- Okay.

728
00:42:40,033 --> 00:42:42,366
Suddenly I feel
a heavy sense of responsibility.

729
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:44,098
The head used to only lead three,

730
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:47,732
and now, as the head, I have to lead four.

731
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,932
I'm really afraid I can't handle it.

732
00:42:49,932 --> 00:42:52,265
You all must help me, okay?

733
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:55,000
Right.

734
00:42:56,765 --> 00:42:58,632
Then, congratulations Yazi.

735
00:42:58,632 --> 00:42:59,932
You should treat us.

736
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:01,932
Yes, treat us.

737
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:03,166
Treat us.

738
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,166
Okay.

739
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:08,000
I'll treat.

740
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,598
Hurry and see what everyone wants to eat.

741
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:10,598
Okay, leave it to me.

742
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:13,598
- I want a drink.
- Then I won't be polite.

743
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:29,033
Shall we go eat first?

744
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:32,598
Why are you playing this if you're not eating?

745
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,866
I must have thrown away
the one I caught before.

746
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:36,799
That's why I'm being punished.

747
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:40,265
Since when did you become so superstitious?

748
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,131
Now.

749
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:47,932
I can't seem to catch it no matter what.

750
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:49,000
You…

751
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,598
Calm down and try a different angle.

752
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:52,666
Do you remember last time,

753
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,732
you caught it in one try? Try again.

754
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,499
Right, you were emotional just now.

755
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:59,598
If you play emotionally, you'll waste money.

756
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:07,833
I was so close to success.

757
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:08,833
Why?

758
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,533
Is this machine targeting me?

759
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:12,765
Are you targeting me?

760
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:15,199
The machine is innocent, calm down, will you?

761
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,366
How am I supposed to calm down?

762
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:19,399
I did so much.

763
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:21,799
I clearly didn't do anything wrong.

764
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:23,666
I've worked so hard.

765
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,899
Why am I always the one being punished?

766
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,265
No, I was originally

767
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,332
in that position.

768
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:35,199
Where are you going?

769
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:41,366
I'm going to get change.

770
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:51,965
What do we do now?

771
00:44:53,265 --> 00:44:54,732
Let her calm down first.

772
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:57,131
How?

773
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,833
How do I tell you?

774
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,265
Getting back in her original place,

775
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:03,833
and being the head

776
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:04,833
is like

777
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,598
the carrot dangled in front of the donkey.

778
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:09,298
Cindy has always been holding onto this hope,

779
00:45:09,298 --> 00:45:11,332
and continuously going forward.

780
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:12,566
But…

781
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:14,465
What Gao Shuangyun did

782
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:16,598
is essentially blocking Cindy's path

783
00:45:16,598 --> 00:45:18,732
to revival.

784
00:45:18,732 --> 00:45:21,366
Originally thought that Yun was a good person.

785
00:45:21,366 --> 00:45:23,765

00:45:49,098 --> 00:45:50,298
[Next Episode]
I want to take you to meet someone.

789
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:52,598
Someone very important in my life.

790
00:45:52,598 --> 00:45:55,000
Turns out to be a scumbag.

791
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,666
Cindy darling.

792
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:58,732
If…

793
00:45:58,732 --> 00:46:02,000
If the person you like is a bad guy,
then what would you do?

794
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,866
- Zhou.
- I just want to cut off her escape route.

795
00:46:04,866 --> 00:46:06,000
Given her personality,

796
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,965
she'll definitely uncover the truth.

797
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,265
Please don't let others use you.

798
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:10,465
You're investigating me?

799
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:13,499
Are you doing this really just to help me…

800
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:15,533
Are you doubting me now?

801
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:18,566
