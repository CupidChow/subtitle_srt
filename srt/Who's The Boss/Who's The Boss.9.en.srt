Mr. Xi has already made it very clear.

18
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:14,708
He could take the project away at any time.

19
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:20,208
You already told me that your role as a manger felt very weak and wanted to perform well.

20
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,009
I can't let this project fail, can I?

21
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,443
You always say it's for me.

22
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:33,776
Is it really for me?

23
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:47,376
Fine, I admit it.

24
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:53,008
It's not just for you. It's also for myself.

25
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:55,609
You need performance, and so do I.

26
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,876
But agreeing to Mr. Xi on this matter is really dangerous.

27
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:01,742
What if someone finds out?

00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:05,242

32
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,109
I'm meeting with Sister Chen today.

33
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,976
- So we will talk about work at some point.
- That's right.

34
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:37,876
I am interning with you for these three months. So, of course, I have to come and learn.

35
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:41,108
All right, let me say this first. Don't talk recklessly when we go in.

36
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,342
I'll think about it.

37
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,508
Don't talk nonsense.

38
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,068

You are new to the company. This is your first time meeting her, right?

41
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:55,608
Hello, Sister Li. I am Meng Heng, an intern in the Sales Department.

Such a sweet talker, this kid.

43

Relax a bit. Don't be so uptight after work.

44
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,809
You know, Zhou, even a good person like you would end up in a police station.

45
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:11,143
Did you turn in a lost wallet to the police station? Doing a good deed each day, right?

46
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,342
- Zhou, you were in the police station. When was that?
- All right.

47
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:17,943
Today, I invited everyone over to clarify one thing.

48
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:23,408
Cindy, that thing you posted in the group chat today wasn't a "what if" kind of thing, right?

49
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:27,408
Is there solid evidence or are they just baseless rumors?

50
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:31,975
I'm not sure if it's solid evidence, but I really did see something.

51
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:34,808
I'm just not that certain.

52
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,112
We have been together for such a long time.

53
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,968
- How could I possibly deceive you?
- No. I feel like you're deceiving me.

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,176
If you're unsure, just act as if you don't know.

55
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:49,076
But I really did see something.

56
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:50,508
What on earth did you see?

57
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:51,875
Wait a moment.

58
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,843
Before you say what you saw, I want to speak first.

59
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:58,242
The president once said, "Our Jingdu Construction sells houses with love."

60
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:01,660
So if anyone messes around with romantic relationships in the company,

61
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,470
they are not suitable for the job.

62
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,342
So, when you say not suitable, do you mean being fired?

63
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,342
Of course.

64
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:10,041
Fired? Then, just pretend not to know about it.

65
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,443
Stop worrying about it, come on.

66
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:13,409
- How could we possibly not care?
- Come on.

67
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,376
So what exactly did you see?

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,176
Don't tell me your Manager Gao has a mistress.

69
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,875
It's not Manager Gao.

70
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:29,208
If it's a mistress, it must be a man involved.

71
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,442
Thank goodness it's not Xiaoyun.

72
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:36,080
All right, stop beating around the bush now, just tell us directly.

73
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,140
Who is it that you saw?

74
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:42,075
We'll call them out. Don't let them ruin the company's culture.

75
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:45,210
Do you think the president would fire himself?

76
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,476
What the heck?

77
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:48,508
What do you mean?

78
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:51,875
The president?! Who is the president's mistress?

79
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,610
You should know, right?

80
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:03,842
- The receptionist Fang Aisi.
- How could that be?

81
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,508
- That's too much.
- No way.

82
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:07,943
- That would be a May-December romance.
- The age difference is a lot.

83
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:09,043
- They have such a big age gap.
- Guys.

84
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,209
It's impossible.

85
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,308
What did you really see?

86
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:17,408
Okay, it's like this. When I was delivering things to your place,

87
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:21,176
I saw Fang Aisi enter the president's office.

88
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:24,476
And when she came out, she was empty-handed. Then a note fell out.

89
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:27,309
[Take care of your health.]
It was for "Baby".

90
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,409
Baby is all right, right?

91
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,309
Yeah, it's not like "Babe".

92
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:34,542
No, the point is, she walked directly into the president's office.

93
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,743
Whenever we deliver any documents or anything, don't we always just put them on your desk?

94
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:42,143
Going directly into the office is not very likely, right?

95
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,408
- Right?
- Something's off.

96
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,176
- Right?
- Indeed.

97
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,409
So that's how it is.

98
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,042
We don't know if that note was really for the (boss).

99
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:56,200
Or if it was something of Fang Aisi that dropped out, right?

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,608
Leave this matter to me. I'll observe, okay?

101
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:03,608
There are five people here. No sixth person can know about this.

102
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,309
Agreed.

103
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:06,676
Agreed.

104
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:09,209
Agreed.

105
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,508
- Agreed.
- I'm okay.

106
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:13,242
Good, let's go.

107
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:27,875
- Right.
- Who knew Sister Chen could drink so much?

108
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,976
We still have work tomorrow. Go home and rest early, all right?

109
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,343
Thank you, Sister Chen, for today.

110
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,843
- Thanks, Sister Chen.
- All right.

111
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,443
- Go home early.
- Remember to let me know when you get home.

112
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,575
- Okay.
- Bye!

113
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,740
- Bye!
- Be careful.

114
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,820
- Sister Chen, please get in.
- I'll go in first.

115
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,809
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

116
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:44,308
- I'll go in first. Be careful, okay?
- Okay.

117
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,676
- Be careful, bye!
- Be careful on the way.

118
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,943
- Okay.
- Bye!

119
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,810
Zhou, where is Meng Heng?

120
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,241
He said he wanted to go to the bathroom to wash his face and sober up.

121
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:56,792
Okay... What about you? Where is your car?

122
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,308
No, I walked. I live close.

123
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:00,743
- All right.
- Let me know when you get home.

124
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:01,743
- You be careful too.
- Okay.

125
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,542
- Let me know when you get home.
- Good, let me know when you get home too.

126
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,476
- Bye!
- Okay, bye!

127
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,141
Did you fight with someone inside?

128
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,676
Who hit you? I'll go talk to him.

129
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:21,542
No, just calm down.

130
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,508
This... This was from yesterday.

131
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,996
Who were you fighting with yesterday? I'll go, I'll go talk to him.

132
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:28,276
Wait a moment.

133
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:32,340
Didn't Secretary Li just mention that Zhou went to the police station, right?

134
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:34,843
It was because of me.

135
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,375
Then, you…

136
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,010
I beat up Lu Yicheng yesterday.

137
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,910
So it was because of me, huh?

138
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:53,143
I used my casserole-big fists and caught him completely off guard.

139
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:55,108
That kind of person is just asking for a beating.

140
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,976
You really are handsome with a kind heart.

141
00:07:57,976 --> 00:07:59,410
Thank you.

142
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,575
But if you saw Lu Yicheng, why didn't you tell me in advance?

143
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,176
Some people were too focused on dating

144
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:09,209
to look at the messages in the group, let alone have time for me.

145
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,743
You can send it, and I'll look at it later.

146
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,242
Oh, really?

147
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,642
I heard Lu Yicheng's statement yesterday.

148
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,876
I think there's an 80% chance that it wasn't him.

149
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,208
How is that possible?

150
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,276
Seriously, if a person is going to lie, they can make up any excuse.

151
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:27,208
Men can't swear an oath with a physiological response.

152
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:33,243
I swear, if it were me, then I wouldn't be able to hold my head high for the rest of my life.

153
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,475
He was bragging to friends about the rumors he'd heard.

154
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,041
Let me tell you! I heard she's been demoted to a secretary.

155
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,643
- Really?
- Really?

156
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:42,041
It's true.

157
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,308
Instead of boasting about what he did.

158
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,041
So I don't think it was him.

159
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:51,841
Then if it wasn't Lu Yicheng who framed me. Who the heck could it be?

160
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:00,908
- It's him.
- It's him.

161
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,209
The sales department is really strong.

162
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,342
Besides the sales cases you have in hand,

163
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:11,709
there's also the Bosheng and our Jingdu Construction's sustainable housing project.

164
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,170
And coming up, several plots of land owned by Changyi Assets

165
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,300
have also been specifically appointed to you all.

166
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,576
Being busy is a given.

167
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:20,942
However, our sales department is a performance-based unit.

168
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,710
So the bonuses won't be short, I guarantee it.

169
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,110
- Thank you, Manager.
- Yes.

170
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,009
Since Manager Gao has already talked about the money distribution.

171
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,409
Then, of course, snacks and drinks should not be missed either.

172
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,575
Thank you, Vice President.

173
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,009
Afternoon tea is our salvation.

174
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,643
Hearing you say that puts me at ease.

175
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,876
Pressure brings motivation.

176
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:45,643
Vice President, I will work hard to put pressure on everyone.

177
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:48,475
Supervisor Xu, it's important to relax appropriately.

178
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:50,775
Don't put too much pressure on everyone.

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,443
Zhou, quickly attend to everyone.

180
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:55,276
Everyone, please help yourselves, don't be shy.

181
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:56,708
Thank you, Vice President.

182
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,608
This is a latte and this is an Americano. There is black tea.

183
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,443
- This is an egg tart.
- I'd like a latte.

184
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,376
- Chen Han, a latte.
- A latte.

185
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,736
- Would you like some egg tarts?
- Bring it to me.

186
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,328
- I'm getting a box.
- Here are the egg tarts for you.

187
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,352
- Egg tart.
- Egg tart.

188
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,364
Try to eat as much as you can.

189
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:12,376
- All right.
- Is this the original flavor?

190
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,840
I really can't figure it out.

191
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,310
Han Xinzheng has no reason to frame you.

192
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,543
Your businesses doesn't overlap.

193
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:31,276
What about positions? He's above, and you're below.

194
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:33,542
What exactly is he framing you for?

195
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,810
I'd like to know, too.

196
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,650
I used to admire him so much,

197
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,940
thinking he was the most magnanimous and visionary leader.

198
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:43,643
Why?

199
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,343
Actually, I've thought about it for a long time.

200
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,141
There's only one possibility.

201
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,608
What?

202
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:54,400
What is it?

203
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:00,176
He just simply dislikes you and doesn't want you to become a manager.

204
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:03,842
After all, you have poor social skills and a sour face.

205
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:06,843
Meng Heng, can you even hold a conversation?

206
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,576
What do you mean "simply dislikes"? That's too much.

207
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,375
Seriously.

208
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:14,643
But that possibility does exist.

209
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,240
Right?

210
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,741
- Do you want me to pour water for you?
- No.

211
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,176
Why did Changyi Assets specifically ask for me?

212
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,475
That's because your work ability has been recognized.

213
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,810
If that is really so,

214
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,975
why didn't they approach me directly instead of going through you?

215
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,175
A few days ago, while socializing,

216
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:53,276
we talked about these cases.

217
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:56,076
What's wrong? It's not good going through me?

218
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,343
No, it just feels coincidental.

219
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:07,208
In our line of work, many cases come in through drinking.

220
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,275
And it doesn't matter who gets the offer.

221
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:13,542
What's important is that you can take on this case.

222
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,980
What's wrong?

223
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,880
Are you feeling unwell?

224
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,508
My heart aches.

225
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:33,008
I thought you would thank me for getting these cases.

226
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,608
Turns out I was reading too much into it.

227
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,443
Okay, I'm sorry.

228
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,775
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

229
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:46,809
With what just happened with Mr. Xi,

230
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,876
I'm really afraid that being discovered will affect you.

231
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,543
I promise you.

232
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:02,176
I absolutely won't agree to such a thing again. Okay?

233
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:08,941
Don't worry, I will achieve things with my own abilities.

234
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:12,075
I will make achievements and not let you down.

235
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:16,409
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

236
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,709
Remember, I will always be with you.

237
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,810
Tonight, let me book your favorite restaurant to celebrate.

238
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,230
Another day perhaps.

239
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,440
You just got me this project.

240
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,975
I must also work hard to do some homework on it, right?

241
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:38,175
So… tonight I'll just go home on my own, obediently.

242
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,742
Good boy.

243
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,343
This one dries faster.

244
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,348
Give it a try.

245
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:51,508
- It seems so, yeah.
- Isn't it?

246
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,604
If you like it, keep it.

247
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:56,009
- Really?
- Of course you can.

248
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,376
This is a promotional gift from our exhibition center.

249
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:01,276
I've got plenty more over there, give it a try.

250
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,543
And it's foldable, too.

251
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,292
You can put it in your designer bag.

252
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,241
- It's very convenient.
- This is really convenient.

253
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:09,910
Yeah, and it's pink. It's super suitable for you.

254
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,775
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

255
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,075
I just went to buy that drink.

256
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:15,443
They've released this new product, Tremella Flower Brew.

257
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:17,275
They say it's good for skincare.

258
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,575
I specially bought a can for you.

259
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,141
Skincare? I really need that.

260
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:24,842
You're already beautiful, and this is just maintenance.

261
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,442
- Thank you.
- It's so pretty.

262
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:30,010
- So pretty.
- Why are you all so nice?

263
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,308
[Jingdu Construction Organization]
You guys are here, too.

264
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:35,809
Aisi, do you know there is a very famous makeup brand?

265
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,908
- I know, it's the one many influencers haven't introduced, very popular.
- Right!

266
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,876
I'm telling you I have a friend who works there.

267
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,308
She can give us an employee discount.

268
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:44,308
And she can also get us the latest products.

269
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:45,743
Let's go shopping together next time.

270
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:47,241
- Sure!
- Let's go together.

271
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,008
- Let's go.
- I didn't invite you.

272
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,542
Why are you all so nice to me?

273
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,440
I've been working here for so long. It's the first time I feel like I've made friends.

274
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,209
- Thank you all.
- You're welcome.

275
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:57,075
- Why would you say that?
- Right.

276
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:59,241
We are all your good colleagues and friends.

277
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:03,043
If you want to chat in the future, you can always come to me.

278
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:04,642
And me.

279
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:05,876
And me, too.

280
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,136
Okay.

281
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:08,176
Let's do it together.

282
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,441
Really beautiful.

283
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:13,708
- Really? Thanks.
- Yes.

284
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,741
So beautiful.

285
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:23,041
[Taoyuan]
The company's sustainable home has three key points.

286
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,009
Firstly, Livable Taoyuan.

287
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,876
It's about making clients who move from Taipei and New Taipei

288
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,876
feel relaxed as soon as they get home.

289
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,543
Next page.

290
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,475
Secondly, smart technology.

291
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,141
Emphasizing smart homes.

292
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:38,275
After a long day at work,

293
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:41,809
we can enjoy the comfort of smart home technologies.

294
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,342
Thirdly…

295
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,310
Excuse me, I have to take a call.

296
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:52,476
Hello?

297
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,875
What? I know.

298
00:15:57,642 --> 00:16:00,309
Cai, I'm leaving the meeting to you. I have something to attend to and must leave first.

299
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,809
Please continue the meeting.

300
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,710
Director Zhang still has some matters to deal with.

301
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,376
Then let's continue with the meeting.

302
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:07,442
- Amy.
- Director.

303
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:08,743
How did Yiyi disappear?

304
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:11,209
I'm sorry, just now Yiyi wanted juice.

305
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,009
And then I asked her to wait at the entrance of the convenience store.

306
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,208
But when I turned around, she was gone.

307
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,408
How do you look after children?

308
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,276
I'm sorry, Director.

309
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:22,041
You, go to the store first and see if there's a surveillance camera.

310
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,376
- I'll call the police first.
- Okay.

311
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,310
- Go quickly.
- Okay.

312
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,476
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,142
Excuse me, have you seen this little girl?

314
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,710
Sir, I'm sorry.

315
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,176
Excuse me, have you seen this little girl?

316
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:36,342
- No, I haven't.
- Are you sure?

317
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:37,543
No, I haven't seen her.

318
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,709
Son, have you seen it?

319
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:42,241
Miss, excuse me, can I ask,

320
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:44,209
have you seen this little girl?

321
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,110
- No, I haven't.
- Order delivery to my home.

322
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:51,175
I need to think it over properly. Why does Vice President Han treat me this way?

323
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,942
Yes, you should really think it over.

324
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:59,342
Do you see a little girl over there?

325
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,876
Yes, what about her?

326
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:07,509
Should I not see her?

327
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,109
Is she the little girl in red?

328
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,109
No, no, that's not it.

329
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,475
She is the daughter of Zhang Shiping.

330
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,276
She is the daughter of Zhang Shiping?

331
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,408
That's right.

332
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,709
What is she doing here all by herself?

333
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,076
She must have come to find me.

334
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,875
Hello, Cindy. I have an emergency, I'll call you back.

335
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,096
Are you looking for Yiyi?

336
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:30,075
How do you know?

337
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:32,443
She got lost when the nanny went out to buy things.

338
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:34,742
I don't know if she was kidnapped or not. I've already called the police.

339
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:37,242
She's downstairs at my company.

340
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,276
Why would she go looking for you?

341
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,876
I think she came to find me on purpose.

342
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,442
On purpose?

343
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:47,776
Then, is she all right?

344
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,976
I will go to pick her up right now.

345
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,109
She looks quite fine.

346
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,442
But, Shiping, since she has come to find me,

347
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:01,610
I think, let me spend some time alone with her.

348
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,876
I will send her back later.

349
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:07,242
Are you worried that I can't handle her?

350
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:09,575
If I really can't handle her, that's fine too.

351
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:12,475
That way we won't waste each other's time.

352
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,675
Okay, but let me talk to her first. Okay?

353
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,775
Okay.

354
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,308
Let's go.

355
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,708
Okay.

356
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,476
Yiyi.

357
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,242
Looking for me?

358
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:45,141
Report to your daddy first that you're safe.

359
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,076
He's very worried about you.

360
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,843
Hello, Daddy.

361
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:57,443
I just wanted to find Auntie Cindy.

362
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,109
I understand.

363
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,576
Daddy, goodbye.

364
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,009
What do you need me for?

365
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,075
Auntie Cindy, can I ask you out for a meal?

366
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:12,509
Of course.

367
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,876
But if you want to come see me alone in the future,

368
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,942
you must first make it clear to your daddy.

369
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:19,075
And you must call to make an appointment with me.

370
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,042
Auntie Cindy, but my daddy often says

371
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:27,943
that "victory comes from the element of surprise"…

372
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:32,842
You're a little girl who can't even finish an idiom.

373
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:35,575
And you're actually planning to make a move?

374
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,209
Dear, I think this little girl is not easy to deal with.

375
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:41,376
No matter how difficult she is, she has taken the initiative.

376
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:43,843
How can I, Cindy Wang, back down?

377
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:46,248
But have you thought of how to handle her tactics?

378
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,343
Of course not. I've been thinking about Vice President Han all day.

379
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:53,276
She came running over with a surprise victory.

380
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:57,376
If you can't eat with me,

381
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,509
I'll have to leave.

382
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,542
Of course, I'll eat with you.

383
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:05,475
But since you are the guest and I am the host,

384
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:10,009
I'll decide what to eat. Okay?

385
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:19,008
It's come to this.

386
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:23,142
You even bought clothes and these pants specifically for the competition.

387
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:26,642
And even the kids have changed.

388
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,710
No need for idle talk.

389
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,475
One minute of warm-up, then the game begins.

390
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,008
As long as you meet with me three times,

391
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:39,676
we will definitely become good friends.

392
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,809
It's okay, you don't need to waste your time.

393
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,476
As long as I don't like you, my daddy won't like you.

394
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:54,576
I'm telling you. One-on-one like this is not fun.

395
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,443
I'll get you a little helper.

396
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,132
Who is it?

397
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:03,524
- Meng Heng, don't you have to drive today?
- No, I don't.

398
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:05,209
I came with him to keep you and Yiyi company.

399
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,209
- That's right.
- Okay.

400
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:07,309
Then we two will be a team.

401
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,443
- Okay.
- You two are a team.

402
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,808
No way! That way we'll definitely lose…

403
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,075
No, I'm with you.

404
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,475
He's with her.

405
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,376
I'm with her?

406
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,109
Do you know how to play soccer?

407
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:29,241
You just have to kick it into that hole.

408
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:30,508
Can you?

409
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:32,610
Of course I can, I've even watched soccer.

410
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,641
Good luck.

411
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,742
[Cin & Mi Team player No.1 Wang Cunfeng]
She's just a little girl.

412
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,776
How could I possibly lose?

413
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,242
[Meng & Yi Team player No.1 Meng Heng]
A serious woman is truly beautiful.

414
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:45,142
I must perform well.

415
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:47,848
[Cin & Mi Team Player No. 2 Chen Duomi]
What about the dinner we agreed on?

416
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,742
[Meng & Yi Team player No.2 Yiyi]
I don't care what you adults are going to do.

417
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,176
My daddy is mine.

418
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:58,176
Ready, go.

419
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,076
Yiyi.

420
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,508
Hurry up.

421
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,088
[Cin & Mi Team 0 VS Meng & Yi Team 1]

422
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,975
Chase.

423
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,509
Be careful.

424
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,688
[Cin & Mi Team 2 VS Meng & Yi Team 1]

425
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,241
- Two points
- Didn't you say you could play soccer?

426
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,710
- I did.
- Come on.

427
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,008
Too fast.

428
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:36,042
Yiyi, are you okay?

429
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:38,642
[Cin & Mi Team 5 VS Meng & Yi Team 1]
It's not fair, he doesn't know how to play.

430
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,209
And he doesn't pass the ball to me.

431
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,609
I'm the one scoring all the points!

432
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:44,308
Find a game we can win.

433
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:46,009
Split into two teams.

434
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,009
So, our first runner starts from here.

435
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:50,443
After sliding down, high-five and switch to the next person.

436
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:51,820
Go on the green, run-run-run.

437
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,444
Run to this side, get down. Let's head to the finish line.

438
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:55,476
Good, keep it up.

439
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:57,342
You have to come out for it to count.

440
00:22:58,487 --> 00:23:01,712
♫ Heartbeat is a bit loud ♫

441
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:04,912
♫ Footsteps should be quiet ♫

442
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:08,356
♫ Finding a chance to plant the seeds ♫

443
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:11,048
[Cin & Mi Team 5 VS Meng & Yi Team 5]

444
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:15,072
[Cin & Mi Team 5 VS Meng & Yi Team 6]

445
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,068
[Cin & Mi Team 7 VS Meng & Yi Team 6]

446
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,308
We won.

447
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:28,042
We won, didn't we?

448
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:32,741
Do you feel like playing again?

449
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:03,276
I told you to let the kid win.

450
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:07,008
Look at her now, she seems so glum.

451
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:09,075
Don't talk about winning over.

452
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:12,042
She must dislike you even more now.

453
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,410
Hey.

454
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,443
Whether she dislikes me more now or not,

455
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:22,942
I'm sure she'll want to see me again.

456
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,241
Next time, you can't just run away without saying a word.

457
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,008
Daddy will worry, you know?

458
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:53,343
And if you want to see her, just tell me.

459
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:55,575
I will take you.

460
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:59,243
But I don't want to be a third wheel.

461
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,120
Have you had dinner yet?

462
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,140
Or shall I treat everyone to dinner?

463
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:11,609
Consider it a thank you for bringing Yiyi back.

464
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:15,508
Sure. But Director Zhang, you and Cindy can just go and eat.

465
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:19,642
I have plans with Meng Heng. We'll go eat together later.

466
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,709
I?

467
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:25,442
If needed, Yiyi can also join us.

468
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,242
Yiyi, do you like Mcdonald's?

469
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:33,475
We obviously had already eaten. Why eat again?

470
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:35,610
We had a simple dinner before we came back.

471
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,642
She was very active today, so she ate a lot.

472
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,475
She should not be hungry now.

473
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:42,042
So, where did you go just now?

474
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,930
I think it's not fair.

475
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,676
He is your friend.

476
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:50,042
And he's not very good at playing.

477
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:53,209
He caused our team to lose.

478
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:56,509
Little girl, what are you talking about?

479
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:58,609
I don't care, I want to compete again.

480
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:01,841
But I want to be on the same team as my daddy.

481
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:13,742
I didn't expect Yiyi to be just like you said.

482
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:15,530
She wants to go out with you again.

483
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,510
You're amazing.

484
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,209
This move of mine is called "retreating to advance".

485
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:24,075
Everyone thinks you have to go along with the children when playing.

486
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:27,042
I refuse, and I want to win against her.

487
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,443
I want to provoke her competitive spirit.

488
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:33,008
Turns out kids can have such a strong desire to win.

489
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,642
Especially for her, I'm the villain who's going to steal her daddy.

490
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:39,109
That makes sense.

491
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:47,243
Kids are actually like that. They really need companionship.

492
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:49,376
She must not have had someone accompany her like this in a long time.

493
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:52,442
I think she would want to meet again.

494
00:26:58,943 --> 00:27:01,709
It's from Director Zhang. I'm going to take this.

495
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,342
Go ahead.

496
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:08,876
Hello?

497
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:18,042
Thank you so much for today.

498
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:21,142
I haven't seen Yiyi this excited in a long time.

499
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:23,508
She keeps talking about your competition.

500
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:28,109
And she keeps telling me to practice well, to not hold her back.

501
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:30,441
She really wants to win.

502
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,675
Yes, did you know?

503
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:35,675
She even warned me that if I caused her to lose,

504
00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:38,542
I'd not be allowed to give her a goodnight kiss for three days.

505
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,843
I guess I have to be serious.

506
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,241
Then, if you, father and daughter, team up,

507
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:46,642
and I lose in the end, aren't you afraid I'll be sad?

508
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:50,309
Well, I…

509
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,643
You can treat me to a meal to comfort me.

510
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:56,809
Then I will definitely give it my all

511
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,076
to fight for the opportunity to have a meal with you.

512
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:07,375
I thought that ice cream shop we went to last time was pretty good.

513
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,575
She's leaving us hanging here while she talks on the phone.

514
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:11,875
Is this a proper way to treat guests?

515
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,060
Don't go.

516
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,640
They're pouring out their hearts, you know?

517
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,308
You've never been in a relationship, have you?

I just want to remind you don't just focus on your relationship.

Quickly think about why Vice President Han is treating you this way.

We don't need to waste time analyzing Vice President Han's intentions.

539
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:52,443
The most efficient and direct way is to ask him in person.

540
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,009
I think that's too impulsive. It might just tip him off.

I think the most efficient way for a double-kill

is to find Lu Yicheng

543
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:02,542

he changed his phone number as soon as he left the job.

Look at Fang Iris, doing her nails all day, dressing herself up beautifully.

If the president is someone who is mature and abstinent,

683
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:35,176
how can Fang Aisi seduce him?

684
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,309
You're too naive.

685
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:38,942
It's not a question of whether I'm naive or not.

686
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:39,976
We are not the parties involved.

You don't know how scheming young girls can be nowadays.

689
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,650
I don't know about others.

690
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,008
But I believe Fang Aisi is not that kind of person.

00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:55,230
You know so little. I can't bother to explain.

692
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,970
I'm off to work.

693
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:09,976
Crazy.

694
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:13,747
[Jingdu Construction Organization]

695
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:25,876
When… When did you come back?

696
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,709
I've been here all along.

697
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:37,975
So you heard everything.

698
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:44,380
Well, you know… Everyone can talk.

699
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,909
We can't control it. Don't overthink it.

700
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:52,075
I thought they sincerely considered me as a friend.

701
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:54,410
It seems I misunderstood.

702
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,976
No way, you…

703
00:38:57,976 --> 00:39:00,275
This is a good opportunity to see some people's true colors.

704
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:03,175
It's not a bad thing, consider it a gain.

705
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,509
Okay, please, please don't cry.

706
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:09,909
Come on, it's okay.

707
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,675
Wipe your tears first.

708
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,090
All right, don't be sad.

709
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,170
I can be your friend.

710
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:21,676
The kind of friend with no ulterior motives.

711
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:29,976
Here, eat this.

712
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:33,309
And all of this was prepared by Sister Xiaoting just for you.

713
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,909
There are still people who will be very good to you.

714
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,376
Don't be so sad.

♫ Be carefree like a child ♫

716
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,742
Xiaoting, you've been staring at the manager's office for a long time.

717
00:39:59,742 --> 00:40:01,610
Did something happen?

718
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,941
I wasn't staring at the manager's office.

719
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:08,009
I was meditating just now.

720
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:11,776
You know? Meditation can relieve anxiety,

721
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,543
maintain mindfulness, and increase confidence.

722
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:18,609
But, wait, I remember people usually close their eyes when they meditate.

723
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,809
You don't know. This is the latest method.

724
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,142
Ssiter Yazi,

725
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:32,476
I have some good news for you.

726
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:35,109
Didn't you say last time

727
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:38,375
that your mother-in-law wanted to watch Chen Yalan's Taiwanese opera?

728
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,375
Yes, the tickets were snapped up instantly.

729
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:44,409
Right, I heard the tickets were sold out in seconds.

730
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,941
So I begged and pleaded with my friend to give me the tickets.

731
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:50,876
She just called to say it's okay.

732
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:53,109
You can take your mother-in-law now.

733
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:56,742
Do you want to sell the tickets to me?

734
00:40:56,742 --> 00:41:00,575
Not sell, give.

735
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,276
Really? For real?

736
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:06,008
Yeah. I was planning to surprise you with them.

737
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,509
Thank you.

738
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,643
Don't mention it, as long as you're happy.

739
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:10,842
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'll go back first.

740
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,008
- Go ahead with your work.
- Okay.

741
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,742
Everyone, I have an important announcement to make.

742
00:41:24,742 --> 00:41:26,809
Due to the increase in our workload recently,

743
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:29,676
we have made some reallocations in our work.

744
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:31,476
I just discussed it with the manager.

745
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:35,404
The new case we took on, Changyi Assets, will be handled by me,

746
00:41:35,404 --> 00:41:38,168
[Changyi Assets… Chen Han, Lin Yingjun]
[Shanshui Development… Zhang Xiaoting, Guo Shijie]

747
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:43,675
along with Chen Han and Zhang Xiaoting.

748
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,041
As for the follow-up on the Shanshui Development project,

749
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:47,909
it will be undertaken by Guo and Brother Yingjun,

750
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:50,376
under the direction of our manager.

751
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,709
All right, go back to work.

752
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,643
How thirsty are you?

753
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:15,476
Brother Yingjun, I'm not thirsty. I'm disgusted.

754
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:17,476
What did Xu Yazi say today?

755
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:19,176
That the two of us are older, experienced,

756
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:21,242
so the follow-up mess of that Shanshui Development project

757
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,475
is for us to deal with.

758
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,642
This makes us mere errand runners.

759
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:27,509
Look, she is simply an ageist.

760
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:29,341
This is workplace harassment.

761
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,542
Try to see it from a broader perspective.

762
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,109
Xu Yazi has just been promoted to supervisor.

763
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:34,810
Naturally, she would want a case like Changyi Assets

764
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,342
where she can be responsible from the beginning to the end,

765
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:38,609
a case that's representative. Right?

766
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:40,775
So why are Xiaoting and Chen Han appointed?

767
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:43,042
Usually, it's pairing a less experienced person with a more experienced one.

768
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,209
Okay, let me ask you.

769
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:49,343
Among you, Chen Han, and Xiaoting, which two are easier to instruct?

770
00:42:51,908 --> 00:42:55,542
Exactly, Xu Yazi is burning the candle at both ends with work and family.

771
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,208
Of course, she chooses the ones who are easier to command.

772
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:00,741
Please, she's so astute.

773
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:03,709
But I still feel it's very unfair.

774
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,242
Brother, let me tell you.

775
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:14,575
We just obediently follow orders and work, receiving our salary every month.

776
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:17,276
That's enough, you know?

777
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:24,110
But when will this lead to a promotion?

778
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,140
Okay, stop drinking so much by yourself.

779
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,810
How pitiful. Come on, let's drink together.

780
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:38,708
I think I can somewhat empathize now with Cindy Wang's feelings back then.

781
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:43,508
No matter how hard you try, it's not the same as having luck on your side.

782
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:46,042
Want to change your luck, huh?

783
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:49,143
I will buy you a crystal cave another day.

784
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:52,376
Crystal cave?

785
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:54,175
It's very effective, you know.

786
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:56,443
Then I'll thank you in advance, brother.

787
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:57,536
No need to thank me.

788
00:43:57,536 --> 00:43:58,642
Crystal cave.

789
00:43:58,642 --> 00:44:01,443
Remember me when you make it big.

790
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:04,142
If the crystal cave works, I wouldn't be here anymore.

791
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,844
Don't underestimate the power of the crystal cave, I'm telling you.

792
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:10,008
I made my money on that stock thanks to it.

793
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:14,542
Xiaoyun.

794
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:18,509
Manager Gao, what brings you here?

795
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:41,896
[Patience rounds things out

00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:44,875
[Next Episode]
I think Fang Aisi is very pretty.

797
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,208
You should pursue her.

798
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:52,043
I met you at my best time.

799
00:44:52,043 --> 00:44:55,608
I am Secretary Li from the planning department.

800
00:44:55,608 --> 00:44:59,243
The President and Fang Aisi have officially announced it.

801
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:01,176
Does the boss know you're pursuing me?

802
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,542
What do you take me for?

803
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,708
I am truly disappointed.

804
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,609
I will keep this matter a secret.

805
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,542
I ran into Lu Yicheng earlier

806
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:12,543
