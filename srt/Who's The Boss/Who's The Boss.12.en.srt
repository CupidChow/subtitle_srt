Here, you finished your bath.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:19.639
Hurry up and go to sleep.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.305
That way, you won't
have trouble getting up tomorrow.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:22.372
Daddy.

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:24.539
Close your eyes like this, okay?

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.873
There's a surprise.

00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:28.738
Yes, my little princess.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:30.171
I'll count to three.

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.939
Then you open your eyes, okay?

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.106
Okay.

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:35.571
One, two, three.

00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:37.606
Look.

00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:40.338
I love Daddy.

00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:44.005
I love you too.

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:47.772
Is it pretty? I chose it with Aunt Cindy.

00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:49.539
Of course, it's beautiful.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:50.639
Like this, Daddy.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.372
I want to hold your little hand every day.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.171
But when it's time to sleep,
you still have to sleep.

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:59.472
That way, you can have sweet dreams at night.

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:04.271
What's wrong?

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:07.338
Daddy, can you not see

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:09.672
Aunt Cindy anymore?

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:12.571
Were you unhappy playing today?

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.038
Don't you like her?

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:17.506
Didn't you say you wanted
to compete with her again?

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:20.771
I don't dislike Aunt Cindy.

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.038
Then…

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:24.806
Why should I

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.172
stop seeing Aunt Cindy anymore?

00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:30.806
Because if I become good friends with her,

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:31.872
then what am I supposed to do

00:02:31.872 --> 00:02:34.372
when you two have a fight?

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.939
Just like Anderson in our class.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.204
When he had a fight with Elsa,

00:02:39.204 --> 00:02:42.739
Anderson wouldn't let me play with Elsa.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.271
But I still want to play with Elsa.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.972
So, you're worried

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:53.239
that if Daddy and Aunt Cindy

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.771
have a fight,

00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:57.439
then you won't be able
to play with her anymore.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.972
About this issue,

00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:11.372
I might need to talk with you for a long time.

00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:12.806
But let's go to sleep first.

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.338
Let Daddy think it over.

00:03:14.338 --> 00:03:15.372
Okay.

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:18.672
Good girl.

00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.506
Quickly go to sleep.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:23.972
Do you want to hug the teddy bear?

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:39.872
Yun.

00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:41.139
Zhou.

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.672
- Zhou.
- Zhou.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:44.239
Who is Yun really dating?

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.872
- No, Zhou.
- Zhou.

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.204
Yun.

00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:49.139
Don't sleep here.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.204
- Right.
- Wake up.

00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:53.605
Look at me, don't sleep here, okay?

00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:55.372
- Your hand is so cold.
- Get up.

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:57.338
No.

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.006
- Yun.
- No.

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:06.639
Yun, I am sincere towards you.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.038
- Fine, you are sincere
- Yun, I'm so cute.

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.438
Why don't you like me?

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:13.739
Okay, you're very cute.

00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:19.572
He can't breathe.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.339
Zhou.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.805
Zhou, wake up.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:25.404
- Who is she dating, Zhou?
- Yun.

00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:26.771
Don't fall asleep at the most

00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.771
- critical moment, okay?
- Yun.

00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:30.438
Zhou.

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:31.538
Alright.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.006
Not sleeping.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:36.038
I'm now asking you two.

00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:37.771
What do you want to ask?

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:38.873
Come, buzz in.

00:04:38.873 --> 00:04:40.438
- Who is Yun dating?
- No, that's not it.

00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:41.705
Raise your hand to buzz in.

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:44.171
- I'll go.
- Go ahead, ask.

00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.372
Who is Yun dating?

00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:49.438
You are very gossipy.

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:51.472
It's okay.

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:54.572
I'm Secretary Zhou.

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:58.506
I have very strong professional ethics.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.372
I won't tell you anything.

00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:03.538
Next, whose turn is it?

00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:04.606
Your turn to ask.

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.538
Don't be foolish, okay?

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:07.771
Foolish.

00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:08.771
I'm just that foolish.

00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:11.072
That's why I've had a crush on her
for so many years.

00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:13.438
You're good, yes, you're great.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.106
- Meng Heng.
- You call me foolish.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.404
- I know who it is now.
- Who?

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:18.538
Yun.

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:23.438
It's really Han Xinzheng.

00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:28.506
That way, his motive
for harming you makes sense.

00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:32.805
Because of love.

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:35.805
So, he resorted to any means to help
Gao Shuangyun rise to the top.

00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:38.006
Why does it feel a bit romantic?

00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:41.839
Romantic my foot!

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.239
He doesn't even know if he's divorced or not.

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:45.905
How do you know he's a hopeless romantic?

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:47.339
I think right now

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.006
we should quickly find Lu Yicheng.

00:05:49.006 --> 00:05:50.839
They must be confronted.

00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:54.271
But I've staked out his house several times,

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.538
and haven't seen anyone.

00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:57.038
Could he have been scared away?

00:05:57.038 --> 00:05:58.639
It's possible.

00:06:00.873 --> 00:06:04.205
But he made Gao Shuangyun the manager.

00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:06.606
There must be some reason why it had to be her.

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:11.472
I feel that this matter

00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:13.506
should be handled separately.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.671
Okay.

00:06:22.973 --> 00:06:24.304
Come in.

00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:27.705
There's really a lot going on at school.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:29.438
Come on in.

00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:30.771
What's up?

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.973
Miss Gao, I…

00:06:32.973 --> 00:06:35.205
You talk about your own matters.

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:38.205
Sorry, Miss Gao.

00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:40.006
The school asked us to hand in assignments.

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:41.171
So,

00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:43.438
I don't know if I can ask you

00:06:43.438 --> 00:06:45.839
for the data that has already been completed.

00:06:49.873 --> 00:06:51.139
The school gives out more assignments

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.038
to enhance the experience of young people.

00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:55.438
Okay.

00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:57.304
So, you agree?

00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:04.705
Then could you authorize Cindy?

00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:06.171
Since she's more experienced,

00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.538
I was hoping she could help me with the data.

00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:11.438
Can't you do your own work?

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:14.938
Cindy.

00:07:14.938 --> 00:07:16.739
You help him out.

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:18.938
Leave a good reputation for the company.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.271
It will make recruiting newcomers smoother
in the future.

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:24.705
You're so wise.

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:27.006
Flattering.

00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:28.472
By the way, Meng Heng,

00:07:28.472 --> 00:07:29.805
you have to work hard.

00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:31.239
Do it well.

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:34.205
I hope you can impress your professor.

00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:35.271
No problem.

00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.372
I won't let you down.

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:40.139
- Go on with your work.
- Okay.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.606
Thank you, Miss Gao.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:42.771
Thank you, Miss Gao.

00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:45.572
Go, what are you doing?

00:07:45.572 --> 00:07:46.839
Thank you, Miss Gao.

00:07:48.205 --> 00:07:50.139
You want me to open
the door for you, don't you?

00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:57.771
<i>[Jingdu Cambridge Unit Price Analysis Budget]</i>
The business department had no manager.

00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:00.771
All approvals and amounts
had to go through Vice President Han.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.106
What we need to do now

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:04.106
is to check the information
sent out by the business department

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:06.139
against the final information
received by the accounting department,

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.873
and see if there are any discrepancies.

00:08:07.873 --> 00:08:09.024
Okay.

00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:11.171
It feels so thrilling.

00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:13.671
Can you be more serious?

00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:15.339
Point out all the suspicious places.

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:16.404
Do you understand?

00:08:16.404 --> 00:08:18.072
Yes, Sir.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.706
Why are you all here
at the accounting department?

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:32.039
You get along well, huh?

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.539
We're helping Meng Heng with his assignment.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.605
Right, I need to rush
that report for submission.

00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:38.706
I see.

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:39.906
Doing the assignment

00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:41.672
so far away?

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:44.438
- We're not.
- We're not.

00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.172
But our hearts are close to each other.

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:47.738
You came looking for me, right?

00:08:47.738 --> 00:08:49.006
Come on, let's talk outside.

00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:50.571
Well, Meng Heng's assignment is a bit rushed.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.639
Let's not disturb him.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:53.839
He's not very focused.

00:08:55.271 --> 00:08:57.339
Let's go outside to talk, come on.

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:02.204
Come on, talk here.

00:09:02.204 --> 00:09:03.204
What's the matter?

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:06.805
I thought you would disdain this kind of thing.

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:08.873
I didn't expect you to come around as well.

00:09:08.873 --> 00:09:11.305
Helping Meng Heng with the assignment.

00:09:11.305 --> 00:09:12.972
Not bad.

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:15.172
You also know that Mr. Cai cherishes Fang Iris.

00:09:15.172 --> 00:09:17.073
And Fang Iris likes Meng Heng.

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:18.771
You are just totally

00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:20.172
brown-nosing indirectly.

00:09:20.172 --> 00:09:22.972
I never thought of it this way.

00:09:23.672 --> 00:09:25.839
You must have something
to look for me for, right?

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:28.139
Yes, the Yongxu Residence case.

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:29.172
Manager Wu asked,

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:30.771
when your department is available

00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:31.906
to schedule a meeting.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:33.873
Okay, I'll share the progress with you
as soon as possible.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.204
Once we are ready,

00:09:35.204 --> 00:09:36.972
we'll arrange in the group.

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:38.472
Okay, sounds good.

00:09:38.472 --> 00:09:41.605
I really wish we had
a Meng Heng in our department too,

00:09:41.605 --> 00:09:44.339
Otherwise, let's transfer him
to our department,

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:47.371
How about that?

00:09:57.073 --> 00:09:58.105
Shall we go together?

00:09:58.105 --> 00:09:59.238
Or should I wait for you?

00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:00.371
Together of course.

00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:03.339
As a director, of course I need
to know the proposal you're making

00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:06.339
This is the follow-up
for the Landscape Development.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.339
I've prepared two directions

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:08.771
for Yun to choose from.

00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:10.371
That's not okay.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:12.371
Yun is already swamped as it is.

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:14.073
And you're giving her two options.

00:10:14.073 --> 00:10:16.073
Like this, she'll have difficulty choosing.

00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:18.339
It's too much information.

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:19.672
In that case.

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:21.006
Come, let me take a look.

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:23.839
Okay then.

00:10:36.738 --> 00:10:39.271
I think your Plan B is pretty good.

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:42.571
Using our previously hot-selling
Future City as a template.

00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:44.438
Highlighting the first row of lake views

00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:46.506
to recreate bestsellers.

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:50.006
But I think Plan A could perfectly combine

00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:52.404
with the current construction project
in C Area of Taoyuan Middle Road,

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:54.271
and then create a special district landmark

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:56.738
along with five-star
property management services.

00:10:56.738 --> 00:10:58.271
Perhaps even more newsworthy.

00:10:58.271 --> 00:10:59.873
Guo.

00:10:59.873 --> 00:11:01.906
Landscape Development is the project
Yun managed

00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:03.271
s she became the manager.

00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:04.605
Regardless of how topical it is,

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:07.271
it's not as good as quickly
selling out the houses.

00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:10.139
Selling out the houses is the ultimate goal.

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:13.438
True.

00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:14.672
Alright, thanks.

00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:16.404
Let's cheer each other on,
we're in the same team.

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:22.805
Yun.

00:11:24.873 --> 00:11:26.571
Hold on.

00:11:27.305 --> 00:11:29.271
Something's off here.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.204
The numbers don't match, look.

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:33.506
Here.

00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:34.605
Right.

00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:37.172
And the amount Vice President Han reported

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:38.771
is clearly over by twenty to thirty percent.

00:11:42.371 --> 00:11:44.972
That's way too much of a difference, isn't it?

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:47.139
So, where has all this money gone?

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:49.605
It probably went right into his own pocket.

00:11:52.204 --> 00:11:53.506
That's outrageous.

00:11:53.506 --> 00:11:55.204
Where are you going?

00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:56.706
Of course, I'm going to report to Mr. Cai.

00:11:56.706 --> 00:11:58.039
That's really exaggerated.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:59.873
Wait a minute, can you not be so impulsive?

00:11:59.873 --> 00:12:02.039
We should find the other entries to proceed.

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.605
When there's one such instance,
there will be a second.

00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:06.339
Who knows how much money he's swallowed.

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:08.404
If you are going to report this to Mr. Cai,

00:12:08.404 --> 00:12:10.805
then concrete evidence is very important.

00:12:11.672 --> 00:12:13.204
Moreover,

00:12:13.204 --> 00:12:14.571
we still have the last piece of the puzzle.

00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:15.938
to be put in place yet.

00:12:20.938 --> 00:12:23.073
We really need your help.

00:12:25.472 --> 00:12:26.873
Zhou.

00:12:26.873 --> 00:12:28.906
We're just missing your final touch.

00:12:30.339 --> 00:12:32.539
Be brave, don't back down.

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:37.706
Wait a second.

00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:41.839
How can you two be sure

00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:44.873
that I'm not in the same gang
as Vice President Han?

00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:09.438
Changyi Assets is doing very well.

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:11.404
Yazi, you're very diligent.

00:13:11.404 --> 00:13:12.438
Thank you, Miss Gao.

00:13:12.438 --> 00:13:14.073
We will go all out.

00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:17.972
About the Landscape Development…

00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:21.339
Guo, let me be straight with you.

00:13:21.339 --> 00:13:24.305
Although our company's
construction projects sell well,

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.972
I always feel that…

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.105
- I know, Miss Gao.
- I…

00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:30.404
You want to think big, right?

00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:34.073
Perhaps we can combine
with the Taoyuan Zhonglu Section C project,

00:13:34.073 --> 00:13:35.371
and create a landmark in the special zone.

00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:37.371
Additionally incorporating
five-star property services.

00:13:37.371 --> 00:13:39.105
This way, it's even more newsworthy.

00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:41.271
Yazi, this idea of yours is great.

00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.506
Guo.

00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:45.339
Let's make this the focus
of our development strategy.

00:13:48.672 --> 00:13:49.972
Yazi, not bad at all.

00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:52.605
Thank you, Miss Gao. I learned it all from you.

00:14:03.938 --> 00:14:05.172
Xu Yazi.

00:14:05.172 --> 00:14:06.305
You really are exaggerated.

00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:07.771
Snatching credit to this extent.

00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:09.738
That project to create a landmark residence
in the special zone

00:14:09.738 --> 00:14:10.839
was my idea.

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:12.738
My idea.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:15.771
Didn't I tell the Miss Gao it was your idea?

00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:18.305
Sorry, I'll pay attention next time.

00:14:18.938 --> 00:14:20.639
You'll pay attention next time?

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:23.238
There's a next time? I must be a fool.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.672
Alright, don't be angry.

00:14:25.672 --> 00:14:27.706
Think on the bright side.

00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:29.605
If this proposal passes,

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:31.906
then the bonus will be yours, you know.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.873
Sorry, I just didn't notice.

00:14:35.873 --> 00:14:38.472
Otherwise, I'll treat you to a meal.

00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:40.238
I just speak too quickly.

00:14:40.238 --> 00:14:42.539
I didn't do it intentionally.

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:44.506
Alright, I have to go and get busy now.

00:14:44.506 --> 00:14:45.706
Remember to save some time for me.

00:14:45.706 --> 00:14:46.873
And if you want to eat something,

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:48.105
then remember to tell me.

00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:49.339
I'll go and make a reservation.

00:15:00.371 --> 00:15:01.371
Let me say it first.

00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:04.238
I didn't intend to eavesdrop
on your conversation.

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.738
I just happened to be passing by.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.706
I accidentally overheard it.

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:14.506
Alright, calm down.

00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:22.605
Xu Yazi has also been enduring
at the company for so long.

00:15:22.605 --> 00:15:24.139
She wants to protect her own position.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:25.805
It's understandable.

00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:27.172
It's understandable?

00:15:27.172 --> 00:15:29.006
What she's doing is unreasonable, isn't it?

00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:30.305
It was clearly my idea.

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:31.972
She claims it was hers.

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.571
Others are 'Baby,' she is a word…

00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:34.906
Despicable.

00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:39.639
Although we can't change
other people's thoughts,

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:42.472
we can change our own, right?

00:15:43.073 --> 00:15:44.139
Have you ever thought

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:45.472
that this road is no longer passable,

00:15:45.472 --> 00:15:47.571
and there are other paths to take?

00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:52.605
Are you talking about switching jobs?

00:15:54.238 --> 00:15:56.506
I've thought about it.

00:15:56.506 --> 00:15:58.839
But I don't have
any representative works right now.

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:00.271
Where could I jump to?

00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:03.472
I'm afraid that jumping
might lead to a lower position.

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:08.238
Drink a bit slower.

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:09.738
Don't choke on it.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.906
I am currently stuck in a position
neither higher nor lower.

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:16.972
Wanting to switch jobs,

00:16:16.972 --> 00:16:19.105
I certainly won't be able
to get a better salary.

00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:21.672
And all my years of service
would have to be recalculated.

00:16:21.672 --> 00:16:23.771
And I'd have to adapt
to everything all over again.

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:25.972
Why is your way of thinking so rigid?

00:16:25.972 --> 00:16:27.839
You need to be more flexible in your thinking.

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:30.371
Switching jobs doesn't necessarily mean
moving to another company.

00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:33.006
There are still many opportunities
within our company.

00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:34.339
And you really don't need to worry

00:16:34.339 --> 00:16:36.706
about your seniority being reduced.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.539
What do you mean?

00:16:39.238 --> 00:16:40.738
I'll tell you secretly.

00:16:40.738 --> 00:16:43.771
Our planning department
still hasn't found a director.

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:46.805
I personally think you're quite suitable.

00:16:48.873 --> 00:16:52.006
- Me?
- Yes, it's you.

00:16:52.006 --> 00:16:54.972
Let me tell you, even though
we're not a front-line performance unit.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.839
We have many advantages.

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.139
We're close to Mr. Cai.

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:00.939
There are many PR events.

00:17:02.171 --> 00:17:04.706
The Future City project by the construction
company will definitely be a hot seller.

00:17:04.706 --> 00:17:06.738
The landscape faces
a ten-thousand-ping lake view.

00:17:06.738 --> 00:17:08.338
Transportation extends
across sea, land, and air.

00:17:08.338 --> 00:17:10.372
Whether it's taking the high-speed rail
or flying on a plane,

00:17:10.372 --> 00:17:11.738
or getting on the highway.

00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:13.305
It's all very convenient.

00:17:13.305 --> 00:17:15.805
You guys in land development
have put a lot of heart into finding locations.

00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:18.139
Thank you, Director Zhang, for the compliment.

00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:20.505
So, Mr. Cai hopes
that our joint construction project

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.671
can take this place's internal layout
into consideration.

00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:24.106
No problem, rest assured.

00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:26.139
My cooperation with the construction company

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:29.005
will definitely be
as hot-selling as the Future City.

00:17:30.873 --> 00:17:32.005
What's the matter?

00:17:32.005 --> 00:17:33.505
What's up?

00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:36.738
Nothing, I just got a paper cut, it's fine.

00:17:36.738 --> 00:17:38.706
Why scream about a little blood?

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:39.972
I'll check if there's a first aid kit.

00:17:39.972 --> 00:17:42.404
It's okay, Miss Gao,
it's just a small wound, I'm fine.

00:17:42.404 --> 00:17:43.706
No way.

00:17:43.706 --> 00:17:45.372
A wound must be disinfected.

00:17:45.372 --> 00:17:47.039
I happen to have a medical kit with me.

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:49.439
Really, it's okay, I'm fine, Director Zhang.

00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:51.738
Just let Director Zhang take care of it.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.671
Director Zhang even carries
a first aid kit with him

00:17:56.439 --> 00:17:58.972
It's inevitable to get hurt by accident
when we enter and leave the construction site

00:17:58.972 --> 00:18:00.805
It's a precaution just in case.

00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:03.772
I never thought to bring a medical kit.

00:18:03.772 --> 00:18:05.571
Director Zhang, you're truly meticulous.

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:07.472
It's going to hurt a bit.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.671
Bear with it.

00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:15.939
Bear with it.

00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:21.439
- It's done.
- Thank you.

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:24.106
Then let's continue to the next room type.

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.606
Excuse me, where is the trash can?

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.905
Just give it to me.

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.539
Okay.

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:38.305
You're almost drooling.

00:18:38.305 --> 00:18:40.472
- Who.
- You of course, who else?

00:18:41.939 --> 00:18:43.571
Don't you think it's handsome?

00:18:43.571 --> 00:18:45.439
He's already bandaged it for you.

00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:49.472
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, it's just that

00:18:49.472 --> 00:18:51.505
Meng Heng is smitten by Director Zhang's charm.

00:18:56.372 --> 00:18:57.606
Hello, Director Zhang.

00:18:58.139 --> 00:19:00.539
I'm the secretary to Manager Wu
Tianfu of the Planning Department.

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.772
My name is Li Mi.

00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:03.838
Because our manager
is on a business trip out of town.

00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:06.972
He asked me to convey a small token
of appreciation to you.

00:19:06.972 --> 00:19:09.272
He hopes for your continued support
in the future.

00:19:10.205 --> 00:19:12.939
Then, please thank Manager Wu for me.

00:19:12.939 --> 00:19:14.939
If there is really a chance
to cooperate in the future,

00:19:14.939 --> 00:19:18.005
will Director Zhang's work
involve the planning department?

00:19:18.005 --> 00:19:19.205
No, it won't.

00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:20.772
Then what is she here for?

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.939
Cindy, are you free tonight?

00:19:27.939 --> 00:19:29.772
Come with me to a place.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.171
I'll contact you after work.

00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:36.272
Then, let's meet downstairs.

00:19:36.272 --> 00:19:37.571
Goodbye.

00:19:37.571 --> 00:19:38.706
Bye.

00:19:50.496 --> 00:19:53.954
<i>[Vice President Office]</i>

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:58.238
This isn't considered an illegal act.

00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:00.571
We just need you to trace
Vice President Han's cash flow

00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:02.472
to rectify the company's corrupt practices.

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:04.171
Not only can you make a contribution,

00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.171
there's also another benefit for you.

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.439
Wait a moment.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.639
Make a contribution?

00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:11.039
Let me tell you, if this fire is set,

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:13.039
then it might backfire on me.

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:16.838
You haven't heard
the other benefit I mentioned.

00:20:16.838 --> 00:20:18.039
Come on.

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:21.905
Don't you like Gao Shuangyun?

00:20:21.905 --> 00:20:23.439
If she knew about
Vice President Han's character,

00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:26.272
then do you think
she would continue to be with him?

00:20:26.272 --> 00:20:27.606
Exactly.

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:38.571
From what I know about Yun,

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.139
she definitely

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:42.671
wouldn't like someone who is corrupt.

00:20:42.671 --> 00:20:44.606
That's right then.

00:20:44.606 --> 00:20:45.606
And can you bear

00:20:45.606 --> 00:20:48.205
to see Gao Shuangyun with such a person?

00:20:50.072 --> 00:20:51.873
Think about it carefully.

00:20:55.972 --> 00:20:58.404
<i>Cindy Wang isn't wrong either.</i>

00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:00.873
<i>But such cash flow.</i>

00:21:00.873 --> 00:21:03.238
<i>How could it possibly be stored
on the company's computers?</i>

00:21:05.072 --> 00:21:07.005
<i>Should I go to the Vice President's house?</i>

00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:08.873
<i>But…</i>

00:21:18.238 --> 00:21:19.238
Alright.

00:21:19.238 --> 00:21:21.039
I'll leave it up to fate.

00:21:21.639 --> 00:21:22.905
If it lands on heads,

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:24.238
then I'll go.

00:21:24.238 --> 00:21:25.404
If it's tails,

00:21:25.404 --> 00:21:27.805
then I'll wash my hands of this matter.

00:21:27.805 --> 00:21:29.072
Please.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:31.606
Zhou.

00:21:32.472 --> 00:21:34.139
I have to go out
for an unexpected social engagement.

00:21:34.139 --> 00:21:35.139
Can you go to my house for me?

00:21:35.139 --> 00:21:36.738
There's a frozen package
that seems a bit large.

00:21:36.738 --> 00:21:37.805
The management office can't fit it.

00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:39.372
Can you make a trip there for me?

00:21:40.606 --> 00:21:42.072
To your house?

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:43.106
Don't worry.

00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:45.706
You won't run into Miss Gao like last time.

00:21:47.671 --> 00:21:49.738
Do you remember the code for my house?

00:21:49.738 --> 00:21:51.171
I do.

00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:52.439
No problem.

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:54.005
Then I'll bother you with this.
I'm heading out now.

00:21:54.005 --> 00:21:56.039
Okay, Vice President, take care.

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.072
There's no helping it.

00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:05.838
You're the one who asked me to go.

00:22:22.139 --> 00:22:25.139
Still touching up your makeup
even though work is about to end?

00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:27.905
Is your husband taking you out on a date?

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:29.738
I'm just touching up my makeup.
How did you know

00:22:29.738 --> 00:22:32.272
I'm going on a date with my husband?

00:22:32.272 --> 00:22:33.272
Please.

00:22:33.272 --> 00:22:35.439
You are, after all, the envy

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:37.404
of the company's female staff.

00:22:37.404 --> 00:22:39.205
Your career is flourishing.

00:22:39.205 --> 00:22:40.972
And you have a husband who loves you.

00:22:40.972 --> 00:22:43.439
Did you know?
Even the security guard downstairs says

00:22:43.439 --> 00:22:45.338
your husband really dotes on you.

00:22:45.338 --> 00:22:48.139
He lovingly drops off
and picks you up every day.

00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:50.972
I'm just working hard, and living hard.

00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:52.939
Just like everyone else.

00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:54.205
How is that the same?

00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:56.404
It's clearly not the same.

00:22:56.972 --> 00:22:59.472
Having both a successful career
and a fulfilling love life like you isn't easy.

00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:01.539
It's really not easy.

00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:03.072
Okay, it's about time.

00:23:03.072 --> 00:23:07.305
My husband said he's taking me out
for a fancy, romantic dinner later.

00:23:07.305 --> 00:23:08.772
You're so lucky.

00:23:08.772 --> 00:23:10.372
Alright, you should hurry up and go.

00:23:10.372 --> 00:23:12.404
Remember to teach us all next time

00:23:12.404 --> 00:23:13.838
how to be as incredible as you.

00:23:13.838 --> 00:23:15.439
Got it, I'm off now.

00:23:15.439 --> 00:23:16.472
Bye!

00:23:16.472 --> 00:23:17.838
Goodbye.

00:23:38.472 --> 00:23:39.873
Okay.

00:23:39.873 --> 00:23:41.106
Take a break.

00:23:43.805 --> 00:23:44.939
Be careful.

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:46.072
Thank you.

00:23:49.404 --> 00:23:51.072
Your water is…

00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:54.272
People are contradictory.

00:23:54.272 --> 00:23:56.305
I really admire your independence.

00:23:57.005 --> 00:23:59.805
Yet I want to show that I can take care of you.

00:24:01.238 --> 00:24:03.171
Even independent girls

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:05.072
also want to be well cared for.

00:24:06.805 --> 00:24:09.205
It seems my instincts have helped me.

00:24:11.272 --> 00:24:12.338
Oh, right.

00:24:12.338 --> 00:24:13.338
Do you remember

00:24:13.338 --> 00:24:16.005
the champagne you once gave me?

00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:19.238
We can soon pop the champagne to celebrate.

00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:23.639
You've found the person who framed you?

00:24:23.639 --> 00:24:24.772
Who is it?

00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:27.539
After my key person finds the crucial evidence,

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:29.005
then I'll tell you.

00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:33.738
Is there a possibility

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:36.472
that you've known all along
but deliberately kept it to yourself?

00:24:36.472 --> 00:24:39.171
Wanting to create more opportunities
to spend time with me?

00:24:40.171 --> 00:24:41.706
You're so vain.

00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:44.873
This is called masculinity.

00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:49.404
I won't tease you anymore.

00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:51.571
I'm truly happy for you.

00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:52.738
I'm really looking forward

00:24:52.738 --> 00:24:55.305
to the day when the injustice is cleared.

00:24:55.873 --> 00:24:57.905
Then we'll celebrate together with Yi.

00:24:57.905 --> 00:24:59.272
She can drink juice.

00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:07.205
You got it right.

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.939
Just give you three chances,

00:25:09.939 --> 00:25:12.205
and you'll become good friends with Yi.

00:25:12.205 --> 00:25:14.439
If I am about to succeed,

00:25:14.439 --> 00:25:16.505
then you should be happy.

00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:18.072
Why that expression?

00:25:20.905 --> 00:25:22.171
She

00:25:23.372 --> 00:25:25.539
hopes we never see each other again.

00:25:26.072 --> 00:25:27.338
Why?

00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:30.272
Because she…

00:25:30.873 --> 00:25:32.706
worries if the two of us argue,

00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:34.772
then you two can't be friends anymore.

00:25:36.072 --> 00:25:37.338
That's what she says?

00:25:38.072 --> 00:25:39.472
To be honest.

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.472
I really fail as a father.

00:25:43.106 --> 00:25:44.639
I never even thought

00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:46.772
she would feel this way.

00:25:47.472 --> 00:25:49.905
Although I've never interacted with children.

00:25:49.905 --> 00:25:52.005
I have also been a child.

00:25:53.171 --> 00:25:56.338
As a child, my father
was in a similar situation to you.

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:59.404
I also often saw many aunts come and go.

00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:07.039
So,

00:26:08.472 --> 00:26:11.005
just take that situation just now.

00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:14.472
Actually, after seeing it a lot,
Yi got used to it.

00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:17.039
But after waiting for so long,

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:18.873
she'll feel disappointed too.

00:26:19.972 --> 00:26:21.005
However, once she grows up a bit,

00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:22.606
she'll adjust on her own.

00:26:22.606 --> 00:26:23.972
Just like me.

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:27.238
You don't want Yi to feel disappointed, right?

00:26:29.772 --> 00:26:31.571
But none of us can guarantee

00:26:31.571 --> 00:26:34.106
whether we can make it to the end or not.

00:26:34.939 --> 00:26:36.305
Cindy.

00:26:43.772 --> 00:26:45.039
If even Yi is worried

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.972
that we will argue,

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:48.372
then you must have

00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:50.571
scared off many aunties.

00:26:52.238 --> 00:26:53.639
Don't talk nonsense.

00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.205
There weren't that many aunties.

00:26:57.106 --> 00:26:59.571
And I never argue with girls.

00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:04.706
Then you must have
some unspeakable hidden illness.

00:27:05.439 --> 00:27:08.005
That's why a few aunties have run away.

00:27:10.372 --> 00:27:12.439
I'm in great health.

00:27:12.439 --> 00:27:14.171
I could run for another two hours.

00:28:23.972 --> 00:28:26.005
It's not the vice president's birthday.

00:28:30.171 --> 00:28:31.905
It's Yun's birthday.

00:28:34.805 --> 00:28:36.439
It's not that either.

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:40.238
Then what is it?

00:28:41.606 --> 00:28:42.972
No, that's not right.

00:28:42.972 --> 00:28:44.372
Where is it hidden?

00:29:21.404 --> 00:29:22.838
Darling.

00:29:22.838 --> 00:29:24.539
Didn't you have a social engagement today?

00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:27.005
Why did you come back so early?

00:29:35.372 --> 00:29:37.005
Darling.

00:29:38.838 --> 00:29:40.439
Darling.

00:30:30.072 --> 00:30:31.772
Zhou?

00:30:43.404 --> 00:30:45.005
Miss Gao.

00:30:46.372 --> 00:30:48.072
I…

00:30:49.472 --> 00:30:51.772
What are you doing
at the vice president's house?

00:30:53.972 --> 00:30:55.972
The vice president asked me

00:30:55.972 --> 00:30:58.139
to come and receive a frozen package for him.

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:00.439
And then I just took the chance to check

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:02.972
if the cleaning lady
had cleaned the house properly.

00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:12.738
Then why did you touch
the vice president's computer?

00:31:12.738 --> 00:31:14.539
Computer?

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:17.706
I…

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.472
When I came in here,

00:31:19.472 --> 00:31:20.805
it already looked like this.

00:31:20.805 --> 00:31:22.738
I didn't touch anything.

00:31:27.772 --> 00:31:29.539
It's okay.

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:32.072
I'll ask the vice president
to check the surveillance and we'll know.

00:31:44.805 --> 00:31:46.139
Okay, fine.

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:49.338
I did touch the laptop.

00:31:53.639 --> 00:31:55.772
But before I reveal my purpose,

00:31:56.505 --> 00:31:58.571
I want you to see something.

00:32:00.738 --> 00:32:02.171
Here.

00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:26.005
This bracelet bought by the vice president

00:32:26.005 --> 00:32:28.472
wasn't bought because yours was broken.

00:32:32.372 --> 00:32:33.838
He originally bought

00:32:33.838 --> 00:32:36.039
two identical bracelets.

00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:41.505
Whether it's for repair or pickup,

00:32:41.505 --> 00:32:43.472
it was always handled by me.

00:32:47.106 --> 00:32:48.972
If you don't believe it,

00:32:48.972 --> 00:32:51.272
then you can check the warranty card inside.

00:32:51.272 --> 00:32:53.305
There is a number on it.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.606
You can verify it,

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:56.838
and see if it's just one number off from yours.

00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:12.404
Buying the same thing
doesn't necessarily mean anything.

00:33:12.404 --> 00:33:15.205
Perhaps he just gave it to a client.

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:18.106
I don't think so.

00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:20.139
Yun, think about it.

00:33:20.139 --> 00:33:21.772
If it's for a client,

00:33:21.772 --> 00:33:24.139
then the vice president
could have simply told you.

00:33:25.873 --> 00:33:28.305
Why would he choose to deceive you?

00:33:34.005 --> 00:33:35.905
So, you know,

00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:37.772
who he was going to give it to?

00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:39.671
I don't know.

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.472
The vice president doesn't tell me everything.

00:34:15.606 --> 00:34:16.805
Yun.

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:19.739
Don't ask me anything.

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:30.141
<i>♫ The rift between you and me ♫</i>

00:34:31.157 --> 00:34:33.137
<i>♫ Don't force repairs ♫</i>

00:34:34.402 --> 00:34:38.070
<i>♫ It's impossible anyway ♫</i>

00:34:39.957 --> 00:34:45.245
<i>♫ The one who loved out of their league ♫</i>

00:34:46.014 --> 00:34:47.818
<i>♫ Highlighting oneself ♫</i>

00:34:48.472 --> 00:34:49.972
Really?

00:34:49.972 --> 00:34:51.838
So, aside from embezzling company funds,

00:34:51.838 --> 00:34:53.606
Vice President Han
was also involved in an office romance?

00:34:53.606 --> 00:34:54.939
And the point is he was cheating too!

00:34:54.939 --> 00:34:57.772
He's utterly a casanova.

00:34:57.772 --> 00:34:59.239
Yun is so pitiable

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:00.405
to have met such a person.

00:35:00.405 --> 00:35:02.239
A downright jinx.

00:35:03.171 --> 00:35:05.204
After Gao Shuangyun found out everything,

00:35:05.204 --> 00:35:07.405
what was her attitude?

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.371
Of course,
she was as vindictive as she could be.

00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:10.405
Her boyfriend cheated!

00:35:10.405 --> 00:35:11.538
She must take revenge.

00:35:11.538 --> 00:35:12.838
Meng Heng, little brother.

00:35:12.838 --> 00:35:14.705
Then you really don't understand women.

00:35:14.705 --> 00:35:16.073
Without seeing with their own eyes,

00:35:16.073 --> 00:35:18.139
and without concrete evidence,

00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:19.204
women tend to be blindsided,

00:35:19.204 --> 00:35:20.371
and unable to see anything.

00:35:20.371 --> 00:35:21.538
How can they not see?

00:35:21.538 --> 00:35:22.705
The truth is right before their eyes.

00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:24.838
Just short of catching the cheating in bed.

00:35:24.838 --> 00:35:25.906
And Miss Gao is so smart.

00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:28.272
How could she choose
to believe a scumbag like you do?

00:35:29.739 --> 00:35:30.838
You…

00:35:31.906 --> 00:35:33.472
Haven't you heard the saying,

00:35:33.472 --> 00:35:35.073
'hopelessly in love?'

00:35:35.073 --> 00:35:36.439
In the face of love,

00:35:36.439 --> 00:35:38.073
no matter how smart a woman is,

00:35:38.073 --> 00:35:39.671
she can still act foolishly.

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:40.939
Just like me.

00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:43.239
I don't think so, I,
I'd better go and try to persuade Miss Gao.

00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:45.171
You, sit down.

00:35:46.005 --> 00:35:48.505
You two don't know anything, just chipping in
one comment after another here.

00:35:48.505 --> 00:35:50.772
Can someone present here speak up?

00:35:53.972 --> 00:35:57.038
What did Yun say?

00:36:00.405 --> 00:36:02.139
She didn't say anything.

00:36:02.872 --> 00:36:04.671
She just kept crying.

00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:06.505
Kept crying and crying.

00:36:11.073 --> 00:36:12.505
So, what do you think?

00:36:12.505 --> 00:36:15.272
Will she help us expose
Vice President Han's crimes?

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:21.338
I don't know.

00:36:23.405 --> 00:36:25.505
But the Vice President has hurt her so deeply.

00:36:25.505 --> 00:36:27.439
I think she should stand by your side,

00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:29.371
and make the right decision.

00:36:30.139 --> 00:36:31.439
Really?

00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:34.538
Really?

00:36:35.338 --> 00:36:37.139
Really?

00:36:46.272 --> 00:36:47.772
Yun.

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.639
I want some water.

00:36:52.038 --> 00:36:54.739
Yun, get me some water.

00:36:54.739 --> 00:36:56.872
I'm so drunk.

00:36:59.038 --> 00:37:00.538
Yun.

00:37:00.538 --> 00:37:02.038
Here's your water.

00:37:43.648 --> 00:37:44.838
What's wrong?

00:37:44.838 --> 00:37:46.073
What are you doing?

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:48.805
I want to loosen your tie for you.

00:37:50.171 --> 00:37:52.639
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I can do it myself.

00:37:57.305 --> 00:37:58.405
Yun.

00:37:58.405 --> 00:38:02.305
Do you know the origin of the necktie?

00:38:03.439 --> 00:38:05.272
How would I know?

00:38:05.972 --> 00:38:07.739
Back in ancient times,

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:11.073
boys would go into battle

00:38:11.073 --> 00:38:13.305
wearing armor,

00:38:13.939 --> 00:38:16.472
which couldn't protect the neck.

00:38:16.472 --> 00:38:18.972
So, they would take a piece of cloth,

00:38:19.805 --> 00:38:24.073
and tie it around
the most vulnerable spot for protection.

00:38:24.906 --> 00:38:26.572
This piece of cloth

00:38:27.106 --> 00:38:32.106
was usually sewn by their own wives.

00:38:32.106 --> 00:38:37.171
Not only did it serve a protective function,

00:38:37.171 --> 00:38:38.639
at the same time,

00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:43.073
it was also a symbol of loyalty.

00:38:46.439 --> 00:38:48.073
Loyalty.

00:38:49.972 --> 00:38:53.239
Just like my loyalty to you.

00:38:54.338 --> 00:38:56.472
In this world,

00:38:56.472 --> 00:38:58.671
the only person who can touch my tie

00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:02.939
is Gao Shuangyun.

00:39:07.939 --> 00:39:09.505
So drunk.

00:39:09.505 --> 00:39:10.972
Have some water first.

00:39:10.972 --> 00:39:13.338
Then, tell me about your loyalty slowly.

00:39:20.204 --> 00:39:21.772
My head really hurts.

00:39:22.472 --> 00:39:23.872
No way.

00:39:24.972 --> 00:39:27.338
I'll sleep a bit more.

00:39:46.838 --> 00:39:49.972
- Chen Duomi, it's your turn.
- Hurry up.

00:39:49.972 --> 00:39:52.272
Why fall asleep while playing cards?

00:39:52.272 --> 00:39:55.606
No, playing all night,
who wouldn't want to fall asleep?

00:39:56.139 --> 00:39:57.872
We are not card-playing robots, you know.

00:39:57.872 --> 00:39:59.305
You go first.

00:40:01.204 --> 00:40:03.671
Isn't it so?

00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:06.472
Before we even know what Gao Shuangyun thinks,

00:40:06.472 --> 00:40:08.505
I'll be thinking all sorts of things.

00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:10.439
You guys just keep me company.

00:40:10.439 --> 00:40:11.472
Okay.

00:40:13.671 --> 00:40:14.805
Going to the bathroom.

00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:17.705
Then…

00:40:17.705 --> 00:40:19.005
Alright.

00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:21.671
Chen Duomi.

00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:22.805
Chen Duomi, it's your turn now.

00:40:22.805 --> 00:40:24.005
You go first.

00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.106
You go first.

00:40:26.439 --> 00:40:28.272
- Chen…
- Okay, it's fine.

00:40:28.272 --> 00:40:30.239
Let her rest first.

00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:31.338
I'll play with you.

00:40:31.338 --> 00:40:33.606
No, how can two people
play with four decks of cards?

00:40:34.772 --> 00:40:36.073
Well, this…

00:40:43.505 --> 00:40:44.872
I'm sorry.

00:41:02.671 --> 00:41:04.073
<i>It can't be.</i>

00:41:04.073 --> 00:41:05.872
<i>Wang Cunfeng.</i>

00:41:05.872 --> 00:41:07.139
<i>You're doing this again?</i>

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.782
<i>♫ I'm going to love you ♫</i>

00:41:17.338 --> 00:41:19.572
If I could watch Yun this closely,

00:41:20.272 --> 00:41:22.005
holding her hand,

00:41:22.005 --> 00:41:23.439
that would be so good.

00:41:31.939 --> 00:41:34.106
Really getting old.

00:41:34.106 --> 00:41:35.671
Shouldn't have drunk so much.

00:41:36.838 --> 00:41:38.805
What are you cooking? It smells so good.

00:41:38.805 --> 00:41:39.805
Your awake?

00:41:39.805 --> 00:41:40.906
Yes.

00:41:40.906 --> 00:41:42.305
I made some borscht.

00:41:42.305 --> 00:41:43.671
It can help you sober up.

00:41:44.472 --> 00:41:45.538
Truly wise.

00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:48.272
How did you know that a hungover person
needs this the most?

00:41:49.038 --> 00:41:51.439
Try it and see if it suits your taste.

00:41:51.439 --> 00:41:52.639
As long as it's cooked by you,

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:54.838
it'll definitely suit my taste.

00:41:55.739 --> 00:41:58.705
If you ask me what a moment of happiness is,

00:41:58.705 --> 00:42:00.371
then it's definitely now.

00:42:01.772 --> 00:42:03.204
That's an exaggeration.

00:42:03.204 --> 00:42:04.705
Drink it while it's hot.

00:42:07.073 --> 00:42:08.338
Thank you

00:42:10.772 --> 00:42:12.272
Why is there only one set
of bowl and chopsticks

00:42:12.272 --> 00:42:13.505
Aren't you eating?

00:42:13.505 --> 00:42:14.838
I've already eaten.

00:42:16.872 --> 00:42:19.038
I was originally waiting
to have breakfast with you.

00:42:19.038 --> 00:42:22.005
Now I can only watch you eat brunch.

00:42:22.639 --> 00:42:23.772
I'm sorry.

00:42:29.772 --> 00:42:31.139
Your cooking is really good.

00:42:33.805 --> 00:42:35.572
And then?

00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:38.439
Then…

00:42:38.439 --> 00:42:40.038
I'll have an extra two servings.

00:42:42.838 --> 00:42:45.038
Usually, after praising one's cooking skills,

00:42:45.038 --> 00:42:46.872
won't they then say

00:42:46.872 --> 00:42:48.472
that you're ready to get married.

00:42:56.906 --> 00:42:58.705
Then, are you willing to marry me?

00:43:03.805 --> 00:43:05.939
Before I agree to marry you,

00:43:06.838 --> 00:43:08.705
is there anything you want to tell me?

00:43:11.538 --> 00:43:13.705
I love you, Yun.

00:43:19.939 --> 00:43:21.472
I mean

00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:24.538
do you have any secrets

00:43:24.538 --> 00:43:25.705
that I should know about?

00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:27.606
That you haven't told me yet.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.106
I…

00:43:32.838 --> 00:43:34.838
I don't have any secrets.

00:43:34.838 --> 00:43:36.671
I've said all I should have said.

00:43:38.171 --> 00:43:39.972
Really, there aren't any.

00:43:42.972 --> 00:43:44.371
What's wrong?

00:43:47.906 --> 00:43:48.939
It's nothing.

00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:51.439
There's one more dish that hasn't been served.

00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:52.671
I'll go get it.

00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:58.772
Are you mad at me
for getting too drunk yesterday?

00:43:59.472 --> 00:44:01.671
Sorry, I'll be more careful next time.

00:44:03.838 --> 00:44:05.038
This bracelet.

00:44:05.606 --> 00:44:06.872
Who are you giving it to?

00:44:39.917 --> 00:44:44.618

Okay, you two can kiss now.

00:44:48.572 --> 00:44:49.671
It depends on

00:44:49.671 --> 00:44:51.371
what you think

00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:52.772
I am to you.

00:44:52.772 --> 00:44:54.239
I think that Guo Shijie

00:44:54.239 --> 00:44:56.772
should be in our bag.

00:44:56.772 --> 00:44:58.805
The more chaotic the business department,
the better.

00:44:58.805 --> 00:45:00.204
I feel like Chen intentionally keeps me

00:45:00.204 --> 00:45:02.239
trapped here to watch me.

00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:04.005
You just stay
in the planning department for now.

00:45:04.005 --> 00:45:05.872
Don't go back to the business department
for these few days.

00:45:05.872 --> 00:45:07.805
I really didn't know you had an ex-wife.

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.572
I truly have only you.

00:45:09.572 --> 00:45:10.838
I have a secret weapon.

00:45:10.838 --> 00:45:12.439
Hello, my name is Jiang Manfei.

00:45:12.439 --> 00:45:14.038
You can also call me Mrs. Han.
