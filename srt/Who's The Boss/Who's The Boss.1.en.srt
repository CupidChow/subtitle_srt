00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,011
My team and I are dining here.

180
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:43,078
I saw Director Zhang
and thought to come over to say hello.

181
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,745
Of course.

182
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,644
Hello, I'm Gao Shuangyun.

183
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:49,011
I'm Cindy Wang.

184
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:50,644
You can just call me Cindy.

185
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:54,444
I've come specifically to discuss
the joint project with you.

186
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,310
I know you enjoy drinking.

187
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,011
Hope you like it.

188
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:59,644
Thank you.

189
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,210
[Zhang Shiping]
My name is Zhang Shiping.

190
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,043
- Let's sit down and talk.
- Okay.

191
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,210
You and your colleague are dining.

192
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,960
Leaving the table so suddenly
isn't very polite, is it?

193
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,678
To leave in the middle of greeting is what's considered rude.

194
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,978
That's not my style.

195
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,577
Please sit. Sit down.

196
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:22,510
Thank you, Mr. Cai

197
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,545
I'm quite familiar with Director Zhang.

198
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:29,110
We're old friends.

199
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,577
Director Zhang, take a look at our company.

200
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:34,378
The two pillars of the sales department.

201
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:36,978
So proactive, hardworking, and striving.

202
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,220
There's absolutely no problem.

203
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:42,670
Alright, your cup.

204
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:48,478
What on earth are you guys doing?

205
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,610
In one night, besides the construction department's material costs, nothing else is done.

206
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,912
In one night, besides the construction department's material costs, nothing else is done.

207
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:57,077
I know sometimes we have
to cooperate with other departments.

208
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,644
But we are a performance unit.

209
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,478
Guys, be a bit more active.

210
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,478
What about the sales strategy part?

211
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,243
Just off the top of my head,
I can think of introducing green buildings.

212
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:13,178
And also AI smart technology.

213
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:15,878
Where's your sales strategy?

214
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,745
- How's it?
- How's the situation inside?

215
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:20,344
It's terrible. It's a scene of utter turmoil inside.

216
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:22,311
It's terrible. It's a scene of utter turmoil inside.

217
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:24,310
- And you know what? Cindy is in there scolding loudly.
- Scolding inside.

218
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,410
- And you know what? Cindy is in there scolding loudly.
- Scolding inside.

219
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,478
[Xu Yazi]
I run too fast, and you can't catch up?

220
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:28,478
Or is it that you run too fast and Intelligence can't keep up with you.

221
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:30,278
Or is it that you run too fast and Intelligence can't keep up with you.

222
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:31,545
Is it that I run too fast, and you can't catch up?

223
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:32,845
Is it that I run too fast, and you can't catch up?

224
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:34,178
Or is it that you run too fast, and Intelligence can't keep up with you?

225
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,712
Or is it that you run too fast, and Intelligence can't keep up with you?

226
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,411
Yazi, how did you know
she was saying that inside?

227
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,210
Use your brain.

228
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,410
[Chen Han]
But there's one more line.

229
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,411
- We are…
- We are a team.

230
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,010
- You guys…
- I need to do all your work.

231
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,977
I have to do the work of three people.

232
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,811
That's impressive, not a single word missed.

233
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:53,077
Not that she's too strong, but that she has memorized it all.

234
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,510
Not that she's too strong, but that she has memorized it all.

235
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,545
[Guo Shijie]
Yazi suffered under her harsh treatment once.

236
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:58,811
I don't want to recall those rough days.

237
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,678
I don't want to recall those rough days.

238
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,845
Let's just get back to work quickly.

239
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,610
Aren't you going to another site
for market research later?

240
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,311
Originally I was, but Xiaoyun said that it's too hot outside,
and she'll go by herself.

241
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,178
Originally I was, but Xiaoyun said that it's too hot outside,
and she'll go by herself.

242
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,145
And she asked me
to stay and be busy in the office.

243
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:14,043
Nice.

244
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,944
[Gao Shuangyun]
Xiaoyun is so gentle.

245
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:17,345
Not like someone, leading people without heart.

246
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:20,144
Not like someone, leading people without heart.

247
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:22,210
Everyone divide up the parts
you're responsible for.

248
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,845
Also, next time don't
bring me this kind of blank thing.

249
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,978
I don't know who brought me this blank thing.

250
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,311
[Chen Duomi]
Coffee, tea, or…

251
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,511
[Chen Duomi]
Coffee, tea, or…

252
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,278
Chen Duomi.

253
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,043
You can't just drink water at times like this.

254
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,277
You can't just drink water at times like this.

255
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,212
What else then?

256
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:52,378
Here, drink this. My secret weapon.

257
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:53,911
Here, drink this. My secret weapon.

258
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,777
You have it stashed away?

259
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:57,944
It's the boss's.

260
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,243
It's to boost your energy.

261
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,478
I really need it so much.

262
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:04,478
You know I really want
to climb up the ladder now.

263
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,345
I want to buy a house quickly and then make money.

264
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,377
I want to buy a house quickly and then make money.

265
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,644
But the people in our team are really passive.

266
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:13,210
You know I have to keep an eye
on them to get into the groove.

267
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,410
The battle for the Sales Department Manager is pretty tough.

268
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,178
The battle for the Sales Department Manager is pretty tough.

269
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,878
As a good friend, I can't just stand by and watch.

270
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:20,478
As a good friend, I can't just stand by and watch.

271
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:22,110
I'll give you my blessing.

272
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,800
Blessing for what?

273
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,981
You know someone from Bosheng Architecture & Design, and can find out some information?

274
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,393
You know someone from Bosheng Architecture & Design, and can find out some information?

275
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,777
Come with me.

[Strawberry Paradise]

277
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:41,497
Chen Duomi, are you kidding me?

278
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,101
Do you know how popular this is online?

279
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,401
I heard it's very effective.

280
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,477
I don't need this kind of elusive luck.

281
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,045
I rely on my own strength.

282
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:55,409
Better to believe it exists.

283
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,523
How can you not catch it?

284
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,597
Move.

285
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,655
I'm working on a big case.

286
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,547
You're wasting my time bringing me here.

287
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:09,177
Do you know how precious one second is to me?

288
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,603
Impossible.

289
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:23,513
Cindy Wang, you're really good.

290
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:27,977
You seem happier than me.

291
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,811
That's because I really hope that you can get promoted to manager.

292
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:32,243
That's because I really hope that you can get promoted to manager.

293
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:33,511
The key point is I know that you work really really really really

294
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:35,610
The key point is I know that you work really really really really

295
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,712
hard.

296
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,511
So, you're bound to succeed.

297
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:43,478
Gao Shuangyun, here I come.

298
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,043

Do you want to take a look at this data?

302
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,343
I've told you several times.

303
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,845
Firstly, I would like to thank the construction company team

Firstly, I would like to thank the construction company team

305
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,178
for working overtime and staying up late
for Bosheng Architecture & Design.

306
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,978
You've worked hard.

307
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,211
Hello everyone, and Director Zhang.

308
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:36,010
We are the Sales Department II
of the construction company.

309
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,077
A house shouldn't just be cold steel and concrete.

310
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:39,945
A house shouldn't just be cold steel and concrete.

311
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,243
It should carry warmer dreams.

00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:44,211
An ideal of home.

313
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,545
Bank loans cover ten percent.

314

The remaining ten percent
is an interest-free loan from our company.

315
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:49,177
Allowing the youth to achieve it.

316

Easily start a family and build dreams solidly.

317

To realize the concept of your ideal home.

318
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:56,510
A city with a vision needs to have love, a feeling of home.

A city with a vision needs to have love, a feeling of home.

♫ Since the world is already beyond saving ♫

322
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:06,083
♫ Might as well go mad sooner ♫

♫ Sooner or later it
will be riddled with holes ♫

It's over, I'm doomed. Retribution is coming.

It's over, I'm doomed. Retribution is coming.

Congratulations. You've won.

351
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,378
Thank you.

352
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:38,744
Your proposal was great too.

353
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,410
Quite good.

354
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,410
Congratulations, Cindy.

355
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,012
Thank you.

356
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,111
Then…let's head back to the company first.

357
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,211
Then…let's head back to the company first.

358
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,911
Back to the company, let's go.

359
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:56,510
Think about what to eat tonight.

360
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:00,811
Congratulations Cindy.

361
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,278
Wait a second.

362
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:04,278
It's congratulations to us.

363
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:05,378
Come on, cheers!

364
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,545
Okay, cheers!

365
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,844
Miss.

366
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:12,344
Miss.

367
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,044
This doesn't look good.

368
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,300
Sorry.

369
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,311
Come on, let me tell you.

370
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,545
With me, Cindy Wang, leading the way,

371
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:26,211
it's guaranteed to get you on the expressway.

372
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,344
If you want to add anything else, just go ahead. My treat.

373
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:28,677
If you want to add anything else, just go ahead. My treat.

374
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:30,111
- Thank you, Cindy.
- Thank you.

375
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:31,677
Thank you.

376
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,144
Let me tell you.

377
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:34,911
Actually, as for my ability

378
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,811
I could have been promoted
to manager a long time ago.

379
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,945
But do you know why I didn't?

380
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:42,778
Because I want to move forward
together with you guys.

381
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:44,744
Especially in this proposal. I've been particularly conscientious.

382
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:46,278
Especially in this proposal. I've been particularly conscientious.

383
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:48,144
I interviewed a lot of local residents and got a lot of little tips.

384
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,344
I interviewed a lot of local residents and got a lot of little tips.

385
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:52,911
Because the devil is in the details.

386
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:54,611
The more meticulous you are with the details,

387
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,811
the more surprises you'll find.

388
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,760
This is why my proposal
will be successful this time.

389
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:03,878
I really hope we can be like you.

390
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:06,945
So creative and insightful.

391
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,243
With your talent and effort, I know you'll definitely succeed, come on.

392
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:11,010
With your talent and effort, I know you'll definitely succeed, come on.

393
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,712
Okay, thank you, Cindy.

394
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,077
Thank you, then here's to our manager.

395
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:17,144
Congratulations to the manager.

396
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:22,611
No one is allowed to leave without getting drunk.

397
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:25,044
No one is allowed to leave without getting drunk.

398
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:26,910
We're out of wine, I'll get some more.

399
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,010
Hey.

400
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,278
You!

401
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:37,243
I've been up all night for several days,
having to listen to her talk on and on.

402
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,111
Yingjun, let me tell you.

403
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,211
It's all yours in a moment. I want to leave first.

404
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:43,010
It's all yours in a moment. I want to leave first.

405
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,510
We advance and retreat together,
and you can't leave without me.

406
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,010
If you want to escape,

407
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,510
then let's see what you can do, Yingjun.

408
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:53,644
Let me tell you, the drinks
are already ordered, what?

409
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,077
None of you are allowed to sneak off.

410
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,311
Good, come on.

411
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:57,677
Cindy, I just remembered

412
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:59,677
that my wife demands
that I must be home before eight o'clock.

413
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:02,272
- If I don't leave now, then it'll be too late.
- Eight o'clock is too early, isn't it?

414
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,344
- Seriously.
- Too early, right?

415
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,445
Why don't you invite her to come along?

416
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,611
My wife is a bit, you know…

417
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,211
Can't help it, I have to go first.

418
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:09,644
Drink slowly, sorry about that.

419
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,410
Yingjun, be safe.

420
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,811
Be safe, see you tomorrow.

421
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,744
Bye, take care.

422
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,243
Don't be fooled by him.

423
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,044
Actually, he's even more experienced than I am.

424
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,243
Do you know that?

425
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:25,644
But do you know, after he joined my team,

426
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:28,177
only then his abilities were recognized.

427
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:30,144
It's okay, it's good that he left.

428
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,278
Today, it is a ladies' night for us.

429
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:34,344
I'll teach you some things

430
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:37,478
that women should know in business.

431
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:40,911
What's wrong with you?

432
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:43,611
I just got my period.

433
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:45,010
And I've just had too much beer.

434
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,510
My stomach hurts a bit.

435
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,577
Let me tell you,

436
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,945
I have some painkillers.

437
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,278
No, Cindy.

438
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,911
Painkillers won't save me.

439
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,911
I'll ask for your advice

440
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,311
about the secrets to success next time.

441
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,911
Can I go home to rest first?

442
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:58,478
Okay, then let me call a taxi for you.

443
00:21:58,478 --> 00:21:59,811
No need.

444
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:02,373
I can just hail a cab on the road.

445
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,478
- Really?
- Yes.

446
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:05,010
I'll go home first.

447
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,144
- Okay, just let me know when you get home.
- Okay.

448
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:09,644
Be careful, congratulations.

449
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:12,077
Thank you.

450
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:14,811
Bye.

451
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:26,111
Here, I'll give you a couple of beers.

452
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,945
Sorry, I probably can't finish them by myself.

453
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:31,243
What can I do, then?

454
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:32,778
Can't finish it?

455
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:34,712
Weren't there three of you?

456
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:35,811
They left already.

457
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:37,945
Gone?

458
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:39,278
But weren't they celebrating

459
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:41,344
for your promotion?

460
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,211
Yes, but they had to take care
of things at home.

461
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,077
And another one wasn't feeling well.

462
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:47,410
So, what do I do?

463
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,712
Well, this…

464
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,077
Ladies and gentlemen.

465
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:01,778
Today is this beautiful lady's

466
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:03,577
promotion day.

467
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:05,410
Let's all raise our glasses
and celebrate for her, shall we?

468
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,510
Okay.

469
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,644
Who doesn't have a drink?

470
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:10,677
Who doesn't have a drink over here?

471
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:12,243
Okay, so there isn't any over there,
and none over here either, right?

472
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:13,410
Okay.

473
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,945
Come, here you go.

474
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:17,278
- I need a bottle over here, thank you.
- Here you go.

475
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:18,844
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

476
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,978
Thank you.

477
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,211
Are you off work yet?

478
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,378
If you are off work, then let's drink together.

479
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:28,744
Let me tell you,
responsibility is shared fifty-fifty.

480
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,311
- Alright, I'm about to finish work
- Here you go.

481
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,378
- I'll join you after I get off work.
- Okay, hurry up, you drink first.

482
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,044
Good, everyone be happy.

483
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:36,211
Thank you, everyone.
Who else doesn't have a drink?

484
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:37,378
Is the pressure on you very high?

485
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:39,410
You've had too much to drink, haven't you?

486
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,644
Already called for.

487
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:43,344
Ouch!

488
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:44,644
Come on.

489
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:48,010
Did I ever tell you that you
actually look really good in a shirt?

490
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,478
My mom says the same.

491
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:31,211
Did anything happen yesterday?

492
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:33,911
It must have been a dream, right?

493
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,577
Good morning.

494
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:17,211
I made some simple breakfast.

495
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,577
Morning.

496
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:22,878
I'm in a hurry to get to work.

497
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:24,778
So, are you…?

498
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:26,945
Okay.

499
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:43,111
Do you have something you want to say?

500
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:44,177
I was thinking

501
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:45,844
that we're all adults now.

502
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,144
So…

503
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,778
Last night was too crazy.

504
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:54,410
So…

505
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,278
I lost my wallet.

506
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:01,517
Okay.

507
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,445
I…

508
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,778
I…

509
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,010
You, you took a taxi back.

510
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,844
- That's too much.
- Don't worry about it.

511
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:11,978
- You take it.
- Okay.

512
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:13,378
I'll definitely pay you back next time.

513
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:14,644
No need.

514
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:18,445
We don't need to see each other anymore.

515
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:19,911
From now on,

516
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,945
we'll go our own ways.

517
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:24,378
Okay, so…

518
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,510
Enjoy the food.

519
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,378
Thank you.

520
00:26:30,077 --> 00:26:32,311
Thank you.

521
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:34,510
Will the door open?

522
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,878
Yes, it should open.

523
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:39,510
Okay, thank you.

524
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,545
Everyone keeps looking at me.

525
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:08,644
Could it be that they've already
announced that I'm the manager selection?

526
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,945
How did it go?
What did Director Zhang of Bosheng say?

527
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,278
Initially got Director Zhang's understanding.

528
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:17,577
Xiaoyun from the business department
has already taken all the team members

529
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:20,311
to carry out remedial measures.

530
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:23,677
Okay.

531
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:26,545
What about Cindy Wang? Any news?

532
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,577
You keep calling

533
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:28,878
until she answers the phone.

534
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,501
Okay.

535
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:36,077
Mr. Cai, your blood pressure
was a bit high just now.

536
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:38,744
Come on, take some medicine first.

537
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:39,945
If Cindy Wang doesn't answer the phone,

538
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:41,712
then I'm going to have a brain hemorrhage.

539
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:44,545
I'll call right away, right away.

540
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:48,510
Everyone's so early today.

541
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,611
- Morning.
- Morning.

542
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:53,712
Yingjun, sit down and talk, it's okay.

543
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:54,844
You've arrived.

544
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:57,677
Chen Duomi, don't run around
in the company, it doesn't look good.

545
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,243
Where exactly did you go yesterday?

546
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,243
Why didn't you answer the phone?

547
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,945
Wasn't it just to celebrate a promotion?

548
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:05,445
I drank too much.

549
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:07,778
My promotion is a good thing,
why the long face?

550
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:09,445
Even if you drank a lot,
you should answer the phone.

551
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:10,744
Do you know that I've been calling
since last night until now?

552
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:12,177
I'm almost going crazy.

553
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,611
Did you call me?

554
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:20,044
Where's my phone?

555
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:22,477
Where's my phone?

556
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:28,144
- Come.
- I'll have a drink with you after work.

557
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:29,545
Alright, hurry, you drink first.

558
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:31,278
Good, everyone be happy.

559
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:32,945
Thank you, everyone.

560
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,577
Why did you hang up on me?

561
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,010
Leave today's troubles

562
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,344
for tomorrow.

563
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:41,510
Right, we'll talk about any issues tomorrow.

564
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,811
- Ouch!
- Assistant Li.

565
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,844
Bosheng, come on.

566
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:52,445
You broke it helping your sister.

567
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:03,878
You…

568
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:06,243
Where did you go last night?

569
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:07,778
You didn't even answer your phone.

570
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:09,811
Do you know everyone
has been looking for you all night?

571
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,878
Did you hide on purpose?

572
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,478
I didn't.

573
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:14,644
I'm asking you.

574
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:17,077
What is our company's corporate spirit?

575
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:20,044
Integrity, Sustainability, Love.

576
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:21,278
You know that?

577
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:23,243
The first one is integrity.

578
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:25,978
You even dare to plagiarize?

579
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:29,010
Mr. Cai, I really didn't.

580
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,510
You still dare to say no?

581
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,611
If you didn't plagiarize,

582
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,044
then why did Taiyue Construction's proposal

583
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:35,111
come out one step ahead of you?

584
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:38,010
And with
a higher distribution ratio than yours.

585
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,278
I really didn't plagiarize.

586
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,111
I want to know why too.

587
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:45,111
Yingjun.

588
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:46,677
Do you think

589
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:49,644
Cindy can make it through this time?

590
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,611
Cindy Wang

591
00:30:04,611 --> 00:30:07,311
made such a big mistake this time.

592
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:12,010
The manager's position might or might not…

593
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,243
Definitely be Xiaoyun's.

594
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:18,311
After all, Taiyue Construction
had disputes with residents before.

595
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:20,010
The quality of construction is worrying.

596
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,311
With great difficulty,

597
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:22,844
they secured the joint construction project

598
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:24,844
with Bosheng.

599
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,243
But Cindy doesn't seem quite like

600
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,278
someone who would plagiarize.

601
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:33,611
This is called knowing the face
but not the heart.

602
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:34,811
Forget it, you're still too inexperienced.

603
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:37,445
I don't want to explain to you.

604
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,844
Go.

605
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:41,744
Rookie, start working.

606
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,410
[Cindy Wang]

607
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,278
Mr. Cai, I guarantee with my integrity.

608
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:51,545
I really didn't plagiarize.

609
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,410
Integrity? You!

610
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,978
You even dare to mention integrity?

611
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,945
How much is your integrity worth now?

612
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:58,010
I've been in the company for so many years.

613
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,344
This is impossible.

614
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,712
The words 'impossible'

615
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,844
only appear in a fool's dictionary.

616
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,911
Mr. Cai.

617
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,311
Wang Cunfeng.

618
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:51,644
Vice President.

619
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,144
You usually work out, don't you?

620
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:56,744
[Han Xinzheng]
He's got quite a strong grip

621
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:58,744
I see Mr. Cai's face is all swollen.

622
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:01,545
Then I must go apologize
and then get some ice for his swelling.

623
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,378
Don't, have a seat first.

624
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:05,077
If you go apologize now,

625
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:08,111
wouldn't that just make him seem petty?

626
00:32:10,077 --> 00:32:11,144
I know.

627
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:13,478
You saw Chen about to fall,

628
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:14,712
and was worried about the hot tea in her hands

629
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:15,778
spilling on the boss.

630
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:18,111
That's why you did it, isn't it?

631
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:19,478
The boss knows as well.

632
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:21,878
But was a bit overly startled.

633
00:32:21,878 --> 00:32:24,077
He's not blaming you.

634
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:30,211
Did the boss mention
the plagiarism thing to the Vice President?

635
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,510
I did tell him.

636
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,778
I said you, you would absolutely
never do such a thing.

637
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:39,111
Isn't that right?

638
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:41,545
But my guarantee is of no use

639
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,010
under the current circumstances.

640
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,712
So, Mr. Cai, he…

641
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:48,677
He has to punish you

642
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,010
for accountability to the client.

643
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:54,978
But I have fought hard for you.

644
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:58,044
After all, having you start
as a specialist again is a bit too much.

645
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:00,478
Starting as a specialist
means starting from scratch.

646
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,144
Don't rush.

647
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,510
Didn't I say that I fought hard for you?

648
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,378
I won't let you start over as a specialist.

649
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:09,044
Then, what's the punishment?

650
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:10,278
A pay cut?

651
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:12,111
Base salary remains the same.

652
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,945
But no bonus or extra pay.

653
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:17,644
As for the position…

654
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:20,344
Sales Department's

655
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:22,644
manager's secretary.

656
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:28,378
Did I hear that wrong?

657
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:32,677
You want me to be Gao Shuangyun's secretary?

658
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:37,078
Cindy.

659
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:39,210
No!

660
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,745
No, don't go.

661
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,711
Do you need anything?

662
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,478
Otherwise, I'm throwing it away.

663
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:48,510
You can't.

664
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,877
This is what you grew
for a successful promotion.

665
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,043
The hope potted plant, you can't throw it away.

666
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,278
Maybe it's just attracting bad luck.

667
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:55,311
No.

668
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:57,544
Don't talk nonsense.

669
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,244
Don't go.

670
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:02,644
I'll be so bored if you leave.

671
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:06,377
Or I'll quit with you.

672
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,677
I'm not quitting.

673
00:34:09,677 --> 00:34:13,043
How can I buy a house
and pay the mortgage if I quit?

674
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:14,344
If I quit,

675
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,811
then it means I really did something wrong.

676
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:17,445
Fleeing from justice.

677
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:19,778
I must stay
and investigate everything thoroughly

678
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:21,945
to prove my innocence.

679
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:23,611
You're so brave.

680
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,912
And you know what.

681
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:26,043
Through my connections,

682
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:27,978
I saw the proposal from Taiyue Construction.

683
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:30,445
The planning and square footage inside

684
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,877
are eighty percent identical to my proposal.

685
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:34,177
Eighty percent?

686
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:36,111
That's too high.

687
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,978
So, I strongly suspect

688
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:42,078
that there's a mole in our company.

689
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:44,278
Could it be someone from your team?

690
00:34:44,278 --> 00:34:46,945
Impossible, although our team is very passive,

691
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,578
they're loyal to me.

692
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:49,711
And if I become the manager,

693
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:52,111
it's only beneficial for them, no downside.

694
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,644
Makes sense.

695
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:56,078
No, what do you mean by doing all this?

696
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:57,877
It's so heavy.

697
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,745
No, the new position isn't big enough.

698
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:01,043
So, I thought I'd sort things out

699
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:02,311
for a change of scene.

700
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,445
The new position…

701
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,711
How do I throw this away?

702
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,510
I'll just throw away the box.

703
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,544
Then help me throw it out.

704
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:12,711
I have to go back to the fight.

705
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:21,043
[Manager Gao Shuangyun]
Miss Gao, this way please.

706
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:24,510
- Seeing Miss Gao into the elevator!
- Into the elevator!

707
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,778
Walk slowly, come.

708
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:28,010
- Vice President.
- Hello, Vice President.

709
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,811
- Hello, Vice President.
- Hello, Vice President.

710
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:31,945
Congratulations.

711
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:34,411
Being promoted to manager is a good thing.

712

Thank you, Mr. Han.

713
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:41,578
There are so many of you, take the next one.

714
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,945
Mr. Han seems to be nicer to Cindy.

715
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,745
The elevator is here, let's get in.

716
00:35:57,745 --> 00:35:59,478
Miss Gao, into the elevator.

717
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:01,945
Feet, careful with the high heels.

718
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:05,711
- Hurry up.
- Get in the elevator.

719
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:06,912
Thank you all sincerely.

720
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:08,244
Everyone has worked hard.

721
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,377
I'll say it first, don't go home

722
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,745
if you're not drunk.

723
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:13,411
Okay.

724
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:16,344
Not going home.

725
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,311
Cindy Wang.

726
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:23,311
Didn't expect you to show up suddenly

727
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,078
to give me a surprise.

728
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:29,144
- Come on, join us.
- Let's do it together.

729
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:31,778
Gao Shuangyun, congratulations.

730
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:33,844
Thank you, congratulations.

731
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:35,745
- Take a seat.
- Come, sit here, come on.

732
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:37,311
You sit here.

733
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:39,344
- Okay.
- I'll interrupt, that one.

734
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:40,510
Yingjun, you're here.

735
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,010
You go back first, I'll drink for you.

736
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,144
I'll go back first.

737
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:46,677
He's under strict wife control.

738
00:36:46,677 --> 00:36:47,945
Curfew at eight o'clock.

739
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:50,778
Don't make it hard for him,
I'll drink on his behalf.

740
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,711
You go back first, really.

741
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:57,377
Yingjun, it's okay.

742
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:58,377
If it's really like this,

743
00:36:58,377 --> 00:36:59,478
then you'd better go back first.

744
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,544
Be careful on the road.

745
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:06,912
Right, I forgot.

746
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:09,043
Thanks for the reminder, I'll go back first.

747
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,945
Sorry, then I'll leave first.

748
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:13,144
- Okay.
- Then you guys drink slowly.

749
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:14,478
I'm off.

750
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:15,745
OK, goodbye.

751
00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:18,210
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

752
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,210
Goodbye, have a good trip.

753
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,578
- Goodbye.
- Be careful on the road.

754
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:24,210
Then I'll just sit here.

755
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,111
Come on, Xiaoting.

756
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,111
Don't drink, you're on your period, aren't you?

757
00:37:29,111 --> 00:37:31,111
You can't, you drink for her.

758
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,144
I'll help you,
give her a cup of hot Oolong tea.

759
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:36,144
You're on your period?

760
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,745
What are we waiting for? Cheers!

761
00:37:40,745 --> 00:37:41,778
Congratulations!

762

765
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:50,111
Okay, thank you.

766
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:54,177
Five, six, seven, eight.

767
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,278
Kelp.

768
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:57,711
Lost.

769
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:59,344
Bye.

770
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:00,411
I'm going home to see my boyfriend.

771
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,244
Bye.

772

773
00:38:03,745 --> 00:38:04,912
I'm leaving.

774
00:38:04,912 --> 00:38:07,344
- Give it a wipe. Bye.
- Wipe your hands.

775
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:20,311
You guys must be really thirsty.

776

Still drinking?

777

Wait a moment.

- Do you dare?

then you'll be my secretary.

785
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,711
OK.

00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:02,010
The sales department's war

787

is about to start.

788
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,544
The rule is

drink from here to here.

790
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,510
The fastest drinker who doesn't throw up

791
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,544
and isn't drunk

792
00:39:17,544 --> 00:39:19,912
wins.

793
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:24,278
Be careful, I can hold my liquor very well.

794
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,745
Watch out, I might take your manager position,

795
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:29,778
and return to glory.

796
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:32,745
It's not yet clear who will win or lose.

797
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,278
Secretary Wang.

798
00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:38,677
Let's add two of the boss's special drinks.

799
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:40,811
That wouldn't be too much, would it?

800
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:44,445
Having too much to drink.

801
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,010
Let's have something to help with digestion.

802
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,611
It's hard not to throw up

803
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:50,949
after drinking that lactic acid drink.

804
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,210
Do you two want to reconsider?

805
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,377
Here, with my first drink.

806
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,244
Let's toast to your promotion first,

807
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:57,912
and thank you for your rescue.

808
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:59,445
I accept your congratulations.

809
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:01,010
You might not have warmed up
your manager's seat

810
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,177
before it's returned to me.

811
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:06,711
No, I'll definitely fill this position well
and completely.

816

You can do it.

817
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:43,177
You're good.

818
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:46,510
Insert the straw there.

819
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,144
At this pace, don't rush.

820
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:50,317
Don't rush.

821
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,437
Okay.

822
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:07,244
It's a critical moment now.

823
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:11,078
I knew it.

824
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:14,912
Cindy Wang, you'll eventually

825
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:17,278
lose to me.

826
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:25,111
You!

827
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:27,778
- You!
- Gao Shuangyun, you can't throw up, okay?

828
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,912
If you throw up, you lose, okay?

829
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:31,043
You drink.

830
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:32,711
I'll go look.

831
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:34,377
You pay the bill, I'll go take a look.

Gao Shuangyun.

833
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:37,877
Put it on our company's account.

Construction company.

835
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,445

Playing with the puppy over there?

838
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:49,311
Puppy, go pee.

00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:58,144
Are you okay?

Congratulations on the promotion, Miss Wang.

852

Cindy, you don't need to attend the meeting.

853

I have a way to deal with him.

00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:46,411
It's only 10%.

896
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:49,244
The pressure shouldn't be too great, right?

897
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:50,978
No, it won't be.

898
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:52,445
It's

899
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:55,677
a sense of responsible belonging.

900
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:56,778
Congratulations!

901
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,144
You're finally going to have your own house.

902
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:01,711
Thank you.

903
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,043
OK

904
00:45:03,043 --> 00:45:04,877
I'm Cindy Wang.

905
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:09,445
It's because I bought a house
that I can't quit my job now.

906
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:11,144
Perhaps,

907
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:14,711
this is the sweet burden.
