your dad still has things to do in Taipei.

Okay, tomorrow, Grandpa will go
and check on them for you, okay?

00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:57,213
Wait until you come next time,

38
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,380
the baby birds will have grown up,

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,880

Why are you coming back to Taipei with me?

66

were discussing some serious topics.

We weren't fighting.

75
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,079
Daddy, don't lie to me anymore.

76
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,213

played the game of guessing animals with me

79
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,814
and then played charades.

80
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:58,646
They must have been trying
to divert my attention.

81

Meng Heng briefly followed Yingjun.

120
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,381
Do you think he should
continue following Yingjun

121
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,780

Sorry, what did you say?

124
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:12,447
I'm asking if Meng Heng should
continue to follow Yingjun or Yazi.

125
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,347
Or is it that you can't bear
to part with your little follower

126
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,179
and want to continue leading him?

127
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,046
Let him follow Yingjun.

128
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,046
Yazi has more cases recently.

129
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,214
She might be too busy

130
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,981
to teach Meng Heng.

131
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:26,080
Yingjun can work on construction
sites and also in sales.

132
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,748
He should be more comprehensive.

133
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:30,080
I see.

134
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,247
Additionally, double-check the appointments

135

A good sleep can make you feel spirited, right?

142
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:00,447
Right, for the boss's meeting later,

143
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,913
he should be discussing
the sales performance part.

144

148

is pretty similar to mine.

Actually, we have a good
understanding of each other at work.

If we could have decided to cooperate earlier,

151

that would have been great.

152
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,714
I think the boss might not agree.

153
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:25,947
Because…

I'm sorry.

You've already found out
about the boss's back sprain.

about any supporting measures?

164
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:56,714
Does he lack plaster?

165
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,981
Or do I have to figure it out myself?

00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,646

Mr. Cai.

171
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:16,813
Okay, thank you.

172

- Mr. Cai, is your back still bothering you?
- Yes.

173
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,347
Do you want me to get you some medicine?

174

No, that's okay. Zhou.

- Yes.
- Could you pull a chair over for me?

176
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,980
- Okay.
- I think I'd better sit a bit higher.

177
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:33,980
I can't, my waist, can't stay slouched here.

178
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,079
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

179
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,414

180
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,613
Take it slowly.

181
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,347
Excuse me.

182
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,547
Sorry.

183
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:45,547
- Be careful.
- OK.

184
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,279
- Is the cushion okay like this?
- Yes, much better.

185
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,014
- Does that feel a bit more comfortable?
- Yes, much better, thank you.

186
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:50,948
- Good.
- Thank you.

187
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,381
Boss, have you seen a doctor for your back?

188
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,514
A strained back can be a major
or minor issue, don't take it lightly.

189
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:57,313
Yes, I know, that's why
I went to see the doctor.

190
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,680
I also got some painkillers.

191
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,079
But the doctor said that this

192
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,914
might

193
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:03,980
not heal so quickly.

194
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,381
Boss, I've heard

195
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,446
that steaming sweet potatoes with rice wine

196
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,680
is the best solution to this problem.

197
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,680
Rice wine steamed sweet potatoes?

198
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,980
What kind of folk remedy is that?

199
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,847
Must be one of those internet hoaxes.

200
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:23,313
Li Mi.

201
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,246
Sorry to disturb everyone's meeting.

202
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:27,047
Um, Manager Wu, Jia is asking

203
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:30,714
- if the house viewing gift should be this.
- This one, huh?

204
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,980
What's this house viewing gift this time?

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,214
Let me take a look.

206
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,781
A waist clip, this…

207
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:39,146
As a house viewing gift?

208
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,881
Quite a coincidence, Boss.

209
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,446
This thing is especially good
for supporting the back,

210
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:44,414
and it can also improve blood circulation.

211
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:45,680
It's particularly suitable for you.

212
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,914
Back support?

213
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,748
Come on, take it out.

214
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:50,381
Boss, do you want to give it a try?

215
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,079
Okay, I'll try.

216
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,079
I'll help you.

217
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,214
Jia just wants

218
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:58,813
to let those who live in apartments
and are looking to change houses know

219
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:00,748
that buying a place with an elevator

220
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,948
is the best remedy for taking
care of tendons and bones.

221
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:05,847
Reverse thinking.

222
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:07,980
This is an interesting idea.

223
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,113
Not bad.

224
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,279
I think customers should be happy

225
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,948
with this house viewing gift.

226
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,079
Customers are not that important.

227
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,180
Boss, your health

228
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,446
is what's most important.

229
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:17,480
Okay.

230
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,581
Thanks.

231
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,581
So, let us start the meeting.

232
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,480
- Alright.
- Meeting, okay.

233
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,514
Cindy, it's okay, you stay.

234
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:28,613
Stay.

235
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:31,014
Sit down.

236
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,246
Okay.

237
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,613
Chen.

238
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:34,781
Come on, let's go.

239
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:36,581
Chen.

240
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:40,680
It is clearly a senior management meeting.

241
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,914
Why is Cindy Wang, the secretary

242
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:43,813
able to stay in there?

243
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,047
Don't think too much about it.

244
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,948
The boss might have things to explain to her.

245
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,246
Cindy was supposed to be

246
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:51,881
one of the participants in the meeting.

247
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,680
She originally wasn't a secretary.

248
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,446
If it weren't for being framed before,

249
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,214
I believe she would have
become a manager long ago.

250
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,079
Demoted to secretary?

251
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,214
Cunfeng didn't tell me.

252
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,347
I think she didn't

253
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:15,781
want you to worry,

254
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,547
which is why she didn't tell you.

255
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,047
Originally, I thought

256
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,813
my daughter was being petty,

257
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,214
throwing a fit.

258
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,414
But now that I heard the full story,

259
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,014
I'd be mad too.

260
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:28,313
Mr. Wang.

261
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,214
Sit down first. Don't be angry.

262
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,214
Let me explain, okay?

263
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:33,847
Explain?

264
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,180
There's nothing to explain.

265
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,246
You knew what kind of person Han was,

266
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,646
yet you angered my daughter over such a person.

267
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,279
I want to ask you something.

268
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,813
Does my daughter

269
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:45,381
rank so low in your heart?

270
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,781
Cindy is very important

271
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,381
in my heart.

272
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,714
I could even fire Han Xinzheng for her.

273
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,347
Is that so?

274
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,347
As long as you, Mr. Wang,
and Cindy both insist,

275
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:57,980
there's no problem.

276
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,279
But the problem is,

277
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,813
if I really fire Han Xinzheng,

278
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,014
and the person I found later
is not capable enough,

279
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,547
what should I do?

280
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,113
Can you not drag others into this?

281
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,948
If the person you find is not capable,

282
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,414
it's because you're not good at judging people.

283
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,646
Yes, so I should be even more clear
about public and private matters.

284
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,914
Isn't it?

285
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,480
Fine.

286
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,781
You have the freedom
to employ anyone on your own.

287
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,180
But you are also a father.

288
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,914
If Yi suffers this kind of grievance,

289
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,748
can you accept it?

290
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:44,079
Even if Cunfeng was being unreasonable today,

291
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,646
it should be me who teaches and scolds her.

292
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,480
You must remember this.

293
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:50,914
I know.

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,313
Actually, in this matter,

295
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,948
Cindy was not wrong to begin with.

296
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,146
I handled it poorly

297
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:58,881
and made her unhappy.

298
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:00,279
Also, thank you

299
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,180
for your understanding of my difficulties.

300
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,948
You called me out here.

301
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:09,014
I think you plan

302
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:11,381
to continue this relationship, right?

303
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,581
Of course.

304
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,980
Cindy, in my heart,

305
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,514
is truly important.

306
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,381
Mr. Tianfu,

307
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:27,014
have some tea.

308
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,480
Just leave it.

309
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,480
That act you put on
in front of the boss just now,

310
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,414
it seems that the boss was quite satisfied.

311
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,547
So are we really going

312
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,279
to place a large order for waist clamps

313
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,014
as house viewing gifts?

314
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,313
Why not?

315
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:43,113
It's a gimmick, right?

316
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,047
The more people discuss it
on social networking sites,

317
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,680
the more exposure we get, OK?

318
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,813
Good, then I will ask Jia to handle it later.

319
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:52,381
Later, call everyone for a meeting.

320
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,279
Also, please urge Guo Shijie for me

321
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,980
about the list of developers
from Vice President Han.

322
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,313
But Guo Shijie has been busy
teaching Fang Iris recently.

323
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:01,914
Is he a unicellular organism like you?

324
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:05,446
Can he only do one thing at a time?

325
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,581
Although Vice President Han was not clean,

326
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,047
before he left,

327
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,180
he left a big opportunity
for the business department.

328
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,014
Cindy Wang and Gao Shuangyun,

329
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:19,279
these two women can't possibly finish it.

330
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,813
We don't need to be polite.

331
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,480
Am I right?

332
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,847
If the planning department is going to expand,

333
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,847
and everyone gets a raise,

334
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,214
it all depends on this opportunity.

335
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:32,279
Okay.

336
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,881
I understand. I'll contact
Guo Shijie right away.

337
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:37,079
Remember to drink the tea to cool your temper.

338
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:45,872
[Planning Department Manager's Office]

339
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
Chen, did you personally…

340
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,613
bring in the approval form?

341
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,414
I need to buy something for Mr. Cai,

342
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,246
so I brought it along the way.

343
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,313
Thank you.

344
00:14:58,313 --> 00:14:59,581
Thank you, Chen.

345
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,313
Mr. Cai signed these urgent documents later.

346
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:06,079
You need to process them as soon as possible.

347
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,047
Okay.

348
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:10,113
I'm off.

349
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,613
Chen probably didn't hear

350
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,014
the conversation between
Mr. Tianfu and me, I suppose.

351
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
Do you have plans for the evening?

352
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:26,813
Keep me, a single lady,

353
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,581
company for dinner.

354
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,381
Sure.

355
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,279
See you.

356
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
Chen Duomi.

357
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,948
What's up?

358
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,446
Didn't the boss just

359
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,581
convene an emergency meeting?

360
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,781
Is there something important?

361
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,079
Yes.

362
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,547
He gave me some business cards of clients,

363
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:07,613
asking me to arrange appointments

364
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:09,446
and visit clients with Gao Shuangyun.

365
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,781
If necessary, he can join us.

366
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,113
Then why do you look so lifeless?

367
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,646
It doesn't sound like
there's any problem at all.

368
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:18,446
That's exactly where the problem lies.

369
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:20,113
Can't you hear it?

370
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,748
The boss is hinting to me and Gao Shuangyun

371
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:22,914
that we can no longer rely on others.

372
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:25,547
We must develop the business
with our own abilities.

373
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,813
If necessary, he can pull strings for us.

374
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:33,446
This does sound quite stressful.

375
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:34,547
Besides,

376
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:35,948
if we ask him to pull strings,

377
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:37,381
it'll be a slap in the face
for me and Gao Shuangyun

378
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,146
for having no working capability.

379
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:40,881
And if we relied on him,

380
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,547
can the performance be counted on us?

381
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,613
It's so complicated.

382
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,613
How much meaning can be
behind just one sentence?

383
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:49,646
Fortunately, I studied accounting.

384
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:50,948
When it comes to numbers,

385
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:52,948
one is one, and zero is zero.

386
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:54,381
It's much simpler.

387
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:57,781
So you see, the workplace
is just like the harem.

388
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,481
One must be cunning to survive.

389
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,514
But at least work doesn't harm people.

390
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,213
People do.

391
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,914
So I have to work hard

392
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:08,814
and forget those annoying things.

393
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,713
Annoying matters?

394
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:16,046
You mean the thing about your
argument with Zhang Shiping?

395
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:18,213
You are avoiding it, you know.

396
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:19,914
I'm not.

397
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm just…

398
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,713
creating some space by pulling away.

399
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:25,514
It's the aesthetics of love.

400
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:27,880
Aesthetics of love?

401
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,981
How can you even say that?

402
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:32,046
I don't know why I can say it either.

403
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:33,947
But honestly,

404
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,514
even without Zhang Shiping,

405
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,880
you could still choose Meng Heng.

406
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,279
What are you talking about?

407
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,814
Follow your heart.

408
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,947
And I think Meng Heng,

409
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,546
he…

410
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:46,713
What about him?

411
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:50,748
Speak of the devil.

412
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:55,481
I'm going to chat with my online friend.

413
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:59,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

414
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,914
What do you want to ask me?

415
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,247
Nothing much.

416
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:06,414
What's this?

417
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,014
I just passed by the counter

418
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,147
and saw your parcel, so I picked it up for you.

419
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:13,446
Who sent so many? What, feeding pigs?

420
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,147
Just kidding.

421
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,347
[I am bad, so go ahead and dispose of me]
Who's that?

422
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,780
Sent by a bad thing.

423
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,347
Do you, do you have time?

424
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,613
Can you take a look

425
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:32,247
at the proposal I wrote?

426
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,613
Sure.

427
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,713
Then this…

428
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,847
Put it in the fridge for now.

429
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,713
[Jingdu Milan]

430
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:43,847
You wrote 'destruction'
instead of 'construction'.

431
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:44,613
- What's your problem?
- I'm sorry.

432
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:46,347
Did your Chinese teacher have a problem?

433
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:47,981
It's my problem.

434
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:49,880
If it's straight, then it's straight.

435
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,647
Can you not make one straight and one sideways?

436
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,680
Okay, teacher, I'm sorry.

437
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:56,080
In this way, Yingjun will definitely think

438
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,347
that I haven't taught you well.

439
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:58,814
And then this management mode.

440
00:18:58,814 --> 00:18:59,880
What is the mode?

441
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,847
You can list it, break it down into a subitem.

442
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:03,880
Bullet points.

443
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,414
Just a simple list format will do.

444
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:06,680
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

445
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,080
Mr. Wang, what's wrong?

446
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,446
Let me tell you.

447
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,581
Cunfeng is acting strange today.

448
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,113
How so?

449
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,481
I'll tell you secretly.

450
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,581
When Cunfeng is in a bad mood,

451
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:31,546
she buys a lot of potato chips
and cola and eats them.

452
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,680
Is she eating them?

453
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,981
She is.

454
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:38,914
But it's strange.

455
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:41,213
She doesn't seem to be in a bad mood.

456
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,247
That's good.

457
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:45,481
Has she finished eating?

458
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,279
She should finish eating very soon.

459
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,247
Because she's not eating alone.

460
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:54,514
Meng Heng, who lives across,
is eating with her.

461
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,514
No wonder he often gives her a ride to work.

462
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,180
Did you catch the main point?

463
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,014
Living across.

464
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:07,080
I know.

465
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,581
Mr. Wang, thank you for telling me this.

466
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:11,314
But I am busy right now.

467
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:13,914
Can we talk about this later? Goodbye.

468
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,147
You…

469
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,546
I think this way it's more layered.

470
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,613
Where is it layered?

471
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,514
Excuse me.

472
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:26,446
I have no place to sit.

473
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:27,914
Pops, what are you doing?

474
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:29,414
The proposal, right?

475
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:31,814
I can help review the project proposal.

476
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,546
I know a thing or two.

477
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,380
You don't understand this.

478
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,414
No, you see.

479
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
Listen.

480
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,314
I think there's an issue with your proportions.

481
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:46,680
Okay?

482
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,380
Go back and take a look yourself.

483
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,414
Delicious.

484
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,814
Continue.

485
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,680
The new company's decoration is being rushed.

486
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,279
Regarding the recruitment part…

487
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,213
Excuse me.

488
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,546
Regarding the recruitment part,

489
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,347
I have already sent it to your mailbox.

490
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:17,380
I have already preliminarily
screened the HR files.

491
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,880
You can review it again.

492
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Are you okay? Have some hot tea.

493
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,314
Caught a cold?

494
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,147
I'm fine, thank you, Director.

495
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:28,014
Additionally,

496
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:30,613
as for the sustainable housing project
with the construction company,

497
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,446
the building permits and the schedule planning

498
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:33,914
are all progressing as scheduled.

499
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:35,748
Director, you can rest assured.

500
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,414
You work very efficiently.

501
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:40,347
The overall progress is much
faster than I expected.

502
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,647
Perhaps it's because of
my long years of service.

503
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:44,981
I have some experience, after all.

504
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,380
Additionally,

505
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,914
there's one more thing.

506
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,147
I…

507
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,847
Speak your mind.

508
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:01,613
It's just that…

509
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,780
Lately, I've been running around outside.

510
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,847
And often, there's a need to use money.

511
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:06,514
I know I can ask accounting for funds,

512
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:09,014
but it always takes time.

513
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:11,014
And not every client

514
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:13,314
is willing to accept invoices.

515
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:16,279
So the part concerning petty cash…

516
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,347
I see.

517
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:22,414
I'll instruct accounting
to give you 100,000 tomorrow.

518
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:25,014
From now on, the petty cash will be doubled.

519
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,446
You're giving me so much at once.

520
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,147
Aren't you afraid?

521
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:33,414
Afraid?

522
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:35,780
Why would I have hired you if I were afraid?

523
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:40,814
Moreover,

524
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:43,080
if you don't cherish this second chance,

525
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,546
if we are to talk about loss,

526
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:47,446
my loss is merely money,

527
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:48,546
but what you would lose

528
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,347
is your life.

529
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:52,180
You are the one at a greater disadvantage.

530
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,613
Thank you, Director,

531
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,247
for trusting me.

532
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:02,180
I won't fail your trust.

533
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:06,046
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave now.

534
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,314
Thank you, Director.

535
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,347
Are you still staying at the hotel?

536
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,613
Yes.

537
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:19,947
Living in a hotel

538
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:22,481
under air conditioning for long
is not good for your health.

539
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:24,147
Go find a place outside.

540
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:25,713
If you are worried about money,

541
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,380
you can get an advance on your salary.

542
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,680
It's fine.

543
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,713
It's more convenient for me
to stay at a hotel alone.

544
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,113
Moreover,

545
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,814
there's a housekeeping service.

546
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,713
Good night, Director.

547
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,481
- Come on.
- Thank you.

548
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:52,613
Thank you.

549
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,380
It's indeed the wine for me.

550
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,947
Chen, you like the drier sake, huh?

551
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:13,546
Don't you think it has
a bit of a sweet aftertaste?

552
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:15,046
A sweet aftertaste?

553
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:30,247
I feel that our work

554
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:31,814
is just like sake.

555
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:33,748
First it's bitter, then it's sweet.

556
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,514
Just like some people like

557
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:39,847
to take shortcuts and use schemes.

558
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:41,748
But if their fundamental skills

559
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,647
are not solid enough,

560
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:47,814
like lacking depth in sake brewing skills,

561
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,380
a person who understands wine tasting

562
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,914
will try it once or twice,

563
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,880
and then they won't come back again.

564
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:05,880
Chen, I'm not sure I know what you mean.

565
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:15,446
I know you can endure hardship.

566
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,180
Even if some people

567
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,014
give you a lot and a lot of candy,

568
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,514
we should not forget

569
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:25,213
the principle of 'bitter first, sweet later'.

570
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,147
Yingjun.

571
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,147
Yingjun.

572
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,147
- Morning.
- Good thing you're here.

573
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:56,046
I went to look for you yesterday
but you had already left work.

574
00:25:56,613 --> 00:26:00,380
I was wondering when I could
find you to copy some documents.

575
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
Or should I wait a bit…

576
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,947
Morning meeting…

577
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:05,814
What are you rushing for?

578
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,296
I…

579
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,713
It's my girlfriend.

580
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:13,147
She thinks I have no future
in the planning department.

581
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:14,613
She wants me to change jobs.

582
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:16,780
Otherwise,

583
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,546
she won't marry me.

584
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,613
Okay, I got it.

585
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:26,947
I'll talk to you when I get out.

586
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:28,847
Really?

587
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,247
Thank you, Yingjun.

588
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,113
I…

589
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:33,380
Keep your voice down.

590
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,880
Keep it a secret.

591
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,380
I'll wait for you.

592
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:40,780
Let's go.

593
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:46,981
Why haven't I seen Meng Heng?

594
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,481
I asked Meng Heng to deliver
some transaction documents

595
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,180
to the management committee
of the company's construction project.

596
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,446
He'll come in later.

597
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,880
The new performance targets
have been uploaded to the cloud.

598
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,914
In addition to individual ones,

599
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,814
there are also departmental total performances.

600
00:26:57,814 --> 00:26:59,347
Let's all work hard to achieve them.

601
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,748
Everyone has performance targets,

602
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,713
except for someone.

603
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:07,847
That's true, when doing serious work,

604
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:09,713
they'd use the fact that they
are a secretary as an excuse.

605
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,581
But when it's time to receive a bonus,
they'd say we're all in this together.

606
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,213
What a smart tactic.

607
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:15,748
I never thought of it.

608
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,247
- Yazi, actually…
- It's okay.

609
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:21,147
I'll explain it to her myself.

610
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:23,514
Director Xu.

611
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,414
Yes, I don't have the same

612
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:26,581
performance targets as everyone else.

613
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,914
But what I need to do
is land development and bidding.

614
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,647
If I don't secure one of them
within the deadline,

615
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,847
I'll leave, how about that?
Are you interested in joining?

616
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:42,080
Anyway, let's give it our all together.

617
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,347
Strive for performance.

618
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:52,481
Yingjun, the information and list
of the land developers

619
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:55,347
could you copy a set for me when you have time?

620
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:56,847
The information and list of land developers?

621
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:58,314
- Right.
- Okay, no problem.

622
00:27:58,314 --> 00:27:59,347
Thank you.

623
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:00,748
Oh right, Cindy.

624
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:02,748
Take a look at this document.

625
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,314
Please double-check this list for me.

626
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:08,014
- Cindy?
- Yes.

627
00:28:08,014 --> 00:28:09,713
Look who's here.

628
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:16,581
Cunfeng, where are you taking me?

629
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:17,613
Come on.

630
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,880
Where are we going?

631
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,446
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

632
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,814
What are you here for?

633
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:29,847
I'm just fulfilling someone's trust,
a matter of loyalty.

634
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,347
Shiping pleaded with me earnestly

635
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,546
to deliver this love-filled bento box

636
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,014
and this glittering apology bouquet.

637
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:40,014
This bouquet is pretty practical, huh?

638
00:28:40,014 --> 00:28:42,113
After appreciating it, you can also

639
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:44,748
eat sweets and give birth to a son next year.

640
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:47,113
You know, Pops,

641
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:49,581
your acting is really off the mark.

642
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:51,981
What do you mean by fulfilling someone's trust?

643
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,213
This

644
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,947
curry rice with two poached eggs

645
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:57,680
was made by you, right?

646
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,847
So smart.

647
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:01,914
Impressive.

648
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,514
Truly my daughter.

649
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,314
But I'm afraid Shiping is too busy

650
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,647
to comfort his "lord".

651
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,748
I feel like you're selling off your daughter.

652
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:12,581
What do you mean by "Comfort his lord"?

653
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:13,647
Besides, you should stay

654
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:14,748
out of our business.

655
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:16,180
What do you mean by "stay out of it"?

656
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,680
You're my only daughter.

657
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,514
And you're my only dad.

658
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:22,347
Maybe you should think it through.

659
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,380
About what?

660
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,814
Did I ever meddle in your affairs
when you had so many girlfriends?

661
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:28,014
Yes, you did.

662
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:30,380
Remember what happened with Aunt Meizi?

663
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,613
Dad, I'm really busy.

664
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:34,314
Maybe you should go back first.

665
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,780
No, people say even if you're busy,
you should still join me for a coffee.

666
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,647
The least you could do is have
a meal with your old man, right?

667
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,981
Mr. Wang, hello.

668
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,514
Hi.

669
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:45,981
I just heard you were going to have a meal.

670
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:47,814
There's a well-rated restaurant
near our company.

671
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:49,314
Do you want to go?

672
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:50,880
You know the one I'm talking about.

673
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,680
No.

674
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,046
Cunfeng said she was very busy.

675
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,314
Let's not disturb her.

676
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,279
That's right.

677
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,748
- Aren't you an Uber driver?
- Yes, I am.

678
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,981
Can you take me home now?

679
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,914
Right now?

680
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:10,613
Yes, now, because I left in a hurry,

681
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:12,713
and I think I forgot to turn off the tap.

682
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,880
I don't know how much money
has been wasted on that water.

683
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,814
Please help me, come on.

684
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,446
Here you go, Mr. Wang, this way.

685
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:25,647
This TV is really big.

686
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:27,380
Yes, Mr. Wang, are you feeling cold?

687
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,481
Do you want to turn down
the air conditioner a bit?

688
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:30,880
It's okay.

689
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,914
Alright.

690
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:34,613
Meng Heng.

691
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,981
Let's go to 101, to 101.

692
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:39,147
To 101?

693
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:41,814
I thought you were going back
to turn off the tap.

694
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:43,647
I just remembered.

695
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:46,613
I remember I did turn it off, I did.

696
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:48,279
Oh, right.

697
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,180
Later, you should buy some fruit to take back

698
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,748
for your colleagues to eat.

699
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:52,780
Remember to say I bought them.

700
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,080
Okay.

701
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,414
We'll go to the Yuche River later.

702
00:30:56,414 --> 00:30:58,380
That's nice, okay.

703
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:03,314
You feel nice, but I don't.

704
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:06,147
I just want to have dinner with Cindy.

705
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:11,780
Mr. Li.

706
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,347
Can you contact the crew for me

707
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:16,780
to see if the plumbing and electrical
work can be completed within this week?

708
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,147
Sure, no problem.

709
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,514
If needed, we can add more hands.

710
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,213
I know, I'll go there tomorrow.

711
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:25,347
Thank you.

712
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:26,981
Alright, see you tomorrow, thank you.

713
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,247
Goodbye.

714
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:00,014
Yun.

715
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:02,279
If I say what a coincidence

716
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,446
that I happen to run into you,

717
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:04,748
would it sound fake?

718
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,947
Zhou.

719
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:09,247
I'm a bit tired today.

720
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:10,847
I don't really feel like going out.

721
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:13,780
Please don't get me wrong.

722
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,314
I know you've had a long day at work.

723
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,014
I waited here for you to get off work

724
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:19,914
not to ask you out.

725
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,314
I just wanted to help you change the curtains.

726
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,180
Didn't you say

727
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:29,446
that you were not very good at installing them?

728
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:36,546
It's not really nice
to keep troubling you, is it?

729
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:39,213
It's no trouble at all, not one bit.

730
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:41,647
Besides, getting it done earlier

731
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:44,514
might allow you to see

732
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,046
a different view sooner.

733
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:48,113
Right?

734
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:57,680
You worked hard today.

the best amount of sleep per day for a person

Yes.

to report anything to you,

about the matter with Vice President Han.

882
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:18,014

00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:21,106
♫ I wait for you ♫

922
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:26,144
♫ To become no longer illusory ♫

923
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:31,232
♫ Those past hurts ♫

924
00:45:31,776 --> 00:45:34,501
♫ The involuntary evil ♫

925
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:38,592
♫ All are left behind ♫

926
00:45:39,422 --> 00:45:44,581
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

927
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:49,504
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

928
00:45:49,504 --> 00:45:52,323
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

929
00:45:52,323 --> 00:45:57,504
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

930
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,790
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

931
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,085
♫ Because of you ♫

932
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:08,000
♫ I'm no longer afraid
of loneliness and solitude ♫
