177
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,908
I can go to the social event by myself tonight.

178
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:39,941
You follow me early in the morning and return late every day.

179
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,708
Take a day off today. Find a friend and go see a movie.

180
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,142
Thank you, Vice President.

181
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,875
You should also hurry up and get a girlfriend.

182
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,720
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

183
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,040
No problem.

184
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:03,942
By the way, Vice President, why would you want to buy an electronic wardrobe?

185
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,776
It was a gift from a good friend of mine.

186
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:08,530
It can steam sterilize and disinfect.

187
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,770
It's quite convenient.

188
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:11,341
That's pretty impressive.

189
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,242
Thanks for the bread.

190
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:16,208
Not bad.

191
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,775
Do I need to accompany you to Mr. Xi's dinner?

192
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:22,074
No need, I don't like my colleagues having to work overtime for me.

193
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:25,408
Where's the location then? Do I need to make a note of it?

194
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:26,960
No need to record this.

195
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,040
You can leave work now.

196
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:34,750
[Battery 100 percent]

197
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,042
I'll take my leave then.

198
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:42,275
6:00, off work.

199
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:45,975
7:00, Mr. Xi's dinner.

200
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,942
The air purifier needs to be turned on every day.

201
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:08,308
- Zhou. 
 - Manager Gao.

202
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:10,242
Are you also going to attend Mr. Xi's dinner?

203
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:11,809
- Yes. 
 - Just in time.

204
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,174
I just sent the Vice President downstairs.

205
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:15,042
I'll give him a call and ask him to give you a ride too.

206
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,650
No need, I'll go there by myself.

207
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,860
No need to trouble him.

208
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,875
All right, take care on your way.

209
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,609
- Okay, 
 - I'm off.

210
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:28,741
Zhou, thank you for the sandwich.

211
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:31,950
But how did you know I don't add mayonnaise?

212
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:35,009
I… I just…

213
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,376
I discovered it unintentionally before, and I remembered it till now.

214
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,776
No problem.

215
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:41,880
You're really attentive.

216
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,390
A secretary likes to note these kinds of minor details.

217
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,442
Then, you go ahead with your work.

218
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:51,074
Okay, goodbye.

219
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,074
Wine.

220
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,576
Silly me.

221
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,808
The perfume smells so good. Who are you trying to seduce?

222
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:42,674
What do you think?

223
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,574
I hope this scent is exclusive to me.

224
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:57,342
Then, in this case, is this considered an unconventional date?

225
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:58,742
Of course.

226
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:02,775
Vice President.

227
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:07,204
Vice President.

228
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:13,360
What's the matter?

229
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,241
M-Manager Gao?

230
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,241
I saw the Vice President when I came down, so I hitched a ride with him.

231
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:25,476
Vice President, you've forgotten your wine.

232
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,709
Look at my memory.

233
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,175
- Put it in the back for me. 
 - Okay.

234
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:41,675
Then if there's nothing else, leave work early and take some rest.

235
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,409
Okay, Vice President, take care.

236
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,674
- Bye, Manager Gao. 
 - Goodbye.

237
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,374
Zhou probably hasn't discovered anything, right?

238
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,041
Isn't it better if he has?

239
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,974
Don't you want to make our relationship public?

240
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,108
But I've decided to take your advice.

241
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,842
First prove our capabilities, then go public.

242
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,300
This time, the case with Mr. Xi is a very good opportunity.

243
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:18,342
I'm telling you. You know Mr. Xi has malicious intentions towards you.

244
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:22,109
Without this case, there'll still be many opportunities later, why do you have to…?

245
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,108
I don't want to wait for later.

246
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,808
You know how I got this manager position.

247
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:30,508
I want to quickly prove that I'm capable, and not just lucky.

248
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,241
Only then can I secure my position firmly.

249
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:35,990
Otherwise, Cindy will quickly pull me down.

250
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:43,174
So, you want me to see my woman step by step into the tiger's mouth.

251
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:45,375
Rest assured.

252
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,742
I'm no longer the girl who doesn't know anything.

253
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:51,375
I know how to deal with him.

254
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,908
Besides, I still have you, don't I?

255
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,541
Okay.

256
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:05,909
Cindy, I'm getting off work first.

257
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,475
Okay, bye.

258
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,842
I'm getting off work, too.

259
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:17,242
You're leaving work without finishing your tasks?

260
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,942
What can't be done today will be done tomorrow. Work won't run away.

261
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,676
There are plans for tomorrow.

262
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,875
And don't you want to learn how to schedule things from me?

263
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:29,207
Yes, I do, but it's during working hours.

264
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,108
Your efficiency isn't good when you work overtime. And it's also a violation of the labor law.

265
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,408
Young people insist on not working overtime.

266
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,208
Today, I've finally witnessed it.

267
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,275
It's not like we insist on not working overtime.

268
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,175
But rather... not to engage in meaningless time-wasting.

269
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:47,241
Let's discuss what "meaningless" is, what is the definition of "meaningless"?

270
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:50,142
- Off work! 
 - Meaningless is not having…

271
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,875
Let's go, let's have dinner together.

272
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,108
I can't, I have to work overtime today.

273
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,175
How about another day?

274
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,241
I thought you'd be less busy after becoming a secretary.

275
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,875
I'm just getting the hang of the job.

276
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,175
There're some things I want to handle first.

277
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:09,442
But the restaurant I booked is the one you said you really wanted to try,

278
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,908
but could never get a reservation for.

279
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:13,207
Really?

280
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:16,808
And have you bonded with the intern yet?

281
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:17,941
She'll treat you to dinner.

282
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,275
No. I still have to work overtime.

283
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,608
I'll invite you to dinner another day then.

284
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:26,108
Then I'll have to check out the place for you.

285
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:30,107
I'll taste it for you, to see if it's good or not.

286
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:33,208
Looking at the texture, and that flavor.

287
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,708
Just go already, you're so annoying.

288
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,141
- Okay, let it be. 
 - Sister Doula.

289
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,908
- Do you want a lift? 
 - It's Sister Duomi.

290
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,242
Sister Duomi, do you want a lift?

291
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:44,909
How are you going to give me a lift? With what?

292
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,075
I... I'll drive.

293
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,474
I'm troubling you both.

294
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,808
Please take good care of us.

295
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,808
Dig in.

296
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,741
- Mr. Xi, I'm late. 
 - Mr. Xi.

297
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,575
Hello, I'm Guo.

298
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,520
This is our Director Zheng and Director Li.

299
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,509
- Director Zheng, Director Li, hello. 
 - Director Zheng, Director Li.

300
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,076
This is Vice President Han and Manager Gao from Jingdu Construction.

301
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:13,608
- A handsome guy and a beautiful lady. 
 - A person of good appearance, isn't it?

302
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:16,142
Mr. Xi, I've specially brought a bottle of fine wine for you.

303
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:19,375
And there's a gift too, very sincere, isn't it?

304
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,208
However, this wine isn't suitable for drinking in large gulps.

305
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,541
It's meant to be savored slowly.

306
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,041
Are you looking down on us?

307
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,508
Such a small bottle, it's hardly enough to drink, right?

308
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:30,207
- Guo. 
 - Yes.

309
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:32,741
Come, have a seat, don't be shy.

310
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:33,942
Please sit.

311
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,684
Sit down.

312
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,408
Manager Gao. Please sit.

313
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,875
Both of you, come here.

314
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,742
Pour a glass then.

315
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:50,008
Let me introduce this to you.

316
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,576
What I have prepared here is 58 percent alcohol by volume.

317
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:55,342
Just as passionate and fiery as I am.

318
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:59,474
It's up to you whether to drink the whole bottle or go glass by glass. Either way is fine.

319
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,575
You want to develop the new land my company has hunted down.

320
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,676
It's very simple.

321
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:06,841
As long as I feel good.

322
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,974
I talk too crude, right?

323
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:14,442
Not at all, Mr. Xi, I'll toast to you first.

324
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:17,241
Here's to our successful cooperation.

325
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,742
Sounds good.

326
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:20,075
Mature and sensible.

327
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,975
You get it, come on.

328
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:25,541
Mr. Xi, I toast to you as well.

329
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,775
No need, you have a special task today.

330
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:30,242
You are responsible for taking care of these two elder brothers for me.

331
00:21:30,242 --> 00:21:33,175
Director Li. Director Zheng. I'll leave them to you.

332
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,708
Director Li and Director Zheng.

333
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,474
- Let me toast to you first. 
 - Mr. Xi, come on.

334
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:41,308
Today, I just want to drink with girls who smell nice.

335
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:45,007
Mr. Xi, you really have a sense of humor.

336
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:53,909
- Come on, Director Li. 
 - Yes, here.

337
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,609
- Another toast to you. 
 - Let's eat.

338
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:56,808
Don't be polite.

339
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:00,375
Try this meat, you're not afraid of getting fat, are you?

340
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:11,007
I want to have a good drink with you.

341
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,875
It's easier to pour this way.

342
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,541
Are you okay? Have you been drinking too quickly?

343
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,776
It's okay.

344
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,942
Have some soup.

345
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,442
Let me refill your drink.

346
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:37,275
Take your time, drink slowly.

347
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,009
Please excuse me for a moment.

348
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,974
Had enough rest?

349
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:45,409
Okay.

350
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,109
Manager Gao, can I call you Xiaoyun?

351
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:51,975
- Either is fine. 
 - Isn't it too intimate?

352
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,509
Not at all.

353
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:03,542
- I'm okay. 
 - No, you're too weak. Take good care of yourself.

354
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,141
- Mr. Xi, I toast to you. 
 - Here.

355
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:09,474
Hello, everyone.

356
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:16,775
I'm Miss Gao's secretary.

357
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:20,208
I'm Zhou, Vice President Han's secretary.

358
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,142
You must be Mr. Xi.

359
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,742
Manager Gao specifically instructed me

360
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,141
that she's afraid that you'd drink too much and hurt your stomach.

361
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:34,075
So, she told me to buy this to help you digest.

362
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,141
Look how considerate Manager Gao is to you.

363
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,141
Your colleague is so lively.

364
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:41,541
It helps sobering up, so you can drink more.

365
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:45,441
Okay, since Xiaoyun asked me to drink,

366
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:47,474
then I'll drink it.

367
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,609
You have to finish it.

368
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:53,642
I'll drink the whole bottle.

369
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,730
Done!

370
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,108
Honestly, am I amazing or what?

371
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,942
Then I shall be rewarded.

372
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:16,775
I want a reward.

373
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:18,442
- Mr. Xi, don't… 
 - I want the reward.

374
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,475
I want a reward.

375
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,409
Boss, are you okay?

376
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,642
Guo.

377
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,308
Hurry up.

378
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:36,708
Boss, how are you?

379
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,842
I'll take you to the restroom.

380
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:39,708
- I'll take him to the restroom first. 
 - Come this way.

381
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,474
Toilet is out the door, turn left.

382
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,075
Be careful.

383
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:47,342
Director Li. Director Zheng. Are you both okay?

384
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:48,542
I think that's about it for today.

385
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,942
- Zhou, let's send them back first. 
 - Okay.

386
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:52,308
- Director Li, be careful. 
 - Come on.

387
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,842
- Is it okay? 
 - Take it slow, right here.

388
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,974
Cind, I'm leaving Manager Gao in your hands.

389
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:59,041
- Be careful, this way. 
 - Come. 
 - Careful, slowly.

390
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,742
Watch for safety, walk carefully.

391
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:02,209
- This way. 
 - This way, please.

392
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,000
Be careful.

393
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:07,676
You've also had too much to drink, haven't you?

394
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:15,308
- Be careful. 
 - Thank you.

395
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,509
The car is here.

396
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:25,274
Sorry, driver, could you please open the door?

397
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:28,242
Meng Heng.

398
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,742
You're actually driving an uber?

399
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:32,207
Yeah, it's a part-time job.

400
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,008
This car isn't cheap.

401
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:35,942
You couldn't be a second-generation rich kid, could you?

402
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:39,208
It's debt. I bought this car with a loan.

403
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:43,174
- Come on, get in the car first. 
 - Come on, be careful.

404
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,009
Okay, come.

405
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,230
Be careful.

406
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,909
Here, your bag.

407
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,474
Thank you.

408
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,974
Why did you come here?

409
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:57,641
The Vice President called me for a rescue.

410
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,275
- What should we do? 
 - Zhou.

411
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:08,075
- Cindy, over here. 
 - What did the Vice President call us here for?

412
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:09,342
It's not to fend off drinks, is it?

413
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:12,009
No, he called us here to help.

414
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,275
- Help? 
 - Yes.

415
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:15,008
Who? Gao Shuangyun?

416
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,842
Manager Gao, right.

417
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,342
No, then why don't you just go in and take the person away?

418
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,208
What did you call me here for?

419
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,409
If it were that simple, I wouldn't have had to look for you.

420
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:23,909
The Vice President just gave special instructions, saying

421
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:28,474
we have to take Manager Gao away without offending Mr. Xi.

422
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,108
And do you know what was even more outrageous just now?

423
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:37,542
I just heard that Mr. Guo next to Mr. Xi just snuck out,

424
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,542
and made a call to book a room.

425
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,574
What?!

426
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:44,208
I know Mr. Xi is a lecher.

427
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:47,074
He even has the audacity to this extent.

428
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:48,307
This is criminal, you know.

429
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,942
Manager Gao has sacrificed so much for the company. I really can't bear it.

430
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,575
It's not worth it. I mean it's not worth it.

431
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,641
Anyway, I just can't think of any solution.

432
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,708
Do you have any ideas? Please help.

433
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,742
Did they drink a lot?

434
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,942
Seems like they drank quite a bit.

435
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:06,342
I think I have a way. That, help me take it for a moment.

436
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:10,408
- Wait for me, I'll be right back. 
 - What?

437
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:13,141
What method? Tell me first.

438
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:15,470
I have to say,

439
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,190
you really know how to adapt to the situation.

440
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,108
And luckily you vomited last time.

441
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:22,074
Otherwise, I wouldn't know the little trick.

442
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,908
- I didn't vomit. 
 - Yes, you did.

443
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:29,742
Anyway, I still want to thank you.

444
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:36,108
Right, remember to buy me a gift tomorrow.

445
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,309
I also want to thank Zhou.

446
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:39,374
Okay.

447
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:42,708
Also, next time, no matter the occasion,

448
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,108
even if you don't need my company,

449
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,808
you must tell me who will be attending and where the location is.

450
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:49,074
You have to let me know, okay?

451
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,109
I'm leaving.

452
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,541
Finally, I know why you have to leave work on the dot.

453
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,641
So, you have a side job.

454
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,641
The culture of overtime is wrong to begin with.

455
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:14,142
As for the side job, it's because I like to explore different professions,

456
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:17,376
and various ways to earn money.

457
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:21,275
But your car seems to be expensive.

458
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:23,408
If it was bought with a loan,

459
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:25,474
then can you actually make money like this?

460
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:27,409
The money hasn't disappeared.

461
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:30,374
It's just becoming the way I like.

462
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:33,509
I really don't understand what you young people think.

463
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:36,041
I'll take you home.

464
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,775
I'll give you a 20 percent discount.

465
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:39,042
20 percent off?

466
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:41,842
Thank you for your kindness today.

467
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,509
Can't do anything about it, after all.

468
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:45,675
Handsome and kind-hearted, you know.

469
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,807
What's so funny?

470
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:54,309
I'm not giving you a discount anymore.

471
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,676
All right, I'm just kidding. I want the discount.

472
00:28:57,676 --> 00:29:01,942
- Get off the car. 
 - No, I'll fasten my seatbelt

473
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:04,620
Go home by yourself.

474
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:50,950
[Uncle]

475
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:03,742
Thank our most handsome Vice President Han for rescuing me.

476
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:05,774
It's so good to have you.

477
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:08,574
You're my woman.

478
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,574
It's only right for me to protect you.

479
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:15,141
I just love hearing you say that all the time.

480
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,874
"My woman."

481
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:24,174
After hearing that, there's a feeling of being owned,

482
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:28,142
being protected, being admired,

483
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,708
being exclusively cherished and loved by a man.

484
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,942
The feeling of being cared for.

485
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:36,708
Because you truly are the woman I cherish, love

486
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,274
and protect, the only woman.

487
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,807
So, are you coming over?

488
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,941
I'll wait for you. My man.

489
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:56,041
I really want to come over.

490
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,909
But I drank too much just now, feeling a bit dazed.

491
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:04,008
Moreover, I accidentally broke our house's code lock.

492
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:06,441
I'm waiting for rescue now.

493
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:10,750
Then just stand at the door as punishment.

494
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:13,480
I'm going to take a nice bath.

495
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:17,875
You saying that is tempting fate, you know. Be careful.

496
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:22,408
All right. You also drank quite a bit today.

497
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,241
Rest early.

498
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,542
Bye.

499
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,042
Good night.

500
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,742
You don't need to keep hurrying me.

501
00:31:57,742 --> 00:32:01,674
I'll give you what I owe you.

502
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:05,842
Got it.

503
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:20,509
Thank you for giving me a lift back.

504
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:24,141
You can just pull up to the side by that door entrance later,

505
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:26,042
and I'll give you a five-star rating and a tip.

506
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:28,008
- I'll give them to you, rest assured. 
 - Okay.

507
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:31,608
You can come into the office later tomorrow. I will inform the manager.

508
00:32:31,608 --> 00:32:33,075
You can stop right here at the entrance.

509
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,509
- Yes, where? 
 - Here, right here.

510
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:36,641
- You've passed it. 
 - I've passed it?

511
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,641
Right.

512
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,320
So, I…

513
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:43,242
No, the parking lot... you might not be able to go down there.

514
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:44,875
It's okay, I'll try.

515
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:48,009
No, you might not be able to go down to the parking lot.

516
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:55,168
What's wrong?

517
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,108
You went down!

518
00:32:59,108 --> 00:33:00,908
Yes, I did come down!

519
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,908
No. How could you come down?

520
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:06,676
I don't know either.

521
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:08,675
But… why…

522
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,242
What's the situation now?

523
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:23,409
Why are you able to stop?

524
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:25,307
I put it in the park gear.

525
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:28,541
No, I mean how are you able to come to a stop?

526
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,676
I can unlock it with facial recognition.

527
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:37,174
But I don't have a car, how did you unlock it with recognition?

528
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,274
I'm going home, why are you following me?

529
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,341
If it's about what happened that night, then I feel I need to explain to you.

530
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,542
Actually, I'm not usually like that.

531
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:09,042
And then… you're not my type, either.

532
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:18,175
I'm telling you the s-security guard is downstairs. T-Then, there are surveillance cameras here.

533
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:19,809
I'm recording right now.

534
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:21,775
I'm recording now, don't mess around.

535
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,342
I… I'm recording the whole time now.

536

There are cameras inside and outside, everywhere.

537
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,775
I just moved in yesterday.

538
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:46,242
Nice to meet you.

539
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:47,875
Good night.

540
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,808
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

541
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:22,242
Why are you walking so fast?

542
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:31,274
Could you please not walk next to me? Could you stay a bit further away from me?

543
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:32,900
Why?

544
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,641
Please stand here for five minutes.

545
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:39,042
Enter the company after five minutes.

546
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,974
Are you afraid others will notice us?

547
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:49,974
Please, who would notice us at this time?

548
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:51,575
You're overthinking it.

549
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:53,208
Stop nagging.

550
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,775
When I tell you to stand, just stand.

551
00:35:54,775 --> 00:35:58,141
At the same time, think about what to buy for Zhou on behalf of the manager.

552
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:00,541
Think it over before you come in.

553
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:42,341
Good morning.

554
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:44,474
It's not early anymore.

555
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,442
Yesterday, someone left their drunk girlfriend alone.

556
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:50,942
And today, he is so diligent in coming to pick her up for work.

557
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,341
Can I reasonably suspect that you're getting old,

558
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:56,230
and avoiding something?

559
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,142
I didn't sleep well all last night.

560
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:01,741
That's my punishment, isn't it?

561
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:05,508
I'll let you off.

562
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:06,709
Good news.

563
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:08,675
Mr. Xi called me this morning.

564
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:11,509
He told me about the new piece of land they've acquired

565
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,641
is going to be developed together with us.

566
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:17,975
Then my little weapon is useless.

567
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,008
What weapon?

568
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,675
Yesterday, Mr. Xi held my hand

569
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,609
speaking a bunch like "beauties hidden in the golden house" and such.

570
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,442
I wonder how Mrs. Xi would feel hearing that?

571
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:33,508
Can't believe you have this trick up your sleeve.

572
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:35,608
Of course, I've to buy insurance for myself.

573
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:38,474
Luckily, he took the bait. I didn't drink in vain.

574
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:41,142
I want you to be in charge of this project with Mr. Xi.

575
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:42,675
Directly to me.

576
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,375
I'll take charge?

577
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,108
But I still have the Bosheng case on my hands.

578
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:50,709
You've just been promoted to manager. Of course, you need to perform well.

579
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:54,042
Mr. Xi's project's core work must be you.

580
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:56,075
You should be able to do it, right?

581
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,675
Of course, I can do it.

582
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:04,909
Why don't say you want to take this opportunity

583
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,907
to spend more time with me?

584
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:11,842
How can my secret intentions be admitted so openly?

585
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:34,641
Morning, you came to work early too?

586
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:36,108
You're really like to exaggerate.

587
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,742
There's no one here, who are you performing for?

588
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:42,108
How do you know if someone won't suddenly come in?

589
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:43,208
Have you decided on the gift yet?

590
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,375
How about giving a PS5?

591
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,375
Or does Zhou have a favorite action figure?

592
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,208
That's what you want, isn't it?

593
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,641
It's too expensive, no way.

594
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:51,942
Why not?

595
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:54,942
You just want to express your gratitude, yet you're giving something worth tens of thousands.

596
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:58,308
Do you young people have a skewed sense of values?

597
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:00,909
The rent for your place over there must be expensive, right?

598
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:03,275
It's not cheap.

599
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:07,241
When I had just graduated, I just rented a place with others for a few thousand.

600
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,942
That's why I went to drive uber.

601
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:10,942
The place where I live is close to the company and comes with a parking space.

602
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:13,641
Then I can use the time I save on commuting to take other orders.

603
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,974
All right, how you spend your money in private is up to you.

604
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:18,042
But the budget at work has to be logical.

605
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:22,408
You should just choose a quality office product for about five hundred.

606
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:24,308
Five hundred?

607
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:27,374
Right.

608
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:29,541
Didn't the manager say that you could come into the office later yesterday?

609
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,341
Why did you come in so early?

610
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:35,409

613
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,474
I didn't even drink, do you think I dare to be late?

614
00:39:42,474 --> 00:39:44,675
I have so much work. Of course, I need to come early.
