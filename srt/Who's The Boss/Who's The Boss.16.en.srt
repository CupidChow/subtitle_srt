- It doesn't show…

Cindy.

24
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,467
Welcome back to the business department.

25
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,633
Congratulations on clearing your name.

26
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,166
Thank you.

27
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,133
Well…

28
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,199
If I had done anything

29
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:30,432
that seemed disrespectful to you,

30
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:32,032
it was just a misunderstanding.

31
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,967
Sometimes we can't decide
the course of an event.

32
00:01:36,532 --> 00:01:37,532

We are all small-time investors.

35
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,567
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,000
I get it. That's what it's like
in the workplace.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I know you're the best.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
Now that I'm back

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,766
in the business department

40
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:52,666
and have cleared my name,

41
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,199
I'll treat everyone to a meal.

42
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,967
With me, Cindy Wang, leading the way,

43
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,933
you're guaranteed to head for success.

44
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:00,500
No one is allowed to leave

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,766
without getting drunk.

46
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,600
It's okay, well…

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,332
I promise I won't be so socially clueless

48
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:11,367

49
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,567
And it's totally fine

50
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,100
if you really don't want to come.

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,332
- We will go.
- No problem.

52
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:16,632
- Yeah.
- Sure thing.

53
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,233
It's on me. No worries.

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,733
- No problem.
- Yingjun, did you make money again?

55
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just Day Trading.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,132
I made a few bucks.

57
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,533
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,833
Actually, the biggest problem

59
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,000
lying between us

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
isn't about right and wrong.

61
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:49,300
Our problem is we no longer love each other.

62
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,065
If we were still in love,

63
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:57,934
how could we bear to hurt each other?

64
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,699
Forget it.

65
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,733
None of this matters anymore.

66
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,300
Let it be, then.

67
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,867
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,367
Whenever you're ready,

69
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,899
we'll get a divorce.

70
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,899
Dandruff.

71
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,066
Manager Wu, don't be nervous.

72
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,000
You look very handsome today.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,834
The boss is going to
appoint the Vice President today.

74
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,433
Of course, I have to look good.

75
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,566
You look radiant and full of energy.

76
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,399
You'll surely be the next Vice President.

77
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,399
That's right.

78
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,000
I have a strong feeling

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,433
that it will be me.

80
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,233
What do you think?

81
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,967
Do you like my arrangements?

82
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,566
I have no objections.

83
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,666
But I don't get it.

84
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,799
Haven't you always wanted to be the manager?

85
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,799
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

86
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,766
I do want the position.

87
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:05,000
But the business department

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,734
is simply a mess right now.

89
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,165
I'm not taking over even if you want me to.

90
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,367
Why don't you sort out

91
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,333
all the problems first?

92
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,066
Yeah.

93
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,165
Cindy seems to have a point.

94
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:19,500
Right?

95
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,467
Wu, is that you? Come in.

96
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,700
- Good morning, Mr. Cai.
- Morning.

97
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,032
Good to see you, Manager Gao, Cindy.

98
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:31,265
- Please sit.
- Morning.

99
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,467
Today, I'd like to talk about

100
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,766
the vacant position of Vice President.

101
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,834
Well…

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,433
Mr. Cai, I wouldn't dare to speculate

103
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,632
what you are thinking.

104
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:52,933
But anyway, we're all colleagues here.

105
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,333
So I'll just say it.

106
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,566
This resume

107
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,899
is handed by Guo Shijie to our department.

108
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,467
Guo Shijie.

109
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,933
Such a senior employee

110
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,000
wanted to transfer to our planning department.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,066
It shows

112
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,100
that the business department is in chaos

113
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,467
and lacks cohesion.

114
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,933
Besides,

115
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,433
Cindy,

116
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,899
you've also handed us your resume.

117
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,132
I haven't! Don't make things up, please.

118
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,867
Miss Wang Cunfeng.

119
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,233
[Resume]
So you're also

120
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,367
vying for Cindy, huh?

121
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,467
Cindy.

122
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,600
It seems you're in high demand recently.

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,899
You know?

124
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,666
Director Zhang of Bosheng

125
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,532
also asked for you.

126
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,132
But you know, Wu,

127
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,734
Bosheng is offering her the position

128
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,666
of Executive Director.

129
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,632
May I ask what terms

130
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:48,032
you're offering to poach Cindy?

131
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,734
I don't think the title matters.

132
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:56,933
I just can't bear

133
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,834
to let a talent like Cindy

134
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,367
be restrained in the business department.

135
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,000
Cindy, come to our department.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,467
I promise I'll utilize all my resources

137
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,132
to make you the best secretary, okay?

138
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:10,100
Alright, that's enough.

139
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,532
I know what you're thinking.

140
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,066
Say no more.

141
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,734
I have my own perspective.

142
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:27,433
Chen, I'll take care of this.

143
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,700
Sit down and take a rest.

144
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,299
No need. This is my job.

145
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,433
I can do it myself.

146
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,632
It's okay. Don't be so formal with me.

147
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:36,000
I can do it as well. It's all the same.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,066
Besides,

149
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:40,233
I think we'll be seeing each other quite often.

150
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,200
We'll get many chances to help each other.

151
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,367
Right?

152
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:47,899
Hello?

153
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,867
Okay, I got it.

154
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,433
Excuse me.

155
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,867
Mr. Cai said

156
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,700
that he had reached a decision
about the Vice President.

157
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Zhou.

158
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,200
The boss wants to see you.

159
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,399
Me?

160
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,566
Well played.

161
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,467
Cindy Wang is the toughest opponent

162
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,500
I've encountered.

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,899
Cindy Wang volunteered to be a secretary.

164
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,367
She simply has no way

165
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,500
to compete with you.

166
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,934
How could she be your toughest opponent?

167
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,367
So rudimentary.

168
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,700
Way too rudimentary.

169
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,799
You have worked for me for so long

170
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,867
and yet haven't learned a thing.

171
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,666
Gao Shuangyun may still be the manager.

172
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,567
But she's already a marked person.

173
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,734
If the business department achieves anything,

174
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,200
who will take the credit?

175
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,799
It wouldn't be Chen, would it?

176
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,333
Her name starts with a C.

177
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,400
Cindy Wang?

178
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Yeah.

179
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,767
Once Gao Shuangyun
reorganized the business department,

180
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,200
I bet she'd be too embarrassed to stay.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
If the boss wants her gone,
he could just kick her out now.

182
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,799
Why would he let her stay?

183
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,132
Think about it.

184
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,533
Are you saying

185
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,000
that the boss will try to keep Gao Shuangyun

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
as the manager of the business department?

187
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:16,065
But wouldn't that be unfair to Cindy?

188
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:18,299
Given the boss's way of doing things,

189
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,734
he may be unconventional

190
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,799
and directly appoint her

191
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,567
as the Vice President.

192
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,466
It's not something impossible.

193
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Now I get it. No wonder Cindy Wang
wants to stay as a secretary.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,299
That's why

195
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,200
I said "well played".

196
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,333
And she won't have to compete with me.

197
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,767
You're so insightful, Tianfu.

198
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:41,099
You easily saw through her tricks.

199
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,232
Now,

200
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,466
we know what's going on.

201
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,567
So does Cindy.

202
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,966
And I bet the boss is thinking the same thing.

203
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,033
That's why he's taking on the position for now.

204
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,065
Anyway,

205
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,966
we can't let things go smoothly
in the business department now, okay?

206
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:02,966
Leave it to me.

207
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:04,400
I won't let you down.

208
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,599
Also,

209
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,799
don't let up with Chen and the boss's driver.

210
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,033
Build a good relationship with them.

211
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,299
I've been doing that all along.

212
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,333
But Tianfu,

213
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,867
I think there's someone

214
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,799
we should really try to win over.

215
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:30,934
Iris.

216
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:35,500
Iris, look what I brought for you.

217
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,700
What is it?

218
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,132
These Butterfly Crackers

219
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:41,232
are quite the trendy group-buy snack.

220
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,132
And our manager said

221
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,132
that you'd been working hard
as the receptionist.

222
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:48,567
So he told me to bring you some.

223
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,734
Manager Wu is so considerate.

224
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,033
Of course.

225
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,900
And I know how you hate

226
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,265
to gain weight.

227
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:59,400
So I prepared herbal tea for you.

228
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,632
Come on, give it a try.

229
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:03,033
If you like it,

230
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,734
[Herbal Tea]
keep the entire box.

231
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:07,033
Are you live-streaming?

232
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,299
I'm filming a short clip

233
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,132
to promote my nail salon.

234
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,734
You're the right person for promotion.

235
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,632
You're so beautiful.

236
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,500
I mean, you clearly
have the potential to be a star.

237
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,065
It's a waste for you to be a receptionist.

238
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:23,734
Really? I thought I had the potential
to be a mistress and seduce Mr. Cai.

239
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,333
It was a misunderstanding.

240
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,533
Iris, my sister.

241
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,934
It's all my fault. Please…

242
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:31,966
Please forgive me.

243
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,867
I apologize, okay?

244
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,700
Okay, fine.

245
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,666
I've given you a hard time.

246
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,599
Let's call it even, okay?

247
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:44,767
I knew a pretty like you must be kind.

248
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,767
Am I really that pretty?

249
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,466
Of course.

250
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,734
Come on, let me see.

251
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,833
How can you be so pretty?

252
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,132
Do I even need to say it?
Anyone with eyes can see that.

253
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,367
Is it good?

254
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,065
Right.

255
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,265
Don't you always get internet celebrities

256
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:11,466
and TV stars

257
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:14,466
to take part in
kickoff ceremonies, charity events,

258
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,400
and even housewarming activities?

259
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,567
I can help with that.

260
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,666
Those are very tiring.

261
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,166
It's okay. I don't mind the tiring work.

262
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,200
Besides,

263
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,065
Meng Heng and my uncle encouraged me

264
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:28,400
to have a serious plan for my future.

265
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,833
What you said made me think

266
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,567
that I should become the company's

267
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,166
Goodwill Ambassador.

268
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,333
Goodwill Ambassador?

269
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,299
Yeah, it's settled then.

270
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,000
Find someone to tutor me.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,734
I can definitely handle it.

272
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,132
The boss may have

273
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,400
put Guo Shijie's transfer on hold.

274
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,265
But are you confident you can keep him here?

275
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:56,000
I have to even if it's difficult.

276
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,432
If you can't do it,

277
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:01,333
should I help you?

278
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,900
Worry about yourself first.

279
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:09,200
Can you handle Yazi on your own?

280
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,299
You won't start arguing
in a few seconds, right?

281
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,734
Don't worry.

282
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm a changed person.

283
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,232
No matter how disrespectful she is,

284
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:19,232
I won't argue with her.

285
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,767
Then let's work on our own problems.

286
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,666
Come in.

287
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,200
Miss Gao, you're looking for me?

288
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,432
Sit down. Let's talk.

289
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,533
After that,

290
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,299
there will be some deliveries…

291
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,833
Then I'll stamp it.

292
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,567
- Ask Miss Gao for final confirmation.
- Okay.

293
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,367
Take it to Miss Gao…

294
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,400
Where is my stamp?

295
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,065
Director Xu.

296
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:02,132
May I have a word with you in private?

297
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,599
No need to do it in private.

298
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,432
We can talk right here.

299
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,299
I'll check the accounts
with the financial department.

300
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:13,666
I'll leave you to talk.

301
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,065
No need.

302
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:18,666
I don't make unwarranted remarks to clients
like someone else does.

303
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,799
You don't have to leave.

304
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,166
Stay and do your work.

305
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,599
I haven't stamped the papers.

306
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,464
Meng Heng.

307
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,599
What are you drinking?

308
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,099
Coffee from the welfare department?

309
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,232
Let's go for a coffee.

310
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,265
Take me there.

311
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,033
I want some coffee. Go.

312
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,132
What do you want? Spill it out.

313
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:41,299
I'm very busy.

314
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,299
Xu Yazi.

315
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,767
I want to make peace with you.

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,132
I know you don't like me.

317
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:52,200
And

318
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,466
I must have done many things that annoyed you.

319
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:55,833
But if there's anything

320
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,833
that appeases you

321
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,400
or even if you want to punch me,

322
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm okay with it. No problem.

323
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
You haven't changed at all, have you?

324
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Do you really think you are the sun?

325
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,265
Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter

326
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,666
all revolve around you, huh?

327
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,567
Why should I reconcile with you
just because you say so?

328
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,232
Also, I'm sorry.

329
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,567
The world doesn't just cater to your wishes.

330
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,265
As you've said before,

331
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,567
I'm here to work, not to make friends.

332
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,599
I think I owe all of you an apology.

333
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,333
It's my mistake

334
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,166
that things have turned out this way.

335
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,265
I deserve some punishment.

336
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:41,333
No, Miss Gao.

337
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,599
It's not your fault.

338
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,500
Even if there was someone to blame,

339
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,900
it would be that lame guy.

340
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,033
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

341
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,432
Miss Gao, don't drink alone.

342
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:51,099
- Come on, cheers.
- Come on.

343
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,132
- We toast to you.
- To you.

344
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:54,567
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Lame guys begone.

345
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:55,666
- Begone.
- Get lost.

346
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,799
Begone.

347
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,033
Yun.

348
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,632
Listen, you want to find a good man, right?

349
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,700
I can buy you the essential oil spray

350
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,666
that invites romantic opportunities.

351
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,033
After I used it,

352
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,099
I've been having

353
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,432
nice chats with a girl on the dating site.

354
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,632
What does she look like? Show us.

355
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,333
Do you have a link to that spray?

356
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,934
Yeah, I'll send it to you.

357
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,466
Look.

358
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:23,065
[Chat History]
And we talked quite a lot.

359
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,599
- Look.
- Show me her photo.

360
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,734
Look, we've been chatting.

361
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,200
Photo.

362
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,833
Look.

363
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,065
- She's pretty.
- Isn't she pretty?

364
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:36,200
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

365
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,265
- She's not bad.
- Yeah.

366
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,666
Way to go, man.

367
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,666
But you know,
face swapping with AI is very popular.

368
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,533
Maybe she doesn't look like that.

369
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,232
Is that possible?

370
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,966
By the way, how did it go with Guo Shijie?

371
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,132
I've warned him of the risks

372
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:54,867
and offered him incentives.

373
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,767
Still, he didn't come.

374
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,599
So I guess I failed.

375
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:03,900
Really?

376
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,366
How come I can't tell?

377
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:06,666
AI is really simple.

378
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,666
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Guo.

379
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,567
- Guo.
- You're so late.

380
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:11,933
- Come on.
- You started without me?

381
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,300
Come on, catch up.

382
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,532
- Okay.
- Come on.

383
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,166
- Thanks.
- Give it to me.

384
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,000
Come on.

385
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:21,000
- Drink.
- And I must say

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,567
you are a better leader than me.

387
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:24,532
I really admire you.

388
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:26,066
I'm flattered.

389
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,599
- Come on.
- Okay.

390
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,699
- Come on.
- I toast to you.

391
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,066
- Come on.
- Hurry, cheers.

392
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,032
- To you.
- Say no more.

393
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,066
- I'll down it.
- Cheers.

394
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,599
Catch up with us.

395
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,666
Okay.

396
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,265
Actually,

397
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,233
I've come to say goodbye to you.

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,500
Bro.

399
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Are you seriously going
to the planning department?

400
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,866
Why are you pulling long faces?

401
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,467
Even if I get transferred,

402
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,366
my spirit will still be with you.

403
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,133
Miss Gao.

404
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,333
Sorry.

405
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,300
It's alright.

406
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,567
Everyone has their ambitions.

407
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,567
Since you've already made your choice,

408
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,967
I respect that and wish you well.

409
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,599
Come on.

410
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:25,734
Thank you, Miss Gao.

411
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:30,333
- Miss Gao, I toast to you.
- Wait.

412
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:33,666
- What's wrong, Yingjun?
- Guo, you're leaving, huh?

413
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,800
Let's not hold back.

414
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,967
Get him a bottle of drink.

415
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,599
- Don't go easy on him.
- Come on.

416
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,900
- The whole bottle.
- The whole bottle.

417
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,265
The same, two bottles.

418
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,666
I can't help you this time.

419
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,933
You have to finish it.

420
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,366
Listen, you're not leaving here

421
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:47,265
- sober today.
- Let's get wasted.

422
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:49,066
- You're done for.
- Planning versus Business, huh?

423
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,099
- Of course.
- Okay, I'll go first.

424
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,500
Come on, one at a time.

425
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
- I'll start.
- Come on, hurry up.

426
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,300
You can take back what you just said

427
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,500
about admiring me.

428
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,734
Drink up before hitting the road.

429
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:00,833
Bon voyage.

430
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,500
Guo Shijie has joined the Planning Department.

431
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,333
Everyone is making their moves

432
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,532
but everything is as you expected.

433
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,800
So

434
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,000
do they know why

435
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,734
I'm the acting Vice President?

436
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,866
You want to keep the competition going

437
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:24,133
so that all the employees remain motivated.

438
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,900
I bet they get it.

439
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,967
You know me best.

440
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:34,900
But, Chen.

441
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:39,734
This… is not how you treat a friend.

442
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,933
How come you didn't tell me

443
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,300
about Han Xinzheng's embezzlement right away?

444
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,734
You didn't want to see me mess up

445
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,800
and get scolded by the chairman, right?

446
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,866
Of course not.

447
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,265
It's okay.

448
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,800
I know that you are working for the chairman.

449
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,633
Mr. Cai, actually…

450
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:05,900
Come in.

451
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,066
Mr. Cai, your dinner.

452
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay, put it over there.

453
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,066
Okay.

454
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,666
Mr. Cai doesn't use disposable cutlery.

455
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll get his eco-friendly utensils.

456
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,333
- One second, sir.
- Thank you, Chen.

457
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,734
Mr. Cai, enjoy your meal.

458
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,933
Take a seat.

459
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,000
So

460
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,166
have you had food?

461
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,866
Not yet. I still have some work to finish up.

462
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,133
You've worked hard.

463
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,766
Well…

464
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,532
I remember that you didn't apply

465
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:55,199
for the secretary position in the beginning.

466
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:58,866
Yeah, I applied to be a specialist
in the business department.

467
00:20:58,866 --> 00:20:59,900
But

468
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,900
they had trouble
finding someone to be the secretary

469
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,366
of the Vice President.

470
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,599
So I was temporarily transferred there.

471
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,166
And then

472
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,000
I've been a secretary until now.

473
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,233
This job as a secretary

474
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,666
is not bad.

475
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,166
However,

476
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,500
for someone

477
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,766
with ambition and drive like you,

478
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,833
being a secretary

479
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,633
doesn't seem very challenging.

480
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,400
And there aren't many opportunities
for promotion.

481
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:34,265
So I have kept you as a second-line secretary.

482
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:36,666
Do you find it unfair?

483
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,432
No, not at all.

484
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,467
Actually, I think

485
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,400
that doing the job of a secretary well

486
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,133
and supporting the supervisor

487
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,933
is quite fulfilling.

488
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:51,333
It's just that

489
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,900
I didn't discover

490
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,866
Mr. Han's illegal activities right away.

491
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,866
And I feel a bit sorry for the company.

492
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,866
It's okay.

493
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:04,567
After all, it's all in the past.

494
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,133
Well…

495
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,567
No matter who becomes the new Vice President,

496
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,633
just keep a good eye on that person.

497
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,866
Yes, sir.

498
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,099
Work hard.

499
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,967
The company won't treat you unfairly.

500
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,099
Okay, Mr. Cai. I won't let you down.

501
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,633
It's on me.

502
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,800
- No way.
- How come you're paying?

503
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,400
It's my turn to buy you dinner.

504
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,567
- Use my card.
- Take mine. You…

505
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:30,633
- My card.
- You…

506
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:31,734
- We agreed. Take mine.
- No way.

507
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:33,432
Who agreed with you?

508
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,666
Meng Heng, please pull her back.

509
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,599
You can split the bill, okay?

510
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,265
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

511
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:41,133
- Who does that?
- Take mine.

512
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,166
- I'm paying.
- I'm paying it all.

513
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,166
- Take it.
- Take mine.

514
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,032
- I was faster.
- Cindy Wang.

515
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,467
Same old rules.

516
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,599
The one who lasts pays the bill.

517
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:54,900
Come on.

518
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,166
The usual.

519
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,967
The usual.

520
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:05,933
Same old rules.

521
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,366
No matter if you drink
from the left to the right

522
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,800
or from the right to the left,

523
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,265
whoever finishes first wins.

524
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:17,133
I will definitely win.

525
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:20,199
It's too early to say that.

526
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:43,233
Hello, Zhou.

527
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,532
Come to the tavern now.

528
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:46,766
Shoulder your responsibility here.

529
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,166
The usual place, thank you.

530
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,432
Over here, thank you.

531
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,099
- Be careful.
- Okay.

532
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,432
Be careful.

533
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,400
Watch your head.

534
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,833
Be careful.

535
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,967
Steadily.

536
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,467
It's here, right?

537
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:16,265
Mind your steps.

538
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,400
I will carry your purse.

539
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,666
Come on, be careful.

540
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,000
The elevator is…

541
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:25,000
On the right.

542
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,800
On the right. Okay, be careful.

543
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,599
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

544
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,866
If you're not feeling well,

545
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:32,532
I can buy you a hangover cure.

546
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,766
It's okay.

547
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,133
I'm feeling much better now.

548
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,967
You should go back and rest.

549
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:43,500
Are you sure you're okay?

550
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:47,766
See you tomorrow.

551
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,599
Be careful.

552
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,666
Bye-bye.

553
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,734
I'm really getting old.

554
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:27,900
I didn't drink much yesterday
but I got such a headache.

555
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,900
Thank goodness I wore sunglasses.

556
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:43,766
This scene feels all too familiar.

557
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:47,920
♫ No one has ♫

558
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,224
♫ Your proud smile ♫

559
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:55,300
Morning.

560
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,640
Morning.

561
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,199
You both came to pick me up for work?

562
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm on my way to work. Let's go.

563
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,000
It was convenient for you but I made a detour.

564
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,833
Cindy specifically told me yesterday

565
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,967
to come and pick her up today.

566
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,265
Did I?

567
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,599
Do you have proof?

568
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:17,666
♫ Close your eyes. I will say it out loud ♫

569
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,766
Pingzhi.

570
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,699
Let's keep it down and don't wake up Yi.

571
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:30,866
I want to tell you.

572
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,500
I…

573
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:40,833
Pick me up for work tomorrow morning
to see what I want to say.

574
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:44,866
I'm sorry.

575
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,066
Good night.

576
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,467
W-When did I send you those?

577
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,432
She said that when she was drunk.

578
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,800
It doesn't count.

579
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:09,233
It's okay.

580
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,532
I won't let you come here for nothing.

581
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:13,866
I'll pay for the ride.

582
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,666
Again?

583
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,066
No need.

584
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,300
He has grown up.

585
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,400
Let's go.

586
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,265
You have a headache so don't get in the wind.

587
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:42,900
It may get you worse.

588
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,099
Thank you.

589
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,500
Feeling any better?

590
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Much better, thank you.
Better not to be in the wind.

591
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,599
You're really thoughtful.

592
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,866
Meng Heng, good morning.

593
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,199
Morning.

594
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,000
Did you have breakfast?

595
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,366
Not yet.

596
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:34,333
Have this then.

597
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,833
Thank you.

598
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,800
After all, someone doesn't need to eat

599
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,467
when she's on a date.

600
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,500
What did you say?

601
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:44,599
Nothing.

602
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,633
This is an oat milk latte.

603
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,967
If you're not used to it--

604
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:50,532
No problem. I love trying new things.

605
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,366
I've reviewed his resume.

606
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,199
He lacks experience in every aspect.

607
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,300
Tell the headhunters to keep searching.

608
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,833
Okay, bye-bye.

609
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,265
Do you have a few minutes?

610
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,666
I have nothing but time right now.

611
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,099
Looking for a job?

612
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,532
Yeah.

613
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:29,599
But…

614
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,699
Not a single company dares to hire me.

615
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,467
So you already knew when you were

616
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,333
at Mr. Lu's wedding banquet.

617
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,233
No wonder

618
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,032
you said those random things to me

619
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,000
at the restaurant entrance.

620
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And you mentioned something about "dirt".

621
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,900
It turns out you were hinting at me.

622
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,265
Too bad you didn't get it back then.

623
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:03,400
Why would it have mattered?

624
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,500
It wouldn't change anything.

625
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,099
It's my fault that I got greedy.

626
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:15,467
This circle may not be so big,
but it's not small either.

627
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,333
The news will spread quickly.

628
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:22,400
Thank you

629
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,532
for having the heart to talk with a loser.

630
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,633
However, I'd like to remind you.

631
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,333
Cindy

632
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,866
is not as harmless as she seems.

633
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,099
I ended up like this

634
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,734
thanks to her too.

635
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,166
Be careful.

636
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:40,933
Dr. Chen is the top expert

637
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:43,400
in this field.

638
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,900
That's right.

639
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,766
I recommended that clinic to her.

640
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,300
What's done is done.

641
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,467
Next.

642
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,166
How about I show you a clear path?

643
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,666
What do you think?

644
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,532
- Come on.
- Cheers.

645
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:13,099
- Welcome.
- Looking forward to working with you.

646
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,000
Thank you, Manager Wu, I swear I will

647
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,199
work hard and do my best.

648
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,967
Come on, meet Jia.

649
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,500
- Hello, Jia.
- Yi.

650
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,099
- Hello, Yi.
- And Wen.

651
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:22,366
They are all important staff.

652
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:23,432
This is Guo, alright?

653
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,000
Help each other out at work.

654
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,133
Okay?

655
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:27,933
Please look after me.

656
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,166
Guo.

657
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,066
I will definitely teach you

658
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,766
everything I know

659
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,233
to make your decision to join us worthwhile.

660
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,467
Thank you, Manager Wu.

661
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:39,833
Okay, that's about it. Everyone, back to work.

662
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,133
Let me talk to Guo in private, okay?

663
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,400
- Take the booze.
- Thanks in advance.

664
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,500
- Welcome, Guo.
- Welcome.

665
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,432
- Thanks.
- Guo.

666
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,967
I need to tell you something.

667
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,304
Okay.

668
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:54,734
Guo, come here.

669
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,233
I treat my subordinates

670
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,866
just as I care for these plants.

671
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:02,467
I do it with sincerity

672
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,099
and love.

673
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:08,000
You see, this is Jia's Baby Jia.

674
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,734
Look at it, so fluffy and robust.

675
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,900
Thriving and flourishing.

676
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,366
Li Mi's Beauty Li.

677
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,734
Standing tall and graceful.

678
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,933
It looks just like a bunny.

679
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,176
This is mine?

680
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:25,599
I hope

681
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,900
it can slowly grow

682
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,066
into something we have in mind.

683
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,833
Manager Wu, rest assured.

684
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,666
It will definitely bloom…

685
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,199
Our planning department

686
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,833
is always serving others' interests.

687
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,500
Market research. Our job.

688
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,032
Product development. Our job.

689
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:45,699
Build good relationships
with neighbors. Our job.

690
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,599
Socialize with government officials. Our job.

691
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,800
Why can't our department

692
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,866
make money on our own?

693
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:52,265
Yeah, so--

694
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:54,467
So we need to get a piece of land.

695
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:56,734
We'll plan, develop,

696
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:59,166
and sell it by ourselves.

697
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,099
A piece of land?

698
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,532
Let's leave the details aside.

699
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,199
The most important job right now

700
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,567
is counting on you.

701
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:08,800
Mr. Han has a list.

702
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,300
That list contains

703
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,467
the land developers we're familiar with.

704
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,400
Now the business department

705
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,099
has that list at hand.

706
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,265
With your intelligence,

707
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,233
you should know what to do, right?

708
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,567
No problem.

709
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:29,766
Leave it to me.

710
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,199
Alright.

711
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:35,800
I love it when young people
are bold and daring.

712
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:38,432
By the way.

713
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:39,872
Li Mi.

714
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,833
There's another important task.

715
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,366
You can count on me.
I will definitely do my best.

716
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:49,766
No one can do this but you.

717
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,699
Go ahead and get busy.

718
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,567
Thank you, Manager Wu.

719
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:13,199
Fortunately, Guo Shijie joined us.

720
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,032
Let him handle the tricky situation.

721
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:18,032
I really wouldn't know what to do without him.

722
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:20,366
Guo will handle the problem for sure.

723
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:23,266
But you still need to keep an eye on it, okay?

724
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:25,199
After all, she's the boss's niece.

725
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,199
We can't afford to offend her.

726
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,232
Rest assured.

727
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,100
I will definitely keep a close watch.

728
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,800
Pretty much like that.

729
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,633
Let's start with this 3D model.

730
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,399
The main thing is to let consumers know

731
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,433
where the neighborhood is

732
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,000
and how convenient it is.

733
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,633
Live streaming is very popular.

734
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:50,767
So you must learn how to interact
with potential consumers.

735
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,600
And your outfit

736
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,532
might need to be simpler and more plain.

737
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:57,000
No way.

738
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,166
Why do I have to be told what to wear?

739
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,500
Because we're trying to focus on the product

740
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,065
and the layout plan.

741
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,399
So we don't want your outfit

742
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,100
to distract the consumers.

743
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,000
You're being too outdated.

744
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,266
Everyone is doing the same.

745
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,266
So we should forge our own path.

746
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:18,833
I want to be myself.

747
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,166
Be yourself. Yes, be yourself.

748
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,733
Young people should be themselves.

749
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:26,100
So, what do you have in mind?

750
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,800
Isn't that what you should figure out?

751
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,300
Be yourself.

752
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,467
Look on the bright side.

753
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,300
At least the work there is easier.

754
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,032
You don't need to run around.

755
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:43,199
Otherwise, you may end up like me.
Then it's troublesome.

756
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,934
I'd rather be like you, actually.

757
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:47,199
Nonsense.

758
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,532
No, look.

759
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:51,600
Tutoring Fang Iris is all pain and no gain.

760
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,366
If I teach her well, it's expected.

761
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,767
And the credit goes to the team.

762
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,199
If I don't teach her well,

763
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,232
then the problem is mine alone.

764
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:03,232
Alright, I can only tell you this.

765
00:36:03,232 --> 00:36:04,532
Keep it up.

766
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm with you.

767
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,733
Yingjun, Mr. Han left in a hurry.

768
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:18,467
Did he hand over the documents to anyone?

769
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,600
I think he handed over
a list of land developers

770
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,199
he was familiar with
to the business department.

771
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,199
To be honest,

772
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,133
I really want that list.

773
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,399
Come on, you see.

774
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,767
If I fail my job with Fang Iris,

775
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,199
I'll take the blame

776
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,366
and get fired.

777
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:39,934
Then it's all over.

778
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:42,333
So I need some leverage to play it safe.

779
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,866
If I have to look for a job,

780
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:45,767
that list might come in handy.

781
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,566
You want the trade secrets?

782
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:52,399
If they find out about it,

783
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,399
we'll be doomed.

784
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,433
As long as we keep it a secret,

785
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,666
how would anyone find out?

786
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,266
Besides, I could say

787
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:03,000
that someone else developed the list.

788
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,199
Right?

789
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,600
No.

790
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,266
This is our policy.

791
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:10,934
I've called her using the intercom.

792
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,699
Please wait here for a moment.

793
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,500
It's okay.

794
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:24,967
Director Zhang.

795
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:26,666
You are Yi's dad?

796
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:29,800
You know my daughter?

797
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,199
Yi comes to me for her nails.

798
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,166
She wants the "I love daddy" stickers.

799
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,767
She showed me a photo of you two.

800
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,366
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

801
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:37,467
It's okay.

802
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:39,866
So you're the one who did Yi's nails.

803
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:40,899
You're really skilled.

804
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,433
She really likes it

805
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:44,300
and wouldn't wash it off for days.

806
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,866
Tell Yi it's okay if it comes off.
I can redo it.

807
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:48,266
I guarantee she will like it.

808
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,467
I'll pass that on.

809
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,300
Cindy.

810
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,566
I'll leave you to talk. Tell Yi to come.

811
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,166
What brings you here?

812
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,366
You left your phone in my car.

813
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,000
I've been looking for it all morning.

814
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,433
Thank you.

815
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,566
You didn't have to come.

816
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:08,199
Just get a courier.

817
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,100
Aren't you busy with your new company?

818
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,166
It's okay.

819
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,333
I've already found a capable assistant.

820
00:38:14,232 --> 00:38:16,366
Still, you could have called a courier.

821
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:18,600
You really wanted to see me, huh?

822
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,899
It's not just that.

823
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:21,633
I want you more than anything.

824
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:27,600
I mean

825
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
I want your answer.

826
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,133
What answer?

827
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,699
Check your phone.

828
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,800
Go to the country villa?

829
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,232
This weekend?

830
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:41,232
This is the construction project I worked on.

831
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:42,767
It's right next to a golf course.

832
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,300
The view is pretty good.

833
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
Do I have the honor

834
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,532
to have you there with me?

835
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,467
All right.

836
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,733
Mr. Cai, Mr. Li's secretary called

837
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,733
to reschedule the dinner tonight.

838
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:59,032
Can I arrange it for next Monday?

839
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,833
Aren't I supposed to
see the dentist next Monday?

840
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,133
Yeah, I was thinking of arranging it first--

841
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,232
For what?

842
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,100
- Alright, whatever. Take care of it.
- Okay, sir.

843
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,467
- Arrange for it.
- Okay.

844
00:39:13,232 --> 00:39:15,967
I've also bought a gift for Mr. Fang.

845
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,699
When the time comes, I will…

846
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,133
Mr. Cai, what's wrong?

847
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,000
Mr. Cai, sorry, there is a document…

848
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,500
Slowly.

849
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,232
- Sit down first.
- Mr. Cai, are you alright?

850
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,333
Chen, let me be.

851
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,133
- Zhou, get me the chair.
- Okay.

852
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:33,633
Be careful.

853
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:35,532
- Come on, be careful.
- Careful.

854
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:40,899
Okay.

855
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,032
I'll book an acupuncture

856
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:43,232
with Dr. Zhang.

857
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:45,199
No need, Chen.

858
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,300
Give Dr. Zhang's number to Zhou.

859
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,232
Let him make the appointment.

860
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:50,300
Okay.

861
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,199
Okay, and also,

862
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,600
Zhou, come with me to the dinner with Mr. Li.

863
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,699
Let Chen rest.

864
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:00,032
After all, she'll just tell me not to drink.

865
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,333
I didn't order this.

866
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,266
The lady over there got it for you.

867
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:42,566
Thanks.

868
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,100
No problem.

869
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,266
May I join you?

870
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,133
Why are you alone today?

871
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,566
It's normal to be alone.

872
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:07,600
We, as secretaries,

873
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,699
are always alone.

874
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,232
We work alone without colleagues.

875
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:15,500
We wait alone for the boss

876
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,065
without fixed work hours.

877
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,399
We handle things alone

878
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:21,000
without anyone to share our burden.

879
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,532
We eat alone

880
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:24,333
without anyone for company.

881
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,699
We're always alone.

882
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:31,133
We just get used to it.

883
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,566
And it might just so happen

884
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,600
that we'll be

885
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,366
replaced by someone at any time.

886
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,100
No way.

887
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,032
Chen, you're such an expert at work.

888
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:52,967
No one can take your place.

889
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:57,399
Cindy told me everything.

890
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,366
If it weren't for you stepping in,

891
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:04,433
who knows when this farce would have ended

892
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,532
and how much deeper I would have fallen?

893
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,866
Are you alright

894
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,000
being alone?

895
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:26,300
To be honest…

896
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,934
But one must get used to being alone.

897
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:36,300
Right?

898
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:58,767
Han Xinzheng?

899
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,399
No.

900
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:03,166
I've blocked him.

901
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,633
That's right.

902
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:08,266
Say goodbye to the wrong person.

903
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,399
That's how you meet the right guy.

904
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,333
Do you know why desserts

905
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,065
make people feel happy?

906
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:39,300
It's because

907
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,934
the sugar in desserts stimulates the brain

908
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:44,500
to produce dopamine receptors,

909
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,266
which makes one feel cheerful.

910
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:51,000
Really?

911
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:06,166
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

912
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:09,300
Nothing. I was just…

913
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,833
I was looking for the restroom.

914
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,467
The restroom?

915
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:15,065
It's at the back.

916
00:44:15,065 --> 00:44:17,433
Behind the pillar, to the right.

917
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,366
Okay, I'll be right back.

918
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,532
Okay.

919
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,733
Be careful.

920
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,967
You seem to have recovered
faster than I imagined.

921
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,232
So…

922
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,433
you've been thinking of me?

923
00:45:04,816 --> 00:45:09,875
[Choice is more important than effort
because it makes all the difference]

924
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,899
[Next Episode]
Leave the heavy lifting to me.

925
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,232
