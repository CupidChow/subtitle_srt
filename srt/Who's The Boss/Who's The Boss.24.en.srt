Quickly, let's hurry back to the office and prepare for tomorrow.

180
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:54,447
Waiter. Check, please.

181
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,682
Hello, today's bill is TWD$848.

182
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,715
- This is your cash voucher.
- Okay.

183
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:03,715
I just calculated it.

184
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,414
There's still some change, probably just a few dozen dollars.

185
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,048
It's your turn.

186
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,415
Still $148 short.

187
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:12,781
Hurry and pay up. There's still work at the company.

188
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,780
Becoming the vice president.

189
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,848
Still $148 short.

190
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:27,448
Anyway, our collaboration with Xin Daqi is not just about the building project.

191
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:30,981
We also have a resort and a wellness village.

192
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:32,981
Wherever the excavator can reach, we will go.

193
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,680
Where the excavator cannot reach, we will pave the way

194
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,281
and plant Jingdu's flag there.

195
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:41,014
We want Jingdu's buildings to cover the whole world.

196
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,080
Very good.

197
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,814
No wonder I heard people say if you want to make big money,

198
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,215
you can't talk about profit first.

199
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:56,381
You must have a great and beautiful vision.

200
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:58,048
Right?

201
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:02,081
Manager Wu, you have such ambition.

202
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,281
Amazing.

203
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:05,848
Especially after just hearing what he said,

204
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:10,314
it reminds me of when we used to work hard by the chairman's side.

205
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:11,982
Don't you agree, Sister Chen?

206
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:13,148
Yes.

207
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:17,514
I also think Manager Wu's vision map is particularly big and particularly good.

208
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:18,648
Very good.

209
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:19,815
Thank you, Sister Chen.

210
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:24,314
Under the leadership of the president, my spirit of hard work has never changed.

211
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,415
Grand goals provide the motivation to move forward.

212
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:29,380
Thank you, President. Thank you.

213
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,213
Okay, sit down. Please sit.

214
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,281
You've worked hard.

215
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:37,014
Okay, well done, planning department.

216
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:40,347
Well, Manager Gao,

217
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:43,214
how is the sales department doing?

218
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:46,681
The colleagues in the sales department are all working hard to catch up with the performance.

219
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:49,813
However, we have some ideas that we want to report to you.

220
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,848
Okay, go ahead.

221
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:56,015
First, let's invite our most beautiful Jingdu ambassador, Aisi.

222
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,594
[Jingdu Customer Care APP]

223
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,580
One phone call, a lifetime of protection.

224
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,980
I am the Jingdu ambassador, Fang Aisi.

225
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,847
The company's corporate spirit is integrity, love, and sustainability.

226
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,315
To implement sustainability,

227
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:19,913
we should provide permanent maintenance and sustainable service.

228
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:21,848
Having this app on one's phone,

229
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,648
customers buying houses from Jingdu

230
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:26,815
is not the end, but the beginning of service.

231
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,847
Online repair requests are a very important part of this App.

232
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:34,913
This can allow customers to avoid wasting time looking for a technician.

233
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,481
And it will also be retroactive.

234
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:39,880
Whether it's a new homeowner or a homeowner from years ago,

235
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,248
they can all use this function.

236
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,747
Next, for customers of pre-sale houses,

237
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,314
we also provide real-time reports on construction progress,

238
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:50,547
so that customers can keep track of their future homes at any time,

239
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:54,482
watching their future homes being built bit by bit until completion.

240
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,513
I believe this can bring immense happiness to our customers.

241
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,182
That's great.

242
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:06,814
In the past, we never thought after-sales service could reach this level.

243
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:10,980
Not bad, really good. Keep going.

244
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,682
Considering the wide age range of home buyers,

245
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:17,082
some customers like to directly call the repair hotline.

246
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,281
We plan to ask Aisi,

247
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,948
the Jingdu ambassador

248
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,781
who has the sweetest voice and looks,

249
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:26,447
to be responsible for recording the repair hotline messages.

250
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:30,981
Wu Tianfu is really a supervillain.

251
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,515
Really, he made so many people angry.

252
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:33,815
I think this time he…

253
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,314
- Really?
- Cover him with a sack.

254
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,781
- What are you discussing?
- Don't worry.

255
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,580
What meeting are you having?

256
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,048
Are you thinking that Cindy Wang's strategy

257
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:43,681
has won the boss's heart or not?

258
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,047
Please, we have great confidence in Sister Cindy, okay?

259
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,815
Yes, we are discussing which restaurant to hold today's celebration party.

260
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,180
That's right.

261
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,515
Our action this time, should score 99 points, if not 100.

262
00:13:56,515 --> 00:14:00,280
Besides, we have mobilized royal relatives, our Jingdu ambassador.

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,848
How could it not win the boss's heart?

264
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:07,515
I'm telling you, it's simply a sure win.

265
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,447
Really?

266
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,514
Are you up to some bad things again?

267
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,781
Brother Guo, it's never too late to turn back.

268
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,814
You guys…

269
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:24,613
Why do your sarcastic comments feel so refreshing?

270
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,680
There's a sense of complete relaxation, like being bathed in the spring breeze.

271
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,448
I really want to get back to the sales department to be scolded by you guys.

272
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:32,413
- Hurry up and scold me.
- You're a masochist. You know what I'm saying?

273
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,481
Masochist.

274
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:35,647
That's really perverted.

275
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,380
You missed me, right?

276
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,448
- Not really.
- Actually, we're okay.

277
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,781
- It's really okay.
- You're overthinking.

278
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,547
You guys…

279
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,114
By the way, where are you going to celebrate later?

280
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,947
- This seat is taken.
- It's Meng Heng's.

281
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:48,681
- Please go away.
- On the ground.

282
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,215
There's really no colleague love.

283
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,715
Do you want me to get you a cup of hot tea?

284
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,182
I…

285
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,514
Can't you read the room?
[Jingdu Construction Organization]

286
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,481
Do I not look angry enough?

287
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:13,581
You want me to drink hot tea. Are you trying to make me boil?

288
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,348
Actually, it's not that bad.

289
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:21,747
Besides, your position hasn't changed.

290
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:25,113
Didn't the boss give you a raise?

291
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:26,981
Why are you smiling?

292
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:29,214
I'm asking you, what are you laughing at?

293
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:32,348
What good is a raise?

294
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:36,881
How embarrassing was it in the meeting room just now? Did you see it?

295
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:38,715
In my opinion,

296
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:41,547
Manager Wu managed to secure the Xin Daqi project

297
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:44,281
which is highly promising,

298
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:45,647
is really impressive.

299
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,880
A great achievement.

300
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,813
However,

301
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:54,714
have you neglected your duties?

302
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:59,148
Look at the sales department. They are so high-profile,

303
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,747
developing an app for sustainable housing.

304
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,682
Also, they've attracted so many members

305
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:05,913
to apply for membership and download the app.

306
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:09,080
Have you not noticed at all?

307
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,348
You're too slow-witted.

308
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,614
Wu, this won't do.

309
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:17,815
From the looks of it, you are still not qualified enough

310
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:20,180
to be a vice president.

311
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:29,815
Yes, boss. I will definitely reflect on it, reflect on it.

312
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:38,080
Excuse me. As for the potted plant Manager Wu left in the vice president's office,

when it is convenient for you, I'll help you move it back.

Aren't we supposed to prepare the proposal for the boss tomorrow?

315

How come we're moving things?

316
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:52,114
Isn't it too early to move now?

317

Keep your voice down.

318
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:59,047
We come now just to take advantage of the time when they are sleeping

319
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:02,314
and let them, and us,

320
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,147
get familiar with the environment together.

321

No one has been confirmed to be promoted to vice president yet.

Very good.

324
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:26,647
The sales department has performed really well this time.

325
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,947
Both offensively and defensively, right?

326
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,147
Knowing how to sell houses and how to provide after-sales service

327
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:35,214
is the long-term way to manage customers.

328
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:40,448
Manager Gao, your all-around strategy this time was really comprehensive.

329
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:42,381
It's great.

330
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:46,281
Actually, it's not just my credit.

331
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:49,081
The sustainable housing app was Cindy's idea.

332
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,514
And she was also responsible for leading the project.

333
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:55,947
We've all worked together as a whole department to achieve this.

334
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,547
Don't be so modest.

335
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,448
Although Cindy performed very well,

336
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:04,682
it should also be credited to your leadership and empathy.

337
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:07,581
The vice president position belongs to you for sure.

338
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:11,648
I have high hopes for you. I look forward to your performance.

339
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:13,248
Thank you, President, for giving me this opportunity.

340
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,414
I will definitely work hard.

341
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:18,781
Zhou,

342
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:23,147
you should also seize the opportunity to assist your Vice President Gao well.

343
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,015
Yes.

344
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:29,781
But don't work too hard.

345
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:35,114
Seeing the employees happy and joyful is what I really want.

346
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,114
I suggest you do your work well,

347
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:41,015
and also maintain your relationship well.

348
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:44,213
Get married earlier. Have a few more children.

349
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,980
It was really well said, but President,

350
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,748
you shouldn't talk much about such topics

351
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:49,948
in the company now.

352
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:52,581
They involve gender equality issues.

353
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:55,380
It's so hard to chat in the office now.

354
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,181
All right, let's not talk about this then.

355
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:02,547
By the way, how do you feel about my arrangement of Cindy?

356
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:05,648
Isn't it a little too harsh?

357
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,114
Thank you.

358
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,781
Take care, everyone.

359
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:22,081
Sis, are you really going?

360
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:25,815
Do you want to talk to the boss again?

361
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,815
I didn't expect you to say yes.

362
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:29,980
Not fun.

363
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,380
Sister Cindy, don't go. I'll talk to Uncle.

364
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,915
The idea of the Sustainable Housing Maintenance App is yours.

365
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:39,248
Even if you can't be the vice president, you can still be the manager.

366
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,048
Forget it.

367
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,082
I don't think the boss would

368
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,047
want to upset a pregnant woman about the manager position.

369
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:51,047
- What?
- Sister Yazi. You…

370
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:54,214
That's right. I'm pregnant.

371
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,481
Congratulations.

372
00:19:55,481 --> 00:20:00,781
As for the manager position, it's mine.

373
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,280
All right, Cindy, wish you all the best.

374
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,747
- If you need any help, just let me know.
- Okay.

375
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:11,347
Yes, Sister Cindy. Don't be shy, just let us know what you need.

376
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,015
We're all rooting for you.

377
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:18,148
- If so, I will count on you to handle these for me.
- No problem.

378
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:21,414
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't handle this part.

379
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:22,615
As for the self-contradictory part…

380
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:23,948
As for the bulldozer part…

381
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,914
Well, I'm pregnant.

382
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:27,414
I'll do it.

383
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:28,747
Can I touch it?

384
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:30,813
It's just formed.

385
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:39,081
This one, please help me handle this.

386
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,682
See if there's anything you like, I'll give it to you.

387
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:44,413
The rest, I'll trouble you as well.

388
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,814
Idiot, I go to your house often.

389
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,148
It's for you.

390
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,748
New sprouts are growing.

391
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:56,681
All right, bye.

392
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,048
Do you have time to chat?

393
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,115
Of course.

394
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,948
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

395
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:34,115
Wait! When it comes to helping someone,

396
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:36,015
everyone has run away.

397
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,860
No one is here.

398
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,140
Okay, fine.

399
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:45,848
This one.

400
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:49,981
Just leave it. I'll do it.

401
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:20,115
- You look…
- You look…

402
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:22,514
- So familiar.
- So familiar.

403
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,114
I didn't know you liked watching night scenery.

404
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,647
I didn't know I liked watching night scenery either.

405
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,380
Usually at this time, I'm either working overtime

406
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,314
or on my way home from working overtime.

407
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,414
I've never seen the night scenery.

408
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:10,415
So, the night scenery is very novel to me.

409
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:15,381
But if I had to choose again,

410
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,480
I would still go back to work overtime.

411
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:24,648
So am I the first person to watch the night scenery with you?

412
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:33,580
Meng Heng, have you thought about your future?

413
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,914
Yes, I have.

414
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,747
But...

415
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:42,813
I'm still figuring it out as I go.

416
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,215
But don't worry.

417
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:49,888
I'll make sure you live the life you want before I turn thirty.

418
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:01,714
Do you know how old I'll be in eight years?

419
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,047
Forget it, don't calculate.

420
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,815
I don't want to know.

421
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:16,982
Whether it's eight years or eighty years, you are still you.

422
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,281
You will always be the Cindy I like.

423
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:30,948
Do you remember the amusement park we went to before?

424
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:34,313
Of course, I do. It was fun that day.

425
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:37,248
Yes, it was very fun.

426
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:41,647
But just after those happy days,

427
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,980
you know, my hand hurt for three days.

428
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,748
Your hand hurt for three days?

429
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,880
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:51,548
That's not the point.

431
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:55,781
And it was at that time that I discovered,

432
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:59,315
that our gap was not just in age,

433
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:02,914
but also, in our planning for the future.

434
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,381
Even if there is a gap,

435
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:21,914
if there's anything you want me to do, I can accommodate you.

436
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:30,348
But I can't stop and wait for you.

437
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:47,881
But we are happy together, aren't we?

438
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:04,514
Thank you. It was truly happy.

if you are willing, you are welcome to join my department after graduation.

Because by that time,

447
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:10,581
Sisters Yazi and Xiaoyun will definitely be fighting to have me.

448
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,981
Because I will become very strong.

You're amazing.

452
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,681

00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:08,082
If Zhang Shiping does wrong by you,

459
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,448
you must tell me.

Look at how serious he is about you.

466
00:28:56,047 --> 00:29:01,780
Even if the method was not perfect, his intention was perfect.

467
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,581
Don't you know I'm just a secretary?

468
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,048
- I know that.
- You know that, yet you still chose me?

469
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,114
You don't know the secretary's work is just to serve tea, deliver water, and do some unimportant tasks.

470
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:14,648
Is this really what you want to do?

471
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:17,148
So, the small tasks I do are also important.

472
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:19,747

Let me tell you. Asking us to work overtime at night to move these things,

513
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:50,980
we could make a complaint to the labor department.

514

Since we're already here helping,

515
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:54,448
just stop complaining. Okay?

 - Guo.

- Have you finished moving?
- Almost finished.

525
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:25,914
Please. Please be extra careful.

Plants are living things.

560
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,648
The president told me

561
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:26,850
that you told him not to promote me to vice president.

562
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,814
I haven't settled this score with you.

563
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,848
But he also said, that it was you...

564

who asked him to let me go to the overseas business department as a manager.

565
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,281
Although the title isn't as prestigious as vice president,

566
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,182
the stage is bigger, and the scope of interaction is wider.

567
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,681
There may be many challenges,

568
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:53,560
but I believe you will definitely enjoy it.

569
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,480
Not becoming the vice president is quite frustrating,

570
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,081
but I have to admit that you do understand me very well.

571
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:03,780

572
00:35:05,348 --> 00:35:07,547

That's right.

579
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,515
She also reminded me to keep my word.

580
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:56,230

It's okay.

582
00:35:58,748 --> 00:36:03,430
Letting your girlfriend be a bit capricious is perfectly justified and proper.

583
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,215
But I have to say it first. I can't do a long-distance relationship.

00:44:24,014 --> 00:44:25,347
- Let's go.
- No, you can…

706
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:26,581
The boss has gone home.

707
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,847
Gone home, right? At home, right?

708
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:29,415
That's great.

709
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:32,514
Don't think you can sneak away.

710
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:35,948
There was a time when I really disliked Gao Shuangyun.

711
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:38,748
But then I realized she is the reason I can't slack off,

712
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:41,515
and the source of my self-discipline.

713
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,581
It's good that Cindy is here.

714
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,347
A competition without rivals is very lonely.

715
00:44:48,347 --> 00:44:51,148
As always, I have to be grateful to my rivals

716
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:54,214
for making me a better person.

717
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:58,452
[The end]

718
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:03,091
♫ Since the world is already beyond saving ♫

719
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,934
♫ Might as well go mad sooner ♫

720
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:07,936
♫ Sooner or later, it will be riddled with holes ♫

721
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:09,984
♫ There are millions of thoughts ♫

722
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:12,520
♫ Empty all the judgments made about you ♫

723
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,081
♫ Still need to go with the flow and show off together ♫

724
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:20,164
♫ How can you and I appear so bewildered ♫

725
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:23,264
[Dedicated to every woman in the workplace striving to overcome prejudice]

726
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:26,768
[And to the men who withstand expectations. You are the strongest warriors]

727
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,859
♫ In the end, what can still ♫

728
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:34,013
♫ Be upheld ♫

729
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:36,338
♫ I can no longer believe ♫

730
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:40,263
♫ In right and wrong ♫

731
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,196
♫ The boundless sea of stars ♫

732
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:47,075
♫ I wait for you to become no longer illusory ♫

733
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:51,813
♫ I wait for you to become no longer illusory ♫

734
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:57,001
♫ Those past hurts ♫

735
00:45:57,001 --> 00:46:00,370
♫ The involuntary evil ♫

736
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:04,861
♫ All are left behind ♫

737
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:10,150
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

738
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,973
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

739
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:17,792
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

740
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:22,973
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

741
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:26,359
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

742
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:28,454
♫ Because of you ♫

743
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:33,469
♫ I'm no longer afraid of loneliness and solitude ♫
