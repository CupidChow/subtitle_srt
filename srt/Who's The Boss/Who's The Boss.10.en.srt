By the way, I ran into Lu Yicheng earlier

66

Yes, he adamantly denies it, being very despicable.

69
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,170
But in the end, I used some methods

70
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,610
to finally get him to agree to meet with you, Vice President.

80

00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,412
First, have a drink with me.

178
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,778
I have to pick up my daughter later.

179
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:35,180
I'll drink this, tea instead of wine.

180
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,611
I'll join you for a drink.

181
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:42,072
You drove here on purpose to avoid drinking, didn't you?

182
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:44,445
- A sense of ritual.
- Fine.

183
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:51,779
Go on, what happened?

184
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:58,345
I finally went public today

185
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:04,144
and let the staff know that Aisi is my niece.

186
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:05,412
That's very good.

187
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,945
From now on at the company, you can

188
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,277
openly take care of your own people.

189
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,279
As you know,

190
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,512
our family company was founded by my father-in-law.

191
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,977
He still doesn't trust me up to this point.

192
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:25,177
You know about Sister Chen, my secretary.

193
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,612
She was intentionally placed by my father-in-law by my side

194
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,378
to keep an eye on me.

195
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:38,245
So, are you worried that your niece working at your company

196
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,844
will make others think you're unfair?

197
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,611
This is quite cute, you know.

198
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,846
Actually, I don't think you should mind

199
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,112
when others make a joke about it.

200
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:05,944
You and Fang Aisi are both so young. You really could give it a try.

201
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:08,845
All right, this topic is over.

202
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,746
Why end this topic?

203
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,744
I think Fang Aisi is very pretty. You should pursue her.

204
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,412
You really can't read people's expressions.

205
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:18,211
That's why you're so unpopular.

206
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,311
Why do you bring that up?

207
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,279
Lu Yicheng, upon hearing Chen Han say you were looking for him,

208
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,312
changed his account right away.

209
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,444
Now the trail has gone cold.

210
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:31,077
Am I really so annoying?

211
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:39,779
Why? It'll cause wrinkles, you know.

212
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,745
I'll pinch both sides, then it'll be fine.

213
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:42,878
- You can't do that.
- No.

214
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:45,679
I… Let me pinch it.

215
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,545
Let me stretch out your nasolabial folds for you.

216
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:50,012
- You…
- Is this workplace bullying?

217
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:54,712
What a coincidence.

218
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:58,178
Do you have time to take a walk with me?

219
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,344
Sure.

220
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:14,645
She's off work now.

221
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,878
There should be no need for an intern, right?

222
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,977
Then you pay for me, and I'll give it back to you when I return.

223
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,112
Go back first.

224
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,645
Okay.

225
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,746
Do you know?

226
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:36,612
I like this period of time at night the most.

227
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,445
Because it is the moment

228
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:43,211
my heart is the calmest in the whole day.

229
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,345
Usually, by this time, things are basically done.

230
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,111
It's a good time to summarize the day's work.

231
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:56,412
Then plan for tomorrow's work,

232
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:59,479
seeing whether to adjust or sprint.

233
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:05,411
So you also like to use this time to settle yourself?

234
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:10,079
This is my favorite moment of the day.

235
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,512
I call it the magical moment.

236
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,544
It's also when my mind is the clearest.

237
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,278
It seems we've found our first common ground.

238
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,346
Wasn't our first common point that supermarket?

239
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:28,712
Right, both your company and your home aren't near here.

240
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:32,944
Why do you frequently appear in this supermarket?

241
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,578
If I say I was there waiting for you,

242
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,544
would you believe that?

243
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:43,845
Such a wait-and-see approach isn't very time-efficient.

244
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:46,178
You're too smart for that, no way.

245
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,145
If that were the case,

246
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,545
I'd have to give it some serious thought.

247
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:55,845
Actually, Yiyi's nanny lives nearby.

248
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,746
Sometimes I drive her back here

249
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,778
and stop by the supermarket to pick up a few things.

250
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,845
How was your summary of today?

251
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:09,544
I met you at my best time.

252
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,845
I know you've told me you want to slow down,

253
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:25,145
but I'm sorry, I disagree.

254
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,944
♫ Be upheld ♫

255
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:32,978
What's this?

256
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:37,811
This is to say thank you for taking care of Yiyi last time.

257
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:43,712
Since it's a thank-you gift, I'll accept it.

258
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,677
Aren't you going to open it?

259
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:51,616
♫ Those past hurts ♫

260
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,177
This golf outfit is very nice.

261
00:16:56,177 --> 00:17:00,811
I believe it will certainly compliment your temperament.

262
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:06,879
And I have to tell you, I have a feeling.

263
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,878
What feeling?

264
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:15,245
I feel that we will have more and more opportunities to spend time together.

265
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:19,616
Don't forget. I don't know yet whether Yiyi and I can become friends.

266
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:29,878
[Xiaoyun]  The president has made a last-minute appointment to play golf at six o'clock tomorrow morning.

267
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:35,111
Playing golf with the president at 6:00 is too early.

268
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:38,378
I'm sorry, but I might need to go home early to rest.

269
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:41,380
That's perfect.

270
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,470
Tomorrow, you can wear the new golf clothes.

271
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,412
I'll take you home.

272
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:48,878
Okay.

273
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:11,845
A joint construction project being led by Bosheng Architectural Design Firm.

274
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:16,944
Whoever seals the deal will have the position of sales department manager.

275
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:22,045
I hope the president isn't going to assign another task.

276
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:29,445
Gao Shuangyun, I won't lose to you this time.

277
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:34,444
You guys should warm up with some exercises as well.

278
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:37,045
Otherwise, you might get injured during the exercise.

279
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,946
President, I am all ready. I can start at any time.

280
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,978
Me too.

281
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:43,444
But there's no rush.

282
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:46,412
We don't have everyone yet.

283
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:51,968
Look, the mystery guest has arrived.

284
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,444
Good morning, everyone.

285
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,378
Morning.

286
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:03,045
Sorry.

287
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:08,611
Your outfits today

288
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:11,412
match quite well, don't they?

289
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:14,812
The couple value is very high.

290
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:18,078
President, it's just a coincidence.

291
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:32,178
I have done everything as you instructed.

292
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,212
I've avoided everything I could.

293
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:39,077
But Cindy Wang won't give up until the end.

294
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,745
She not only came to my house but also sought me out through Chen Han.

295
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,578
It's really bothering me now.

296
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,978
I will transfer some more money to you.

297
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:53,212
Will that lessen your troubles?

298
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:55,112
Absolutely.

299
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,944
This is the last time.

300
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,879
I hope we won't see each other again in the future.

301
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,645
Definitely.

302
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,078
Sister Duomi is so troublesome.

303
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,678
Isn't caramel latte all the same?

304
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:18,212
Which one you drink doesn't make a difference.

305
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:43,145
- Hello. I would like a caramel latte.
- One caramel latte.

306
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:44,279
Use this.

307
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,508
Do you have limited-edition handmade cookies?

308
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,145
- Yes, we have handmade cookies.
- Then I'll take one.

309
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,224
- Another handmade cookie.
- Right.

310
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,784
Okay, that brings your total to 250 for today.

311
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:51,745
Good, that's all for now.

312
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,078
- Okay, thank you.
- Wait a moment.

313
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:54,576
Okay.

314
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,145
How can it be so coincidental?

315
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,512
I'm so unlucky.

316
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:11,877
He isn't coming in here, is he?

317
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,112
Occupied.

318
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:20,511
Someone's inside.

319
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,079
Thank you.

320
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,511
If you want to drive the ball further in your tee-off,

321
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:13,177
you'll need to find a way to extend your backswing trajectory.

322
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:17,344
That way, when you come down in the swing, you'll have more time to accelerate.

323
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,479
- Give it a try.
- Okay.

324
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:21,545
Nice shot!

325
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,812
Thank you.

326
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,344
Give it a try.

327
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,745
I told you I had a feeling

328
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:38,045
that we would have more and more opportunities to spend time together.

329
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:41,743
It's not a feeling. You cheated. Didn't you?

330
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:44,412
It's very clear that you were the one who arranged this.

331
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,611
Otherwise, why would you have given me this outfit yesterday?

332
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:52,345
Yes, it's like being in love.

333
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:56,379
The wise create opportunities, the strong seize them,

334
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,545
while the weak can only wait for them.

335
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,511
Extend further, nice shot!

336
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:04,078
- Not bad, you've improved.
- Nice shot!

337
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:07,648
Now, I'm going to seize the opportunity and perform well.

338
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,011
Nice shot!

339
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,312
Nice shot!

340
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:25,312
Did you see that?

341
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:29,578
Director Zhang's performance is utterly on a professional level.

342
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:32,344
Director Zhang, who would have thought you played golf so well?

343
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,044
You're completely on par with professional players.

344
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:36,512
Thank you.

345
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,278
Were you waiting at the door?

346
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,812
But it took you so long.

347
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:46,979
It's just a few minutes' walk.

348
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:50,011
Now that Cindy isn't there, you're not loafing around, are you?

349
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,545
No, it's just that there were quite a few deliveries today.

350
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:53,678
I've been waiting so long I almost fell asleep.

351
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:56,778
Ms. Chen, Meng Heng is here for an internship,

352
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,412
not to be your delivery person.

353
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:59,912
Please don't abuse your position for personal gain,

354
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:02,646
having our Meng Heng run errands for you.

355
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,912
No, Sister Duomi didn't ask me to run errands for her.

356
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:08,611
I bought it for her when I went to get coffee.

357
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:11,312
Is that so? Is the coffee from there any good?

358
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:13,645
Which one is it? What do you usually drink?

359
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,845
What did I just hear?

360
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:19,346
Since when did it become "our" Meng Heng?

361
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,312
Take a sip of water.

362
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:24,644
Thank you.

363
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:26,544
What do you think of this…

364
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:36,312
Does the boss know you're pursuing me?

365
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:38,212
"A fair lady is a gentleman's good match."

366
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:40,412
There's no need to hide it.

367
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,145
Mr. President and I have been good friends for many years, and…

368
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:47,078
This suit of clothes, I'll return them to you after washing.

369
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:52,860
Sorry for ruining everyone's good mood.

370
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,845
I believe the company pays me to work,

371
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,545
not to fall in love.

372
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,145
Manager, I thought you were as professional as I am,

373
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:04,578
and dislike people like Mr. Xi who take advantage of work to ask people out.

374
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:06,711
What do you take me for?

375
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:09,711
I am truly disappointed.

376
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,177
I don't know what misunderstandings you have.

377
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:16,712
However, if you can't pursue her,

378
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:20,245
don't let our cooperation go to waste.

379
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,344
Come on.

380
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:23,879
Thank you.

381
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:26,212
Come on.

382
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,312
The leaders are all gone.

383
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:35,078
Chen Han and Meng Heng, do you want to have lunch early?

384
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,978
I'm buying.

385
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:49,011
Let's eat.

386
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:51,145
No thanks, you guys go ahead.

387
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:54,845
Playing video games really saves money.

388
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:56,578
Chen Han, let's go.

389
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:59,145
I'm rushing the land development strategy that Sister Yazi wants.

390
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:01,478
She said she wanted to see it when she got back to the office.

391
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,446
I don't have time to eat. Brother, you go ahead.

392
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:07,812
Indeed, Brother Yingjun was right.

393
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:11,177
Xu Yazi is really treating you guys as errand runners.

394
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:13,344
Look at Xiaoting, she went to the site early in the morning

395
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:14,912
to collect the sales daily report.

396
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,344
And you, rushing and rushing over here.

397
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:20,045
As for her, she's nowhere to be seen all day,

398
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,280
only caring about sales performance.

399
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,896
There's nothing I can do about it. I am just hardworking, obedient, and responsible.

400
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:29,045
Obedient? You are overly responsible, you know.

401
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,944
In the eyes of a superior, there is no such thing as being overly responsible,

402
00:26:30,944 --> 00:26:33,045
only shared hardship.

403
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,179
I thought given Cindy Wang's previous performance,

404
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,278
Xu Yazi would be gentler with you guys.

405
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,111
Turns out it's about the same.

406
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:45,579
But it's not quite the same though.

407
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:48,812
Xiaoting said if it was the same situation,

408
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:51,879
Cindy used to pay out of her own pocket to give them bonuses.

409
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:55,212
You know it's not much, but it's the thought that counts.

410
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:59,412
But Sister Yazi, well…

411
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,812
What's going on?

412
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:04,578
Everyone in the world is hailing cars, aren't they?

413
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,744
No one is taking my order.

414
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:12,312
No, Meng Heng is at work now.

415
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:13,745
If I ask him to come pick me up,

416
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:16,578
wouldn't that be the same as using work for private gain like they do?

417
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,270
Cindy.

418
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,720
Listen to me first.

419
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,845
Perfect timing.

420
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:27,378
I want to make things clear to you.

421
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:36,008
It's not that I don't accept your pursuit.

422
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:39,245
But I think in terms of work, we should all be a bit more professional. Right?

423
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:41,944
Work and personal feelings should not be mixed in the first place.

424
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:45,511
And I hate being the topic of others' after-dinner conversations.

425
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,545
I'm sorry, I was too high-profile.

426
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:50,011
But you really misunderstood me.

427
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,771
Your boss is a businessman.

428
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,879
Business is business.

429
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,845
Do you think he would, because I am pursuing you,

430
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:04,078
simultaneously invite you and Manager Gao to play golf together?

431
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:08,712
Even now as we stand here talking,

432
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,845
he has to pay you a salary.

433
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:13,712
Yeah, but isn't that too much of a coincidence?

434
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:16,868
You just gave me the clothes yesterday. And the boss arranged to play golf today.

435
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:20,379
And didn't you see the two of them whispering over there?

436
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,778
Because they were discussing

437
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:29,378
whether the sustainable housing in Taoyuan should be led by you.

438
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,212
I do believe in your abilities, but your boss said

439
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:39,978
we still need to respect the formality and go through the sales department manager.

440
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:43,556
I know we could have discussed this matter at your company as well.

441
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:47,078
I do have ulterior motives.

442
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:49,244
On one hand, I want to rely on your abilities,

443
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:55,578
on the other hand, I also want to spend more time with you.

444
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:58,578
I'm sorry, I have been greedy.

445
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:05,978
So, after this incident,

446
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,645
you should know that I am impulsive and have a bad temper.

447
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:12,278
Do you want to consider it again?

448
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:23,078
I have indeed found that you…

449
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:29,077
have an upright and diligent work attitude.

450
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:30,879
This also confirms one thing

451
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:33,411
that my taste is really good.

452
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:34,712
You praise two people at once.

453
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:36,844
You're quite amazing, aren't you?

454
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:46,711
And you purposely overlook my shortcomings, blinded by love.

455
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:48,445
I won't deny it.

456
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:54,145
But I also want to know if you've been blinded by love.

457
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:58,560
Seeing my cool tee-off just now, did it make you swoon?

458
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,045
A little bit, yes.

459
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:07,012
Also, I've changed my mind.

460
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:10,712
I'm not giving you back the clothes.

461
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:17,956
Then, may I have the honor to give you a ride?

462
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:21,111
You've already opened the door.

463
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,444
Meng Heng, your boss isn't here today.

464
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:43,048
Shall we go have lunch together?

465
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:45,156
- Why are you speaking so loudly?
- You're wearing headphones.

466
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:46,944
How can you hear me if I don't speak up?

467
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,379
My headphones aren't playing anything.

468
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,312
You can just speak at a normal volume.

469
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:52,479
Then what's the meaning of you wearing these?

470
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:54,320
For decoration.

471
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,211
I really don't get it. I don't understand your generation's sense of aesthetics at all.

472
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,145
Does it look good this way?

473
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:01,344
It's not for looking good.

474
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,144
I'm doing it to…

475
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,944
filter out some distractions.

476
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:08,445
Distractions?

477
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:11,478
Meng Heng, look this way. Yeah.

478
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:14,379
What are you doing?

479
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:16,511
Posting. This is our first photo together.

480
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,978
I'm going to tag you.

481
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:21,312
BFF.

482
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,545
What's BFF?

483
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:24,712
Best Friend Forever.

484
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,245
Meng Heng, these are handmade cookies I made.

485
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:30,845
To go with your afternoon tea.

486
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:35,111
Meng Heng, what a coincidence.

487
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:37,479
Isn't this the handmade cookie

488
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,911
from the coffee shop I mentioned today?

489
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:44,212
I wanted to trick you, but you busted me.

490
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:48,512
Don't worry about bothering me. We're friends, after all.

491
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:50,577
Let me help you take it inside.

492
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,278
Friend. You can rely on me.

493
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:04,578
Are you trying to ward off some romantic interests?

494
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:06,978
It feels like you're showing off.

495
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:08,578
Not at all.

496
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:09,978
She was putting so much effort into it.

497
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:12,011
This is not okay.

498
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:13,545
I am really embarrassed, you know.

499
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:15,445
The pressure is immense.

500
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:16,845
Let me tell you.

501
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:21,132
You'll feel more and more pressure, and it's getting closer.

502
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:21,944
Why?

503
00:32:21,944 --> 00:32:25,545
Meng Heng, you finally stopped playing games.

504
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:28,312
I saw you playing games earlier and didn't dare to disturb you.

505
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:29,879
What game are you playing?

506
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,912
It must be fun. I want to play, too.

507
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:33,879
The game I'm playing

508
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:36,111
is too brutal.

509
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:38,379
It's very difficult, not suitable for you.

510
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:41,645
Indeed, I'm not very good at it.

511
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:43,212
Right.

512
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,812
What would you like for lunch? I'll treat you.

513
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:48,511
Ms. Chen, come join us.

514
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:50,011
Sure.

515
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,444
But there are only ten minutes left for lunchtime.

516
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:56,479
If you go, who will look after the reception?

517
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,278
It's okay, just for a little while.

518
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,778
There won't be anyone around noon.

519
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,911
Right, let's go.

520
00:33:02,678 --> 00:33:04,045
Let's go.

521
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:10,211
Do you think that the reception job is not important

522
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,011
and that's why you have such thoughts?

523
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:16,378
Let me tell you. Every job exists for a reason.

524
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:17,888
Okay?

525
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:20,545
The reception is the face of a company

526
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:22,545
and also an important checkpoint.

527
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:25,612
How can you say it's okay?

528
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,812
It's okay.

529
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:33,145
Let's order takeout then, it's okay.

530
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,312
If you don't like this job, it means you are not passionate about it.

531
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:39,245
If there's no passion, then I think...

532
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:43,378
you should change your path.

533
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:51,678
That's why I wanted to become a flight attendant.

534
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:06,012
Look at him.

535
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:08,245
He's so young and unaware of the treacherous world.

536
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,578
That's why such words were spoken.

537
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,712
Talking about how vast the world is.

538
00:34:14,712 --> 00:34:16,444
Wouldn't I know?

539
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:17,679
I kindly reminded him,

540
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,145
and yet he lectured me with grand principles.

541
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,379
I think you are overreacting.

542
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,878
You wanted to become her friend,

543
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:27,379
and now you're keeping your distance from her. What's that about?

544
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:32,278
I didn't know she was so clingy.

545
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,444
And we've been together at the company all day already.

546
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,345
Why make plans after work?

547
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:40,178
- Then what are you doing over here now?
- Right.

548
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,644
- I am just…
- We also spent the whole day together at work.

549
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:46,111
- Isn't that too clingy?
- Yes.

550
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,811
It's different.

551
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:49,912
How is it different?

552
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:53,945
When I am with you all, I don't have to think of ways to try to please you.

553
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:56,444
But you aren't trying to please Fang Aisi either.

554
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:57,444
Exactly.

555
00:34:57,444 --> 00:35:00,512
Let's talk about something else. Don't talk about this.

556
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,052
Change the topic.

557
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:05,011
- That's so forced.
- Yeah.

558
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:10,570
- Is there really something?
- We can talk about what you have strived for at work.

559
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:16,012
Of course, it's to realize our own dreams.

560
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:18,278
Dreams, and what else?

561
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:19,624
Money.

562
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:20,679
That's important, too.

563
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,645
Then good salary and bonus systems

564
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:26,112
should be your priority when choosing a company.

565
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:29,145
You want a high salary,

566
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:30,679
and then you don't want to work overtime,

567
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,879
don't you think that's contradictory?

568
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:36,512
Not really, I wouldn't put all my eggs in the same basket.

569
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:39,845
I would take a portion to invest as a form of passive income.

570
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,712
And the second portion I'd save…

571
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:46,345
Hold on, this all sounds very familiar.

572
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,345
That ex-boyfriend of mine who swindled my money

573
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:50,444
would often talk to me about passive income.

574
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:53,645
He told me to drink one less coffee a day, saying I would quickly achieve financial freedom.

575
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:56,178
And what happened? He got free.

576
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:58,079
But what about my wealth?

577
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:01,977
You were lovesick. That's different.

578
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:02,977
- So it's a special case.
- I don't want to hear it.

579
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:04,045
All right, don't listen.

580
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:05,512
- Drink up.
- Wait up.

581
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:08,311
There must still be many in this world

582
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:10,977
willing to make sacrifices for love. Right?

583
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:14,978
Such as Director Zhang.

584
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:19,078
Speaking of him,

585
00:36:19,078 --> 00:36:21,311
you couldn't have played golf all day long, right?

586
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,445
Of course, we did other things too.

587
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,379
Doing other things until the night?

588
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:28,144
Naughty, naughty.

589
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,512
When we finished playing ball during the day, we went to the company to discuss work in the afternoon. Okay?

590
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:36,212
Discussing work with this kind of smitten face, huh?

591
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:41,444
Director Zhang wants me to take over the sales of sustainable housing in Taoyuan.

592
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:42,745
Really?

593
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:45,846
So you've gone back to being a specialist.

594
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,778
I actually don't quite understand it.

595
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:51,078
Your romance is mixed with work relations.

596
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:53,311
Does he like you as a person

597
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,511
or does he like your work abilities?

598
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:59,044
Of course, he likes me as a person

599
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,279
and my work abilities.

600
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:04,977
- Come on…
- I didn't…

601
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,578
- So careless.
- Cover it up.

602
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,345
- My goodness.
- Encountering love,

603
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:10,412
you just completely fill me up.

604
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:12,311
All right, stop wiping it.

605
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:14,144
[Charging]
This one's fine with both dry and wet.

606
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,679
Just leave it to the machine.

607
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,645
[Pause]

608
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,212
Why did it suddenly move?

609
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:19,712
I didn't start it.

610
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:22,145
I've set us as family members.

611
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:24,576
Why did you set up the app for my home items?

612
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,345
Am I not considered your family? Otherwise…

613
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,945
does Zhang Shiping count now?

614
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:30,979
He does.

615
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:32,578
He does? You gave me goosebumps.

616
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:34,411
Does he help you clean?

617
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:36,645
You are someone who simply doesn't clean the house.

618
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:37,645
Yes, I do.

619
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:39,444
You should just hurry up and marry Zhang Shiping, then.

620
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:40,578
He must have a cleaning lady at his house.

621
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:41,745
- That's good.
- I marry him?

622
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:43,311
You want me to marry him just for the cleaning?

623
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,045
He's so wealthy. He must have a cleaning lady.

624
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,212
- And what do you mean by tiring you out?
- Feet.

625
00:37:46,212 --> 00:37:47,345
Did you help me clean?

626
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,379
- How did I not help you clean?
- Feet.

627
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:50,879
- We've all helped you clean, see?
- All right.

628
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,416
So I'll marry him. What's the big deal?

629
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,344
- Just because of this…
- Marry him, then!

630
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:02,045
The floor is so dirty and you didn't clean it.

631
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,245
And there's a bunch of hair on the sofa.

632
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:07,245
How can you get married like that? Clean it yourself.

633
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,444
I'm going home now.

634
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,278
[Sales Department Manager Gao Shuangyun]

635
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:24,811
As for the subsequent sales strategy and general direction for sustainable housing in Taoyuan,

636
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:27,044
I've already put them on the cloud.

637
00:38:27,044 --> 00:38:30,645
The work progress came out so quickly, huh?

638
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:33,988
Your work ability and efficiency are still so good.

639
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:35,478
Efficiency is competitiveness.

640
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:37,379
This is what I demand of myself.

641
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:40,645
Additionally, I will cooperate with the Planning Department moving forward.

642
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:43,579
But rest assured, the secretary's work will still be done well.

643
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,278
That I believe.

644
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:48,611
And then…

645
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:53,112
I misunderstood you and the boss yesterday, sorry about that.

646
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:54,944
It's okay.

647
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:57,144
The fact that you got so angry indicates

648
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,778
that in your eyes, I am not someone who would betray you.

649
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:01,678
It shows you trust me.

650
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:05,478
Honestly, I only heard it from the boss at the golf course yesterday,

651
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:08,012
about putting you in charge of sales.

652
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,944
And he even gave me a heads-up while we were playing golf.

653
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:13,379
He said he would tell you at the restaurant.

654
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:16,444
But then you got upset and left first.

655
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:20,044
I'm just a very efficient person, even flipping out.

656
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:22,712
Efficiency is competitiveness.

657
00:39:22,712 --> 00:39:25,178
However, communication is the key to success in work.

658
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:28,645
If you could learn to listen before others finish,

659
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:31,278
I think your popularity would improve a lot.

660
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,745
I understand your point, thank you.

661
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:37,444
Oh, right! I have to remind you,

662
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:40,245
we need to coordinate with the Planning Department next.

663
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,412
They are not easy to serve.

664
00:39:42,412 --> 00:39:44,512
Especially that Manager Wu.

665
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,345
You'll have to be careful.

666
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:47,878
I know.

667
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:52,079
I'm Secretary Li from the planning department.

668
00:39:55,912 --> 00:39:58,978
I really am Secretary Li from the planning department.

669
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:02,245
How are you going to prove that you are Secretary Li?

670
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,545
As the company's most important receptionist,

671
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,444
I must properly filter out idlers and riffraff.

672
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:10,344
If you can't prove it, I can't let you in.

673
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,412
I usually always carry my access card.

674
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,311
It just so happens that I forgot to bring it today.

675
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,478
Just show her your access card.

676
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:19,178
- Is it that difficult?
- I just told her, that I forgot to bring it.

677
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:20,912
Didn't you hear?

678
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:22,745
Look at Fang Aisi, doing her nails all day,

679
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:24,545
dressing herself up beautifully.

680
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,912
She must be the one seducing the boss.

681
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,810
- I didn't...
- No.

682
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,245
Meng Heng, you're here.

683
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:35,478
Look! I'm working very seriously.

684
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:36,645
I haven't casually let anyone in.

685
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,012
I verify each one individually

686
00:40:39,012 --> 00:40:40,944
and filter identities one by one.

687
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,879
I'm great, aren't I?

688
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,944
Great, very diligent.

689
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:51,746
- You don't have to queue. Hurry into the company.
- No need to queue?

690
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,779
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

691
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:58,412
- Well…
- Hurry up and come in.

692
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,211
Go ahead.

693
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:01,578
I'll continue to work diligently.

694
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:03,911
- Bye.
- Okay.

695
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:12,400
How exactly are you going to prove that you are Secretary Li?

696
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:17,278
Sorry, the most important, the most esteemed,

697
00:41:17,278 --> 00:41:20,245
and the most beautiful receptionist Ms. Fang,

698
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:24,112
excuse us, can we two go in first?

699
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:27,846
- We have an appointment with Meng Heng.
- Right.

700
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,012
- We have a meeting to discuss matters.
- Meng Heng.

701
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,478
Then hurry up and get in, don't keep Meng Heng waiting

702
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:31,552
Hurry up.

703
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:32,912
Quickly, let's go now.

704
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:34,720
Wait a moment.

705
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,311
I didn't expect the royal relative to be

706
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:54,792
so proactive just because of your words.

707
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:59,200
I guess flattering the right people is more important than being able to work.

708
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,645
Do as much work as the pay received.

709
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,512
"Go for wool and come home shorn."

710
00:42:04,512 --> 00:42:06,278
Have you heard of it?

711
00:42:06,912 --> 00:42:08,812
What do you mean?

712
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:24,604
[The truth is like age spots. It may come late, but it will definitely come.]

713
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:28,336
[Next Episode]
- Can't you control your subordinates?
- Who said that?

714
00:42:28,336 --> 00:42:30,444
Getting rid of you is as easy as a snap of the fingers.

715
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:31,778
It's all up to me.

716
00:42:31,778 --> 00:42:34,578
If there's anything wrong, you would tell me, wouldn't you?

717
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:37,778
Xiaoyun! Xiaoyun, wait a moment!

718
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:41,112
Actually, the vice president bought two identical bracelets.

719
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:44,645
They are really holding hands.

720
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,778
Meng Heng, ou've been tricked.

721
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:49,645
How can that be?

722
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:55,178
When I ran into Meng Heng today, my heartbeat sped up.

723
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,519
♫ In the end, what can still ♫

724
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,675
♫ Be upheld ♫

725
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:05,200
♫ I can no longer believe ♫

726
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,625
♫ In right and wrong ♫

727
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,858
♫ The boundless sea of stars ♫

728
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:15,727
♫ I wait for you to become no longer illusory ♫

729
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:20,582
♫ I wait for you to become no longer illusory ♫

730
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:25,807
♫ Those past hurts ♫

731
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:29,132
♫ The involuntary evil ♫

732
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:33,553
♫ All are left behind ♫

733
00:43:33,553 --> 00:43:38,712
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

734
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:43,635
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

735
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:46,454
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

736
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:51,635
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

737
00:43:51,635 --> 00:43:54,921
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

738
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:57,216
♫ Because of you ♫

739
00:43:57,216 --> 00:44:02,331
♫ I'm no longer afraid of loneliness and solitude ♫

740
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:07,711
Marry him then!

741
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:14,211
The floor is so dirty and you didn't clean it.

742
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:16,412
And there's a bunch of hair on the sofa.

743
00:44:16,412 --> 00:44:19,577
How can you get married like that? Clean it yourself.

744
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:23,644
I'm going home now.

745
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:35,346
Is he… Is he angry now?

746
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:40,811
He's angry because my house is very dirty?

747
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,877
Hard to say, but it's possible.

748
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:46,344
But I know how to sweep the floor.

749
00:44:46,344 --> 00:44:48,544
Do you believe I can fish out trash casually in your house?

750
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:50,677
How is that possible?

751
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:55,012
Why is there blond hair?

752
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:57,745
Now you know how long it's been since you last vacuumed?

753
00:44:57,745 --> 00:44:58,977
What is this called?

754
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:01,578
You can see it, how about you vacuum it?

755
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:05,645
I really think you should just marry Zhang Shiping sooner.

756
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:07,944
Put it back in.

757
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:11,379
I've vacuumed and packed it.

758
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:13,545
It wouldn't be too much to take it back, right?

759
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,679
All right, stop haggling over there.

760
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,311
It really is so boring.

761
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:19,879
Haven't I done enough?

762
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:24,778
- It's such a simple task.
- Wang Cunfeng. Wang Cunfeng.

763
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:28,245
Only you can't see that Meng Heng likes you.
