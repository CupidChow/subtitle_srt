[Episode 22]

17
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,390
You kissed her, and then she became like this?

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,124
Tell the truth.

19
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,157
Did you do anything else besides kissing her?

20
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:34,391
Of course not.

21
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,923
I'm not some kind of freak.

22
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,291
What a pity.

23
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:53,158
No, I mean, it's good that you didn't.

24
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:56,725
So what's going on?

25
00:01:56,725 --> 00:02:00,990
I wanted to imitate the male lead from a romance show so I dominantly kissed her.

26
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,524
How would I know that kissing her would make her faint?

27
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,258
I don't know either, but…

28
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,090
You did well.

29
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:10,857
Should we take her to the hospital?

30
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:18,224
Her vital signs seem pretty stable to me.

31
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:20,358
I think we just need to observe her for a while.

32
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,491
I'll stay here with her. You can go back first.

33
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,757
It's okay, I'll stay here with you and wait for her to wake up.

34
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,190
No.

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,323
Here, let me talk to you.

00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:32,590
Here's what I think.

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,591
You know, if something happens, we'll contact you.

38
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,523
Shouldn't you get some rest first? That's better.

39
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:41,656
- Okay.
- Yes.

40
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,891
I'll handle the observation part.

41
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:54,224
And if something happens, you'll take action. Right?

42
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,558
- If she wakes up, you must contact me immediately.
- Definitely.

43
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:58,958
- Bye.
- Bye.

44

Fine, I'm getting up.

50
00:03:32,724 --> 00:03:35,124
How did you know I was faking it?

51
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:37,257
Come on. Who do you think I am?

52
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,991
How long have I been your bestie?

53
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:40,591

00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:42,048
Thanks.

55
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,391
But your move was not bad, quite creative.

56
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:51,324
Slowly.

57
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:55,191
How are you? What happened?

58
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,624
So I went to find Zhang Shiping today.

59
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,791
He didn't answer my calls or reply to my messages.

60
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,324
So I went to his company to see what was happening.

61
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:03,824
- Then the girl at the company's front desk…
- Pause.

62
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:06,623
I want the climax.

63
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,190
With whom?

64
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,023
How did you guys kiss? And how did his lips feel?

65
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:14,090
Did you use your tongues? Did your tongues do this?

66
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,890
I don't know! Everything happened so suddenly.

67
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,423
Don't ask me, I just… I just felt it was very scary.

68
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:20,958
Scary?

69
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,623
Why is it scary?

70
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:24,224
Meng Heng is very handsome.

71
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,558
Besides, it's not like you haven't kissed before.

72
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,491
No, that's not it.

73
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,858
- It's just…
- Just…

74
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,924
The thing I found scary is… you know what?

75
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:40,558
For a fraction of a second, I actually felt

76
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:42,691
that it wasn't bad.

77
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:45,523
And then I closed my eyes.

78
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:48,623
Isn't that great?

79
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,423
What are you scared of?

80
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,757
I have Zhang Shiping.

81
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:55,324
And I went to see him a second ago.

82
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:56,890
And I…

83
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,523
So you have Zhang Shiping. So what about Zhang Shiping?

84
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:02,925
It's not like you made the first move.

85
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,256
Please don't lead me astray, okay?

86
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,623
Sorry.

87
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,324
This Mr. Han kept saying he wanted to find Xiaoyun.

88
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:16,290
We really couldn't help it. So we used his phone to call you.

89
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,156
Thank you.

90
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:20,691
Let's settle the bill for him first.

91
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:22,240
Here.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,425
Be careful.

93
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,491
- Sorry, I'm drunk.
- Be careful. It's okay. Watch the road.

94
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:29,390
- Miss, your card and receipt.
- Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

95
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:33,590
Here, stand still. I'll open the door.

96
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,757
There are steps. Be careful.

97
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,491
Foot...

98
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,523
Are you okay?

99
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:48,458
Okay, just spit it out and you'll be fine.

100
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,857
Are you feeling better?

101
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:53,790
Are you all right?

102
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,491
Sorry.

103
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,825
Xiaoyun, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,324
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

105
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:02,191
This happens when you drink too much.

106
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:05,657
You were like this before, too. It's all right.

107
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,957
Sorry.

108
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:11,891
I…

109
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,023
I know I really did something wrong.

110
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:20,524
I… I really tried hard...

111
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,025
to do well.

112
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:29,156
I also want to repay Director Zhang.

113
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,458
I also want to make it up to you.

114
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:36,025
But it seems like no one believes me. I can do better.

115
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:41,357
No one believes me. I am really trying hard.

116
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,991
Everyone thinks I'm a bad person.

117
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:46,757
I'm really not a bad person.

118
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,191
I just want to do things well.

119
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:53,157
I want to be good to you.

120
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:56,858
I want things to be like they were before.

121
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,858
Sorry.

122
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:02,790
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,025
I don't blame you, I don't.

124
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,324
It's fine.

125
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:07,725
I'm not a bad person.

126
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,424
Okay, I know.

127
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:10,890
Stop crying.

128
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,790
It's fine.

129
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,325
Good morning.

130
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:35,657
I called you just now but you didn't pick up. So you came to work this early.

131
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,868
Yeah.

132
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,991
Thank you.

133
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,156
Are you okay?

134
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,557
I was really scared when you fainted yesterday.

135
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:52,291
I? I fainted?

136
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:56,156
I slept and forgot everything when I woke up.

137
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,256
By the way, the manager informed me last night,

138
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:02,790
saying she'd be coming to the office a bit late today.

139
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,258
So, for today, you can follow Brother Yingjun.

140
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:08,823
- Yingjun. You came just in time, come on.
- What's wrong?

141
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,591
Well, the manager instructed that when you go to visit Mr. Qin today,

142
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,825
you should take Meng Heng along.

143
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,324
Okay, but Mr. Qin is not available today.

144
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,358
I have arranged to meet him another day.

145
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,757
Then you should go to the construction materials exhibition.

146
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,256
The tickets are over at the counter.

147
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:23,858
You need to visit, take photos, and make records at each booth.

148
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,358
Wait a minute.

149
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:27,390
But this will take a whole day.

150
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,824
I still have other things to do today.

151
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,058
Anyway, the exhibition will last for several days.

152
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:33,323
- I will arrange with Meng Heng separately. Okay?
- Okay.

153
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:35,157
I'll get to work for now.

154
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,791
Then, you should go to the construction materials exhibition yourself. Okay?

155
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,256
That is your major. You will definitely understand.

156
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,325
It's about time now. You should go now. Go.

157
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,391
How am I supposed to learn alone?

158
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,557
Like what Brother Yingjun said, the exhibit lasts for a few days.

159
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:52,490
Why do I have to rush there today?

160
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:55,757
- Well, then, just…
- Cindy, come in with me for a moment.

161
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,657
Okay, I'm coming.

162
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:04,925
That's weird.

163
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,725
Where did the other earring go?

164
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,457
How could it be missing?

165
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:14,357
- What are you looking for?
- Forget it, the earring.

166
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,758
Where was the last place you saw it?

167
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:18,757
Or did you go somewhere just now? I'll help you find it.

168
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,290
It's all right, it's not important.

169
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,391
How is Director Zhang's company?

170
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:28,391
I heard from Vice President Han that he has already resigned and cut ties.

171
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:32,891
I think those suppliers and customers won't make things difficult for him anymore.

172
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,857
Probably not.

173
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:38,456
What about Han Xinzheng? What are his plans?

174
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,324
We haven't talked about this.

175
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:44,256
By the way, can you help me with something?

176
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:45,590
Sure, go ahead.

177
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,158
I'm having a meeting with the boss later, so I don't have time.

178
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:51,225
Can you help me buy a top?

179
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,758
A top.

180
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,490
This one you're wearing looks okay.

181
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:00,923
No, it's just…

182
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:05,358
You didn't go home last night.

183
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,891
Got it, wait for me a moment.

184
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:16,123
Wear this perfume first.

185
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:18,290
I'll figure out the top later.

186
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,858
Thanks.

187
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,558
You know true love won't hurt you.

188
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:33,924
What are you implying?

189
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,857
I'm not implying. I'm stating it clearly.

190
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:40,090
There are many people around you who are better than Han Xinzheng.

191
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,657
Like Zhou, for instance.

192
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:48,358
I can figure out my relationship matters.

193
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:52,391
This scent smells so familiar.

194
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:55,224
But it doesn't quite seem like your perfume.

195
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:58,025
I just took it from Chen Han's desk.

196
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,358
The one very effective for attracting love?

197
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:04,857
Yes, it should be that bottle. Wearing it makes you popular.

198
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:08,091
You should use more so that later in the meeting,

199
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,524
the boss won't target our sales department.

200
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,858
After the planning department took away the Xin Daqi project,

201
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:17,358
Manager Wu will definitely step on our sales department in the meeting.

202
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:21,957
Manager Wu will never give up any opportunity to attack us.

203
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:26,358
By the way, I talked to Guo Shijie.

204
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,558
We can conditionally let him come back.

205
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:30,824
You can discuss the specific details with him.

206
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,424
No problem.

207
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:38,123
- I'll go to the meeting first.
- Okay.

208
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:45,420
Manager.

209
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:50,824
Why haven't you left yet?

210
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:53,358
You… Do you need something from me?

211
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,624
Not me. Aisi is looking for you.

212
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:00,826
Sister Cindy, there's a package for you.

213
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:02,924
Please sign for it.

214
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,856
Thank you.

215
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:14,758
What are you looking at? Go do what you need to do.

216
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:15,891
Aren't you going to the construction materials exhibition?

217
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:17,457
Listen, you have to look carefully.

218
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,756
The manager will do pop quizzes, you know.

219
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,723
- Then, Sister Cindy, we are leaving.
- Okay.

220
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:24,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

221
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,558
What?

222
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,524
When someone can walk swiftly in high heels,

223
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,890
how could I think I was better than her?

224
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,357
Don't give me gifts every time you piss me off. Okay?

225
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:17,258
You have great taste, though.

226
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:22,090
Well, let's think of a return gift.

227
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,623
President, this pot on the left is Pu-erh tea for you and Manager Wu from the planning department.

228
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:30,924
The pot on the right is red dates and longan tea for Manager Gao.

229
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,790
You're very considerate.

230
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,657
Even the tea preparations are personalized.

231
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:37,258
Thank you, President.

232
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:39,358
These two are the materials for the meeting minutes later.

233
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,857
And this is this month's financial report from accounting.

234
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:44,725
- Okay.
- And this blue one is the project progress report from the engineering department.

235
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:48,023
Now, I'm about to go check on the details of tonight's Builders Association dinner.

236
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,291
If there are any issues, I will report them back to you. I'll take my leave now.

237
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,092
Slower, slower. Wait, you…

238
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:55,958
You said so much in one breath. My blood pressure almost skyrocketed.

239
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,090
What did you just say?

240
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,491
- Go to the restaurant for tonight's Builders Association dinner?
- Yes.

241
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,491
Why? Isn't that restaurant our long-term partner?

242
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,025
Why do you still need to look after it?

243
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:10,123
Because the restaurant just changed to a new chef two days ago.

244
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:15,024
I thought I'd make a trip myself to check for peace of mind.

245
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:19,091
Well, if you leave like this, who will take the meeting minutes later?

246
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,324
President, rest assured.

247
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:26,091
I will make the meeting minutes based on the recording when I get back.

248
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:27,023
Okay.

249
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,726
- Then I'll take my leave.
- Go ahead. Okay.

250
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,590
Goodbye, President.

251
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,924
Manager Gao.

252
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,391
You're here so early.

253
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,591
Yeah, I am a bit early today.

254
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:44,024
Sorry.

255
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:48,659
- You first, after you.
- Thank you.

256
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,391
You're welcome.

257
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,592
- Manager Gao, please sit down.
- President.

258
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,657
Here, this is what Zhou just prepared for you, Longan and Red Date Tea.

259
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,791
Drink it while it's hot.

260
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,891
- Okay.
- And please take a look at this one for me.

261
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,758
Okay.

262
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:05,790
President, are you okay?

263
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:11,056
No. I still feel more comfortable wearing it.

264
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,891
It's nothing, just help me take a look at that contract.

265
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:15,325
Okay.

266
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,824
So that's why Sister Cindy didn't dare to look at you.

267
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,858
As expected of my apprentice.

268
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,491
Kissing directly like that is so cool.

269
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,056
It's like filming a drama.

270
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:36,957
Come on, the ending was like a horror movie.

271
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:41,056
And now, she is clearly avoiding me.

272
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,324
I don't know what to do.

273
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:46,558
What else can you do? Just give up.

274
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:48,758
Or you could change your target.

275
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:51,323
For example, me?

276
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,457
Stop joking around.

277
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:56,758
All right.

278
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,891
You are really a devoted man.

279
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,324
Cindy ignored your strong signals of affection,

280
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:04,056
but you still want to pursue her.

281
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:07,858
She just ignored them. She didn't directly reject me.

282
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,856
And I probably, at least,

283
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:15,391
maybe, might still have a 1% chance.

284
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,725
As long as there's a chance, I don't want to give up.

285
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:22,290
All right, I just like devoted men like you.

286
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,557
I'll help you think of something.

287
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,191
Thank you so much.

288
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:32,324
If you were a man, I would definitely become sworn brothers with you on the spot.

289
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,891
I'm so beautiful.

290
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,458
It would be a pity if I were a man.

291
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,140
That's true.

292
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,925
Why do you need that document?

293
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:53,323
You will know when it's time.

294
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:56,757
You just need to say, are you in or out?

295
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:01,558
Getting that document is not difficult.

296
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:04,591
However, Wang Cunfeng, are you not tricking me?

297
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:08,057
If I take that document, I can go back to the sales department for real?

298
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:11,657
The manager has already told you. Why would I trick you?

299
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,190
But I need to remind you first.

300
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,924
If you can return to the sales department,

301
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,924
you are redeeming yourself by doing this.

302
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:20,458
If other colleagues have any attitudes towards you,

303
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,523
you need to handle it yourself. I won't take responsibility.

304
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:25,424
Those are all small matters.

305
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:29,057
Anything is better than staying in the planning department.

306
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:32,657
Then… it's a deal.

307
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:34,458
I'll wait for your news.

308
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,891
Back then, I should have pursued you more seriously.

309
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:47,824
You are beautiful, you're capable,

310
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,558
and you're willing to help when something happens.

311
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,625
You know, how could I let myself miss you?

312
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,959
Stop it. Stop trying to flatter me on purpose.

313
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,458
You didn't say that about me before.

314
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,224
That was before.

315
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:03,324
All right. I will leave now.

316
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:04,990
Wait for my news.

317
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,791
I'm beautiful.

318
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,923
I'm capable.

319
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:52,858
Remember to take the hangover solution and vitamins.

320
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:54,856
Take care of yourself.

321
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,824
This time, regarding this Xin Daqi case,

322
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:26,625
your sales department was indeed not proactive enough.

323
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,823
You can't blame the planning department for acting quickly. Right?

324
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,224
Yes. I will lead our department colleagues

325
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,257
to carefully review and reflect on that.

326
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:41,191
Wu.

327
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,392
President.

328
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:44,057
Thank you for your hard work this time.

329
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,124
You did well.

330
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:50,490
Originally, when you were stealing business from other departments,

331
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,557
I was planning to teach you a lesson.

332
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:56,523
But seeing that this time you managed to secure this new client, Xin Daqi,

333
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,190
it's quite an achievement.

334
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,924
I'll let your merits cancel out your offenses

335
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:02,090
and not hold it against you.

336
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,657
Thank you, Boss, for giving me a chance to redeem myself.

337
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:06,924
In the past,

338
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:09,891
I was too eager to show off in my work without thorough consideration.

339
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:13,625
Now, I've decided to learn a painful lesson and start over from scratch.

340
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,657
The only thing on my mind is how to make amends for the company

341
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,957
and repay you, President.

342
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:20,958
This time working with them,

343
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,357
make sure to seize the opportunity.

344
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:24,191
No problem, I will give my all.

345
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,224
I won't let you down.

346
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:31,224
Speaking of which. Manager Gao,

347
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:35,891
the sales performance of your department is indeed unsatisfactory.

348
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,690
Has something gone wrong?

349
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,091
You should probably be more diligent.

350
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,657
According to the data I have,

351
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:45,523
the buying interest is indeed slowing down.

352
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:48,057
But the main reason is due to the overall market conditions,

353
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:50,358
buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.

354
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,757
There is no such thing as a bad market.

355
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:53,523
Only poor performance.

356
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:55,725
Houses are built for people to live in.

357
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,991
We need to actively identify customer needs.

358
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,991
Make adjustments where necessary. Provide discounts if needed.

359
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:05,590
The key is to sell the houses.

360
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,958
The planning department has drafted many sales strategies for you.

361
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,323
But after giving them to you, you just left them unused.

362
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,690
- Well…
- No way.

363
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,324
It can't be your women's pettiness

364
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:23,090
letting personal feelings affect business. right?

365
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,323
Are you still holding grudges?

366
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,657
I personally feel that people at our level

367
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:31,291
should always let the company's best interests come first.

368
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,323
Right?

369
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:35,657
Just some of my own humble opinions.

370
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:41,557
I don't think Manager Gao is that kind of person.

371
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,891
Manager Gao,

372
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:47,757
the planning department is acting for your own good

373
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,224
and for the sake of the company.

374
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,324
We're all in the same boat.

375
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:54,657
When it's time to cooperate, we should cooperate well.

376
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,391
Yes, I understand.

377
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,157
Also, as for the position of vice president,

378
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,757
I should also hand it over.

379
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,990
I didn't initially let you take over, because I wanted to observe your performance more.

380
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:11,658
And now,

381
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,624
I think it should be by the end of this month.

382
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:19,725
By the end of this month, I will decide who will be the vice president

383
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:23,290
according to your performance.

384
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,457
No problem, Boss. We will definitely give it our all.

385
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,791
Manager Gao, we're out of water.

386
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,124
Could you please help us get some water?

387
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:45,423
You women are more attentive,

388
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:47,023
and are better at such things.

389
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:49,124
Thank you.

390
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,657
No problem.

391
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,857
President, I actually heard

392
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:07,824
about some of Xin Daqi's other plans, in Southeast Asia.

393
00:23:07,824 --> 00:23:11,457
Talking about "women's pettiness," he is the most vengeful. Okay?

394
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,023
Doesn't he know himself?

395
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:16,690
If I were there just now, he would have been either dead or seriously injured.

396
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,023
Are you that obedient? When he tells you to make tea, and you do it.

397
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,023
Did the boss tell you to make tea?

398
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,924
No, he didn't.

399
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,590
But Manager Wu still needs to discuss

400
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,224
matters about Xin Daqi Real Estate Development with the boss.

401
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:31,857
The boss wanted tea, and Sister Chen wasn't there.

402
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,824
I'm just helping out.

403
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:36,524
You'll get Wu Tianfu used to this.

404
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,391
That chauvinistic dude.

405
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:40,723
All right. Stop doing it.

406
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,657
Let me brew the boss's tea.

407
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:45,156
He's very particular about his tea. There is a fixed tea-to-water ratio.

408
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,057
Sister Chen taught me before.

409
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:48,691
Is that so?

410
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:54,323
As for Wu Tianfu, he needs another lesson from me, Teacher Wang.

411
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,224
What are you going to do?

412
00:23:57,224 --> 00:24:00,524
You're not going to throw hot tea on him, are you?

413
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:03,023
Do you think I would reprimand him so blatantly?

414
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:07,657
I just want him to experience what it means to reap what you sow.

415
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,990
All right, don't worry. I won't poison him.

416
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,324
The shirt you wanted is ready. It's in your office. Go change now.

417
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:17,791
So fast.

418
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:21,057
There are so many fast delivery platforms now. Just a tap of your finger and it arrives.

419
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,558
Also, thanks to you,

420
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,823
I got what I wanted, too.

421
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,458
Thanks then.

422
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,524
I'll go change my clothes first.

423
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:41,923
If we can secure this overseas project,

424
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:46,690
President, your long-desired plan for an overseas branch

425
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,124
is just around the corner.

426
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:52,258
I hope that this day doesn't come too late.

427
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,690
No way.

428
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,991
Our planning department will give it our all.

429
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:58,257
It might even be sooner.

430
00:24:58,257 --> 00:25:00,691
You are so confident.

431
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,024
President, it must be divine assistance.

432
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,590
Just now, I was inspired and came up with a great idea.

433
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,690
Tell me about it.

434
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,590
President, what if we invite Aisi to be

435
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,558
our Jingdu ambassador?

436
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:16,958
What do you think?

437
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,590
Jingdu ambassador?

438
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,791
Elaborate.

439
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:25,458
The planning department previously invited Aisi to help shoot a VR video.

440
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,558
The result was excellent.

441
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:28,690
She was impressive.

442
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,524
She speaks clearly and looks beautiful on camera.

443
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,558
No less than those big celebrities.

444
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,791
It will be a great bonus to our Jingdu's image.

445
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,924
You are absolutely right.

446
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:41,357
This investment in image assets

447
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:44,857
will have a significant impact on sales.

448
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:47,491
That's indeed a great suggestion.

449
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:53,490
Also, I heard that Aisi wanted to become a flight attendant before.

450
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,424
It indicates her foreign language proficiency is at a certain level.

451
00:25:56,424 --> 00:26:00,090
I want to include her in this Xin Daqi project

452
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,757
and let her take the opportunity to learn.

453
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:04,591
This will certainly be helpful for our company.

454
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:06,391
I see.

455
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:11,191
Okay. I will think carefully about it.

456
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,691
Please come in.

457
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,356
Sorry to keep you waiting.

458
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:21,924
Why are you bringing in the tea?

459
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:24,890
Manager Gao was busy, so I volunteered to make tea for her.

460
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,323
- You wouldn't mind, would you?
- How could I mind? I should be thanking you.

461
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:32,123
I followed Sister Chen's ratio and made a new brew.

462
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,590
How thoughtful of you.

463
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,091
I thought about making do with what we had.

464
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:41,990
- How could we let the President make do?
- Thank you.

465
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,356
Manager Wu, do you want some?

466
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:45,890
Thank you.

467
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:48,857
I specifically prepared sparkling water for you.

468
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,724
Because I heard sparkling water helps with rhinitis.

469
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,190
Impressive.

470
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,458
You've become so considerate since becoming the secretary.

471
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,591
Thank you.

472
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,757
I shouldn't have done my nails yesterday.

473
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,423
Look.

474
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:14,024
You women just love to look pretty, asking for trouble.

475
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:15,691
Here.

476
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:18,990
Leave these trivial matters to us.

477
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:28,824
How could you be so careless?

478
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:30,924
Look, you got the president's carpet wet.

479
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:32,256
President, look at him.

480
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:33,690
Okay, all right.

481
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,292
Cindy, take the documents that are on my desk to the accounting department.

482
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,224
President, remember to drink your tea.

483
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:44,590
Okay. Ask someone to clean up, too.

484
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,324
Okay. Be more careful next time.

485
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:57,857
I'm about to die laughing.

486
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:59,291
You are really talented.

487
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,724
And your acting skills were a hundred percent.

488
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:04,090
I can't open it.

489
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,690
Please. Men really don't get it.

490
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,891
After we women put on nails, we can even pick our noses. Okay?

491
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,391
Yes, I was betting that men wouldn't understand.

492
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,224
I was outside the president's office, jumping and shaking it.

493
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:17,491
It exhausted me.

494
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,623
I've had enough exercise for the week.

495
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:23,725
Yes, you worked hard, feminist warrior.

496
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:28,957
Do you think you should put that energy into something else?

497
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,625
What do you mean, what are you trying to say?

498
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,723
What I'm trying to say is, train Meng Heng well.

499
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:41,057
Tame him while he's young,

500
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,857
and easy to control.

501
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:45,857
What are you talking about? Do you think he will never grow up?

502
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,657
That's why you need to train him well now.

503
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:53,190
We need to brainwash him, indoctrinate him,

504
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,991
and make him submit to you.

505
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:58,091
And not just mentally, but also physically.

506
00:28:58,091 --> 00:28:59,959
It would be best if he could develop six-pack abs.

507
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,558
Crunch, crunch.

508
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,824
He already has six-pack abs.

509
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:07,124
How does it matter to me if he has abs?

510
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:09,757
Then you can make him wear an apron naked,

511
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:11,725
and wait for you at home.

512
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:16,291
After you finish eating, you can eat something else.

513
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,791
Chen Duomi.

514
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,525
Do you think you don't have any colleagues anymore?

515
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:23,459
- Sorry.
- It's okay, right?

516
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,691
Yes, it's fine.

517
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:29,190
What's the matter?

518
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,924
Looks like you need to buy me a cup of coffee.

519
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:33,624
What's wrong?

520
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:37,324
Look at what you left last night at my place.

521
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,891
That's where it was.

522
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,158
I've been looking for it for so long.

523
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:47,656
Zhou.

524
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:59,823
Do you want to go explain to him?

525
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:08,558
Secretary Zhou.

526
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,824
Where is the president?

527
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,357
Zhou.

528
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,790
Zhou, listen to me.

529
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,423
Xiaoyun.

530
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:31,324
We are both adults.

531
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:34,523
I can understand things.

532
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:36,657
You don't need to say anything to me.

533
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:39,624
Instead, I should thank you.

534
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:41,958
Thank you for your company during this time.

535
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,556
It's just that I didn't know how to seize the opportunity.

536
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:51,725
Zhou.

537
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:56,257
Indeed, you don't know how to seize it.

538
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:01,624
Vice President.

539
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,391
I hope you will treat Xiaoyun well in the future.

540
00:31:05,391 --> 00:31:08,423
Because she deserves happiness.

541
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,757
If I were you,

542
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,690
I would let the whole world know how much I love her.

543
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,324
I would let the whole world know

544
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:21,958
that I am such a lucky person

545
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,857
to have a girlfriend who's so cute,

546
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:28,490
so kind, and so smart.

547
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,256
What else?

548
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,990
That I will take care of her for a lifetime.

549
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,959
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

550
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:49,282
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

551
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,857
I have an extra pen here.

552
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:53,924
Do you need it?

553
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,657
Sure. Thank you.

554
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:59,324
For me?

555
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,591
You're giving me a gift?

556
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,057
Xiaoyun, you've been deceived by the vice president.

557
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:11,057
He bought two identical bracelets from the beginning.

558
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:13,457
Why would he choose to deceive you?

559
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,325
Zhou, don't stay in the rain with me. You should go back quickly.

560
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:22,424
- This is my punishment.
- I'll stay with you.

561
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:27,224
I will stay by your side through all of this.

562
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:31,023
As long as you are willing to try, sometimes things that seem the same

563
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:33,924
can actually be different.

564
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,023
Be careful.

565
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:43,023
The item is so high, you should have asked me to get it.

566
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:45,124
Why did you try to get it yourself?

567
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:48,257
What should I call you in the future?

568
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:52,632
♫ Soothing all the unease ♫

569
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:57,024
♫ No need to guess anymore ♫

570
00:32:57,024 --> 00:33:01,783
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

571
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:07,106
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

572
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,225
How did you get so drunk?

573
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,257
We're almost there.

574
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,158
Be careful.

575
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:19,691
Xin… Xinzheng, you…

576
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:21,256
Don't do that.

577
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:22,891
What?

578
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:27,430
Don't make me think that you are really a bad person.

579
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,057
♫ You make up and fill the gaps for me ♫

580
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,057
It's Zhou, right?

581
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:39,457
I'm going back now.

582
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:42,023
At least tell me what I lost to him.

583
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:49,590
Zhou showed me that as long as I am willing,

584
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,324
there are more deserving people waiting for me.

585
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:57,469
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

586
00:33:57,469 --> 00:34:00,555
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

587
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,750
♫ Because of you ♫

588
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,965
♫ I'm no longer afraid of loneliness and solitude ♫

589
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,059
I'm driving. It's dangerous.

590
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,291
This is big news.

591
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,391
Manager Gao and Zhou were kissing downstairs at the company.

592
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:19,657
They even officially announced it.

593
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,458
Really?

594
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,023
Didn't he say there was no hope? Why so sudden?

595
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,591
It's big news because it's sudden.

596
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,125
Okay.

597
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,291
Why did you suddenly speed up?

598
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,823
I need to go back to the company and ask him immediately what exactly is going on

599
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:40,390
and why he didn't tell me.

600
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,023
Are you focusing on the wrong point?

601
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:43,424
Didn't you bet with him?

602
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,591
You've already lost, and you still care about others.

603
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:47,090
You are really a fool.

604
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,291
I can't control winning or losing.

605
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,223
Who says you can't?

606
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,557
Listen to me now.

607
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,323
Press the advantage.

608
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:56,091
Press the advantage?

609
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:06,224
You're here.

610
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,324
Your package just arrived at the company.

611
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,291
I brought it along.

612
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,257
Thank you.

613
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:16,357
I've completed all the resignation procedures.

614
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:20,023
But I haven't apologized to you in person.

615
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:23,524
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:27,557
My bad reputation has made things difficult for you.

617
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:29,690
It's okay.

618
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,991
They are just exploiting the issue.

619
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,591
After all,

620
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,125
they want us to lower the design fees and service fees.

621
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:40,925
To be honest, I should be the one apologizing to you.

622
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:44,758
In the end, I had to cut ties and let you resign.

623
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:51,424
When everyone else didn't dare to accept me, you were willing to employ me.

624
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,657
I was already very grateful for that.

625
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:55,724
It's the same this time.

626
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,890
You even thought of a backup plan for me.

627
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,023
I won't let down your kindness.

628
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:03,991
At the Thailand branch of Xin Daqi, I will work hard.

629
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:07,791
But don't work too hard.

630
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,857
When you need to rest, you need to rest.

631
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:12,690
There are many sports fields in Thailand.

632
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,990
Go check them out for me and tell me which fields are good for playing.

633
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:17,991
No problem.

634
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:25,225
Turn on the power.

635
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,824
Great job!

636
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:38,124
Applaud for you!

637
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,257
Cindy Wang?

638
00:36:46,357 --> 00:36:49,991
The way you convey affection is quite special.

639
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,925
I still need to go back and pack my luggage.

640
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,690
I won't disturb you anymore.

641
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,857
I wish you all the best.

642
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:00,257
Thank you.

643
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,157
Great job!

644
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:11,556
Applaud for you!

645
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:27,191
You… You're not planning to move in, are you?

646
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,457
No.

647
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,391
It's not what you think.

648
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:37,923
What's inside here are all my savings, stocks, insurance policies,

649
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,758
and my investments and finances

650
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,023
from when I started working until now.

651
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:46,890
This... This is a gold bar given to me by an elder in my family.

652
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,890
- And my mom also wanted to give…
- Okay.

653
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,190
These are not important.

654
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:57,223
If you ask me, all I want is you.

655
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,824
Don't worry, I'm here.

656
00:38:00,824 --> 00:38:02,757
I am always here.

657
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,157
Well, don't you have any questions to ask me?

658
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,357
What?

659
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:15,757
For example, why was my earring with Vice President Han?

660
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:24,123
I think those are not important to me.

661
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:28,424
The most important thing now is that I am with you.

662
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:35,223
And I want to take you to eat all the red bean cakes in the world.

663
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,423
Then I will be very fat, like a pig.

664
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:40,591
No way.

665
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:43,891
No matter what, you'd only have two legs.

666
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,890
You…

667
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,958
- Mr. Zhou.
- Sorry.

668
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,424
Looks like I need to teach you how to tell a joke.

669
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:51,390
No, what I meant by two legs…

670
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,016
- No, two… You have two legs.
- Okay, stop explaining.

671
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,825
- I have four legs, I am a pig.
- Right.

672
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:58,591
I am a pig with four legs

673
00:38:58,591 --> 00:38:59,991
who loves eating red bean cakes.

674
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,791
Okay?

675
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:05,056
Hey, Mi.

676
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:08,758
How was your shopping with that Sister Lily?

677
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:11,291
I'm telling you, pay the bill if you should.

678
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,724
Don't be polite.

679
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:16,390
This is all an investment.

680
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,357
Anyway, it will be billed to the company.

681
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:21,258
I'll sign for everything. Okay?

682
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,591
All right.

683
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,658
That's no problem. Let's meet at the restaurant directly.

684
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:32,358
This is all an investment.

685
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,558
If I knew you were acquainted with the wife of Xin Daqi's owner,

686
00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:41,724
I'd even marry you to get this case.

687
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:26,157
Do you know a company that writes programs?

688
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,490
Can you introduce them to me?

689
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,223
[Fang Aisi]

690
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:37,057
Lin, I have another call. I'll call you back later. Okay?

691
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:39,358
Okay, bye.

692
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,923
Hello?

693
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:45,758
Downstairs?

694
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:47,923
You-You are downstairs at my house?

695
00:40:50,557 --> 00:40:53,124
Okay, wait a moment.

696
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:57,592
Hello?

697
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:00,457
Cindy, can you come downstairs now?

698
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,890
I am downstairs now.

699
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,590
What's going on now?

700
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,623
Why are my hands shaking like this?

701
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:16,925
Don't shake. Don't shake.

702
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,757
- Cindy.
- Cindy.

703
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:23,291
I arrived first, so I will speak first.

704
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,591
We probably arrived at the same time.

705
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:27,291
Is that so?

706
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,125
My foot is ahead of yours.

707
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:34,091
But my car is ahead of yours.

708
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:38,458
Have you heard of the story of the tortoise and the hare?

709
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,656
- The tortoise, though slow…
- Wait, you two hold on a second.

710
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,657
No matter what you two want to say now,

711
00:41:46,657 --> 00:41:48,091
who can give me a ride back to the company immediately?

712
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,291
- Me.
- Me.

713
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:52,758
I know the fastest route to the company.

714
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:55,458
As an Uber driver, breaking the rules won't be convenient. Right?

715
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:58,291
The most important thing is that she can get to the company.

716
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:01,258
I'm in a rush.

717
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,657
President, no problem.

718
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:06,257
I was already working at the company anyway.

719
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,557
No problem.

720
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:10,291
Really, yes, I will definitely get it done tonight.

721
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,191
Tomorrow morning when you arrive at the company, it will be on your desk.

722
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:15,224
President, goodbye.

723
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,223
Manager Wu.

724
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:21,157
Manager Wu, I'm here.

725
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:22,158
What are you doing?

726
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:24,490
My heart belongs to someone else.

727
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,557
No.

728
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:29,390
Manager Wu, you misunderstood me.

729
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,757
After I got home, I kept thinking,

730
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:34,824
how could I let you get sprayed with sparkling water?

731
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:36,690
I was really too careless.

732
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,925
The more I thought about it, the more wrong it seemed.

733
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:40,925
As I kept thinking about it,

734
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,624
I came to the company.

735
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:45,056
I didn't expect to see your office light still on.

736
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:48,324
I thought I must come up and apologize to you.

737
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:52,491
Good to see you reflecting on it.

738
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:55,125
Manager Wu, you haven't eaten yet, right? Let me treat you to a meal.

739
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,824
I'll choose a high-end restaurant

740
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,023
and treat you to a meal as a form of apology.

741
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:02,825
I have to work on the project proposal. I don't have time to eat.

742
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:05,324
How can you have the energy to work without eating?

743
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:06,925
I'm telling you, let's go eat first.

744
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:08,991
After we eat, I'll help you think of the project proposal.

745
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:11,457
Don't you know my project planning ability?

746
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:14,691
I am famous for being efficient.

747
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,824
Don't you think so? Let me tell you. We'll bring the computer along.

748
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:19,757
Maybe while eating, we'll figure out the proposal.

749
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:21,590
How efficient this is!

750
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:23,624
It's your treat.

751
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,724
A high-end restaurant.

752
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:27,157
We are just having a meal.

753
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:28,757
No!

754
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:31,690
We also need to think about the proposal.

755
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,757
- Yes, just think about the proposal. And eat.
- Yes.

756
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,824
Manager Wu, I'll help you close the door.

757
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,958
All right, just close it.

758
00:44:01,322 --> 00:44:05,957

[Next Episode]
Sometimes I even feel that you treat me like an outsider.

760
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:10,223
You should take advantage of the situation!

761
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:13,890
- If you have any skills, come on.
- Because I won't be polite either.

762
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,958
[Immunity]
Since the competition has surfaced,

763
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:18,357
I will act politely first and then forcefully.

764
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:19,690
I like you.

765
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,557
So, is the information complete?

766
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:23,091
The mission starts immediately.

767
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:25,324
Remember, it must be carried out secretly.

768
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:29,724
Maybe they are secretly working on a big plan to counter us.

769
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:32,758
- What are you doing?
- Do you want Cindy to know?

770
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:35,157
Let me explain, will you? I am doing this because

771
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:37,980
Zhang Shiping asked the president not to promote you to vice president.
