I'll pay in cash then.

Does it mean pulling
an all-nighter to work overtime?

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,706
You could say that.

40
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,339

57
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,674

- Yes.

- Morning, Yazi.
- Morning.

00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:31,240
I've already bought a gift for Zhou.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,374
Would you like to see it?

66
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,173
What did you do yesterday?

67
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,941
You look so tired.

68
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,040
Let me tell you.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,706
Last night I completed

70
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:44,540
a big plan that can change the entire office.

71
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,639
It's called the Luck-Changing Plan.

72
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,840
- What is that for?
- Check your emails and you'll find out.

73
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,473
What do you mean by that?

74
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:52,740
You want us to fill out the activity form
when we go out.

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,173
And also fill out
the project progress report for you.

76
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,674
Yazi, what's the matter?

77
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:57,941
Yingjun, go check your emails.

78
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,773
Cindy is going too far,
she's just a secretary after all.

79
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,339
On what basis is she managing us like this?

80
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,773
These forms are to save everyone's time.

81
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:09,674
Put the progress of the work
you're doing right now

82
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:10,807
onto Cloud.

83
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,406
It can facilitate more effective horizontal
and vertical communication.

84
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:16,139
This way, no time will be wasted.

85
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,741
So, from now on, all reimbursement processes
must go through you,

86
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,974
and then arrange to meet with the manager.

87
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:23,874
You need to book at least
half an hour in advance.

88
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:25,906
Will this…?

89
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:26,940

90
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,841
You think it's fun, don't you?

91
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,007
Not at all.

92
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,573
In my opinion, I think

93
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:32,639
it's good.

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,207
And I believe Cindy

95
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,406
has her reasons for doing this.

96
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:37,139
Meng Heng, you've just arrived not long ago.

97
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,172
You don't know Cindy that well,
that's why you think like this.

98
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,272
No, Yazi, I…

99
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,007
- Good morning, everyone.
- Miss Gao.

100
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,374
- Look at this.
- Good morning, Miss Gao.

101
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,673
Some can't become managers,

102
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,841
and then they resort to underhanded tactics

103
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:49,673
to satisfy their own desire for control.

104
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:51,906
What's the reason?

105
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,673
These are just to hope everyone
can more effectively

106
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:55,974
communicate horizontally and vertically.

107
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:57,406
That would make work more efficient.

108
00:04:57,406 --> 00:04:59,139
We're already busy enough with our normal work.

109
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,573
And now we have to fill out
this lousy form of yours?

110
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:02,306
[Secretarial Transfer]
This is what's called wasting time.

111
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,607
And also that activity form.

112
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:06,874
Where we go is none of your business.

113
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,374
Right, it's none of my business.

114
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:11,874
But if the manager asks me,

115
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:12,974
'Where has Xiaoting gone?'

116
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,039
'Where's Yazi?'

117
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,841
Then she can immediately
check the activity form

118
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:17,974
to know what errands everyone has run,

119
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:20,374
[Quick Registration]
or where they have gone like that.

120
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,207
And if the reimbursement requests
go through me,

121
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,940
I can not only help you check them,

122
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,107
I can also help you with collections.

123
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,272
You can focus more on the work at hand.

124
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:30,741
Just treat me as a transit center.

125
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:38,539
- This idea is not bad
- Miss Gao.

126
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,139
- Everyone just go along with it.
- Miss…

127
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,539
Miss Gao, Zhou's gift has been bought.
Do you want to check it out?

128
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,940
Okay, give it to me.

129
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,039
We just printed five copies.

130
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,639
Later, just follow that order, and…

131
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
- Staple them together.
- Right, staple it well.

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,374
Five copies.

133
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,507
Then staple them neatly and nicely.

134
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:11,707
Don't mess up the pagination.

135
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:14,240

complete the reimbursement request today.

It's due tomorrow,
so, help me with the urgent case.

139
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,440
If they're all urgent cases,

140
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,573
then why not sort out these documents first?

141
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:25,539
Didn't you say that it all
has to go through you first?

142
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,974
Right, you told us to focus more

143
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,240
on the work in our own hands.

144
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,741
How can we waste time

145
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,806
on small matter of sorting documents?

146
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,741
Anyway, thanks, Cindy.

147
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,607
Thanks.

148
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:37,707
All done, let's have a cup of coffee.

149
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:40,139
Okay, have coffee, sounds good.

150
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:48,073
They are obviously bullying you.

151
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,474
Do you want to talk to the manager?

152
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:50,841
No need, it's nothing.

153
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,841
I can handle it.

154
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:52,974
Let's go.

155
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:55,272
Really?

156
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,539
Zhou.

157
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,474
Miss Gao.

158
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:05,007
Thank you for that day.

159
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,496
For me?

160
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,440
You're too kind.

161
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,406
I was happy to help that day.

162
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,306
Actually, I was also very happy.

163
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:18,440
It's what should be done.

164
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,507
By the way,

165
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,539
this is for Vice President Han.

166
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,773
Also, thank him for passing the message.

167
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:26,607
He usually has more social engagements.

168
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,139
So, I thought of buying some chicken essence

169
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,240
to help him nourish his body.

170
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,673
If he's too busy with work to drink it,

171
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:35,440
then you remind him.

172
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,707
You're really attentive.

173
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:39,874
Miss Gao, rest assured.

174
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:42,741
I'll definitely remind the Vice President
to drink on time every day.

175
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:46,306
Alright, I won't disturb your work.

176
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:48,306
Bye.

177
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,240
Thank you for your gift.

178
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,639
No problem.

179
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:04,007
She gave me a gift!

180
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:23,773
Chen.

181
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:26,374
Sorry, I spoke without thinking before.

182
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:27,973
I hope you don't mind.

183
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:31,173
- It's okay, it's all in the past.
- Okay.

184
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:33,973
Do you have a document for Mr. Cai to sign?

185
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,540
Mr. Cai is with the construction company today,

186
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,272
meeting with partners from the Ai Foundation.

187
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:40,774
He won't be coming into the office.

188
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:42,606
You can set this aside for now.

189
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,574
I'll take it to him for signing tomorrow.

190
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,707
Then…

191
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:50,540
Once it's signed, 'll notify you to collect it.

192
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,374
Thanks so much.

193
00:08:57,606 --> 00:09:00,907
How is it, are you getting used
to being a secretary?

194
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,507
It's okay, I guess.

195
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:04,840
Actually, Mr. Cai knows

196
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,106
your abilities extend beyond
just being a secretary.

197
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:10,907
He has also instructed the Vice President
to thoroughly investigate your case.

198
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,606
Sooner or later, your innocence will be proven.

199
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:13,840
Really?

200
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,973
That's wonderful.

201
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,340
Otherwise, I would really feel wronged.

202
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:20,806
Then,

203
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:21,973
thanks again.

204
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,239
I'll go ahead and leave.

205
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,540
Thanks.

206
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:47,139
Sorry, and thank you.

207
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,574
Zhou.

208
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:50,374
Miss Gao.

209
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,840
We'll take the next one then.

210
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,639
You're dressed differently from usual today.

211
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,272
Quite stylish.

212
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:02,806
Is that so? Thank you.

213
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,973
Actually, I took leave today.

214
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:08,907
Because the Vice President
happened to have a personal appointment.

215
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:09,941
Just didn't expect

216
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:11,774
that Chen would call me
all of a sudden this morning,

217
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,239
saying that the Vice President
needed a document signed,

218
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,673
which Mr. Cai had already passed,

219
00:10:14,673 --> 00:10:16,072
and that document was particularly urgent.

220
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:17,106
So,

221
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:19,072
I hurried back to handle it.

222
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:21,673
You've worked hard,
coming to the office on your day off.

223
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:22,707
Not at all.

224
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,707
It's what I should do.

225
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:26,907
That's right.

226
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:28,439
I'll run into the Vice President later.

227
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:31,907
I can bring him the chicken essence.

228
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:34,407
I'll make a point to tell him

229
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:37,941
that this is a special gesture from you.

230
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,741
Thank you.

231
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,907
Then I…

232
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,106
You go ahead.

233
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:44,507
Take care, you two.

234
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,606
Off I go, bye.

235
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,374
- Bye.
- Bye.

236
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:10,507
I wonder why Chen hasn't called yet.

237
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:13,306
Mr. Cai clearly came in to sign the documents.

238
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,340
Mine should have been signed as well.

239
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:20,774
I haven't picked up the gift
for the gathering yet.

240
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,473
I'll go pick it up in a bit
and head to the club myself.

241
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay, bye.

[Business Department Cindy Wang]

243
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:38,173
If it's urgent, they'll come get it themselves.

244
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,473
Hello, we're from the construction company.

245
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:55,774
We have an appointment with Director Zhang.

246
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:56,840
Okay, please wait a moment.

247
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,072
Thank you.

248
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,173
You've worked hard,

249
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,874
having you make the trip.

250
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:04,139
No problem.

251
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,106
I'm rather cautious in my work.

252
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,840
So, I hope to keep reviewing the process

253
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,007
before the press conference,

254
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,741
and identify all possible issues.

255
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:15,239
You don't find me
too difficult to deal with, do you?

256
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,540
Of course not.

257
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,072
Director Zhang, you're too kind.

258
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,272
Even if you didn't seek us out,

259
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,741
we would still come to report to you.

260
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,340
Then let's go inside.

261
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,774
- This way
- Thank you.

262
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:30,673
May I ask if you received my email previously?

263

Regarding the Livable Taoyuan.

264
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:33,973
We'll discuss the media outline for
the Sustainable Home press conference

265
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:36,272
with you shortly as well.

266
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,340
Okay.

267
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,072
Excuse me.

268
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:46,207
May I use the restroom first?

269
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,540
Of course, you know where it is.

270
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,639
Excuse me for a moment.

272
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:07,707
Thank you for your assistance that day.

273
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:08,774
Otherwise, I'll be really embarrassed.

274
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:11,072
No worries, it's a minor issue.

275
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:13,507
Oh right,
I forgot to transfer the money to you.

276
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:15,540
No rush.

277
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,473
Sorry, please wait for a moment.

278
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:23,473
I'll go and take care of some things first.

279
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:25,806
So, this is

280
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,507
the written report for today.

281
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,639

282

- No problem, you go ahead
- Okay, thank you.

Hello?

Meng Heng.

285
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,072
I'm almost there.
It's hard to find a parking spot here.

286
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:41,673
Just wait a bit.

287
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:44,096
You go buy that thing.

288
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,139
The bread.

289
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,007
What kind of bread?

290
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:49,941
You know, the kind of bread that's for ladies.

291
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:53,106
It can't be that you're
suddenly hungry now, right?

292
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,507
Do you want sweet or savory?

293
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:57,007
Alright, forget it.

294
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,639
You go find the nearby

295
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,407
convenience store or pharmacy,

296
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,673
and then check for my message.

297
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:04,040
Hurry up, bye.

298
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,606

Let's go with this one.

304
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,574

310
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:02,139
and then they ran out to vomit.

311
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,139
Really?

312
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,272
Miss Gao.

313
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,340
You've almost finished chatting, right?

314
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,407
- Almost covered everything, we were just
- Here.

315
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:20,374
talking about what kind
of lactobacillus drink do you use

316
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:22,106

317
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:23,139
Cindy also said

318
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,540
that you taught her this trick.

319
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,239
On the way here,

320
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,473
our manager thought

321
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:29,707
that her suit

322
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,540
doesn't suit today's briefing content

324
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,306
It's originally targeted at the youth.

325
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:36,173
She hopes to be younger and more energetic.

326
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,439
So, Meng Heng was asked
to purchase a special outfit.

327
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,072
Don't you think

328
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,007
that it's more suitable for today's content?

329
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:49,707
- Let's start.
- Okay.

330
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:52,040
Come, let's begin.

331
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:59,272
This time at our Taoyuan Sustainable Living
residence press conference's

332
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:00,874

333
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:03,072
is primarily about…

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,707
- Miss, hello.
- Hello.

335
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:09,173
I've come to pick up the goods for Mr. Han.

336
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,973
- This.
- Okay.

337
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,340
Alright, please wait a moment.

338
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,407
Thank you for your assistance.

339
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,239
Please confirm for a moment.

340
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,340
Are these both the same?

341
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,941
Yes.

342
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,340
So, both are the same product.

343
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,106
- Yes.
- Okay.

344
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:32,574
Thank you.

345
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,639
Hello, Vice President.

346
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,540
Yes, I've just got it, and I'm on my way now.

347
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,741
Wait for me for a second.

348
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,973
Vice President.

349
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,072
Zhou, thank you.

350
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:43,007
You came all the way here
to deliver it during your day off.

351
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,774
It's my duty.

352
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:45,973
However, Vice President,

353
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:48,507
the unit price of this gift is a bit high.

354
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,806
I'm afraid that later on,

355
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,973
it may not be easy to request
reimbursement from the company.

356
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:54,106
No problem, there's no need
to claim this from the company.

357
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:56,306
I'll pay for it myself.

358
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,507
Sometimes, for important clients,

359
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,773
one must give a little extra.

360
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,706
Understood.

361
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:04,606
Please put this in my office.

362
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,673
No problem.

363
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,507
- You should go back and rest now.
- Vice President, take care.

364
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:10,140
- Bye.
- Bye.

365
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:20,773
What about the essence
of chicken and the contract?

366
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,173
- Sorry…
- What a coincidence.

367
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,873
Director Zhang.

368
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,640
What a coincidence.

369
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,706
You wouldn't happen to be

370
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:47,706
the owner or a shareholder
of this supermarket, are you?

371
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,907
What do you think?

372
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:54,307
If so, you're quite diversely developed.

373
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,106
Which one is more profitable?

374
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
Looking at today's procurement list,

375
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,407
you're feeling pretty good?

376
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,240
Not bad at all.

377
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:11,340
There's something I'm really curious

378
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
about this morning's briefing.

379
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,807
You could have reported directly.

380
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:20,741
Why deliberately delay to wait for Miss Gao?

381
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,507
I could indeed do so.

382
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,140
But if I were to do that,

383
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,574
then Miss Gao would no longer
trust me in the future.

384
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,140
Although on the surface,

385
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I have a superior
and subordinate relationship with her.

386
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,606
But privately,

387
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:37,240
we still have a competitive relationship.

388
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,741
It is indeed quite delicate.

389
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,340
So, if I really were to report by myself,

390
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,173
then she would certainly feel uncomfortable.

391
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:49,407
Then my days ahead would be difficult.

392
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,606
You're very smart.

393
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,340
Clearly picking up a gun,

394
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,974
yet knowing when to attack,

395
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,507
and when to defend.

396
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,007
Able to calmly analyze the situation.

397
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:09,106
I've even considered poaching you
for our company.

398
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:16,741
Then I'll take it as you
testing my loyalty to the company.

399
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,474
Alright.

400
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,673
Since poaching didn't work,

401
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:24,907
then,

402
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,073
I wish you an early return

403
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:29,140
to the position
that originally belonged to you.

404
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,907
If such a day comes,

405
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,640
I'll definitely invite you
to celebrate together.

406
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,206
I'll settle it.

407
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,539
Then,

408
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,606
thanks.

409
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,373
Happy one-year anniversary.

410
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:02,340
Thank you for not getting tired of me.

411
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,873
What's wrong?

412
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,640
Is it that you disdain me
but don't dare to say so?

413
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,073
Or…

414
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:15,974
You don't like the gift I gave you?

415
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:20,640
I've never doubted your taste.

416
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,307
What are you thinking then?

417
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,940
Would you like to share with me?

418
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,073
I'm thinking

419
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,907
whether it's good or bad

420
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:35,340
liking one's enemy.

421
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,173
Anyone who likes someone other than me

422
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,807
is no good.

423
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,706
I must be your only one.

424
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,741
I'm going to the restroom.

425
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:50,206
Please ask the waiter
to get me a new cup of hot tea.

426
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:52,439
Okay.

427
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,673
Excuse me.

428
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:11,140
Mr. Han's seat…

429
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,640
I see it, thank you. Vice President.

430
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,673
- Excuse me.
- Zhou

431
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:21,272
Why are you here again?

432
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:23,474
I was in such a rush earlier
that I forgot to give this to you.

433
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,840
Inside is Mr. Xi's contract.

434
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,974
There's also the chicken essence
that Miss Gao wanted to give you.

435
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:29,807
Actually, you could have taken it
to the company tomorrow.

436
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,539
I thought these items were more urgent.

437
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:34,507
I still thought it'd be better
to give them to you quickly.

438
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:37,007
Alright, I've received it.

439
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,140
Thank you.

440
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:43,373
Vice President, drink less.

441
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:45,007
If there's any situation,

442
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:47,574
then call me anytime and I'll come right over.

443
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:50,240
Don't worry, I won't get drunk today.

444
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,106
You should get back quickly.

445
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:00,840
Zhou.

446
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,606
Yes.

447
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:04,539
That, you…

448
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,007
How did you come here just now?

449
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,106
I came by subway.

450
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:10,673
It's quite close.

451
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:12,936
Then…

452
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:15,272
Take a taxi back later.

453
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:16,840
You've run around so much on your day off.

454
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,073
No need, Vice President,
the subway is very convenient for me.

455
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:21,173
It's fine, take it.

456
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,741
Then, thank you, Vice President.

457
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,039
I'll keep it for future public expenses.

458
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,974
Zhou.

459
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,606
Vice President.

460
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,807
Is something wrong?

461
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:48,807
It's nothing.

462
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:03,140
I thought I saw someone I knew just now.

463
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,340
It's probably because I'm getting older.

464
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,873
My eyes tricked me.

465
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,340
Vice President, you really like to joke.

466
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,140
Excuse me.

467
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,340
Could you do me a favor?

468
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,373
Vice President, I'm leaving now.

469
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:29,007
Don't forget to take your things
when you leave later.

470
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,840
Alright, no problem, get back quickly.

471
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,240
Okay, Vice President, good night.

472
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,539
Zhou.

473
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,106
Miss Gao.

474
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,606
The exquisite gift purchased
by the Vice President

475
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:47,272
isn't it meant to be given to a client?

476
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:51,272
Could it be that the Vice President
is pursuing Yun?

477
00:23:58,173 --> 00:24:00,106
You're also here?

478
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,173
What a coincidence!

479
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,307
You're dining here.

480
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:06,106
No, I just happened
to be getting something for Miss Gao.

481
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:09,073
I'm bringing over the chicken essence for him.

482
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,173
That's very thoughtful.

483
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,940
Not at all.

484
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,574
Excuse me, Mr. Han.

485
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:15,741
Your girlfriend said
she couldn't get through to your phone.

486
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:17,407
She called the front desk
and asked us to convey that

487
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:20,240
she suddenly had something come up
and couldn't make it.

488
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,673
Okay, thank you.

489
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,340
I've been with the company for so long,

490
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,741
and still didn't know that you

491
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:33,773
already had a girlfriend.

492
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,773
You've kept it a secret very well.

493
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,606
Zhou.

494
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,940
You've known for a long time, haven't you?

495
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,706
No, I've only just found out now.

496
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:55,240
I originally thought
eating alone would be lonely,

497
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,039
but since you're also alone,

498
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,140
then would it be convenient to dine together?

499
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:06,039
My treat, as a way to thank you
for making the introduction

500
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,340
on Mr. Xi's case.

501
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,606
Sure.

502
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,873
Sorry to make you spend.

503
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:16,206
Then, please enjoy your meal.

504
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,539
Zhou.

505
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,206
If you're free,

506
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,840
then let's have dinner together.

507
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:26,007
I owe you thanks for Mr. Xi's matter as well.

508
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,140
Vice President.

509
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,539
Welcome, let's all dine together.

510
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,173
- Well then, thank you, Miss Gao.
- Not at all.

511
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:36,474
Please, sit.

512
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:38,840
Yes, Vice President.

513
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,940
Zhou, you see?

514
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,640
Honey.

515
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:21,873
Are you still angry?

516
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:26,574
I'm not angry.

517
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,073
I'm just

518
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:32,106
calming my startled emotions.

519
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:38,439
Why did you invite Zhou
to stay for dinner earlier?

520
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:42,439
Asking him to leave
would have been more suspicious, wouldn't it?

521
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:44,173
Right, you're correct.

522
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:49,106
But why discuss this kind
of topic at the dinner table?

523
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,039
Vice President Han.

524
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,272
Where is your girlfriend employed?

525
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:57,206
- She…
- Yes, Vice President.

526
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,741
I've been with you for so long
and didn't know you had a girlfriend.

527
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:02,106
I'm curious too.

528
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,106
She's works at…

529
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,373
Is she beautiful?

530
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:10,539
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,106
Did I ask something too personal?

532
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:16,539
She's very beautiful.

533
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,240
She's graceful and elegant.

534
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,974
She's also very capable at work.

535
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:23,773
She's a perfect woman.

536
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:27,439
Are you sure it's not just a love filter?

537
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,741
Vice President Gao…

538
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:30,039
Miss Gao, sorry.

539
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,206
I can guarantee that

540
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:32,974
the Vice President has great taste.

541
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:36,673
If he says she's perfect,
then I believe she must be.

542
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:39,307
Otherwise, how would I know

543
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,073
that how perfect I am in your eyes?

544
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,439
So perfect.

545
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,039
You…

546
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,373
If you do this again, then I won't let you off.

547
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,407
I won't let you off.

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,574
- I wouldn't dare again.
- Are you sure?

00:27:50,574 --> 00:27:51,640
Sure, I wouldn't dare, sure.

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,507
Hold on, the phone.

552
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:54,840
- Stop messing around.
- What about the phone?

553
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
The phone is ringing.

What's wrong?

556
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,840
My brother said that on my dad's birthday,

557
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,741
and he's asked me to come for dinner.

558
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,007
I'm going to take a shower first.

559
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,539

562
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,173
and see if there's any courier or mail
for your department.

563
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:42,240
I appreciate it.

- No, I'm not.

569

I saw it all.

570
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,240
You were giving her a gift.

571
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,773
That wasn't from me.

572
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:04,773
Is that so?

573
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,373

574
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:08,373

Then I'll let you know after I receive it.

They just…

600
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:33,507
So, they're bullying you

00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:40,574
It can't be just right.

00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:41,673

657
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,706
Then I'll prepare ten more.

658
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:50,807
Even though I have already confirmed it,

659
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:52,073
but since you are the handler,

660
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:54,706
you need to confirm it again.

00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,000

00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:18,773

670
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:19,807
Okay, I'll go first.

675
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,407

677
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,706
I clock out on time.

678
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:40,206
I have never left work
at the normal time, okay?

679
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,439
I have to visit construction projects
to see the designs during the day.

680
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,272
And at night, I need to work on
unboxing articles for the planning department.

681
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,873
We're also working overtime on the project.

682
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:50,773
The spirit is with you.

683
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:52,940
It would be great if I had a backer.

684
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,039
Or like Fang Iris.

685
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,240
Just by answering the phone,

686
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,307
and someone would send me a designer bag.

687
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:01,373
How good that would be.

688
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:06,007
What about Fang Iris?

689
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,373
Come here.

690
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,706
Come here.

691
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:15,706
I think Fang Iris

692
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:18,774
is a mistress supported by someone.

693
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:21,373
Why do you say that?

694
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:24,206
Doesn't she often carry designer bags?

695
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:25,873
I just asked her who gave it to her.

696
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:27,840
Most people would say

697
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,873
it's from a boyfriend.

698
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,373
But she didn't say that.

699
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,974
She's very secretive.

700
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:35,440
There's a problem.

701
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,340
Deliberately not telling.

702
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:41,107
Wait for me.

703
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:42,206
Which bag is she carrying?

704
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,340
An orange one.

705
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,673
Designer bag.

706
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:46,807
We'll talk about it later.

707
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,072
I want to hear it too.

708
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:49,774
Okay, how old?

709
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:51,807
Hey, 'Fat Bro', what's up?

710
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:53,673
The case of Sustainable Residence in Taoyuan.

711
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:55,673
Yes, it's still in progress.

712
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,573
Why do you ask that?

713
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,840
You're still waiting for the approval
to pay the event company.

714
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,406
But I submitted the approval form
a long time ago…

715
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,840
Need to do it.

716
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,072
'Fat Bro', you hold off
the event company for me first.

717
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,706
I'll expedite the approval form
as quickly as possible

718
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,807
to get the money released.

719
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,507
I've already submitted the approval form.

720
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:16,507
Why does the guy
from the planning department still say

721
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:17,607
that he hasn't received it?

722
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,340
It must be that Cindy
didn't send out the approval form.

723
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,373
I said it before,

724
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:23,640
things will definitely go wrong
if they're left to her.

725
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,941
But what's the point of Cindy holding
onto my approval form and not sending it?

726
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:27,140
That's exactly what it means.

727
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,440
She must see that Yun
is having it easy now,

728
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,107
and wants to make trouble behind her back

729
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,706
to bring her down.

730
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,906
Manager, she's just deliberately
delaying the payment,

731
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:39,072
and want to hinder the progress of this case

732
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:40,239
Come on.

733
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,406
How long have we been busy with
the Sustainable Residence project in Taoyuan?

734
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,640
Why should I delay the payment request?

735
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,740
What benefit would that have for me?

736
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,673
Bringing down the manager
would be your greatest benefit.

737
00:35:47,673 --> 00:35:50,406
Stop judging an upright person
by your own mean measure.

738
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:52,140
Fine, then you explain it.

739
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,039
Chen said the boss
had already signed the document.

740
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,807
It was you who neglected it
and left it lying there.

741
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:00,107
That's because Chen…

742
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:04,107
Forget it.

743
00:36:04,107 --> 00:36:05,774
Yazi is right.

744
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:07,107
Your so-called transport plan

745
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:08,673
is just a pretty excuse.

746
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,774
In reality, you just want to play some tricks

747
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,039
to seize power.

748
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,673
Manager, this time it's about
the payment request.

749
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,807
Who knows what mistakes she'll make next time.

750
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,072
On what grounds do you
say that about me, Guo Shijie?

751
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:21,239
The facts are right before our eyes.

752
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,573
Miss Gao, I think we should first

753
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,941
put the transport plan on hold.

754
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,307
There's no need.

755
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:28,774
The plan is good.

756
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:29,840
And I trust Cindy.

757
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,072
She wouldn't engage
in those underhanded actions behind our back.

758
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,906
Yun, you're just too kind.

759
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:37,539
- Let's leave it at that.
- You're just too…

760
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,239
Hurry up and send the signed document
to the accounting department,

761
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,840
and let them transfer the deposit.

762
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,239
The Sustainable Residence project
is very important.

763
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,840
We can't afford any more mistakes.

764
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:52,840
Did you hear that?

765
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,640
Don't make any more mistakes.

766
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:00,840
Miss Gao.

767
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,807
Are you free tonight?

768
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:05,340
Let's have dinner together.

769
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:19,673
Why do you feel like having warm sake today?

770
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:21,206
Aren't you on your period?

771
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,007
It's better to drink something warm, right?

772
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,173
How thoughtful.

773
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:30,140
This one's to thank you
for your continuous rescues.

774
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,373
First, it was Mr. Xi.

775
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:35,373
And then there was the day
Bosheng did the presentation.

776
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,340
Actually, your quick-witted response

777
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
was indeed good.

778
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,474
You see.

779
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:51,573
You first helped me solve

780
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,474
the unexpected situation during my period.

781
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:55,340
And then you bought clothes

782
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,007
to give me a reason
to postpone the presentation.

783
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,706
It also made Director Zhang
think that I am very diligent.

784
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:04,140
Kill three birds with one stone.

785
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:09,539
What for?

786
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,206
Regret passing me the ball now, do you?

787
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,673
A little bit.

788
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,324
[Duomi]

789
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,173
Take it.

790
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:24,239
It's okay.

791
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,640
Let's take it easy.

792
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,706
It's okay.

793
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,974
Duomi probably wanted to chat with me.

794
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,673
I'll call her back later.

795
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:40,607
You asked me out today

796
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:41,873
shouldn't

797
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:44,573
be just to thank to me, right?

798
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:47,573
Just say whatever you have to say.

799
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:55,673
This morning, Shijie accused you
of acting behind the scenes.

800
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:58,406
I see you hesitating to speak.

801
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,539
How come?

802
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,307
Is there anything inconvenient to say?

803
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:09,474
To put it simply, it's just

804
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,474
that I'm straightforward.

805
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,007
I offended Chen.

806
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,440
When I submitted the approval form,

807
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,673
she told me

808
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:17,206
that the boss would notify me after signing.

809
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:19,607
But Chen didn't notify you.

810
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,440
But you can't blame her entirely.

811
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
I was busy myself and didn't keep an eye on it.

812
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,906
So, it's my fault too.

813
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,507
It's just that…

814
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:29,107
I wasn't proactive enough.

815
00:39:29,107 --> 00:39:31,307
That led to today's situation,

816
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:34,840
and allowing Guo to make a big fuss over it.

817
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,807
Actually,

818
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:40,072
it originally had nothing to do with me.

819
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:44,007
But now that you're my secretary.

820
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,573
It concerns me too.

821
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:49,974
What do you want to say?

822
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:52,340
Have you ever thought

823
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,107
why every time you make a small mistake,

824
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:57,206
the reaction of your colleagues is so strong,

825
00:39:57,206 --> 00:40:00,239
and they keep targeting you?

826
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,740
Because I'm excellent, I guess.

827
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,440
They can't keep up with my pace.

828
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
And they are prejudiced against me.

829
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,206
Do you really think so?

830
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:30,373
Did I go wrong?

831
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,406
This is my…

832
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,206
How come you are in my house?

833
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,941
Don't get me wrong, it was Duomi who let me in.

834
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:38,774
Then, what are you going to do now?

835
00:40:38,774 --> 00:40:41,239
I'm going to buy some alcohol.

836
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,474
Anyway, go ahead quickly.

837
00:40:44,807 --> 00:40:47,273
What's wrong with you?

838
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:50,107
I've had a breakup.

839
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:52,673
I've also been scammed out of money.

840
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:55,273
How could this happen?

841
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:56,873
At that time, he said…

842
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,107
He said he had a car accident,

843
00:40:58,107 --> 00:40:59,474
and then got detained by someone.

844
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:01,273
How can you hit people?

845
00:41:01,273 --> 00:41:03,640
Wait for me.

846
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,373
I did think about how you told me to stay calm.

847
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:08,007
So, I called you.

848
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,474
But I called twice and you didn't pick up.

849
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:14,239
Save the person first.

850
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,906
I was just afraid he would be beaten to death.

851
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,373
I just…

852
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:20,774
went ahead and transferred the money.

853
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:22,273
You called once, twice and I didn't answer.

854
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:23,807
You could have called three or four times.

855
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:24,873
Or else you could have sent me a message,

856
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,039
and let me know.

857
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,107
Don't you have the ability to judge

858
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:29,039
such a simple common sense?

859
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,539
I didn't want to either, but…

860
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,774
I just thought it was too urgent.

861
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:37,039
I was afraid there might be a loss of life.

862
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:40,373
You're just too naive.

863
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,807
That so-called diamond bachelor
from the financial circle,

864
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:43,440
who wanted you to invest in some project.

865
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,539
You didn't even know if he was round or flat.

866
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:47,140
You just threw all your money into it.

867
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,706
And what happened?

868
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,039
Then there was that gym trainer last time.

869
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,807
After you bought a lifetime membership,

870
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:55,607
the gym closed down the next day.

871
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:58,941
You, how could you be so foolish?

872
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,273
Right.

873
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:02,039
I am just foolish.

874
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,140
I deserve to be fooled, alright?

875
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,974
I… Chen Duomi.

876
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:08,807
- Why come here?
- No…

877
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,239
- Chen Duomi, I didn't mean that.
- Duomi.

878
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,552
- Duomi
- Fine, I don't want to listen anymore.

879
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:40,807
[A low-profile stance waiting
for the next stage to bloom]

880
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:43,239
[Next Episode]
I think serious women are the most beautiful.

881
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:45,173
You are truly worthy of that statement.

882
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:46,573
Why do you look

883
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:48,673
that you're a bit blushing?

884
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:49,807
You can tell just by the look in the eyes

885
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:51,007
that whether it's sincere or not.

886
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,607
What are you here for?

887
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:55,673
It would be a total buzzkill if Cindy shows up.

888
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,340
If I, this cannon fodder, am not here,

889
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,740
then how bored must they be.

890
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,340
This is bad, got into a car accident
because of rushing to the next location.

891
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,373
How could this happen?

892
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:04,072
But that Fang Iris is different.

893
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:07,807
- She must be the mistress kept by someone.
- The mistress?

00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:06,911
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

909
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:10,197
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

910
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:12,492
♫ Because of you ♫

911
00:44:12,492 --> 00:44:18,280
♫ I'm no longer afraid
of loneliness and solitude ♫

912
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,539
So, you're here.

913
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,307
It couldn't be the documents just sent over

914
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:29,373
that had a problem, right?

915
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:31,072
I've checked everything.

916
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:34,140
Your comfortable Taoyuan sustainable
residence press conference's

917
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,273
amount requested for payment is too large.

918
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,007
Not saying it earlier or later.

919
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:40,373
But choosing to say it at this time.

920
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:41,706
Either there is something going on,

921
00:44:41,706 --> 00:44:43,706
and especially coming to find me.

922
00:44:43,706 --> 00:44:45,607
Chen Duomi.

923
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:47,273
- Three.
- That…

924
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:49,373
Didn't I want to go have dinner
with you yesterday?

925
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:51,206
It's good that you didn't come yesterday.

926
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:53,774
Because he confessed his feelings to me.

927
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,140
Does he have any
of those social networking sites?

928
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,340
Let me see if his appearance
makes him a good or bad person.

929
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,206
We didn't talk about those things.

930
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:01,340
Besides, I think he probably doesn't have one.

931
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,206
How is it possible for young people
not to have social networking sites?

932
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,140
Even my dad has one.

933
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,807
- I don't have one.
- Don't give me that.

934
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:09,640
For real, young people
love to open alternate accounts.

935
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,941
And then they write all sorts of Stories,
whether real or not.

936
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:14,406
What if I really don't have one?

937
00:45:14,406 --> 00:45:16,873
Would you like to go on a date with me?

938
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:19,507
Date, you…

939
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:21,007
He's just joking, he is…

940
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:22,873
If you don't have one,
then you don't have one, don't be ridiculous.

941
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:25,307
Don't be ridiculous.

942
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:27,273
I'll go handle this matter first.

943
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:29,039
Check that equipment for me.

944
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,507
You say there's no spark
of love between those two.

945
00:45:32,507 --> 00:45:35,573
I don't believe it.
