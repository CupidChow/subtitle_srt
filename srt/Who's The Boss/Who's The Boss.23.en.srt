17
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,818
I like Cindy.

18
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:55,517
Even though I know the chances are slim,

19
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:58,051
I won't give up because of it.

20
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,784
I'm not asking you to give up.

21
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:05,150
I just want to tell you, since the competition has surfaced,

22
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,150
I will act politely first and then forcefully.

23
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,385
No need for that.

24
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,850
If you've got any moves, let's see them.

25
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,850
Come on, because I won't be polite either.

26
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,051
You have some courage, young man.

27
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,651
But I don't need to fight you.

28
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:24,051
I only have a small request for you.

29
00:02:25,618 --> 00:02:27,518
Please tell me.

30
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,651
Please distinguish between work and private matters.

31
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,751
In the future, if Cindy rejects you,

32
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,752
don't let your childish emotions get in the way

33
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:38,085
and cause her trouble at work.

34
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:48,850
That's something I should say to you.

35
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,984
I hope after you lose,

36
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:55,584
you won't cry and ask for candy.

00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:13,717
Chen Duomi.

38
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,885
Do you think I asked you to sleep over because I wanted you to sleep here?

39
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:17,585
You have a task.

40
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,451
Go, go check and see if Meng Heng is outside.

41
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,818
- Hurry up, hurry.
- Don't push me.

42
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,718
What if I open the door and the Great Director is outside?

43
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:27,884
No way.

44
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,851
He is not the kind of person who wouldn't follow the rules.

45
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,017
He calls me every time he comes.

46
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,785

00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:39,917
Ms. Wang Cunfeng, let me ask you a question.

48
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,417
Hurry up.

49
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:44,785
Even if I open the door, and it's Meng Heng outside waiting to confess to you,

50
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,150
if you don't like him, just say no, once and for all.

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,552
Why are you hiding here and dragging me into this?

52
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,684
You like him.

53
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:57,350
Beep. 911, please, take this person away.

54
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,350
Someone is being fickle here.

It's not what you think.

56
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,585
It's just…

57
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,083
I don't want to make things awkward.

58
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,084
After all, he is still interning at our company.

59
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:09,484
Why am I talking so much with you? Hurry up. I have something important today.

60
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,550
- Go and take a look, hurry up, go.
- Fine.

61
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,317
- Hurry up.
- Seriously.

62
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:15,152
Come on.

63
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:21,050
What is it? What's going on?

64
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,651
No one's here.

65
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,150
Then why were you yelling?

66
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,785
I was really touched.

67
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,417
Look.

68
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,118
He is like a little animal. He brought a gift for you.

69
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:37,183
It says, "Your oat latte, no sugar.

70
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:40,152
Remember to drink it while it's hot."

71
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:43,118
So cute.

72
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,917
Please choose him.

73
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,918
You are too easily moved.

74
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,317
Go change your clothes quickly, okay? I'm going to be late for work.

75
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:52,284
Hurry up.

76
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:55,750
Are you not moving? Then I'm going to work first.

77
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:07,018
How's it? Do you have all the information?

78
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:14,918
Guo, thank you this time.

79
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,050
So, can I go back to the sales department now?

80
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,885
Now doesn't seem like the right time.

81
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:27,752
No, I gave you everything. Why do you still make me wait?

82
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:30,417
Guo, we won't lie to you.

83
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,652
We just want to wait until the end of the month, after the vice president's position is confirmed,

84
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:36,317
only then can we use the power to transfer you back.

85
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:41,583
Moreover, we need you in the planning department now to help us gather some information.

86
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,451
Gather information?

87
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,617
I really have become a spy.

88
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,717
Not everyone can be a spy, okay?

89
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,984
I'm so impatient. Do you think I can do it?

90
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,984
Does this count as an encouragement?

91
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:58,317
All right, you just have to endure a little longer.

92
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,584
All right.

93
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:19,985
Sister Duomi.

94
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:22,518
Didn't you come to work with Cindy together this morning?

95
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,552
Where is she?

96
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,183
You knew we came out together.

97
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:28,518
Are you following us again?

98
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:30,784
What do you mean again?

99
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,150
I…

100
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,318
This is called protection.

101
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:37,951
- Beep. Mr. Policeman, someone is illegally stalking…
- Yes, I followed you,

102
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,984
but I swear this is the last time.

103
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,183
So cute.

104
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,417
You're really like a little animal.

105
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,217
All right, your Sister Cindy is on the rooftop now.

106
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:49,150
- Okay.
- But…

107
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,917
- Thank you, Sister Duomi.
- Wait…

108
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,018
I-It's not convenient.

109
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,183
The manager and I will go downstairs first.

110
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,584
You can come down after five minutes.

111
00:06:56,584 --> 00:07:00,017
Make sure no one sees you interacting with people from the sales department.

112
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,317
Okay.

113
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,785
Let's go.

114
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:06,618
Be careful, someone is coming. You hide, I'll block them.

115
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,551
Cindy.

116
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,251
Why did you come up here?

117
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,950
I asked Sister Duomi, and she said you were here.

118
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:23,450
Why would Chen Duomi tell you that?

119
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,050
That's not important.

120
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,985
I…

121
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,183
I have something to tell you.

122
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,985
- I'm very busy right now. Let's talk some other day.
- No,

123
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,285
I must tell you now.

124
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,685
Whatever you want to say, you can't say it now.

125
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,485
I like you.

126
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,183
I am afraid if I don't say it now, I will never have a chance.

127
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,318
What's going on now?

128
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,285
I'm afraid if I don't say it now, you will belong to someone else.

129
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,418
- You shut up.
- So please don't avoid me anymore, okay?

130
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:56,718
- Shut up.
- When I kissed you at your place that day,

131
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,584
I felt we had a chance.

132
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,685
No way. Absolutely impossible.

133
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:03,651
Why is it impossible?

134
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,117
We are in the same company right now, and we are working together.

135
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,884
Do you really have to make things so awkward?

136
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,685
You don't have to give me an answer now.

137
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,984
I can give you an answer right now.

138
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,684
It's impossible for us.

139
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:21,950
If you're not leaving now, I'll leave first.

140
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,617
Cindy.

141
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:35,717
Sister Xiaoyun, what should we do now?

142
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,018
We can only wait for him to leave first.

143
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,085
Manager.

144
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:03,085
Did you… hear everything just now?

145
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:08,151
I don't know what Cindy thinks,

146
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:10,484
but she is strong-willed.

147
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,018
She decisively rejected you like that,

148
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:18,351
probably because there were two extra listeners present.

149
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,585
Yes.

150
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,650
So good luck.

151
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,651
I'll get to work now.

152
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,852
Meng Heng, I'll give you a piece of advice.

153
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,017
When we pursue someone, it's just like doing business.

154
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:51,517
We have to cater to their preferences and serve accordingly to the person.

155
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:54,385
I don't quite get it.

156
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,950
But it's okay.

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,017
Thanks, Brother Guo.

158
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:07,718
Here's some elderflower champagne for you.

159
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:09,418
Thank you.

160
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:26,450
- What's this?
- It's for you.

161
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:31,017
Weren't we going to discuss the after-sales matters today?

162
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:33,617
Today is not my birthday or your birthday,

163
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,818
and it's not any special day.

164
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,450
Or did you do something stupid again?

165
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:51,018
What I'm apologizing for is that I'm sorry

166
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,717
that you didn't succeed in the cooperation with Xin Daqi Development.

167
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,150
If it's about that,

168
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,151
it's really not your fault.

169
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,884
Manager Wu's planning department moves much faster than the sales department.

170
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:06,251
I am not surprised that they partnered first.

171
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,117
And didn't you just say it yourself, business is business.

172
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,918
After all, Xin Daqi still collaborated with Jingdu.

173
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:15,551
So there will still be opportunities for cooperation in the future.

174
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:20,383
Well, that's okay.

175
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:23,185
This gift can be considered for

176
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:27,585
when I… I drank too much last time and said some things that upset you.

177
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:28,983
This is to apologize to you.

178
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:33,685
You can also consider it as a gift to make my girlfriend happy.

179
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,017
You don't need to please me.

180
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,184
Just understand me.

181
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:51,450
Actually, some of our values really match quite well.

182
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,651
However, our ways of handling things can be quite different.

183
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,000
For example, when you employed Han Xinzheng,

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,110
and when your company's contract got terminated,

185
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:06,150
didn't you plan to tell me at all?

186
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,260
Maybe our ways of dealing with things are quite different,

187
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,584
or you think I can't help you.

188
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:21,818
But you know what? I will still support you in the end.

189
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:32,917
It's just that the way you handle things makes me feel that we are very distant.

190
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:38,218
Sometimes I even feel like that you treat me like an outsider.

191
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,517
Cindy.

192
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:45,183
I have revised the discussion part for after-sales.

193
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,252
Take a look at it when you return to the company.

194
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,685
Also, I hope you can think carefully

195
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:54,580
if I am the person you truly want

196
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,218
to stay by your side.

197
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:58,983
I'll leave now.

198
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:00,618
Director Zhang.

199
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,550
You should take advantage of the situation!

200
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,717
I guarantee your success rate is 99%.

201
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,652
It's not the first time they have quarreled.

202
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:36,283
To take advantage of this, I find it too despicable.

203
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,984
If their love is indestructible, you are the one percent.

204
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,118
And this is not illegal.

205
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,550
You can show concern.

206
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,951
You can buy flowers to express your feelings.

207
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,285
There are many things you can do.

208
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,183
Yes.

209
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,451
We agreed to compete fairly.

210
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,251
Yeah, so you need to take action.

211
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,251
Come on, listen.

212
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,550
I have a few good flower shops here, and I'll send them to you.

213
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,384
No, I don't need them.

214
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,617
Cindy is someone who is not swayed by soft or hard tactics.

215
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:04,420
I'm just thinking

216
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,980
chasing foolishly like this and showing goodwill seems to be useless.

217
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:10,352
I need to think of other ways.

218
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,951
Everyone, the mission starts immediately.

219
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,785
Remember, it must be done in secret.

220
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,670
The information Cindy gives everyone now

221
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,380
is your respective scope of work.

222
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:44,817
Yingjun, you bring Meng Heng and liaise with the programmer.

223
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,318
Manager, I suggest going online one week before the end of the month.

224
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:51,750
This will catch the planning department off guard.

225
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,717
Hello, is this Mr. Zhang?

226
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,050
No, I just want to confirm your contact number.

227
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,917
Guo Shijie, where did you sneak off to again?

228
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,850
- I'll tell you the details later.
- Guo Shijie.

229
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,485
- Okay, that's it for now. Bye.
- Guo Shijie.

230
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,651
What are you doing?

231
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,785
So sneaky.

232
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:33,383
I-I was just helping Fang Aisi make some phone calls.

233
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,685
Manager, did you need anything?

234
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,017
Of course, or do you think I'm asking you out on a date?

235
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:43,418
Prioritize. Do you understand that?

236
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,518
Fang Aisi's matter.

237
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,451
The Xin Daqi case.

238
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,050
Fang Aisi's matter.

239
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,852
The Xin Daqi case.

240
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,617
Fang Aisi's matter.

241
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:53,885
Xin Daqi.

242
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,818
What should you be doing now?

243
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:01,284
- Fang Aisi's matter.
- The Xin Daqi case!

244
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,418
Come help me organize some data.

245
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:05,585
Who knows where everyone has gone?

246
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,018
That was close.

247
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:09,584
Fang Aisi. Xin Daqi.

248
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,850
Fang Aisi.

249
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:15,618
- This is the part Yingjun finished.
- Sir.

250
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,618
Yes, I have reviewed the app you sent over.

251
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,851
- Basically, there is no big issue.
- So, have you keyed it in?

252
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:21,251
But just…

253
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:24,550
Can the certification process be simplified?

254
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,385
Because some of the buyers are elderly.

255
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,785
I'm afraid if it's too complicated, it might be too…

256
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:33,152
- Thank you!
- Hello.

257
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,418
I just got off work and saw that the lights in your department are still on.

258
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,550
I thought maybe someone forgot to turn them off.

259
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,717
I didn't expect everyone to still be here.

260
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:44,951
What are you guys working on?

261
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:47,250
- Contacting clients.
- I'm preparing reports.

262
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,317
Working overtime together and doing your own things?

263
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,251
Isn't that obvious?

264
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,017
It's just unfinished work.

265
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:57,718
Doing it during overtime, or when else would we do it?

266
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,684
- Is that so?
- Yes.

267
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,183
Do you need my help?

268
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:06,385
No need, the sales department can handle our own matters. Just like your planning department handles your own matters. Right?

269
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,150
Right.

270
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:10,251
Right, I just remembered.

271
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:15,318
Secretary Li, you haven't been to Fang Aisi's nail salon yet. Right?

272
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:19,617
Because I heard her say that among all the female colleagues in the company,

273
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,818
you're the only one who looks down on her.

274
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:25,517
Nonsense, I don't look down on her.

275
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,885
I-I'm just too busy.

276
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:31,483
Too busy? Well, now you're off work, do you have time now?

277
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,490
I can bring you there now. There's a client near her place who called for my car.

278
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:38,450
But this is not obligatory, right.

279
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,384
- Because this is fate, fate.
- Right.
- Right.

280
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:41,517
It's okay, I have time.

281
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,718
- I'll ride in your car, Meng Heng.
- Okay, let's go now.

282
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:46,051
- Hey, have you finished the work you were doing?
- Yes.

283
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,051
- Just walking away like this isn't…
- You can't do this.

284
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,251
No, because Secretary Li was misunderstood. I must take her there.

285
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:53,183
But, won't the manager be angry tomorrow?

286
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:54,218
Yeah, help me talk to the manager.

287
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:56,517
I think we need to solve this matter.

288
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,851
Meng Heng, when you go, you need to say some good things about me.

289
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:00,684
- I will definitely say good things about you.
- I don't look down on her.

290
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:02,017
Yes, I believe you, you don't look down on her.

291
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:03,217
I really don't look down on her.

292
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,318
- You like her a lot.
- Yes, yes.

293
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:09,618
Let's go.

294
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:13,450
Fortunately, Meng Heng was clever enough.

295
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,918
I would have been scared to death.

296
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,318
- Really.
- So scary.

297
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:17,718
How about the parts he hasn't finished? The progress.

298
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:20,618
It seems like he had contacted one of the guys.

299
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:22,132
- Okay.
- Yes.

300
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:29,484
Last time we played, how many strokes did you hit?

301
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,584
A little over eighty.

302
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,617
Then you've improved today.

303
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,652
President, breakfast is ready for you all.

304
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:36,084
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

305
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,851
Just a reminder, you have a meeting with Mr. Lin at 10:00.

306
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,184
As for the company matters,

307
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,950
the collaboration schedule between the planning department and Xin Daqi has been submitted,

308
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,185
waiting for you to check and sign.

309
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,850
I found that Manager Wu seems to have been performing well.

310
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,318
Yes, he's becoming more reliable in handling things.

311
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:53,784
So, Zhou, what do you think?

312
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:58,651
Manager Wu, Xiaoyun, and Cindy Wang, among these three people,

313
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:01,984
who is most suitable for the vice president position?

314
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:03,984
Me?

315
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,784
President, my position is not quite neutral.

316
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:07,751
So I won't comment.

317
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:10,183
You are too rigid.

318
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,430
If I asked Sister Chen this question,

319
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,980
she would immediately analyze everyone's strengths and weaknesses for me.

320
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:17,485
Yes.

321
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,950
Although I am not from your company,

322
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,518
in my opinion, Cindy Wang is the least suitable person for the vice president position.

323
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,485
Why do you say that?

324
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:32,384
Didn't you just tell me how strong her work abilities are?

325
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:35,484
Moreover, she is your girlfriend.

326
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:41,918
I will tell you the reason when we have breakfast.

327
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:48,918
- By the way, Zhou.
- Yes.

328
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:51,318
That night at the developer's dinner party,

329
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:54,883
Chairman Wang of Wangchao Construction said he had had a son late in life.

330
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:58,884
His youngest son will be a month old in a few days.

331
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:01,517
Please deliver a gift for me.

332
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:03,817
No problem, I will handle it right away.

333
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:11,218
Tianfu, I think Guo Shijie seems shady.

334
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:15,151
If he's not missing for half the day, he's sneaking around in the meeting room.

335
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,051
I don't know what he's up to.

336
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:35,918
Guo Shijie. I'll see what you're up to just now.

337
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,318
Hello, good day.

338
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:44,051
I am Secretary Li from the planning department of Jingdu Construction.

339
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,617
But didn't he hide in the meeting room last time secretly calling old clients,

340
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,818
but he told you he was doing something for Fang Aisi.

341
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:52,950
Guo Shijie has now been relegated to a remote area.

342
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,318
His only project now is Fang Aisi.

343
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,584
What can he possibly accomplish?

344
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:00,718
Even if that's the case, we still need to be wary of the sales department.

345
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,384
They're acting strange lately.

346
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:03,918
Although they haven't made any big moves,

347
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:09,284
maybe they're secretly working on some big plan to counter us.

348
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:14,884
Those blockheads.

349
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:16,950
What big plan could they really have?

350
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,118
At most, they're trying every means possible to sell more houses and boost their performance.

351
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:25,051
Even if their performance improves, even if it's 50% better than last month,

352
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,485
and 50% is a huge increase, it still won't match our performance.

353
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:29,684
Come on.

354
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,918
It's Xin Daqi.

355
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,984
But they've been working overtime for two days straight.

356
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:38,618
No matter how hard they're working overtime, it's none of our business.

357
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:43,885
Mi, you-you just…

358
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,218
You don't need to worry, okay?

359
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:49,352
Just get ready to be the vice president's wife.

360
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:54,817
Then I'll be your good wife.

361
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,984
Tianfu, why don't you ever look at me?

362
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:05,785
Look.

363
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,550
What is different about me?

364
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:11,617
Got a haircut?

365
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:14,184
No, why are you teasing me all the time?

366
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:16,017
I went to get my nails done.

367
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,652
I went to Fang Aisi.

368
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:20,651
I thought I would say something good about you in front of her

369
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,118
and see if she can pass it on to the boss.

370
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,318
You are really thoughtful.

371
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,684
How do you always think of me?

372
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:32,218
Okay. I have a gift for you.

373
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,084
Wait for me a moment.

374
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:37,184
Wait a moment.

375
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:45,385
This gift is not too expensive.

376
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:46,884
However,

377
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:49,218
I still want to give it to you.

378
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:50,718
Yes, it is a thermos.

379
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:55,817
It represents our relationship, always staying warm.

380
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:57,518
Thank you.

381
00:22:57,518 --> 00:23:00,018
Why would Director Zhang do this?

382
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:02,617
Was it because of that unpleasant meal at the restaurant?

383
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:03,950
And he holds a grudge?

384
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,818
Maybe Director Zhang is too chauvinistic.

385
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:11,050
He probably just doesn't want Cindy to perform too well at work.

386
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,017
I don't know.

387
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,718
Anyway, it doesn't matter what the reason is.

388
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:17,518
I just wonder what he thinks of Cindy.

389
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,651
So what do you plan to do?

390
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:29,818
Do you want Cindy to know?

391
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,884
I am stuck now,

392
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,350
not sure whether to tell her or not.

393
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,484
Because it's not good to tell her, and it's also not good not to tell her.

394
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,385
I think she should know.

395
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:45,585
However, think of a way.

396
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,718
No.

397
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,284
So what's your plan?

398
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:53,984
Anyway, no matter what,

399
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:57,384
I want to make sure Cindy doesn't get hurt.

400
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:10,152
Our thermos cups are the same.

401
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:15,950
Really. What a coincidence.

402
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,718
Let me tell you something, this is my…

403
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:21,084
Bank savings gift, right?

404
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,250
They have a good taste.

405
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,851
The things that bank gives are all good.

406
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:27,784
Another bank is also really good.

407
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:31,884
They give small suitcases, the co-branded ones.

408
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:34,251
But which brand is it from, I can't remember.

409
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:37,018
I'll let you know when I remember. Bye-bye.

410
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:44,718
Savings gift? This is a free gift.

411
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,817
Why would he give me a free gift?

412
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:51,118
It's impossible. No way.

413
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:53,850
It should be just a coincidence.

414
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,251
Zhou, what were you thinking?

415
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:00,885
I asked you to send a baby gift to Chairman Wang.

416
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:03,384
May I ask where you sent it?

417
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:05,818
I-I sent it to Chairman Wang's home.

418
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:07,550
I told you to give it to Chairman Wang.

419
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,451
Why did you send to his house and to Mrs. Wang?

420
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:13,283
Don't you understand?

421
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:14,385
Chairman Wang.

422
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,651
Chairman Wang's wife is already a grandmother.

423
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:20,084
Sending the baby gift to his home, to Mrs. Wang…

424
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,652
Oh my god, I…

425
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:25,117
President, but I followed your instructions.

426
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:26,684
- My instructions?
- Yes.

427
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,017
How did I instruct you?

428
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:31,385
When I told you, I… Didn't I gesture this to you?

429
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:33,918
Can't you understand my gesture? Isn't this obvious enough?

430
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:37,084
Yes, doesn't this mean the youngest son?

431
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:38,818
Concubine.

432
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:41,283
Son of the concubine.

433
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:42,684
Concubine?

434
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:45,818
Concubine... Concubine, isn't that the…

435
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:47,218
Oh, no.

436
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:49,517
Sorry! Sorry, President! I'm so sorry!

437
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:52,250
I'm telling you. You not only have to apologize properly,

438
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,318
but you also have to handle the whole situation well.

439
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:57,418
In short, Chairman Wang is an old client and an old friend.

440
00:25:57,418 --> 00:25:58,851
We can't lose him, understand?

441
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,384
Yes, President, I will find a way to handle it immediately.

442
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:03,885
- Go handle it quickly.
- Yes.

443
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:08,218
In short, that's it.

444
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,485
Besides apologizing now,

445
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,551
I can't think of any way to make up for this either.

446
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,951
I think it's very hard to turn this around.

447
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,485
Probably the only way is to resign.

448
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:22,084
Yes, remember, make sure to apologize before you leave.

449
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:24,018
Even if you have to kneel, you must do it.

450
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:25,818
At least you can save some face.

451
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,318
Don't let Chairman Wang end the partnership with our company.

452
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:30,717
Kneeling or resigning isn't the best solution,

453
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:32,584
because the problem hasn't been solved at all.

454
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:34,151
It can't be solved.

455
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,684
That's why we're asking him to resign.

456
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:37,684
In the end, it's Chairman Wang who's the problem.

457
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:39,450
Why did he bother having a mistress in the first place?

458
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,183
That's another matter.

459
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,717
As secretaries, we just do what the boss instructs us to do.

460
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:48,151
And sometimes sacrifices are unavoidable.

461
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:49,985
So if your supervisor tells you to commit murder or arson,

462
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,918
or use your charms to achieve your performance targets, will you do it?

463
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,450
- Please, we're not gangsters.
- It's not like that.

464
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,485
We are salaried employees.

465
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:57,884
Can salaried employees really be themselves?

466
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,117
It's a matter of ethics now.

467
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,651
And how do you know what your supervisor will ask you to do?

468
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,117
- You're overthinking this. It's not like that.
- All right.

469
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:06,251
- About the apology…
- Okay, stop arguing.

470
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,717
Sister Chen.

471
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:09,351
What are you doing here?

472
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:12,885
You put the message in the Secretaries' Club group chat.

473
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,851
So, of course, I came after seeing it.

474
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:19,485
Thank you, Sister Chen.

475
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:22,585
Here, Sister Chen, have an egg tart.

476
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:24,151
And have some cookies.

477
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:29,650
- It's Chairman Wang from Wangchao Construction, right?
- Yes.

478
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,617
Sister Chen, do you have a solution?

479
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:38,451
[Chairman Wang's golf meeting]

480
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:40,885
- Zhou.
- Here.

481
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:43,484
Book a banquet table. Prepare it as a baby banquet.

482
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:46,652
Replace all the wine glasses with baby bottles.

483
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,050
Baby bottles?

484
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,517
Cindy, schedule a meeting with Manager Gao and Director Zhang.

485
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,752
Director Zhang, too?

486
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,951
Is there a problem?

487
00:27:57,951 --> 00:27:59,283
No.

488
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:03,117
Sister Chen, what about me? What should I do?

489
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:06,150
Just go back to work and behave yourself.

490
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:10,351
Cindy, I'm counting on you.

491
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:12,817
You must get Director Zhang to come.

492
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:17,851
Please.

493
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:21,084
Thank you, Sister Chen.

494
00:28:44,184 --> 00:28:45,485
Here.

495
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,851
I know our previous conversation wasn't very pleasant.

496
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,985
But regarding Chairman Wang's matter,

497
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,450
please help out.

498
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,251
No problem, I'll help.

499
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,851
Thank you.

500
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:05,985
Don't thank me.

501
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:09,618
Even if it isn't for you, I would still help your president.

502
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:13,985
However, my help comes with a price.

503
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:15,350
What kind of price?

504
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,818
I want to use this opportunity

505
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:21,750
to exchange for an Immunity Card from you.

506
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:27,683
Do you have paper and pen?

507
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:45,280
[Immunity]

508
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,618
I've written it.

509
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,517
You draw so well.

510
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,752
Why is it taking so long?

511
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,385
Stop walking around.

512
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:19,550
It will definitely work. Don't be so nervous, okay?

513
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,351
I know I shouldn't be nervous. But…

514
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:26,650
If there were any problems, they would have adjourned the meeting by now.

515
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,484
You're making me nervous, too.

516
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:31,384
Are you sure? Because it's taking so long.

517
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:33,718
It has to take that long.

518
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,151
Xiaoyun, are you okay?

519
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:39,951
How are things inside?

520
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,552
I've had too much to drink. My head hurts a bit.

521
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:46,785
Let Director Zhang tell you the details.

522
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:49,385
- Then Cindy, I'll take her home first.
- Okay.

523
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:50,684
Let me know about the situation later.

524
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,485
- Okay. Hurry back; be careful.
- Be careful.

525
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:54,485
Okay, thanks.

526
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,251
Be careful.

527
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:58,851
Be careful going home. Bye-bye.

528
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:03,050
How are things inside?

529
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:08,518
I've had a bit too much to drink.

530
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,750
Will you go for a walk with me?

531
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,218
Okay.

532
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,617
Did I disturb you?

533
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:37,450
Does your head still hurt?

534
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,851
It doesn't hurt if I lean on you like this.

535
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,283
It was clearly my own mistake.

536
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:48,517
But I troubled so many people to help me clean up.

537
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:50,818
Do you think I'm stupid?

538
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:53,084
Of course not.

539
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:55,251
I like you this way.

540
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:57,650
This shows that you are simple.

541
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,818
No matter how chaotic this world gets,

542
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,284
as long as you don't change, I won't change either.

543
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,684
Thank you.

544
00:32:10,684 --> 00:32:14,051
Silly. What are you thanking me for?

545
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:32,717
So, what was the situation in there just now?

546
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:40,884
A perfect lie must be built on truth.

547
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:45,151
"True is false, false is true."

548
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:47,418
What does that mean?

549
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:53,151
It means the dinner just now

550
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:57,718
and the baby gift that Zhou gave to Chairman Wang

551
00:32:57,718 --> 00:32:59,851
were meant to make Mrs. Wang

552
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:05,151
believe that we were celebrating Chairman Wang's hole-in-one last month.

553
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,418
According to Sister Chen's schedule,

554
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,951
last month, Chairman Wang did go golfing,

555
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:12,818
and he did indeed get a hole-in-one.

556
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,718
It's Chairman Wang from Wangchao Construction, right?

557
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,151
Sister Chen, do you have a solution?
[Chairman Wang's golf meeting]

558
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:22,218
Zhou, book a banquet table.

559
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:24,651
Prepare it as a baby banquet.

560
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:27,350
What about the baby bottles?

561
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,517
Why replace the wine glasses with baby bottles?

562
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:33,217
That's to create a humorous atmosphere.

563
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:34,985
Come, everyone, raise your glasses.

564
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,485
No, raise your baby bottles.

565
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,918
Yeah.

566
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:39,217
Raise your baby bottles.

567
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,083
Chairman Wang, Mrs. Wang, come on.

568
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,585
You two, drink a cross-cupped wine.

569
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,985
- Yes.
- Yes.

570
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:45,851
- This is a happy event.
- We're an old married couple.

571
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:47,183
You can do it.

572
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:49,318
Take a drink, right? Let me and Director Zhang demonstrate.

573
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,084
Let us demonstrate.

574
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,017
All right, if everyone says so.

575
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:55,550
Chairman Wang. Mrs. Wang.

576
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,751
- All right.
- Cheers to you.

577
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:03,217
This way, we can let Zhou's misplaced baby gift

578
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,083
seem less serious.

579
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,684
Everyone would think this is a joke

580
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:09,617
played by President to Chairman Wang.

581
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:12,318
It can also be interpreted as we are eagerly awaiting

582
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:16,217
Chairman Wang's next hole-in-one,

583
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:20,785
and invite everyone for another meal.

584
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:23,618
I can't believe it.

585
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:26,718
Why invite you and Gao Shuangyun?

586
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:28,751
I think Manager Gao and I

587
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:32,317
can be seen as a guarantee of character.

588
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:34,884
Indeed, it has to be Sister Chen.

589
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:38,018
It was such a tough task, but she handled it so naturally.

590
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:40,118
She is truly impressive.

591
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:53,384
That day, after talking with you,

592
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,584
I thought it through carefully.

593
00:34:57,284 --> 00:35:01,150
To be honest, I would hire Han Xinzheng,

594
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,251
besides his skills being really good,

595
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:06,850
there was actually another reason.

596
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,684
I felt quite sorry for him.

597
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:16,451
Of course, I knew you would have an opinion about me hiring him.

598
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:19,750
So... So I originally planned

599
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,584
to tell you after he made some achievements.

600
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:29,584
That way, I would have more confidence to face your doubts.

601
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:32,818
Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.

602
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:39,118
I really don't want to lose face in front of you.

603
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:44,718
I hope to maintain a perfect image in your heart.

604
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:46,517
So. I…

605
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:52,117
It's quite funny, isn't it?

606
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,684
Not at all.

607
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:04,151
It's quite cute.

608
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:06,918
It's a bit gap moe (behavior contradicts their appearance).

609
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,484
I don't know where I heard this saying:

610
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:16,385
"If you can let go of your ego in front of your other half,

611
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:19,150
it is a continuation of an intimate relationship."

612
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:38,351
It feels pretty good.

613
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:44,685
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

614
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,284
Cindy, thank you.

615
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:49,818
I will cherish this opportunity.

616
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,184
Also, I need to tell you something.

617
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:56,852
Take your time.

618
00:36:56,852 --> 00:37:01,617
Don't you think tonight is quite perfect like this?

619
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,450
There was such a gathering?

620
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:14,952
Gao Shuangyun, Head of Sales Department,

621
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:18,818
these senior executives all went.

622
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:20,584
Why didn't they invite me?

623
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:21,751
I don't know.

624
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:24,217
This is the guest list drafted by Sister Chen.

625
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:26,918
You already knew the guest list.

626
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:31,351
Why didn't you fight for me for such an important gathering?

627
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:32,952
It's not an important event.

628
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:35,851
- There's nothing to fight for…
- You…

629
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:42,084
You must be so naive.

630
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:44,818
So naive.

631
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,051
This is called a conspirator structure.

632
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:50,752
The boss only invites his own people.

633
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:52,717
Now I...

634
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,351
have become an outsider

635
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:57,717
How can you be an outsider?

636
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,817
You and the boss strived together back in the day.

637
00:37:59,817 --> 00:38:02,917
If this continues, I will become an outsider.

638
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,751
Important matters must be taken care of myself.

639
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,318
Excuse me.

640
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:13,317
My secretary is just unclear-minded and careless with tasks.

641
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:17,017
If I had known about Chairman Wang's issues earlier, I would have taken care of it perfectly.

642
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:19,818
President, you don't have to worry.

643
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:23,618
This superficial work like sugar-coating things,

644
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:26,450
we definitely won't do!

645
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,218
But when it comes to PR crisis management skills,

646
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,351
our planning department is very good at it.

647
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,118
Actually, it's not necessary.

648
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:34,051
Sister Chen has already taken care of it.

649
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:37,284
Besides, Chairman Wang was very satisfied.

650
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:39,617
Zhou, remember this lesson.

651
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,184
Learn more from Sister Chen.

652
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,852
This move of Sister Chen,

653
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,983
making the best out of a bad situation, is excellent.

654
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:46,551
- Yes.
- That's right, that's right.

655
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:50,451
Sister Chen and I are "great minds think alike".

656
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,852
Boss, that's where you are brilliant.

657
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:53,850
You're so good at leading people.

658
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,784
Your secretary is much smarter than mine.

659
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,218
Thank you, President, for your guidance.

660
00:38:58,218 --> 00:39:00,518
I'll definitely learn from Sister Chen in the future.

661
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,984
Good.

662
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:05,318
- President.
- Sister Chen.

663
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:07,585
Sister Chen, we were just talking about you.

664
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:10,385
How's the situation with your mother? Is she okay?

665
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:11,950
Yes, President.

666
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,851
I've officially canceled my leave and returned to work today.

667
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,718
That's great.

668
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:19,251
What are you holding in your hand? So many.

669
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:22,417
These are some anonymous recommendation letters.

670
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,885
Recommendation letters?

671
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,751
For what?

672
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:28,851
Recommending Cindy for Vice President.

673
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,485
Regarding the company's Vice President vacancy,

674
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:42,351
based on many years of camaraderie,

675
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:45,518
teaching and learning from each other, striving for progress together,

676
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:49,317
as fellow women, we should naturally cherish each other.

677
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:52,984
Therefore, I believe Cindy Wang should be promoted to Vice President.

678
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:54,551
She can definitely lead the company teams

679
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:57,918
to create new opportunities and reach new heights.

680
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:01,918
Yazi, you really supported me.

681
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,417
I didn't write this.

682
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,084
No, this… but it says

683
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,051
based on many years of camaraderie,

684
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:10,184
Xiaoting has only been here for two years.

685
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:11,717
Many years of friendship, it must be you.

686
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:12,918
As fellow women…

687
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:14,417
If it's not you, then who?

688
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:18,284
No, if I wrote it, I would definitely admit it.

689
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,651
Stop it. Look, don't be shy. Look here.

690
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,783
- See, here it's covered with correction fluid. There's also the character "Xu".
- No.

691
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:26,551
- It's you.
- I didn't write this. Go and ask your friends.

692
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:37,784
That's right.

693
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:39,384
- It's me.
- What?

694
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,885
Yeah.

695
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,017
Yeah.

696
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:48,218
But I didn't make it up.

697
00:40:48,218 --> 00:40:51,518
All my content is based on everyone's evaluation of you.

698
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:53,140
It's not made up.

699
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,584
So you asked us persistently

700
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,885
about Sister Cindy becoming the vice president,

701
00:40:57,885 --> 00:40:59,318
because you needed to write a recommendation letter?

702
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:01,050
I was very moved myself, too.

703
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,751
It's very tiring.

704
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:05,284
So you wrote this, too?

705
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,751
Yeah.

706
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,484
You also wrote this?

707
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:11,785
Meng Heng, you are amazing.

708
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:14,084
Yeah.

709
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:26,417
- Too…
- Happy.

710
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,118
- Tears…
- Of joy.

711
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,317
Why are you so angry?

712
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:39,550
He strongly supported you with actual actions.

713
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,384
Don't you find him very cute like this?

714
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:42,385
Yes.

715
00:41:42,385 --> 00:41:44,751
He is very cute, but I am very embarrassed.

716
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,718
Don't you think his method is stupid?

717
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:49,584
This isn't stupid. This is called...

718
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:52,517
innocence.

719
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:53,918
All right, let me ask you.

720
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:57,951
The lucky charm in your bag, was it from Meng Heng?

721
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:59,584
Yeah.

722
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,117
So what?

723
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:03,617
He happened to get it, so he gave it to me.

724
00:42:03,617 --> 00:42:05,918
No, it's not.

725
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:08,550
You wanted that lucky charm so much at that time,

726
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,084
so I thought I'd get it after work.

727
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:14,784
When I went there, someone was already there.

728
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:16,583
Who do you think it was?

729
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:24,084
He kept trying and trying.

730
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,284
He didn't drink water or eat anything.

731
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,651
I stood there until my legs were sore.

732
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:30,950
And I kept watching him.

733
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,852
He didn't even notice me at all.

734
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:36,485
Look at how serious he is for you.

735
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,317
But even so, he shouldn't be so reckless.

736
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:42,551
Even if his method was not perfect,

737
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:45,951
his intention was perfect.

Do you have time? I'm at your company.

740
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:56,050
Let's have lunch together.

741
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:00,284
All right, my emotions are intense.

742
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:01,985
I am going to have a meal

743
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:05,317
with a mature adult who I can communicate with.

744
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,551
Wang Cunfeng!

745
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:10,418
Listen.

746
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:13,351
Whether you choose the mature adult

747
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:15,618
or the naive younger brother,

748
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,917
as long as you are happy with your choice,

749
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:21,618
just go ahead bravely. Okay?

750
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:26,085
No matter what, I will support you.

751
00:43:36,418 --> 00:43:37,951
Go ahead.

752
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:44,284
Cindy, could you please let me explain?

753
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:46,550
Thank you for your kindness, but I don't want to hear anything right now.

754
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,112
No.

755
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:50,917
Just listen to me.

756
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:53,085
I did it because…

757
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:58,984
I did it because Zhang Shiping told the president not to promote you to vice president.

758
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:03,417
He clearly knows how dedicated you are to your work.

759
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:06,485
But he doesn't help you and even steps on you. Is this the kind of person you want?

760
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:10,684
Is that true?

761
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:13,018
You told the president not to promote me to vice president?

762
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,785
Let me explain.

763
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,185
The other thing I wanted to tell you last night was…

764
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:30,817
Cindy.

Tomorrow is the day I become the vice president.

767
00:44:53,184 --> 00:44:55,284
Let's get familiar with the environment together first.

I believe this can bring immense happiness to our customers.

771
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:04,518
How do you feel about my arrangement of Cindy?

772
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,818
Isn't it a little too harsh?

773
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:08,184
Are you really leaving?

774
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:11,883
Can you change "thank you" to "I love you"?

775
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:15,017
You don't get a say about my career.

776
00:45:15,017 --> 00:45:18,318
