173
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,256
that the pace seems a bit too fast.

174
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,023
I hope we can slow down a bit.

175

After all,
we don't know each other very well yet.

176

I understand your concerns.

177
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,223
It's my fault
for not expressing myself clearly.

00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,590
that I have deceived you in any way,

185
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,189
leading to us not being able
to be together in the end.

186
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,655
Yi.

187
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:50,356
Let me introduce you.

188
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:53,689
This is my daughter, Yi.

189
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:56,155
This is the nanny
who helps take care of my daughter.

190
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,723
Amy.

191
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:01,223
Hello.

192
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:02,655
Sweetie.

193
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,723
She is the Auntie Wang
that Daddy often mentions to you.

194
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:07,455
Auntie Wang.

195
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:08,923
Miss Wang, hello.

196
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,322
Hello.

197
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:15,322
Yi, you should say hello.

198
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,655
[Zhang Yiyi]
Auntie Wang, hello.

199
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:21,390
- Hello.
- Good girl, sit down.

200
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:26,390
Your name is Yi, right?

201
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,622
This is a gift for you.

202
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:28,856
I hope you'll like it.

203
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,356
Would you like to open it and take a look now?

204
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:31,689
Do you like it?

205
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,122
I'm sure I will like it,

206
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:36,023
because Daddy picked it out.

207
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,822
Thank you, Miss Wang.

208
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:43,056
You're welcome.

209
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,155
Auntie Amy, may I go to the restroom?

210
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,689
Okay, I will take her to the restroom first.

211
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,189
You two talk.

212
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:56,023
Cindy.

213
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,088
I'm sorry, my daughter Yi…

214
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,655
You don't quite know what to do with her.

215
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,957
I know.

216
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,288
Cindy.

217
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:12,390
Business cooperation

218
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,288
should adhere to the principle of integrity.

219
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:17,523
So, we should first clarify
each other's bottom lines,

220
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:18,790
and make them clear.

221
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,122
Between people

222
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,356
is the same.

223
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,423
So, that's my situation.

224
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:28,757
A single father with a little daughter.

225
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,455
If you can't accept it,

226
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:36,255
then tell me honestly.

227
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,989
I can understand.

228
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:41,523
I can accept that.

229
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,288
My dad was also a single parent.

230
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,923
He raised me by himself.

231
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:47,590
So, it won't affect the relationship
between you and me.

232
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,890
Really?

233
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:53,856
Do you want to go see her?

234
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,523
I'm fine on my own.

235
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:57,856
Really?

236
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,989
Thank you.

237
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,455
Although the video is not very clear,

238
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:19,957
I saw it with my own eyes.

239
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:21,723
Zhang Shiping is a scumbag.

240
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,790
He's cheating, and has a mistress.

241
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:34,023
To some extent,

242
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,890
I'm the mistress, right?

243
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,189
Han Xinzheng has already said it this way.

244
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:46,489
Do you have any more questions for me?

245
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,655
That's what he said.

246
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:52,390
But many things
can't be judged by hearsay alone.

247
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,423
So,

248
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:56,556
I would like to hear
your side of the story, Mr. Xi.

249
00:11:56,556 --> 00:12:00,155
If he says I assigned it, then I assigned it.

250
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,489
No, why do you women have to talk so much?

251
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,056
Can't you just listen and be good?

252
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,023
What if this matter gets discovered?

253
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:08,856
Vice President Han
could very likely lose his job.

254
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:10,255
For your personal gain

255
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:11,923
to sacrifice his future.

256
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:14,622
Is that fair?

257
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:19,523
Han Xinzheng is really lucky

258
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:23,023
to have such a beautiful and smart

259
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:26,622
girlfriend who so staunchly supports him.

260
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,056
- You…
- I.

261
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:32,155
How did I know it?

262
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:36,088
Of course, Han Xinzheng told me himself.

263
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,223
Miss Gao.

264
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,288
Not that I want to say this,

265
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:45,723
but if you want to advance through a man,
you should know how to choose.

266
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,288
Han

267
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:51,356
is at most just a worker

268
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,390
Then what about me?

269
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,890
I'm different.

270
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:01,356
What do you mean?

271
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:05,957
What I mean

272
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,390
is that

273
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,689
I respect you.

274
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,856
So, here's a suggestion for you.

275
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,255
I'll take my leave first.

276
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,590
I think you're beautiful, so,
let me tell you something from the heart.

277
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,590
If there's nothing for him,

278
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,189
then do you think Han Xinzheng would do it?

279
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,689
He's not that simple.

280
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,189
How about this?

281
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,655
It's also getting late.

282
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,655
Let's find another place to rest.

283
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,622
Since you're tired,

284
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,155
then return early to rest.

285
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,356
Your wife is waiting for you.

286
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,989
I'll be leaving first.

287
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:06,088
Just kidding.

288
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,489
I'm off.

289
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:24,122
- Meng Heng.
- Nian.

290
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:25,689
This is your salary.

291
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:26,790
- Here.
- Thank you.

292
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,322
So, do you want to have a drink today?

293
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:32,189
Today? Sure.

294
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:34,890
Okay, I'll go get ready.

295
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,356
Zhou.

296
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:48,655
What a coincidence, kid.

297
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,790
Why are you drinking alone here?

298
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:56,689
Thank you.

299
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,989
You haven't drunk
half a bottle by yourself, have you?

300
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:12,423
What's the matter?

301
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:14,890
Troubles at work?

302
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,155
Or is it a love issue?

303
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:20,288
Miss Gao hasn't gotten a boyfriend, has she?

304
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:23,122
How do you know I like Miss Gao?

305
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,023
It's super obvious.

306
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,523
The way you talk to her.

307
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:29,757
You look at her with such tender eyes.

308
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,757
And last time, you were so upset
when the cup she gave you broke.

309
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:35,189
You were as down as anything.

310
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:38,255
Even you noticed.

311
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:41,489
Why can't Yun see it, though?

312
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,757
Can I ask you a question?

313
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:49,822
Why did you

314
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:52,489
like Miss Gao?

315
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:57,957
We joined the company at the same time.

316
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,356
Hello, my name is Zhou Jiawei.

317
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:02,356
Here to report today.

318
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,489
Zhou Jiawei.

319
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:13,989
Back then, she was warm-hearted

320
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,356
and gentle.

321
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,523
Oh, no.

322
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:21,923
I have an extra pen here.

323
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,356
Do you need it?

324
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,223
Sure, thank you.

325
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,989
You're welcome.

326
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:35,390
From the moment I first saw her,

327
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,189
I fell in love with her.

328
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,496
Bumped into each other again.

329
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:43,723
Sit.

330
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,890
Thank you.

331
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,723
Which department are you from?

332
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:54,489
Business department.

333
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,423
Me too.

334
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,723
What a coincidence.

335
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:00,889
Nice to meet you.

336
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,356
Nice to meet you.

337
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,722
- Jiawei, right?
- Yes.

338
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:08,222
I'm the HR manager.

339
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:09,923
I have something to discuss with you.

340
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,189
Can you come out for a moment?

341
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,490
- Sure, no problem.
- Good.

342
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,889
Are you just having instant noodles for dinner?

343
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,055
Yes.

344
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:33,789
I have to visit a client later.

345
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,055
Just eating something quick.

346
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,156
You've worked hard.

347
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,990
You're now the assistant to the vice president.

348
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,490
Are you getting used to it?

349
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,423
It's okay,
the vice president is quite nice to me.

350
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:46,789
Then that's good.

351
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,256
Then, keep it up.

352
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,389
Keep it up.

353
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:56,823
Eat less instant noodles.

354
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,323
It's not good for your health.

Almost done.

360
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,555
You got off work late today too.

361
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,023
Yeah.

362
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,189
Go home and rest early.

363
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,856
Don't stay up too late.

00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:46,592
♫ Usually♫

370
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:51,232
♫ Only folly is what can be picked up
but not let go ♫

371
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:53,184
♫ The appearance of the color ♫

372
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,956
♫ Embracing the shape of bareness ♫

373
00:18:55,956 --> 00:19:01,279
♫ Kind-hearted people
will always feel at ease ♫

374
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:07,590
Originally, I thought her personality

375
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,956
was just like her appearance.

376
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:11,823
That is

377
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,055
somewhat of a delicate girl.

378
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:16,256
But surprisingly, the way she works

379
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,722
is absolutely no less than others.

380
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:20,689
She's a powerful woman.

381
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,923
I'm attracted to her kind of fighting spirit.

382
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,789
Do I look like a manager?

383
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,923
You don't know secretary's work is just

384
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:28,757
to serve tea, deliver water,
and do some unimportant tasks.

385
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:30,423
Is this really what you want to do?

386
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:33,455
I am very strict.

387
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,189
Very much like someone.

388
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,023
Who?

389
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,256
Never mind.

390
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,023
Anyway, now,

391
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:48,189
as long as she's happy,

392
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:52,356
I will be happy with her.

393
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,590
And if she's sad?

394
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,323
I'll be even more anxious than her.

395
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,256
I like her.

396
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:02,923
I just want to give her

397
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:06,490
all the best things in the world.

398
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,023
Return to the original position,

399
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:11,389
and being the head.

400
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,055
Cindy has always been holding onto this hope,

401
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:15,990
and continuously going forward.

402
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,923
What Gao Shuangyun did

403
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,122
is

404
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,189
blocking Cindy's road to revival.

405
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:23,923
Yes.

406
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,619
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

407
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,455
Right.

408
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:35,023
It seems that way.

409
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,823
Anyway, bro.

410
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:38,689
Let me tell you.

411
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,156
In the future, when you meet someone you like,

412
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,256
you must act decisively.

413
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:43,389
Just go for it.

414
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,288
Don't hesitate.

415
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:49,990
Otherwise, in the end, you'll end up like me.

416
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,423
Drinking alone.

417
00:20:55,326 --> 00:21:01,824
♫ Eyes closed, heart beating so fiercely ♫

418
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:08,101
♫ Feeling it once more,
throwing caution to the wind ♫

419
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,823
I feel that

420
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:15,256
I'm probably too late.

421
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:18,122
You have someone you like.

422
00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:21,288
And just like you,

423
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:24,555
I'm too slow to act and got heartbroken.

424
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,990
Come on.

425
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,156
Let's toast this one together.

426
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,512
To heartbreak.

427
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:37,671
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

428
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:42,594
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

429
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:46,413
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

430
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:21,923
- Come on, Yicheng.
- Come on, cheers, drink up.

431
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,656
Do you guys remember Cindy Wang?

432
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:24,923
- Yes.
- Yes, that's right.

433
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:25,990
That company I used to work for,

434
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,156
the really difficult big boss.

435
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:30,555
Let me tell you, I heard
she's been demoted to a secretary.

436
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:32,389
- Really?
- Really?

437
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,455
It's true, I regret it now.

438
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:35,757
I didn't stay a few more days.

439
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:37,389
Otherwise I could have seen her face.

440
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,689
I heard it's very awkward.

441
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:39,823
I guess it should be like this.

442
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:41,789
No!

443
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,089
Is that so?

444
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,089
And, that's an exaggeration.

445
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,990
She's crazy about getting a promotion.

446
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,222
She even bought flowers for herself before.

447
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,423
Then she even said to call me Miss Wang.

448
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:51,956
That's too ridiculous, right?

449
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,423
What ridiculous? You mean losing face, right?

450
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,490
What losing face?

451
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,189
It's shameless.

452
00:22:58,189 --> 00:23:00,189
- Shameless refers to this kind of person.
- Really.

453
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:03,122
Look what it has come to.

454
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:04,923
What for?

455
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:07,555
What are you doing?

456
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,789
What are you doing?

457
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:12,956
What for?

458
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,490
Go ahead, hit me.

459
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,990
No, what are you doing?

460
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:21,156
If you have the nerve to talk nonsense,
then don't be afraid of getting sued.

461
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:22,256
I'll definitely sue you for defamation.

462
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:23,356
Fraud, framing.

463
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:24,523
I'll sue you thoroughly all at once.

464
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:25,689
Do you have a problem?

465
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:27,789
You beat me up like this,
I'm the one who should sue you for assault.

466
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,055
- Go ahead and sue! Come on!
- I want to press additional charges for assault.

467
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:31,722
- Sue me, will you?
- Stop arguing.

468
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,656
- It's him!
- Untie me, I want to hit him.

469
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:34,757
I want to hit you too.

470
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,256
- Stop arguing.
- What do you mean stop?

471
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:37,856
It's all because this lunatic is making noise.

472
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,656
- Who's a lunatic? I'm telling you
- It's you!

473
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:41,122
Admit if you're short,
and stand firm when you get hit.

474
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,757
What getting hit? You really have a problem.

475
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:43,990
I don't know him at all.

476
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,423
- Alright.
- It's nonsensical.

477
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,423
- Of course, you don't know me.
- And you beat me up like this.

478
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:48,089
That's right, you don't know him.

479
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,356
That's because his supervisor
is none other than Cindy Wang.

480
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:51,389
Then that's correct.

481
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,523
- The same demeanor, a face full of arrogance.
- What demeanor?

482
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:54,889
Arrogant, annoying.

483
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:55,923
- Domineering.
- You're the annoying one.

484
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,523
I haven't even kicked you yet, how about that?

485
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,923
- Go ahead and do it.
- I'm going to kick you, come on.

486
00:23:58,923 --> 00:23:59,823
- Let go!
- You hit him, and you hit me too.

487
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:00,722
- Come on!
- What do you think?

488
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,288
- You think you've got long legs.
- Don't.

489
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:03,423
Let go.

490
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,956
Don't kick me.

491
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:06,455
Everyone, stop!

492
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:08,823
Stop it.

493
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,490
Chen.

494
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:29,423
You two, shake hands.

495
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,590
It's you.

496
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,990
Shake hands.

497
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:50,889
Wanting to die for not listening to Chen?

498
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,189
Hurry up!

499
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,356
Hurry.

500
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,990
Shake hands already.

501
00:25:08,856 --> 00:25:11,622
It's settled.

502
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:14,256
The three of you, stand properly.

503
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,356
Salute and say to the officer.

504
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:19,023
- You've worked hard. Come on
- Worked hard.

505
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:21,523
- You've worked hard
- Worked hard.

506
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:23,323
Officer, I'm sorry.

507
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,856
It was just a small misunderstanding.

508
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,990
Now it's all out in the open.

509
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,523
It's alright now, it's settled.

510
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:28,856
Alright, don't do this next time.

511
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:29,990
Okay, I won't.

512
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,189
I won't.

513
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,856
Thank you for your trouble.

514
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:37,323
- You may go now
- Okay, thank you.

515
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,956
Come with me.

516
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:50,523
Chen.

517
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,656
This person just isn't telling the truth.

518
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:55,523
He framed Cindy and won't admit it.

519
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:57,323
It's true that I really dislike her.

520
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,590
But that doesn't mean I would do such a thing.

521
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,856
Something without integrity,
and without a bottom line.

522
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:03,089
Maybe it's you who lacks a bottom line,
lacks integrity.

523
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,656
You just don't dare to admit it.

524
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,323
Alright, or how about this.

525
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:09,523
I swear.

526
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:10,923
If it were me,

527
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:11,956
then I…

528
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,622
I wouldn't be able to hold my head high
for the rest of my life.

529
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:14,889
Make it clear.

530
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:17,023
Big head or small head.

531
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,089
- Fine, just can't raise it.
- Okay.

532
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,156
- The small head is nastier
- Alright.

533
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:21,222
- It's enough
- What now?

534
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:23,656
Stop arguing.

535
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,389
The construction company circle

536
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:31,122
is not too big, and not too small.

537
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,389
If Lu is really lying,

538
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:36,055
then he won't just be unable
to hold his head up for life.

539
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:37,722
He won't be able to get by
in this circle either.

540
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,757
Right or not?

541
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:53,590
Come, one for each person.

542
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,689
Roll it over the bruise and apply it.

543
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:57,889
Just now was really too much of a rush.

544
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:59,956
I didn't have time to buy that boiled egg.

545
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:04,089
Roll this tea egg
over the bruised area and apply it.

546
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,823
Going to the police station isn't a good thing.

547
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,622
Later, peel off that shell
and remember to throw it away.

548
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:08,789
Okay?

549
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,023
Thank you, Chen.

550
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:12,490
Thank you, Chen.

551
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,222
Chen.

552
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:15,523
Thank you for today.

553
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:17,923
Then I'll go first.

554
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,389
Chen.

555
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:31,490
How did you know we were at the police station?

556
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,023
I'm asking you about the Vice President's
itinerary for tomorrow.

557
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:36,956
As a result, you replied to me
in the secretaries' group saying,

558
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:40,889
you are at the police station, talk later.

559
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:41,956
I sent it to the wrong person.

560
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,122
Right.

561
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:45,023
You didn't even tell me
which police station it was.

562
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:47,423
Made me run back and forth to several stations.

563
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:49,222
Finally found you guys.

564
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:51,156
- Sorry.
- Hurry, recall it.

565
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:53,889
Otherwise, I don't know what will happen
in the company tomorrow.

566
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,923
Now only two people have read it.

567
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,622
One is Chen, the other must be Cindy, right?

568
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,622
I'll recall it.

569
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:03,323
It can't be Cindy.

570
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:08,356
She's on a date now,
she won't have time to look.

571
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,590
Zhou, do you need to apply it?

572
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,990
If you're not applying it,
then can I eat it please?

573
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:23,023
I'm really sorry.

574
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,156
It's time for Yi to go to sleep.

575
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:25,356
I'll take her back first.

576
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:27,455
So, as not to disrupt her routine.

577
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,757
No need to be sorry.

578
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:31,455
Children should go to sleep on time anyway.

579
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:33,956
Baby, say goodbye to Auntie.

580
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,656
And also,

581
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:38,455
do you like the hair clip Auntie gave you?

582
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,555
Then what should you say to Auntie?

583
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,256
Thank you, Auntie.

584
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,622
You're welcome.

585
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:46,590
Bye.

586
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,956
Be careful, okay?

587
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:50,023
Come.

588
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:54,156
Come, help daddy hold this, sit down properly.

589
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:56,672
Okay.

590
00:28:56,672 --> 00:28:57,856
Bye.

591
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:00,823
- Drive safely.
- You too, take care.

592
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,256
So,

593
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:13,423
this special person is Director Zhang's

594
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:14,689
daughter.

595
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:15,856
Right.

596
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:18,256
What about the child's mother?

597
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,722
He said he's a single parent.

598
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:21,656
I didn't ask for more details.

599
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:22,923
Okay, then.

600
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:23,956
What happened afterward?

601
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:25,189
Did she give you any attitude?

602
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:27,656
Thinking you're the bad woman
who took her father away.

603
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:30,288
Director Zhang has raised his daughter well.

604
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:34,288
She kept smiling all night.

605
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,122
Kept smiling?

606
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,222
That should mean she's accepted you, right?

607
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:41,689
It was a smile that was awkward yet polite.

608
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:45,256
The kind that sends chills down your spine.

609
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:48,323
Yi is a bit like a little adult.

610
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:51,789
She doesn't wear her emotions
like other kids do.

611
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,856
You know what?

612
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:56,222
Yesterday, she even requested
to spend time alone with me.

613
00:29:56,222 --> 00:29:57,956
Meaning she had something to tell me.

614
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:59,889
Alone time?

615
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,590
That's to keep up her image
in front of her father,

616
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,023
and then to subtly intimidate you.

617
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:05,156
Two-faced.

618
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:06,622
This child, so young.

619
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:08,490
How can she be so cunning?

620
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,656
It's not that terrible.

621
00:30:09,656 --> 00:30:12,256
She's just a little girl.

622
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:13,622
Is that so?

623
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:15,889
Then what did she say to you?

624
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,323
Your daddy shouldn't be able to hear.

625
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:29,089
Say whatever you want to say.

626
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,455
My daddy is handsome,
and my daddy is very rich.

627
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:36,722
My daddy is as handsome as a prince charming.

628
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:38,089
He is quite good-looking.

629
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:41,689
So, I'm the only one he loves the most.

630
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,423
By saying that, you want me
to back off because it's hard.

631
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:44,523
Right?

632
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:48,689
Not bad, you're smarter than the other ladies.

633
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,389
It's okay.

634
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,156
You don't need to waste your time anymore.

635
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:54,455
As long as I don't like you,

636
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:57,288
my daddy won't like you either.

637
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,722
I believe that.

638
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:02,423
Whether your daddy is a prince charming or not,

639
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:03,757
I don't know.

640
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:06,189
But I only believe in one thing.

641
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:07,757
What thing?

642
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:10,222
As long as you meet with me three times,

643
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:12,389
we'll definitely become good friends.

644
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:15,189
I don't believe it.

645
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:17,856
Do you want to make a bet?

646
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:23,288
Okay, if we're betting, let's bet.

647
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:29,823
Don't you think things are moving
too fast with Director Zhang?

648
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:32,622
Why would you still
want to bet with someone's daughter?

649
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,455
Can't help it,
the little girl is challenging me.

650
00:31:34,455 --> 00:31:37,789
It just stirs up my competitive spirit.

651
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,656
Wang Cunfeng.

652
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:43,856
- You're really serious.
- Where?

653
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,222
She's just a little girl.

654
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:46,523
And you want to compete with her.

655
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:47,956
What's that about?

656
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:49,555
I can't just back down

657
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:52,189
because his daughter says so.

658
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:55,423
It wouldn't be fair to Director Zhang.

659
00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:57,222
So, you do like him.

660
00:31:57,222 --> 00:32:00,323
And that's why you want
to win over his daughter.

661
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:02,356
Zhang Shiping's conditions

662
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,523
are not bad, indeed.

663
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,122
It's okay.

664
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,490
It's okay?

665
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,823
It's more than okay, alright?

666
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:12,555
That face…

667
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,856
What about him?

668
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:15,455
He's not here.

669
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:17,490
Never mind, I was originally thinking
of catching a ride with him.

670
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,923
To let him make some money.

671
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:20,222
If he's not here, the let's just go ourselves.

672
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:22,256
Let's go.

673
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,956
Don't move.

674
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,823
Don't move, okay?

675
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,023
Is it done yet?

676
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:33,023
It's pretty good.

677
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:35,023
Done.

678
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:37,222
Take a look.

679
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:43,389
Why did you draw it like this?
How can I go out like this?

680
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:45,423
- Then…
- You don't have to mention Cindy.

681
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,423
Everyone in the company who sees me

682
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,490
will probably think I'm going
to perform for them.

683
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,956
- Seems like it…
- Redo it.

684
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:53,789
- Redo it.
- You must redo it.

685
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:54,956
I'll look for another video in a bit.

686
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,455
Absolutely no problem.

687
00:32:56,455 --> 00:32:57,889
Believe me.

688
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,323
You go remove your makeup, be good.

689
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:01,389
Bro.

690
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:02,555
I found a new video.

691
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:05,389
Definitely better than just now.

692
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,189
- This one…
- It's worse than just now.

693
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:09,256
Don't worry,
this video is specifically for teaching

694
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,956
how to cover dark circles.

695
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,055
There shouldn't be a problem.

696
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:14,222
Okay, I trust you.

697
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:15,856
I also believe in myself.

698
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,823
It's fine, come over here.

699
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:20,156
Come here;

700
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,490
It's true that I really dislike her;

701
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,689
But that doesn't mean I would do such a thing.

702
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:31,389
Something without integrity,
and without a bottom line.

703
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:35,222
If it's not Lu Yicheng,

704
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,956
then why would Vice President Han
accuse Lu Yicheng?

705
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:41,622
Unless,

706
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:45,622
Vice President Han is the real culprit
behind the scenes.

707
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:46,622
Don't move.

708
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,923
Zhou.

709
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:53,789
It's okay.

710
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,089
How is it?

711
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:57,256
Don't worry.

712
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,288
It will definitely work this time.

713
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:00,490
It was my fault, my mistake.

714
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,722
I guarantee this time

715
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:03,889
absolutely no one will find out.

716
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:05,957
Good.

717
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:12,023
If Vice President Han is the real murderer,

718
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:15,456
then could Zhou be an accomplice?

719
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,422
What's the matter?

720
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:20,023
It's almost done, trust me.

721
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:22,255
No problem, come here.

722
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,756
Don't move, it's almost ready.

723
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:27,222
Really, you believe me, trust me,
there's absolutely no problem.

724
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:48,957
Director Zhang.

725
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:50,957
You're really a nice person.

726
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:54,589
Originally, you could have enjoyed
a world for two.

727
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,189
But you're willing to give me a ride like this,

728
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:59,055
and letting me be the third wheel here.

729
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,055
Don't say that.

730
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:04,289
Cindy's friends are my friends too.

731
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:09,289
You didn't get back too late yesterday,
did you?

732
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:12,889
You probably made it in time
for Yi's bedtime, right?

733
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:14,456
The timing was just right.

734
00:35:14,456 --> 00:35:16,289
Letting her take a bath.

735
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:20,255
Before bed, I could still tell her a story.

736
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:22,756
That's good.

737
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,289
I…

738
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,323
Yi's attitude towards you
wasn't very good yesterday.

739
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:32,289
I apologize to you on her behalf.

740
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:35,756
This child has been without
a mother since a young age.

741
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,856
And I have been busy with work.

742
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,490
I might have spoiled her a bit.

743
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,922
I hope you won't hold it against her.

744
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:44,589
Of course not.

745
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:45,957
For her,

746
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:48,222
it's me who intruded into your world,
after all.

747
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:50,856
It's normal for her to be a bit resistant.

748
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,790
So…

749
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,922
May I ask,

750
00:35:53,922 --> 00:35:57,656
what you all talked about yesterday?

751
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,156
Didn't you ask her?

752
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:01,456
I did.

753
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:04,156
But she wouldn't say.

754
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:07,922
Well, if she doesn't want to say,

755
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:10,289
then it's a secret between her and me.

756
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,456
Anyway, when you go out on a date,

757
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:15,289
just remember to bring her along.

758
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:17,823
I thought you were going to tell me

759
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:19,722
that you need some time

760
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:23,490
to reconsider our relationship.

761
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:27,055
Right.

762
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:28,422
Honestly,

763
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,990
when I first found out that you had a child,

764
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,123
- I was really surprised, too.
- Chen Duomi.

765
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,790
It's not that having a child is a bad thing.

766
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,088
It's just…

767
00:36:37,088 --> 00:36:38,123
Normally, if a woman finds out

768
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:39,589
that her partner has a child,

769
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:41,790
then she would want to run away.

770
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,722
Who would be like our Cindy.

771
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:44,990
So generous.

772
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,623
So understanding of the bigger picture.

773
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:47,990
Completely accepting.

774
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,088
You could even say she's

775
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,689
perfect.

776
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:52,922

777
00:36:52,922 --> 00:36:54,289
at the intersection ahead later

778
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,656
- That quick?
- She's arrived.

779
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:57,689
- She has to run some errands at the bank.
- No.

780
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,656
- You can stop somewhere here.
- No.

781
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:01,023
- Just parking will do.
- Isn't that too serious?

Why did Fang Iris come so early?

785

And what's she doing going
into the Mr. Cai's office?

786
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:50,289
If she has something for Mr. Cai,

787
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:53,523
then couldn't she just leave it on Chen's desk?

788
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:33,088
Baby, this smart garment

789
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:34,889
is wearable for both exercise and going out.

Morning.

800
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,422
I went to ring your doorbell today.

801
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:17,856
But it seems like you weren't home.

802
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,389
How come you arrived later than me?

803
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:20,389

No way.

You couldn't have been playing video games
all night without sleep, could you?

If you find out the boss has a mistress,

827
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:35,922
then should we stop it?

828
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:38,589
Or should we pretend to be unaware?

829
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:41,289
It's really just an 'if'.

830
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:46,689

Why are you here? Miss me?

842
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:27,023
I went to see Mr. Xi.

843
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,623
And then?

844
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:38,523
He said you were right about everything.

845
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:40,055
Told me not to overthink it.

846
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:43,023
Just keep quiet.

847
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,689
I told you.

00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:49,889
How could I possibly do that?

850
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:54,255
But I also went to that brokerage company.

851
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:55,422
I told the company's accountant

852
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:57,689
that the amount of the remittance
is a bit large.

853
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,856
I asked him for a different account.

854
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:02,922
Guess what happened.

855
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,790
It wasn't just Mr. Xi's account in there.

856
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,922
There was yours too.

857
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:10,389

858
00:42:13,456 --> 00:42:15,289
Right.

859
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,656
- Yes, my account is there.
- You…

860

861
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:24,055
What do you mean?

862
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:26,356
Just like the reason you gave
to the other party.

863
00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:28,356
Mr. Xi was afraid such a large amount

864
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:30,055
going into one account would raise suspicion.

865
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:32,689
I suggested he use Manager Guo
from their company as the nominee.

866
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:34,289
He said it's not good to use someone
from the company.

867
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,088
And among outsiders he only trusts me.

How was I supposed to refuse?

871
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,422

He could take the project away at any time.

873
00:42:45,823 --> 00:42:48,922

as a manager felt very empty,

00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,187
♫ Because of you ♫

910
00:44:57,187 --> 00:45:03,102
♫ I'm no longer afraid
of loneliness and solitude ♫
