00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.199
Chen, you're really strong.

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:13.867
You know everything,
truly a veteran of the company.

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.199
Of course.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.432
So, when you mentioned
the vice president was cheating,

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:24.733
I thought, I clearly
remember him getting married.

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.233
But I never heard any news about him getting divorced, right?

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:33.265
So, I immediately went back to look for that wedding invitation file and the address book.

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:36.133
And that's how I found Mrs. Han.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.933
It's Gao Shuangyun.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.633
The secret weapon worked, it worked.

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:48.266
Hello, Miss Gao.

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.466
If you're free, come over to my place.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:59.800
If you don't have anything
important to do today,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.440
then do you want to rest at home for the day?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.532
I'll contact you later.

00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:04.467
No, you…

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.966
Okay, bye.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:13.500
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.065
I think she must be very upset right now.

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:20.484
Do you want to go see her first?

00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:23.332
What do you mean? Shouldn't we clear up this matter as soon as possible?

00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:24.433
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.500
The secret weapon we found with so much effort.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.533
What are you doing now?

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:33.033
No, I just think if this matter were to be exposed just like that,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.733
Gao Shuangyun might also get implicated.

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:39.599
Although she is an accomplice, she's also a victim.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.266
Yes, that's true.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:45.899
So, I'm thinking if there's a way to punish Han Xinzheng,

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.499
and yet protect Gao Shuangyun.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.767
What way?

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.533
Someone is coming.

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.733
You're very annoying.

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.033
What's wrong?

00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:28.199
Is it because the case
I gave you is too boring,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.833
or I myself am too uninteresting?

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:32.500
It's not challenging, and not fun anymore?

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.966
No, it's because I feel troubled
by some things.

00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:42.700
Can I tell you about it?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.766
Of course,
I'd be happy to be your AI processor.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:51.366
But it's the user pays, you know.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.367
Then how much do I have to pay?

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.032
You tell me your troubles first.

00:03:57.032 --> 00:03:59.033
I'll assess and see.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.232
Haven't I told you before

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:05.966
that I'm waiting for a key piece of evidence
to clear my name?

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:11.267
What's complicated right now is there's someone I want to punish,

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:14.032
but there's another person I want to protect.

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:16.032
I don't know what to do.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000

00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:40.467
- Sold like hotcakes.
- Awesome.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:41.799
Nice!

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.566
Honestly speaking. Please, it's a hassle.

00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:49.432

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:52.399

Manager, Director Chen and Manager Zhang. I'm really sorry.

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:21.767
Whenever our manager gets drunk, he just wants to rest.

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:23.667
Careful, Manager.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.767
Then, Secretary Li, please take good care of your boss.

00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:27.899
Okay.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.400
Tianfu, let's plan for next time then.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.299
- Next time, definitely next time.
- Next time.

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:33.433
- Next time.
- No flaking, okay?

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:34.933
- Okay, bye.
- Definitely next time.

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.200
- Next time.
- Bye.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.165
I'll be waiting for you.

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:39.770
Careful,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.400
Manager.

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:48.556
Manager.

Thank you.

00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:12.566
Luckily we had a great understanding just now,
working perfectly together.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.500
Otherwise, we would have been
dragged to the bar to continue.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.200
I would certainly end up paying
and playing the fool.

00:06:18.432 --> 00:06:21.265
It's really so lucky
to always have you by my side.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.632
You truly are

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:28.899
the strongest secretary in my heart.

00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:40.299
<i>So, I'm still just a secretary to Tianfu.</i>

00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:15.099
Setting up a game so early?

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:16.967
Are you like me, an old person,

00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:19.466
who can't sleep at night?

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:22.065
Playing in the dark is the only way
to show true skills, isn't it?

00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:24.532
You can tell where the ball will land
even with your eyes closed.

00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:27.299
Doesn't that resemble running a company?

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:31.399
Where you don't have to get hands-on
to grasp every movement.

00:07:32.532 --> 00:07:35.333
You're so young and yet you're telling me
these profound truths.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:36.834
Don't tell me you're the same as me.

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:39.900
Sending good morning images upon waking up.

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:46.316
Are you sure you can control the direction
of every ball though?

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:54.632
Good shot.

00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:16.932
You're here.

00:08:16.932 --> 00:08:18.699
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:21.633
You haven't eaten yet, have you? I brought you breakfast.

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:25.766
I'm such a lucky man.

00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:32.834
There are mosquitoes.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.132
Did you hit it?

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:40.434
It seems to have flown away just now.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.967
Is your home's keycode lock
set to your ex-wife's birthday?

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:01.500
Change it.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.832
Okay, I'll changed it.

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:13.733
I think it's not just the keycode lock
that needs changing.

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:21.434
Might as well change the house too.

00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:25.167
So, the house needs to be changed too?

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:28.565
It was okay not knowing before.

00:09:29.233 --> 00:09:31.734
But knowing about your ex-wife,

00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:34.599
there's always going to be a knot in my heart.

00:09:36.933 --> 00:09:41.166
Actually, I really don't want
to come here again.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.466
Why not just sell the house?

00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:51.900
Or you could move in and live with me,
that's also fine.

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.666
How about it?

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:58.500
Please.

00:10:03.032 --> 00:10:06.667
Alright, I'll do as you say.

00:10:07.366 --> 00:10:09.666
Just right, if the house sells smoothly,

00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:12.200
the money could help pay off your mortgage.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.966
Hurry up and have breakfast. Otherwise, you'll be late.

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:18.332
I'll get the utensils. Have you eaten?

00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:20.067
I've eaten already.

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:44.552
Good morning, Mr. Cai.
- What a coincidence.

00:10:44.552 --> 00:10:46.476
Good morning.
- You look refreshed and energized.

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:48.199
You caught an 'eagle' while playing ball
this morning, didn't you?

00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:49.599
Since when did you learn fortune-telling?

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:51.466
No, I've been working for you for so long.

00:10:51.466 --> 00:10:54.565
It's deduced according to your skill level. Right?

00:10:54.565 --> 00:10:56.967
So, what are your thoughts? Go ahead and speak.

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:58.348
Okay.

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.567
Mr. Cai, it's like this…

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:07.965
- Chen.
- Good morning.

00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:09.432
Morning.

00:11:10.534 --> 00:11:11.999
This is the tea I've made.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:13.966
You take it to the boss to try.

00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:17.199
How did you know I was coming
to make tea at this time?

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:19.999
I misspoke, what I mean to say

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:22.600
is this pot I've brewed beforehand can be given to the boss first.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.233
Let me tell you, this is top-grade
Red Jade tea from Sun Moon Lake.

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:29.300
Its taste has hints of cinnamon and mint.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.933
It's refreshing and has a sweet aftertaste.

00:11:31.933 --> 00:11:33.500
Let Mr. Cai give it a try.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.428
Sounds pretty good.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:36.612
Then I'll let him try it.

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.099
Okay.

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:39.933
What about Manager Wu's tea?

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:42.332
No worries, I'll brew it again.

00:11:42.332 --> 00:11:43.433
Okay, then thank you.

00:11:43.433 --> 00:11:45.932
Don't mention it.

00:11:45.932 --> 00:11:48.000
Take care, Chen.

00:11:55.324 --> 00:11:58.000
I wasn't here these few days. Is there any big news at the company?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.690
No, all departments are performing
their duties and operating normally.

00:12:03.565 --> 00:12:05.933
This isn't the tea I usually drink, is it?

00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:07.767
Why did you suddenly change the tea on me?

00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:08.734
The taste is quite good.

00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:12.100
This tea was specially brewed for you
by Secretary Li from the Planning Department.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.834
She said this tea is refreshing and mellow.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.867
She wanted you to try it.

00:12:16.867 --> 00:12:20.800
It seems that our colleagues in the Planning Department are all full of enthusiasm.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.366
Very good, keep it up.

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:25.500
Come on, is there anything else to review or to sign?
- Okay, let's see.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.120
This is the performance report
of all departments for this month.

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:31.734
What about the development plan
for Changyi Assets?

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:34.699
We have already fixed a time with the other party to discuss further.

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:37.800
We are currently in the phase
of site preparation and survey.

00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:41.933
For Landscape Development, we plan

00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:43.933
to combine it with the construction project in Zhonglu C District

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:45.699
to create a landmark for the special zone.

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:49.420
Then we'll introduce
five-star property services.

00:12:50.634 --> 00:12:54.800
Excellent, our company's products
must be the best.

00:12:57.666 --> 00:12:59.634
Vice President, it's the real estate agent.

00:12:59.634 --> 00:13:01.300
Go ahead and get busy.

00:13:10.066 --> 00:13:12.000
Vice President, Manager,
I'll go and get busy too.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.099
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:14.232
Come on.

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:18.266
Thank you.

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:20.933
Yes.

00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:29.700
With Zhou by my side, I always feel uneasy inside.

00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:31.566
You don't need to worry.

00:13:31.566 --> 00:13:33.700
They don't have any evidence.

00:13:35.232 --> 00:13:38.032
I need to find a way to get rid of him.

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:42.933
Even if you want to get rid of him,
you need a legitimate reason.

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:46.534
Besides, you still have so many trivial matters
to deal with.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.034
Don't rush, take it slow.

00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:05.032
- Director Zhang. 
 - Vice President Han.

00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:07.832
You're here for a Mr. Lu's wedding banquet too?

00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:09.433
Mr. Lu has a wide circle of friends.

00:14:09.433 --> 00:14:11.367
Besides, his second son is getting married.

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:13.760
Of course, I have to come and congratulate him.

00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:15.733
You also keep it up.

00:14:15.733 --> 00:14:18.500
When will you marry Cindy from our company?

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.032
I'll definitely give you a big red envelope.

00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:22.732
I'll work hard.

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:25.032
Marry earlier.

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:28.366
To have someone to look after
each other at work or in life.

00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:31.899
And it's also a security for Cindy.

00:14:32.932 --> 00:14:35.767
Rest assured, even if Cindy is still single,

00:14:35.767 --> 00:14:38.900
her work ability already surpasses many people.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.499
Of course, I know that.

00:14:40.499 --> 00:14:43.867
But just imagine, after getting off work,

00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:47.499
having your other half at home,
having cooked dinner waiting for your return.

00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:49.632
What a blissful scene that would be.

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:57.152
Vice President Han. You're so eager to promote Cindy.

00:14:57.152 --> 00:15:00.400
Are you afraid that her excellence
will steal your position?

00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:04.466
Or do you have some dirt about her?

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:09.832
What dirt could there be?

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.532
I'll go in first, we'll talk later.

00:15:12.532 --> 00:15:14.066
See you later.

00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:16.100
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

00:15:22.534 --> 00:15:25.433
Are you serious? They agreed so quickly?

00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:26.966
I can hardly believe it myself.

00:15:26.966 --> 00:15:28.499
I have been a real estate agent
for over a decade.

00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:31.999
It's the first time I've encountered a client
who didn't even bargain.

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:34.400
Absolutely no bargaining.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.199
No need to arrange a meeting either.

00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:38.032
The client said to leave it all to us.

00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:40.968
We'll represent and sign the contract with you.

00:15:40.968 --> 00:15:43.267
- Please, go ahead. 
 - Thank you.

00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:49.767
What's wrong? Are you afraid of a scam?

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:52.766
Mr. Han, rest assured.

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:54.199
Our company and your construction company

00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:55.699
have been working together for so many years.

00:15:55.699 --> 00:15:57.467
And we are considered leaders in the industry.

00:15:57.467 --> 00:16:01.000
Our credit is quite good. It couldn't be a scam.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.800
That's not what I meant.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.867
I just meant to say,

00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:07.299
that how did the buyer agree so quickly?

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.667
Because the buyer has a special affection for this area.

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:13.099
Moreover, Mr. Han,
the condition of your house is so good.

00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:15.832
That's why he wanted to buy it quickly.

00:16:18.232 --> 00:16:21.699
You just said that the other party
is willing to buy in cash at one time.

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:24.000
That's right, pay in full at once.

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:28.467
The other party is willing
to buy at our asking price.

00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:29.900
And it's in cash too.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.899
I think it's very acceptable.

00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:42.244
Then let's sign the contract.
- Okay, come on.

00:16:42.244 --> 00:16:44.232
Please take a look here.

00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:49.232
If there are no issues, then just sign your name at the end here for me.

00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:52.832
I'll continue to handle the follow-up for you.

00:16:52.832 --> 00:16:54.666
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.066
Vice President Han, I want to confirm
one more thing with you.

00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.967
About the proceeds from the house sale,

00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:03.932
are they to be directly transferred
into Miss Gao's account?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.534
I think some people are already suspicious.

00:17:09.534 --> 00:17:13.233
If the house is sold, it's not a small amount.

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:14.867
I think in the short term,

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.467
it's better not to have large fund movements in your account.

00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:20.200
What do you think?

00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:37.466
Okay, I understand.

00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:44.133
Thank you.

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:24.199
I heard you're the busiest in your department.

00:18:24.199 --> 00:18:26.133
The capable are always busy.

00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:32.200
Keep it up, I have high hopes for you.

00:18:36.704 --> 00:18:38.800
He didn't wash his hands.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.499
You need to be careful with Wu Tianfu.

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:45.999
Don't make that face. Let me tell you.

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:49.140
Let me tell you. The capable aren't just overworked,

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.990
they're excessively overworked.

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:54.533
Understand? Learn from this.

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:00.467
Why don't they wash their hands?
That's so gross.

00:19:01.633 --> 00:19:03.499
This shirt is still new, you know.

00:19:03.499 --> 00:19:07.100
Is there alcohol? Alcohol?

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.466
Here.

00:19:11.466 --> 00:19:12.970
Yun.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.960
urology. Why do we need to come here?

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:20.100
First answer me one question.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.200
Do you want to have children?

00:19:23.534 --> 00:19:25.500
Yun.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.733
I think the two of us are fine as we are now.

00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:31.432
Besides, I'm already at this age.

00:19:31.432 --> 00:19:32.999
If we really want to have children,

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:36.666
then I think we can discuss it further.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.233
Don't be nervous.

00:19:39.233 --> 00:19:41.567
I don't want to have children either.

00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:45.099
But you're about to move into my place.

00:19:45.099 --> 00:19:48.133
I'm afraid that over time,
an accident might happen.

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:52.866
Accidentally…
- So, every time I use protection.

00:19:52.866 --> 00:19:56.100
But since we are already in agreement in not wanting to have children,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.566
then why don't you just get
a vasectomy and be done with it?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.666
I get a vasectomy?

00:20:03.532 --> 00:20:07.666
Or do you really want me
to go through the surgery.

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:10.633
Yun, it's not that…

00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:12.766
Come straight here to get a vasectomy.

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:14.932
I think maybe
we should think it over a bit more.

00:20:14.932 --> 00:20:19.166
Besides, I've heard it's quite painful.

00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:23.199
Alright then, I'll take some special leave
to get the surgery done

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:24.900
Yun.

00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:34.300
Don't be nervous.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.233
The doctor said the surgery will take roughly about half an hour to complete.

00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:40.066
And you'll have local anesthesia.

00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:41.999
It won't be very painful.

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:44.799
Okay. Sign this, please.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.733
What's this?

00:20:48.733 --> 00:20:50.633
Consent form.

00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:52.867
Sign here.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.333
Yun, will you wait for me outside?

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:02.640
Of course,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.900
I'll definitely be there at such an important moment.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.066
You'll see me in just a moment.

00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:11.533
Then I'll go out and wait for you.

00:21:11.533 --> 00:21:13.000
Okay.

00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:34.133
Mr. Han. I'm going to give you an anesthetic injection now.

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:38.800
Where will the anesthesia be administered?

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.566
Sir, you weren't listening when the doctor
was speaking just now.

00:21:43.566 --> 00:21:48.367
It's going to be directly inserted into

00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:50.312
your testicles there.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.499
Tes… Sorry.

00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:00.267
I didn't hear the doctor say that.

00:22:00.267 --> 00:22:03.700
Anyway, it's going to be inserted
from the inside of your thigh.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.200
Close to the scrotum.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.432
Sir, don't be nervous.

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:10.100
I'm not nervous.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.933
Why do you have to hold me down?

00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:13.332
If we don't hold you down,

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:16.267
then what should we do if you move around later, or I insert it in the wrong place?

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:18.399
Insert it wrong?

00:22:18.399 --> 00:22:19.900
Isn't it possible to insert it wrong?

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.699
Let's start.

00:22:35.533 --> 00:22:37.233
Good shot.

00:22:37.966 --> 00:22:39.332
It's your turn now.

00:22:39.332 --> 00:22:41.032
No problem.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.200
Thank you,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.000
everything is going
according to your script now.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.734
But Gao Shuangyun doesn't feel that she can get away perfectly.

00:22:50.734 --> 00:22:54.000
She feels that she herself
should receive some punishment.

00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:57.499
It had never crossed my mind
when I was fighting with her before.

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:59.966
She is such an upright person.

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:03.065
However, it bothers me that you have
to spend so much money on buying a house.

00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:04.666
I feel a bit guilty.

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.967
Even though there is a saying
that a loss may turn out to be a gain.

00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:08.866
This phrase is somewhat cliché.

00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:12.232
But for you, it's well worth it.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.000
You see, this is the result
of not being focused enough.

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:28.367
Because your swing stability
is not yet sufficient.

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:30.300
Come on, get set.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.432
Swing up easily.

00:23:32.432 --> 00:23:34.100
Good, very nice.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.267
Always remember to power through
with your lower body.

00:23:37.267 --> 00:23:40.733
Start with the waist.

00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:43.900
Then the hips, legs,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.332
and finally up to the chest cavity.

00:23:46.332 --> 00:23:48.800
Align your target
with the direction of your ball.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.533
This will make it much easier.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:53.533
Also, I've noticed something.

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:55.866
It's your stance.

00:23:55.866 --> 00:23:57.800
It's too narrow, you can stand a bit wider.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.366
Come on, wider.

00:24:00.032 --> 00:24:03.999
Many people think that the stance should be as wide as the shoulders.

00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:06.199
In fact…

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.265
I've found that golf

00:24:08.265 --> 00:24:11.532
is really a very women-friendly sport.

00:24:11.532 --> 00:24:14.766
It can make men willingly submit to you.

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:22.633
I think I can submit to you without golf.

00:24:23.367 --> 00:24:25.960
You never thought that I pretended not to know

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.260
so that you would come close to teach me?

00:24:29.833 --> 00:24:32.200
So, I've been tricked?

00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:34.900
What do you think?

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.960
♫ ♫

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.260
♫ ♫

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:02.366
Dear.

00:25:03.666 --> 00:25:08.000
Why are you wearing this now?

00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:15.634
No, the doctor said I must behave for a month.

00:25:15.634 --> 00:25:17.634
At the earliest, it would take two weeks.

00:25:17.634 --> 00:25:18.833
I can't think about these things.

00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:21.150
Stay calm, calm.

00:25:25.432 --> 00:25:28.033
I'm dressed like this

00:25:29.866 --> 00:25:31.867
is just to…

00:25:33.266 --> 00:25:35.233
To do what?

00:25:36.633 --> 00:25:38.500
What do you want to do?

00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:46.366
Take this and do some cleaning.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.066
Why are you dressed like that to clean at home?

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.434
This way, I won't sweat.

00:26:26.499 --> 00:26:28.799
I can't take it anymore.

00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:33.067
- Thank you
- Thank you.

00:26:35.733 --> 00:26:38.566
Are you really going to stay in a hotel?

00:26:38.566 --> 00:26:40.332
If I continue to live at home,

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:44.199
I'm afraid I'll have serious insomnia.

00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:48.233
Remember to apply ice and ointment.

00:26:48.233 --> 00:26:51.733
If it really hurts, take painkillers.

00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:53.666
I understand.

00:26:53.666 --> 00:26:55.667
Or I can go up with you?

00:26:56.432 --> 00:26:59.200
No need, I can go up by myself.

00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:03.066
See you at the company tomorrow.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.532
Good night.

00:27:05.532 --> 00:27:06.960
Bye.

00:27:28.932 --> 00:27:30.099
Vice President, hello.

00:27:30.099 --> 00:27:33.028
Meng Heng, I've called for your car.

00:27:33.028 --> 00:27:33.966
Yes, that's right.

00:27:33.966 --> 00:27:35.432
You have a part-time job driving?

00:27:35.432 --> 00:27:36.933
Yes.

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:39.500
But Vice President,
why are you staying at a hotel?

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.299
And you need to call for a car?

00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:44.634
I'm not feeling well, had a minor surgery.

00:27:44.634 --> 00:27:47.133
Staying at a hotel is more convenient.

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:48.932
You've worked hard.

00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:53.250
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.332
You're good, even know how to earn
extra money with part-time jobs.

00:27:56.332 --> 00:27:58.300
Yes, closing now.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.892
Okay.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.500
Unlike you,
earning all that unscrupulous money.

00:28:08.566 --> 00:28:10.304
- Vice President, do you need help?
- No, it's fine.

00:28:10.304 --> 00:28:11.300
- Really?
- Yes.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.348
- Is it okay?
- Thank you.

00:28:12.348 --> 00:28:13.772
Okay.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.128
Vice President Han's walk looks strange.

00:28:20.128 --> 00:28:21.200
I don't know.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.967
Maybe he stubbed his toe,
his foot must be hurting.

00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:26.467
Doesn't look like a foot pain. Looks more like, I don't know…

00:28:26.467 --> 00:28:28.467
- Where?
- I'll go get the package first.

00:28:32.766 --> 00:28:36.800
Vice President Han's silhouette seems to be having such bad luck today.

00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:38.666
Feels like something big is going to happen.

00:28:38.666 --> 00:28:40.966
I feel that way too.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.767
Come in.

00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:58.133
Vice President,
here's the ice pack you asked for.

00:29:00.165 --> 00:29:02.367
Vice President, is there somewhere
you're not feeling well?

00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:04.500
Is there anything I can help with?

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:07.766
It's nothing, I just twisted my hand
by accident yesterday.

00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:09.866
Just need to ice it a little bit
and it'll be fine.

00:29:10.367 --> 00:29:11.600
You go ahead with your work.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.633
Then take good care of yourself.

00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:26.400
Oh, right, Vice President, no…

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:34.133
My hand just slipped a moment ago.

00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:37.232
The boss said when you're free,

00:29:37.232 --> 00:29:40.200
go up and see him.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.066
Okay, I know.

00:29:42.066 --> 00:29:44.900
Then, take good care of yourself.

00:29:56.555 --> 00:30:00.068
<i>[Deputy General Manager's Office]</i>

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.432
Why hasn't Chen called yet?

00:30:04.432 --> 00:30:06.900
Does Mr. Cai really know?

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.433
Chen said that Mr. Cai
was going to handle it half an hour ago.

00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:14.600
Pick up.

00:30:16.133 --> 00:30:17.599
Hello?

00:30:19.332 --> 00:30:23.166
Understood, thank you, Chen.

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:41.367
Come in.

00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:50.800
Chen notified us, it's time to go up.

00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:56.265
What must be faced, must be faced.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.934
Let's go.

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:06.900
I think it's better if I go up alone.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.367
Keep some good impressions
of Vice President Han.

00:31:12.767 --> 00:31:14.833
I'm also at fault for this matter.

00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:17.266
I must go and face the consequences.

00:31:18.233 --> 00:31:22.332
For your part, I'll ask the boss
to handle it separately.

00:31:22.332 --> 00:31:25.699
Don't go, lest it upsets you.

00:31:46.534 --> 00:31:48.799
Let's put an end to this.

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:10.666
Yes, everything is coming to an end.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.532
This brief journey
will eventually come full circle.

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:20.466
All my efforts

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.733
will ultimately be in vain.

00:32:36.707 --> 00:32:40.196
<i>[General Manager's Office]</i>

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.800
Mr. Cai.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.332
Have a seat.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.120
I'll get straight to the point,

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.630
Chen.

00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:13.133
I, Han Xinzheng,

00:33:13.133 --> 00:33:15.400
have used my power and unequal relationships

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.467
to coerce Miss Gao Shuangyun

00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:20.166
into helping cover up
corruption and criminal facts.

00:33:20.166 --> 00:33:22.165
Wait a minute, Chen.

00:33:22.165 --> 00:33:24.500
What is this?

00:33:25.366 --> 00:33:28.133
This is the confession you signed.

00:33:30.699 --> 00:33:34.533
Mr. Cai, I've never signed anything like this.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.733
Mr. Cai, could there be
some misunderstanding here?

00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:52.200
If you have no way to refute,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.499
then I'll take it as your tacit admission.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.833
Cindy.

00:33:57.833 --> 00:34:01.666
Vice President Han, if you forget
that you signed a criminal confession,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.000
then you should remember this.

00:34:12.033 --> 00:34:13.432
That's just a normal suitcase.

00:34:13.432 --> 00:34:14.833
Don't they all look the same?

00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:16.366
What should I remember?

00:34:16.366 --> 00:34:19.200
This is what you had Miss Gao
take out from your house.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.200
Yun,

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.290
she teamed up with you to set me up?

00:34:32.932 --> 00:34:34.433
The company's accounting department,

00:34:34.433 --> 00:34:37.033
worked overtime for several days
auditing the accounts,

00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:40.266
and found that you really took
quite a bit of the company's money.

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:44.132
Moreover, you set a trap for embezzlement

00:34:44.132 --> 00:34:48.600
dragging Cindy down, and let Yun become the manager.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.232
Do you want me to continue?

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.166
Han, if you're short of money, you can tell me.

00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:02.700
Why would you do such a dirty thing?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.533
Mr. Cai, I'm sorry.

00:35:06.232 --> 00:35:09.600
This isn't something that can be resolved
with a simple apology.

00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:14.565
However, considering you've worked so hard
for the company for so many years,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.633
hurry up and go through
the resignation procedures.

00:35:17.633 --> 00:35:20.800
As long as you reimburse the public funds
within the period I specify,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.733
I won't make you pay extra compensation.

00:35:23.733 --> 00:35:27.940
But you should hire a lawyer
and get ready for the lawsuit.

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:39.199
Vice President Han.

00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:46.065
I'm really not happy
to let you go just like that.

00:35:46.065 --> 00:35:47.866
Cindy, what are you doing?

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.332
I originally wanted to punch you a few times.

00:35:53.332 --> 00:35:56.999
Considering you have also lost a lot. I'll just let it be.

00:35:57.633 --> 00:36:00.833
But please, don't let me see you again.

00:36:11.133 --> 00:36:13.199
Cindy, what are you doing?

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:15.965
You look especially handsome today.

00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:18.100
Isn't that right, Chen?

00:36:21.767 --> 00:36:23.432
Especially handsome.

00:36:32.966 --> 00:36:34.500
Vice President,

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.834
thank you for your care over these years.

00:36:37.834 --> 00:36:41.233
You have taught me many things at work.

00:36:41.233 --> 00:36:44.500
I hope everything goes well
for you in the future.

00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:50.132
I'm no longer your Vice President.

00:36:50.132 --> 00:36:52.367
You don't have to call me that anymore.

00:36:55.132 --> 00:36:58.312
From now on, let's both do our best.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.300
Vice President, take care.

00:37:53.533 --> 00:37:55.633
Why did you betray me?

00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:57.466
Haven't I been good enough to you?

00:37:58.734 --> 00:38:01.333
Then why did you deceive me?

00:38:02.766 --> 00:38:04.599
I've given you many chances.

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:07.200
You've never come clean.

00:38:09.132 --> 00:38:11.466
What have I deceived you about?

00:38:11.466 --> 00:38:13.500
What haven't I been honest about?

00:38:15.299 --> 00:38:18.466
I've met your so-called ex-wife.

00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:24.965
She showed me the evidence.

00:38:24.965 --> 00:38:28.333
That's right, you two
are divorced in the United States.

00:38:28.333 --> 00:38:31.566
But in Taiwan, you're still legally married.

00:38:32.699 --> 00:38:35.199
Thank you for making me the third woman.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.633
I've sent the things you left at my place to your hotel.

00:38:41.633 --> 00:38:43.432
What do you mean?

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.399
Are you breaking up with me now?

00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:49.799
Do we have any reason
to continue being together?

00:38:49.799 --> 00:38:52.032
So, you don't love me anymore?

00:38:52.032 --> 00:38:54.932
It's because I loved you too much
that I was foolish.

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:58.233
That's why I kept covering for you
over and over again.

00:38:58.233 --> 00:39:00.432
Do you think you're the only one
who's sacrificed?

00:39:00.432 --> 00:39:02.600
I listened to you and sold the house.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.000
You made all the decisions.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.299
I even got a vasectomy.

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:10.867
You even teamed up with Cindy to mess with me.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.433
You getting a vasectomy, wasn't it because you didn't want to have children?

00:39:18.866 --> 00:39:23.133
I transferred half of the money
from the house to your legal wife.

00:39:23.133 --> 00:39:25.666
I used the other half to pay back
the company for you.

00:39:25.666 --> 00:39:28.732
That's how you were able
to get out with everything intact.

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:34.166
I have nothing now, you're happy, right?

00:39:34.733 --> 00:39:36.633
Are you all happy now?

00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:53.033
<i>You are my woman.</i>

00:39:53.033 --> 00:39:55.667
<i>It's my duty to protect you.</i>

00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:58.934
I just love hearing you always say that.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.633
My woman.

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.867
I made you a special cup of coffee.

00:40:04.867 --> 00:40:08.199
Here's your favorite red bean cake.

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:10.300
You're so nice.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.065
I know that.

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:15.333
You always want red bean cakes
when you're in a bad mood.

00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:22.240
<i>♫ This time I must find happiness for myself ♫</i>

00:40:24.267 --> 00:40:26.600
Where is your girlfriend employed?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.867
She's at…
- Is she beautiful?

00:40:31.966 --> 00:40:33.166
Very pretty.

00:40:33.166 --> 00:40:34.600
Do you like her?

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.100
Very much.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:42.220
♫ ♫

00:40:46.166 --> 00:40:48.300
My brother said that on my dad's birthday,

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.032
and he's asked me to come for dinner.

00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:52.666
Do you want me to take you to dinner tonight?

00:40:54.066 --> 00:40:56.133
Don't ask anything.

00:40:56.133 --> 00:41:00.366
Tell me you want me in the simplest,
most straightforward way.

00:41:02.399 --> 00:41:04.166
I want you.

00:41:06.167 --> 00:41:07.866
I want you.

00:41:10.032 --> 00:41:15.032
The person in this world who can touch my tie

00:41:16.133 --> 00:41:18.933
is only you, Gao Shuangyun.

00:41:21.216 --> 00:41:22.904
<i>♫ The appearance of grey ♫</i>

<i>♫ Be carefree like a child ♫</i>

00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:34.967
Come, let's congratulate ourselves
on completing the puzzle.

00:41:34.967 --> 00:41:36.966
The investigation was successful.

00:41:36.966 --> 00:41:39.100
Come on, cheers!

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.499
What a pity.

00:41:43.499 --> 00:41:46.566
Our Zhou and Chen, for safety's sake,

00:41:46.566 --> 00:41:49.500
are still investigating all the cases
handled by the Vice President,

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.566
and couldn't come to celebrate with us.

00:41:51.566 --> 00:41:54.032
Director Zhang, who planned everything for us

00:41:54.032 --> 00:41:55.766
couldn't come because he had to socialize.

00:41:55.766 --> 00:41:56.866
But that's okay,

00:41:56.866 --> 00:41:59.899
even though we're few,
it's still worth celebrating.

00:41:59.899 --> 00:42:03.399
Celebrate that I can finally clear my name.

00:42:03.399 --> 00:42:04.399
Come on, let's toast again.

00:42:04.399 --> 00:42:06.099
Wait a moment.

00:42:10.867 --> 00:42:12.600
- No problem, I'll order in a bit.
- Okay.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.132
- Come on.
- Let's drink to this first.

00:42:26.666 --> 00:42:28.166
Let's celebrate at the izakaya.

00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:30.567
You're drinking longan red date tea? Isn't that a bit of a buzzkill?

00:42:30.567 --> 00:42:33.166
Can't help it, I'm on my period.

00:42:33.166 --> 00:42:34.733
You think I want to?

00:42:34.733 --> 00:42:37.032
Didn't it just start? How come it's back again?

00:42:37.032 --> 00:42:40.899
It could be messed up
because I was dieting recently.

00:42:44.733 --> 00:42:47.300
I think I haven't had it
for two months now, yikes.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.400
That's no reason to make a big fuss, though.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.166
You've been working on a case;
the stress, you know.

00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:53.799
It can cause a hormonal imbalance.

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:56.799
But we haven't been on the case for two months.

00:42:57.432 --> 00:42:59.467
You and the director
went straight to home base.

00:42:59.467 --> 00:43:01.399
- You didn't tell me.
- We didn't even hold hands.

00:43:01.399 --> 00:43:03.632
What home base then?

00:43:04.066 --> 00:43:05.567
Then you have even less to worry about.

00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:08.499
You can't possibly reproduce asexually, right?

00:43:10.433 --> 00:43:12.632
Four bottles of this.

00:43:12.632 --> 00:43:15.166
Four bottles? Okay.

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:23.333
Don't call me 'sister'.

00:43:23.333 --> 00:43:25.299
Call me Manager Wang.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.900
Chen Duomi, let's go.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.700
Why?

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.433
I'll tell you on the way. Let's go.

00:43:51.763 --> 00:43:56.648

So, the child's father is Meng Heng.
- Keep your voice down.

00:44:04.832 --> 00:44:06.366
Drinking can lead to mistakes.

00:44:06.366 --> 00:44:07.467
Tell me what do you want.

00:44:07.467 --> 00:44:09.199
I want you.

<i>[Manager's Office]</i>
I'll treat everyone fairly, just like Miss Gao. I'll treat everyone fairly.

00:44:14.166 --> 00:44:17.467
It seems no one is vying for that position
with me anymore.

00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:20.767
It was my choice to close my eyes. It has nothing to do with you.

00:44:20.767 --> 00:44:24.499
It's really not necessary. This is my punishment.
- I'll be with you.

00:44:24.499 --> 00:44:26.600
It seems you're having a pretty tough time.
