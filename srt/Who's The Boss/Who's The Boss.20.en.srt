22
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:12,368
I found out

23
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:15,103
that Vice President Han
has another secret file.

24
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,869
It contains records

25
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,570

26
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:23,403
If that's the case, why haven't
you brought it over quickly?

27
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:25,570
I want to as well.

28
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,003
But…

29
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,570
The other party is asking

30
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,003
for 200,000.

31
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:34,368
200,000?

32
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,036
200,000?

33
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:45,903
It's a small amount.

34
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:49,368
This is a very good investment.

Truly, heaven helps me.

36
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,202
Now that we have the list

37
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:57,436

- Mr. Cai, what's wrong?
- This…

57
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,435
Why, why is it like this?

58
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,203
- Let me take a look for you.
- Chen, no.

59
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:01,903

00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:09,636
I don't know, this…

65
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:11,103
I, I'll try to deal with it.

66
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,203
What is it doing?

67
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,268
It won't shut down.

68
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,635

69
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,336
How could the computer
get infected with this virus?

70
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:22,368
Mr. Cai, I will talk

71
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:23,769
to network administrators.

72
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,336
I have notified them.

73
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:27,570
What… what are you doing?

74
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,803
I, I'm closing the window for a moment.

75
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:29,902
Close it now.

76
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,669
Close it quickly!

77
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:32,803
Why are there more windows
the more I close them?

78
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,937
- Shut it down!
- It seems to be a virus.

79
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:36,336

80
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,169
I'll try again.

81
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,970
It's a virus.

82
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,303
I'll make a call.

Yes, us too, our computers are all
filled with pornographic images.

Meng Heng a good scolding.

89
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:10,837
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,235
I don't know why it turned out like this.

91
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:17,603
Yes, I will give him a good lesson.

92
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:19,036
Really!

93
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,036
What about the client data?

94
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,570
It's real.

95
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,970
Yes, it's fine. Get the network administrator

96
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,070
to check it from the source.

97
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,169
Otherwise, it'll be troublesome
if this blows up.

98
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,869
That's it for now. Okay, thank you.

99
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,436
It's satisfying to get them.

00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,470
Awesome!

101
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,135

102
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,368
- You can hear the expression.
- You're good.

103
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:43,436
Wait, but make sure we won't have
any problems on our end, right?

104
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:46,303
Manager, rest assured, our computers
here won't be affected.

105
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,570
I have already disconnected
the network beforehand.

106
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,036
The data has been backed up as well.

107
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,303
No problem.

108
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:52,970
Well done.

109
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,235
Next, Wu Tianfu will fall into our plan

110
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,103
step by step.

111
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:59,735
This plan will not only be
a waste of their time,

112
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,669
but also allow us to successfully
secure the budget.

113
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,103
Everyone has worked hard.

114
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:12,570
You.

115
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:14,635
Are you ready?

116
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,937
If the director means the meeting minutes,

117
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,635
I have prepared them.

118
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:23,502
If it means facing Cindy Wang,

119
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:26,502
honestly, not really.

120
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:27,570
However,

121
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,470
what needs to be faced must be confronted.

122
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,803
I believe Cindy is a mature
and sensible person.

123
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,002
No matter what,

124
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,203
from now on, we are all partners.

125
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,970
She should

126
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,336
not give you a hard time.

127
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:46,869
But rest assured,

128
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,603
if she really goes too far,

129
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,769
I will intervene timely.

130
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:52,002
Thank you, Director.

131
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:55,803
However, no matter how Cindy Wang
makes things difficult for me,

132
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:58,303
I think it's best if you do not intervene.

133
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,869
After all, you two are dating now.

134
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,070
If an argument occurs

135
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,303
because of my affair,

136
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,703
that wouldn't be good.

137
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,703
Besides,

138
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:07,902
if you offend your girlfriend,

139
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,436
life won't be easy.

140
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,070
I have a lot of experience with that.

143
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:33,536
I forgot. You are now the Executive Director.

144

Congratulations on your promotion.

145
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,036
Thank you.

146
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,735
Look how bad I am at courtesy.

147
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,735
Knowing that we haven't met for so long,

148
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:44,869
and you've been promoted,
I actually came empty-handed.

149
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:46,937
It's okay, that's not important.

150
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:48,603
What's important is

151
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,735
we need to cooperate well.

152
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:54,235
We must work well together.

153
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:57,937
I'm relieved to hear that.

154
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,937
Well,

155
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,436
although it's a bit late,

156
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,735
I still

157
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:06,735
want to say sorry to you.

158
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:09,036
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,336
Why bring this up after so long?

160
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:15,502
Just like you said,

161
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,536
we should start working well together now.

162
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:20,970
And I look forward to working

163
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,368
with such an experienced senior.

164
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,070
Come on,

165
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:28,136
have a seat.

166
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:36,769
Regarding

167
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,303
grasping customer needs…

168
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,569
The rest for you includes kitchen paper towels,

169
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,037
hand soap,

170
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,503
yogurt, and oatmeal.

171
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,702
Right here.

172
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,103
I'll get it for you.

173
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,335
Be careful.

174
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,136
Are you okay?

175
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:07,136
Does it hurt?

176
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,136
A little.

177
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,569
Let me have a look.

178
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:13,235
The item is so high, you should
have asked me to get it.

179
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:14,503
Why did you try to get it yourself?

180
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,305
♫ I'm going to love you ♫

181
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,436
From now on, I…

182
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,103
What should I call you?

183
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,436
Don't you always call me Zhou?

184
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,436
What do you mean?

185
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:35,470
But everyone at the company
calls you Zhou, too.

186
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,769
If I call you Zhou in private as well…

187
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:41,103
I feel it's a bit strange.

188
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:42,769
That makes sense.

189
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:45,436
How about…

190
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:46,569
Excuse me.

191
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,235
Sorry.

192
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:54,303
How about…

193
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,803
You just call me

194
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,303
- Hey.
- Hey?

195
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,902
- Zhou Jiawei.
- Hey.

196
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,269
Zhou Jiawei, hey.

197
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,436
Yes.

198
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:08,603
Zhou Jiawei, hey.

199
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:09,636
Yes.

200
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,438
[Hidden Number]

201
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,303
Hello, this is Han Xinzheng.

202
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,670
Han, can you sponsor me?

203
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,470
I'm quite affordable, 100,000 a month will do.

204
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,535
You've got the wrong number.

205
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:37,383
[Hidden Number]

206
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:40,168
Hello?

207
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:41,769
Oppa.

208
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:44,535
I'm 36E 25 38.

209
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,503
I have a hot figure and a good personality.

210
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,735
You've got the wrong number.

211
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,295
[Hidden Number]

212
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,902
Hello, this is Han Xinzheng.

213
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,103
Mr. Han.

214
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,402
I'm Angela.

215
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:13,902
I'm 18 this year.

216
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:15,870
I like mature men the most.

217
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,702
Sponsor me, please.

218
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:19,103
You've got the wrong number.

219
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,636
Strange.

220
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,436
Did my personal information leak?

221
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,470
Miss, are you looking for
anything in particular today?

222
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,368
Is it for your use or a gift?

223
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,870
Nothing in particular.

224
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,368
Just browsing.

225
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,202
I didn't know you liked shopping.

226
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,569
I usually shop for things

227
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,003
by ordering them online

228
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,368
and having them delivered directly to my home.

229
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,569
It's both fast and convenient.

230
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:22,936
I don't go out shopping.

231
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,569
So,

232
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,103
why the special interest today

233
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:29,636
in asking me to go shopping with you?

234
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,470
Don't you think a magnanimous

235
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,470
and sensible woman

236
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,037
deserves to be matched with a man

237
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:42,702
who is full of patience and
knows what he should do?

238
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:48,335
Let's go. The next store.

239
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:01,870
What's the matter?

240
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,269
Chen, are you okay?

241
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,037
I just had a cramp.

242
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,603
Do you want to go sit down for a while?

243
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,870
I'm getting older.

244
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,670
You're not old at all.

245
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,603
You clearly look to be in your thirties.

246
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,803
How can you be so sweet-talking?

247
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,436
You're good at making people happy.

248
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:21,503
Thanks.

249
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,136
But why are you preparing these today?

250
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,402
Where's Mr. Zhou?

251
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:32,037
Mr. Cai had something for Zhou to do.

252
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,535
Plus, Mr. Cai is more

253
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,402
used to drinking the tea I brew.

254
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:39,870
No wonder Cindy says

255
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,670
that Mr. Cai relies heavily on you.

256
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:46,936
- Are you alright?
- No.

257
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,069
- Go ahead and pour the water.
- Okay.

258
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,202
I'll do it.

259
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:54,870
It feels like something is about to happen.

260
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:57,803
Chen, don't overthink it.

261
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,368
Maybe it's about winning the lottery.

262
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,769
Mr. Cai, the computer viruses
have been completely eradicated.

263
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:10,168
Additionally, the company's systems
have not been damaged,

264
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,569
nor has there been any data leakage.

265
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,470
However, the network administrators
have replied saying

266
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,303
that the source of the virus originated

267
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:19,636
from the office of the planning
department manager.

268
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:28,303
From Manager Wu's office?

269
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:30,870
Was it a file or a website?

270
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,769
Can you tell us so that we can be cautious

271
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,402
lest we get infected too?

272
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:37,769
I really don't know what caused it.

273
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,269
Wu Tianfu.

274
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,368
From now on, don't look

275
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,136
at messy things.

276
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:43,636
How old are you anyway?

277
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,470
If you want to watch it, do it at home.

278
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,769
Bringing it to the company to watch,
what does that sound like?

279
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:49,735
Yes.

280
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:51,769
I guarantee it won't happen again.

281
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,870
Mr. Cai.

282
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
I'd like to report something to you.

283
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,168
Our planning department has a new resolution.

284
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,103
Sorry, please continue.

285
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:08,003
Our decision is that we hope to…

286
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,735
It's okay, just answer the phone.

287
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,069
It's fine.

288
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:21,603
Mr. Cai, our planning department has decided

289
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:24,436
to start trying land development.

290
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,202
Planning department doing land development?

291
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:29,269
Isn't that taking away
the sales department's job?

292
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,037
Manager Gao.

293
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,269
What do you think?

294
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,303
If it can create profits for the company,

295
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:40,702
it's a good thing.

296
00:15:43,003 --> 00:15:44,069
Let me say it first.

297
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,970
I'm doing this not for myself,

298
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,569
but for the staff of the planning department

299
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:48,670
and for the company.

300
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,870
With better performance,

301
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,235
the company will have a higher profit margin.

302
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:55,003
But land development requires a list.

303
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,735
Do you have the capability for that?

304
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:00,037
You don't need to worry about that, Boss.

305
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,269
We will definitely find

306
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,503
clients who can bring

307
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,569
the greatest benefit to the company.

308
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,402
Not bad.

309
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:09,003
You're thinking about the company's interests.

310
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,670
I'll let you off this time for the virus issue.

311
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,037
Thank you.

312
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:14,769
Mr. Cai, I won't let you down again.

313
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,837
Manager Gao.

314
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,335
Look how proactive the planning department is.

315
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,970
Your sales department

316
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,136
should also make a good effort.

317
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,803
Yes, Mr. Cai.

318
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:29,003
We

319
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,902
will learn well from Manager Wu,

320
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,368
taking him as a role model

321
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,069
and actively developing our business.

322
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,936
Mr. Cai, if there's nothing else,

323
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:39,202
I'll go back and work hard on the clients.

324
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:40,368
Okay.

325
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:41,535
Everyone, get to work.

326
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,535
Yes.

327
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:53,702
Mr. Cai.

328
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:56,769
Sorry, I just got a call from home saying

329
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,535
that my mother has fallen.

330
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,202
Is she alright?

331
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:02,368
I don't know.

332
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,169
I'll only know after getting to the hospital.

333
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,403
So, I would like to ask you
for leave this afternoon.

334
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,003
Of course.

335
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:10,469
You might as well take a few more days off

336
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:12,135
and take good care of your mother.

337
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:14,269
Don't worry about things here.
Zhou can handle it.

338
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,736
Oh, and buy some nutritional supplements

339
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:17,036
and take them to the hospital.

340
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,570
Consider it a gift from the company.

341
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,670
Thank you, Mr. Cai.

342
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,837
Well, go ahead.

343
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:21,969
Go.

344
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:24,403
Wait a moment, take a seat.

345
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:26,236
Sit down, I have something to tell you.

346
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:29,003
Take care, Chen, hurry to the hospital.

347
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,802
Okay, thank you.

348
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,769
Manager, we've arrived early.

349
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:38,169
Shall we go in first?
The clients will arrive soon.

350
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,869
It's okay.

351
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,535
How is it going with those people

352
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:43,302
that you and Simon arranged?

353
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:46,169
The professionals are already on their way.

354
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,736
It's a good thing that Secretary Li
didn't come today.

355
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,969
Later on, we'll just have men's talk.

356
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,535
It's more convenient to talk this way. Come on.

357
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:55,969
Men's talk.

358
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,236
Chen Han, you've got
everything with you, right?

359
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:58,936
- All set.
- Guys.

360
00:17:58,936 --> 00:17:59,936
I just confirmed.

361
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:02,302
Wu Tianfu has reserved a private room there.
They should be arriving soon.

362
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:04,036
Yazi is the most familiar with this client.

363
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,670
Later on, everyone should follow her lead.

364
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,169
Okay.

365
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,469
All of you, don't be so tense.

366
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:10,003
Relax a little.

367
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:11,936
My first mission is so thrilling.

368
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,469
It's hard not to be nervous.

369
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:16,103
Don't be nervous, and just act like
how we rehearsed at the company.

370
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,135
There won't be any problems.

371
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,603
Should we cheer each other up?

372
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:21,869
Cheer up?

373
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,603
I guess we can.

374
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,135
- Come on.
- Okay.

375
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,112
I'll use this one.

376
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:33,503
Let's go!

377
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,302
Get ready to go to battle.

378
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,302
Mr. Su.

379
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,469
Seeing is indeed better than hearing.

380
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,869
Your appearance reveals you
are a person of great importance.

381
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:51,302
I'm very fortunate today to sit
at the same table with you.

382
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:54,169
Well, let us

383
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,169
drink tea in place of liquor.

384
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,436
Here's to you.

385
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,769
Mr. Su, please.

386
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:01,603
Mr. Su.

387
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:06,202
This place you've chosen

388
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:07,603
is not bad.

389
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:09,236
It's quite serene.

390
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:11,903
However, this tea

391
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:14,036
is lacking a bit of flavor.

392
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:19,070
Three of us men drinking tea together

393
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,769
is really not that interesting.

394
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,403
Alright.

395
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:26,635
Speak quickly, my time is valuable.

396
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,936
I told you.

397
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,070
Mr. Su knows his drink.

398
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,103
What's the point of drinking tea like this?

399
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,936
Right, Guo.

400
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,103
Call the people from outside.

401
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:39,436
Coming right up, Mr. Su, please wait a moment.

402
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,436
Who else is coming?

403
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:44,103
Here's the thing, Mr. Su.

404
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:46,236
I've specially invited some

405
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:50,436
professional mind-body-spirit
management masters

406
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,469
to join us in tea tasting

407
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,336
and cultivate our minds and bodies.

408
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:55,336
Yes.

409
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,003
Come on.

410
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:00,036
- They're here.
- Come on in.

411
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,070
Come in.

412
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,403
Come, stand over here.

413
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,702
Go stand over there.

414
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,736
Come on.

415
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,535
The three of you, come on, say hello to Mr. Su.

416
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:08,936
Hello, Mr. Su.

417
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:10,769
Hello everyone, come and sit over here.

418
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,003
Please have a seat.

419
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,503
Take a seat.

420
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,837
Indeed professional enough.

421
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,302
You are Manager Wu, right?

422
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,003
- Yes.
- Promising.

423
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:21,169
Clever.

424
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:22,936
Of course.

425
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:27,070
It's a must. Today we're here
to make Mr. Su happy.

426
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,702
It's so hot today.

427
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,070
Do you want to take off your suit?

428
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,169
Take it off.

429
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,769
Take it all off, it's very hot.

430
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,869
Of course, take it off.

431
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,736
- It's so hot.
- It's so hot.

432
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,003
- It's getting hot.
- It's so hot.

433
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,535
Oh my!

434
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,969
Take it off.

435
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,070
That's so considerate.

436
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:48,736
Cindy.

437
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,103
Is Chen not here?

438
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:52,837
Yes, Chen had something come up at home.

439
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,403
She took a leave. What's up?

440
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:56,903
I wanted to know the boss's schedule.

441
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,903
Will he be in the office today?

442
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,036
Mr. Cai?

443
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,603
Let me check for you.

444
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:06,670
Mr. Cai doesn't have many outings today.

445
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,837
Basically, he should be in the company.

446
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:12,135
OK, because Director Zhang will come
to the company later for my pitch,

447
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:13,368
and he wants to meet with the boss by the way.

448
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:14,969
I don't know if it's convenient.

449
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:16,070
I see.

450
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,070
I'll confirm with Mr. Cai.

451
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,269
There should be no problem.

452
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:24,670
Well…

453
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,969
Well…

454
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,135
He should not be coming alone.

455
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,936
He might bring the new Executive Director

456
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,169
from his company.

457
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,570
You know…

458
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:37,469
Vice President Han?

459
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,302
Yes, that's right.

460
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,368
Does Yun know?

461
00:21:44,368 --> 00:21:45,936
She knows, I've told her.

462
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:47,769
That's good.

463
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,635
Because it's work-related, so understood.

464
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:51,936
I think so.

465
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,969
Rest assured. She is busy this afternoon.

466
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:55,670
They won't run into each other.

467
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:58,003
It's all good.

468
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,070
I'm fine.

469
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,403
I'm not worried.

470
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,269
I'm just afraid

471
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:03,635
that seeing him

472
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,103
might affect

473
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:06,603
Yun's mood at work.

474
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:07,802
Right?

475
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,036
It's fine.

476
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:13,603
- Dance.
- Let me tell you.

477
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:15,302
With your palmistry,

478
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:17,036
you like older men.

479
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,869
- Right.
- That's so accurate. I want to try it too.

480
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:21,736
- Okay, I'll read your palm later.
- Mr. Su.

481
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:22,769
Mr. Su, drink it while it's hot.

482
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:24,635
- Alright, have some tea.
- Mr. Su.

483
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,535
It's too hot to drink like this.

484
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:27,837
- How should I drink it?
- It's scalding.

485
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:29,236
I'll help you cool it down.

486
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,302
Help me cool it down?

487
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:34,969
Cool it down.

488
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:37,769
Wait a minute.

489
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:39,503
Hold on a moment.

490
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:40,769
Everyone, stop talking.

491
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,880
[My Lady]

492
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:47,302
Hello?

493
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:49,635
Honey.

494
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,736
I'm in a meeting at the tea house.

495
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:53,436
Yes.

496
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:56,135
Otherwise, you can check my phone's location.

497
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:58,302
It should show I'm at the tea house.

498
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:01,635
I dropped my lipstick. Could you
pick it up for me?

499
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,603
There's a woman's voice.

500
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,169
Honey, your hearing is so good.

501
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:13,535
Yes, that was the specialist
from Construction Company.

502
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:14,603
Yes.

503
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,769
Of course, we are discussing official business.

504
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:19,670
I'll come home immediately after the meeting.

505
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,236
Okay, bye.

506
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:24,003
What were you just doing, talking?

507
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,702
- It's okay, don't scold her.
- I'm sorry.

508
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:27,070
Right, it's okay.

509
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,603
I apologize, I'll give you a bigger ice cube.

510
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,837
- Bigger, bigger is better.
- The biggest ice cube.

511
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:33,736
Big ice cube.

512
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,103
Mr. Su, take a sip of hot tea.

513
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:39,269
Good, now the hot tea is not scalding.

514
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,969
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:44,837
Feeling refreshed all over.

516
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,603
Mr. Su, I'll pour you some more tea.

517
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,969
What a coincidence.

518
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,368
Elder men also suit you.

519
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:52,336
No wonder you wanted to meet at the tea house.

520
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,269
It's the best cover.

521
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,070
I know what I'm doing.

522
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,969
Yes, have you arrived?
I'll come to pick you up right away.

523
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,135
Yingjun.

524
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:01,202
Okay.

525
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,670
One cup is missing.

526
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:09,269
And the perfume.

527
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:10,535
Perfume.

528
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:14,769
Xiaoting's designer perfume is here.

529
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,635
Five, none.

530
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,336
I won, you drink.

531
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:19,469
And me.

532
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,135
Where are you?

533
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:22,670
I… I don't see you.

534
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,769
Drink, you lost too.

535
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,503
The loser drinks.

536
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:28,003
I lost.

537
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:29,635
I'm at the door.

538
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,469
How come I don't see you?

539
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,070
Where are you?

540
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,269
Forget it.

541
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:35,936
Just tell me which private room you're in.

542
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:37,302
I'll come and find you.

543
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,103
Drink it like water.

544
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,603
Wait a minute.

545
00:24:40,603 --> 00:24:42,302
Hold on a moment.

546
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,469
Mr. Su, your phone didn't ring.

547
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:53,036
- Stop making a fuss.
- Yeah, it's nothing.

548
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:54,368
Hold on.

549
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,003
I feel like she's already here.

550
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,503
How could that be?

551
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,269
It's over.

552
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,535
She's really here.

553
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,736
Get the meeting materials out quickly.

554
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,702
Hurry up, get the documents.

555
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:11,236
Put on your coat.

556
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:12,603
We didn't bring a coat.

557
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:13,869
Isn't it better to wear less?

558
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,103
You guys hide first.

559
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:16,202
Where can we hide?

560
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,368
- Hide.
- Hurry up.

561
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,503
Quickly find a place to hide.

562
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:26,469
Forget it, you don't hide, I'll hide.

563
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:28,135
Let me tell you, when my wife arrives later,

564
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,403
definitely don't tell her I'm here.

565
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,302
- Did you hear that?
- Okay, no problem.

566
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:31,736
- I'm leaving.
- Mr. Su, be careful.

567
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:32,736
Okay.

568
00:25:33,503 --> 00:25:34,769
God help.

569
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,603
Guo.

570
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:40,702
Manager.

571
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:42,570
Guo, come out, what are you doing in there?

572
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:44,869
Come out.

573
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:45,969
Come out!

574
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:46,969
Aren't we supposed to hide?

575
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:02,003
Lin?

576
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:03,469
Mr. Su, it's safe at my room.

577
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:04,903
Follow me.

578
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,368
- Safe?
- Safe?

579
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:07,769
Come on, hurry up.

580
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,236
Here.

581
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:18,670
This place is very big.

582
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:25,336
Excuse me.

583
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:26,503
Come on.

584
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:32,135
Mr. Su, hello, I am Gao Shuangyun, the sales
department manager of Construction Company.

585
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,503
I'll introduce myself to you another day.

586
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:34,570
You will need this in a moment.

587
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,070
Please take a seat.

588
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,603
- Here.
- Okay.

589
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:39,103
Come on, this is your seat.

590
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,269
Thank you.

591
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:52,635
Regarding the strategy of land development,

592
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:55,302
our company plans to use
a different approach than before,

593
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:57,769
focusing on a sustainable,
people-centered environment.

594
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:00,003
As for the issue of resource allocation,

595
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:01,469
our company also plans to…

596
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:06,969
- Madam.
- Good day, Madam.

597
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:07,969
Mrs. Su.

598
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,202
I haven't disturbed your meeting, have I?

599
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,837
Of course not, please come in.

600
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:15,570
Please come in, Madam, please.

601
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,469
Honey.

602
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,936
You're in the middle of a meeting.

603
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,570
Why did you insist on me coming over?

604
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:27,936
Although work is important,

605
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:29,903
Mr. Su has not forgotten

606
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:31,469
what day it is today,

607
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:33,769
and he has specially
arranged a surprise for you.

608
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:35,837
What surprise?

609
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:40,336
Happy anniversary

610
00:27:40,336 --> 00:27:42,469
to Mr. Su and his beautiful wife.

611
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,169
Be happy.

612
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:47,635
Honey.

613
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,036
I have specially prepared a gift

614
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,603
for you.

615
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,036
Happy anniversary, I love you.

616
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:59,236
We're an old married couple now.

617
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:01,702
Yet you still involve the staff
of Construction Company

618
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,202
in these unnecessary things.

619
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:04,570
Really.

620
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:06,269
Old couples value

621
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,070
the sense of ceremony more.

622
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,036
Mr. Su has a unique vision
and meticulous thoughts.

623
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:12,603
He is completely an example
for us juniors to follow

624
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,603
and learn from.

625
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:16,202
Don't put him on a high pedestal.

626
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,736
Arrogance leads to defeat.

627
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:21,236
Look at you. Do you want to change teams?

628
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:22,702
Manager Gao's team is so good.

629
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,036
So excellent.

630
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,236
Yes, excellent.

631
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:30,403
Manager, I think we should find

632
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:31,969
another time to report to Mr. Su.

633
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,802
Today is a special day.

634
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:36,802
We should give them some space.

635
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,336
That goes without saying.

636
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:41,302
Mr. Su has just asked me to book a restaurant.

637
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:46,436
Yes, I just asked Manager Gao

638
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:48,702
to book a restaurant
for our anniversary celebration.

639
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,135
I thought after the meeting,

640
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:52,070
I could take you out for a nice meal

641
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,302
and celebrate.

642
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,169
You forgot everything last year.

643
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,802
I didn't expect you to be
so thoughtful this year.

644
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,336
And you've even given me this surprise.

645
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:00,670
Thank you, honey.

646
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,036
Of course.

647
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:04,302
Otherwise, what would I do if you divorced me?

648
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,570
Honey.

649
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,503
Why do you smell so good?

650
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,135
What scent is it?

651
00:29:16,135 --> 00:29:17,269
Really?

652
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:19,503
Sorry.

653
00:29:19,503 --> 00:29:20,903
I might have

654
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:22,837
sprayed too much perfume today.

655
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:25,570
Yes, he sat next to me.

656
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,903
Try it. It's the same scent.

657
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,368
Isn't it?

658
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:35,469
It is.

659
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:36,702
Sorry about that.

660
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:38,535
It's alright.

661
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:39,837
Thanks to you,

662
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:42,070
today I get to go and celebrate
our wedding anniversary

663
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,336
with my fragrant husband.

664
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:45,403
That's wonderful.

665
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:49,535
Then, I'm sorry, let's reschedule
for another day, shall we?

666
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:51,837
- No problem.
- I'll take my wife

667
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:52,869
for the anniversary dinner.

668
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:54,436
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

669
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:55,670
- Let's meet another day.
- Thank you.

670
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,302
- Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.

671
00:29:57,302 --> 00:29:58,368
Happy anniversary.

672
00:29:58,368 --> 00:29:59,903
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

673
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:01,236
Be careful.

674
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:02,603
Be happy.

675
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,503
Congratulations.

676
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:09,269
Mr. Su just sent a text message

677
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:11,802
asking us to pick a day
and present our proposal.

678
00:30:13,837 --> 00:30:15,702
The designer perfume I contributed to Chen Han

679
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:17,202
wasn't in vain.

680
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:19,003
Yazi, you have intense connections,

681
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,336
to be able to grasp the whereabouts of Mr. Su.

682
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:25,302
Because I'm good friends
with Mr. Su's secretary.

683
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,036
So it seems being friends with a secretary

684
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,837
isn't a bad thing at all.

685
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:33,269
It's very good.

686
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:34,802
I was thinking that if the planning department

687
00:30:34,802 --> 00:30:36,535
continues to snatch Mr. Su's cases,

688
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,736
I still have Plan B.

689
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,503
I didn't expect you to succeed
on your first attempt.

690
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:41,670
People really can't underestimate you.

691
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,769
Impressive.

692
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:50,503
What?

693
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,003
Can't we make peace with a handshake?

694
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,036
I'm thinking about what other methods to use

695
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,903
to turn you from foe to friend.

696
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:00,535
And just like that,

697
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:01,736
so simple.

698
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:03,670
You show me an inch of respect,

699
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,169
and I'll show you a foot.

700
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,802
Besides, this doesn't mean
I consider you a friend.

701
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,769
Be free to not consider me a friend,

702
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,003
but I think you're a respectable opponent.

703
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:16,635
That's the spirit.

704
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:18,336
I'm getting goosebumps.

705
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,336
We're all in the same boat.

706
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,837
Rocking is forbidden.

707
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:24,070
You sound

708
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,670
a lot like a manager.

709
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,535
- Manager Zhang, hello.
- You may stand at ease.

710
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:30,702
Right, why didn't Manager Gao
come back with you?

711
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,469
I just ran into her downstairs.

712
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:34,368
She said she was going to the cafe

713
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:35,837
and binge on coffee.

714
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:39,769
Probably because Han Xinzheng is coming later.

715
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,635
But that's good, to avoid awkwardness.

716
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:48,936
Guo,

717
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:50,903
do you want to check the restroom?

718
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:54,036
Mr. Su might have already
been taken back by Mrs. Su.

719
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,503
Restroom.

720
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,269
Take a look in the restroom.

721
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,680
All right.

722
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:02,535
- He's back.
- Mr. Su is back.

723
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,368
- Time to work, Mr. Su.
- Get ready.

724
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:06,036
Come on, get up for work.

725
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:08,869
- Good day, Mr. Su.
- Su… Mr. Su?

726
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:10,635
Chen Han, what are you doing here?

727
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:12,368
By the order of Manager Gao,

728
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:13,702
I'm here to relay a message.

729
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:15,436
Manager Gao says not to stay out too late.

730
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:17,236
Return to the company earlier.

731
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:20,603
Otherwise, the boss will be unhappy.

732
00:32:22,202 --> 00:32:23,702
Could it be that Yun…

733
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:27,336
Oh no, it seems like we've been tricked.

734
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,070
Explain it to me clearly.

735
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,135
- Explain it to me clearly.
- Hold on, you haven't paid yet.

736
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:34,003
Wait a second, you haven't paid yet.

737
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,403
- I…
- Trying to dine and dash, huh?

738
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:36,736
- Money.
- Yes.

739
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:37,869
I'm giving you the money.

740
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,670
Guo, pay up.

741
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,202
- Pay, pay up.
- Thank you, boss.

742
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:43,403
Pay.

743
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:44,670
Guo, wait a moment.

744
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:47,236
Guo, are you in cahoots with them?

745
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:48,535
Tell me the truth.

746
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:50,702
Manager, I'm innocent.

747
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:51,702
I really am, truly innocent.

748
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,603
They did it on their own. My heart has
always been with the planning department.

749
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,469
And I'll always be your Little Guo.

750
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:57,869
Manager, you have to believe me.
I'm really innocent.

751
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:59,036
You can't lie to me.

752
00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:01,003
I'm truly sincere.

753
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:02,469
I really am your Little Guo, Manager.

754
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:03,869
Alright, pay them first.

755
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,869
Director,

756
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:18,269
I think

757
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,436
it's better if I don't go up.

758
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:22,570
I'm afraid Mr. Cai won't be

759
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,469
too pleased seeing me,

760
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,336
and it might ruin the work
atmosphere you have going.

761
00:33:27,702 --> 00:33:29,469
I'll wait for you at the nearby café.

762
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:57,336
You look a bit old,

763
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,103
but you're well-maintained.

764
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,403
How many people are there in your family?

765
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,736
Excuse me,

766
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:08,002
how much do you earn each month?

767
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:09,335
Sir, I'm sorry.

768
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:10,703
I don't seem to know you.

769
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,469
You don't need to know me.

770
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,469
You can feel it if you want.

771
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,269
Sorry, I like…

772
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:19,736
It's okay if you don't like me.

773
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:21,335
Just come and feel these muscles

774
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:22,903
and this kind of strength.

775
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:25,002
What are you doing?

776
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:27,369
- Darling.
- Yun.

777
00:34:28,703 --> 00:34:30,135
I knew you were no good.

778
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,269
You already have a girlfriend

779
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,502
and you dare to ask my sister out online.

780
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:34,769
What?

781
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:36,469
Asking your sister out?

782
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,403
If I see you asking my sister out again,

783
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:39,669
I'll beat you up.

784
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:40,836
Move aside.

785
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,335
Are you okay?

786
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,736
I'm fine.

787
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:49,703
That's good.

788
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,669
Yun.

789
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:55,070
Can you

790
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,936
stick around for a bit longer?

791
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,870
I'm afraid of that guy.

792
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,135
He might come back later.

793
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:16,236
They haven't finished talking yet?

794
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:22,635
What is this?

795
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:27,769
I just took a glance.

796
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:29,369
Han Xinzheng didn't come.

797
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,335
Gao Shuangyun also went to her favorite cafe.

798
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:33,269
So now they are on two parallel paths.

799
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,469
Safe.

800
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,168
You, you came all the way here

801
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:39,502
just to tell me that?

802
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:43,635
What are you doing?

803
00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:45,236
Are you worried that I'll worry?

804
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:48,135
Do you think I am

805
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,269
that considerate?

806
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,236
Yes.

807
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,603
Alright, thank you.

808
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:56,037
It's nothing.

809
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,870
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- It's okay.

810
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,669
Director Zhang.

811
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,269
May I interrupt you

812
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,603
and invite this beautiful and intelligent lady

813
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:06,103
to have dinner together?

814
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:08,302
You've already interrupted us.

815
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:09,469
Let's go.

816
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:10,502
See you.

817
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,836
Wait a moment.

818
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:16,769
Well,

819
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,703
it's rush hour now, and there's traffic.

820
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:21,703
Shall I call a car for you?

821
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:22,903
I have a driver.

822
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:25,135
Oh, right.

823
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,135
Take care.

824
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,037
- I'll go back to get my purse first.
- Okay.

825
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:34,769
Sorry, Meng Heng.

826
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:36,769
I want to help, but I can't help you.

827
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:49,502
Actually, you are single now.

828
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:51,769
It's perfectly normal to use dating sites.

829
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,436
You don't need to explain it to me.

830
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:55,802
I am busy working every day.

831
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:58,103
I don't have any extra time.

832
00:36:59,103 --> 00:37:00,769
I also don't know how it happened.

833
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,302
I'm not sure if my personal information

834
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:03,736
was stolen or what.

835
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:06,469
Just the other day, someone called and said

836
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,335
that she wanted me to be her sponsor.

837
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:09,769
Isn't that crazy?

838
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:13,969
Have you offended anyone recently?

839
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:16,469
No, I haven't.

840
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:17,969
Even

841
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,037
my biggest enemy, Cindy Wang,

842
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,603
was willing to make peace with me.

843
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:23,570
That day,

844
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,403
we even re-added each other as friends.

845
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,436
Cindy Wang?

846
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:31,135
Can I take a look at your phone?

847
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,969
What's wrong?

848
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,070
You've had a dating app
secretly installed on your phone.

849
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:46,369
I think it must be Cindy Wang's doing.

850
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:53,469
Come on.

851
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,570
Thank you.

852
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,769
Director Han.

853
00:37:57,769 --> 00:37:59,335
You have your phone with you, right?

854
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:00,369
Phone?

855
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,635
In a fit of anger before,

856
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:05,002
I deleted your contact information.

857
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:06,635
Now that we're going to collaborate,

858
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:08,168
I have to add it back, right?

859
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,103
Of course, come here.

860
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:11,936
I-I'll do it.

861
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:13,824
Thank you.

862
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:23,635
I really am stupid.

863
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:25,635
I didn't know that.

864
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,536
No wonder Cindy Wang was so quick

865
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:30,037
to agree to work with me.

866
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:33,502
Her way of setting people up

867
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,002
is really quite special.

868
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:37,302
It definitely has her style.

869
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,296
♫ The role of a passing character ♫

870
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:47,753
♫ You won't miss me as one ♫

871
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,536
♫ As you turn around,
there's a new journey ahead ♫

872
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:57,866
♫ I'm still standing here responding ♫

873
00:38:57,866 --> 00:39:00,438
♫ The eternal self-questioning ♫

874
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,203
This doesn't really seem like

875
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:06,536
a place Director Zhang would come to.

876
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:10,669
I'm going to take you
to meet someone important.

877
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:14,635
The last time you said that,
it was to meet Yiyi.

878
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:16,037
This time,

879
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:17,669
it's not about meeting
some family member, right?

880
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:20,802
I am going to take you

881
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,802
to meet an important work partner.

882
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:24,369
He asked me to meet here.

883
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:29,903
- He's here.
- Daqi.

884
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:31,302
Zhang Shiping.

885
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:33,536
Long time no see.

886
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:35,135
All these years,

887
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:38,536
you've been getting
stronger with practice, huh?

888
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:40,203
Alright.

889
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,369
Why? We've slept together for so many years.

890
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,436
What place haven't I touched? Feeling shy?

891
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:48,469
Honey, don't scare Shiping's
girlfriend like that.

892
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,703
Sorry about that. They were
university classmates

893
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:53,736
and they lived in the same dormitory.

894
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:55,070
Don't take it too seriously.

895
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,103
My husband

896
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,403
loves to joke.

897
00:39:58,002 --> 00:39:59,536
Please, every one of Shiping's girlfriends

898
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:00,669
has been trained

899
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:01,903
to have a big heart?

900
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,736
She won't be scared off just like that.

901
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:06,802
I'm with Xin Daqi Real Estate Development,

902
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,369
Chen Daqi.

903
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,070
Construction Company
Sales Department, Cindy Wang.

904
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,236
Just call me Cindy.

905
00:40:11,236 --> 00:40:13,669
Hello, let me introduce to you seriously.

906
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:14,802
My boss.

907
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:16,669
Lily.

908
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:17,836
Cindy.

909
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,168
- Let's sit down.
- Come, sit, sit.

910
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,469
Every one of Shiping's girlfriends

911
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,403
is tall and beautiful.

912
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:29,769
How did you meet?

913
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:30,903
- How long have you known each other?
- Daqi.

914
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,302
She…

915
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:33,603
You've been to Southeast Asia for so many years

916
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:36,269
yet you are as talkative as ever.

917
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:37,969
But my love for you is just as much.

918
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,203
Has he ever told you about
the relationship between him and me?

919
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:42,936
We made a pact back in college,

920
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:45,302
that after graduation he would be
in charge of drawings and designs,

921
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:47,070
while I would handle
the finances and investments.

922
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,203
We must create a place

923
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:51,135
where architecture and environment
can merge perfectly,

924
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,536
the most livable, most comfortable city.

925
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:56,502
I think Shiping has already achieved it.

926
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:59,802
like that project in the Taoyuan Dayuan
Bus Terminal Special District.

927
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:01,536
It had a prime location,

928
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:02,635
a great design concept,

929
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:03,802
and hotel-style planning.

930
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:05,269
In fact, there are many potential customers

931
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:07,002
already inquiring about it.

932
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:10,037
You're pretty good, kid.

933
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,769
I've just marked out a few new plots of land.

934
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,903
Please handle it accordingly.

935
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,969
From the perspective of the sales department,

936
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:16,236
- I'd like to offer some advice.
- Do you men

937
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:17,936
always get caught up talking about work

938
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,570
and forget to eat?

939
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:21,369
Cindy, let's go.

940
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,969
Let's go order some food for them.

941
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:25,669
Come on, let's go.

942
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:27,536
- Let's get them well-fed.
- Honey, I want beer.

943
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:32,135
Let's order.

944
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:35,002
Menu, OK.

945
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,703
I heard from Shiping

946
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:45,369
that you're a very capable secretary.

947
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:49,335
I haven't always been a secretary.
I used to work in sales.

948
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:52,436
Look at this, I think
this combination is pretty good.

949
00:41:52,436 --> 00:41:54,335
Let's order this one.

950
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,903
Excuse me,

951
00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:58,269
I would like this combination.

952
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:00,135
Okay, and then…

953
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:01,203
Four bottles of beer.

954
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:02,203
Alright, please wait a moment.

955
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,616
Thank you.

956
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,302
Daqi and I were

957
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:07,802
so happy for Shiping when we heard

958
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:09,635
he had met someone.

959
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:12,070
You know,

960
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,703
men, once focused on their careers,
tend to forget to take care of themselves.

961
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,969
But now,

962
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,870
with you behind him,

963
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,769
it really puts us at ease.

964
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,236
Is there anything about him
that's not reassuring?

965
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:29,335
I think you probably know,

966
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:31,870
that over these years,

967
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,037
he's been taking care of Yi all by himself,

968
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:35,836
while also being busy with work.

969
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:37,802
It's really like burning
the candle at both ends.

970
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,302
But now,

971
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:42,502
with you as his support,

972
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:44,703
you can be

973
00:42:44,703 --> 00:42:46,703
a good helpmate.

974
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:49,802
Oh yes, and you can be

975
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:51,603
the perfect mom for Yi.

976
00:42:53,502 --> 00:42:54,502
However,

977
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:56,669
since Yi lost her mother when she was young,

978
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:58,335
her personality might be

979
00:42:58,335 --> 00:42:59,736
a bit strange.

980
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:01,969
You might have to be more patient with her.

981
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:06,536
Thank you.

982
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:25,302
Mr. Chen of Xin Daqi Real Estate Development.

983
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:35,203
- Keep it up.
- The one just now tripled.

984
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:36,703
They know each other.

985
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:45,070
Mr. Chen.

986
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:47,436
Mr. Chen.

987
00:43:47,436 --> 00:43:49,302
Nice to meet you.

988
00:43:49,302 --> 00:43:51,269
You look so young.

989
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,870
- Thank you.
- Hello.

990
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:55,369
I am the planning department manager
of Construction Company,

991
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,536
Wu Tianfu.

992
00:43:56,536 --> 00:43:57,836
Talent Wu.

993
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,236
Hello.

994
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,002
It's really quite a coincidence.

995
00:44:01,002 --> 00:44:03,002
I also know Director Zhang.

996
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,802
As for Secretary Wang,

997
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:06,736
we have always been good colleagues.

998
00:44:07,736 --> 00:44:09,635
- So you are colleagues.
- Yes.

999
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:10,635
Hello.

1000
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:13,802
Poaching from others,

1001
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:15,335
stealing others' secrets,

1002
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:16,836
is that what a good colleague would do?

1003
00:44:35,181 --> 00:44:38,165
[Those skilled in strategy can navigate through
the storms of career threats and the fog of emotions]

1004
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,168
[Next Episode]
The planning department is clearly against us.

1005
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:43,536
So we should

1006
00:44:43,536 --> 00:44:44,969
open up a new battlefield.

1007
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:46,135
Call me Tianfu.

1008
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:47,236
I like you.

1009
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:49,469
I will definitely handle this matter well.

1010
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,536
Are you sure…

1011
00:44:50,536 --> 00:44:51,635
you want to do this?

1012
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:52,870
If she is lying,

1013
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,203
it means she has something to hide.

1014
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:56,269
Or…

1015
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:57,570
in your subconscious,

1016
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,103
have you already fallen for me?

1017
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:01,403
Do you want me to be like Lily?

1018
00:45:01,403 --> 00:45:02,603
I can take care of you.

1019
00:45:02,603 --> 00:45:04,203
I can support you for a lifetime.

1020
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:05,903
I am not the same as him.
