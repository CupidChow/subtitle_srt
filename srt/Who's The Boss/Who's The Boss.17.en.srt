00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,203
Miss Oriole, since you know that I like Cindy,

188
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,302
why would you help me pursue her?

189
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,937
If it makes you happy,

190
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,268
I would be happy too.

191
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:58,870
To like someone

192
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,635
doesn't necessarily mean
having to possess them.

193
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,235
Alright, let's hurry up and go.

194
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,703
Don't go on about it anymore.

195
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,969
Give me your umbrella.

196
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,570
Yi.

197
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,036
Do you know whether walking or driving,

198
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,737
at what speed can one truly
appreciate the scenery?

199
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:21,770
What speed?

200
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,737
Ten kilometers per hour.

201
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:25,737
How fast is ten kilometers per hour?

202
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,836
If it's ten kilometers per hour,

203
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:32,503
we might only arrive in the evening.

204
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,336
Eyes on the road, please.

205
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,435
Also,

206
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,802
do you know what is the most important thing

207
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:45,635
to do during a long drive?

208
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:46,937
What?

209
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:50,003
That is…

210
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,570
eating snacks.

211
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,802
Hey…

212
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:56,203
My dad has a cleanliness obsession.

213
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,737
He says we can't eat in the car.

214
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:04,602
Right.

215
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:06,469
Of course.

216
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:08,503
Sorry.

217
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:09,703
It's okay.

218
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,870
Yi was a child,

219
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,003
and I was afraid she would leave crumbs of food

220
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:14,469
all over the car.

221
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:17,235
Now that she's grown up, it's fine.
You guys can eat away.

222
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:20,102
It's okay, we'll eat later at the reststop.

223
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,669
Excuse me.

224
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,302
Hello?

225
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,737
Yes, I am.

226
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:34,969
Mrs. Lin's granddaughter?

227
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,570
Yeah, I remember.

228
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,135
What?

229
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:41,802
Okay.

230
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,036
Okay.

231
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,770
Thank you for telling me.

232
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,937
Okay, goodbye.

233
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:50,268
Sorry, I might not be able to go with you guys.

234
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:53,135
Can you let me off where it's possible to park?

235
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:57,235
My dad, he's sick.

236
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:59,135
I, I want to go back to check on him.

237
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,268
It's okay.

238
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:03,536
I'll take you back.

239
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:39,536
[Zhou]
I'm sorry,

240
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,536
I seem to have caught a cold.

241
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:43,435
I want to rest at home.

242
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:45,336
Sorry.

243
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:55,169
[A new message]

244
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,235
[Zhou]
Rest well then.

245
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,503
If you really feel unwell,

246
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,302
remember to see a doctor, okay?

247
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:22,737
What, what?

248
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,870
You came back to glare at me, didn't you?

249
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,169
Tell me.

250
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,536
How sick are you? Don't lie to me.

251
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:30,737
It's really just a sprained back, that's all.

252
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:31,802
When you called just now,

253
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,870
I told you, didn't I?

254
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,003
If it really is a sprained back,

255
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:36,903
why would Mrs. Lin's granddaughter ask me
to come back to take care of you?

256
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,235
Just, just tell me.

257
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,503
I can handle it.

258
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,836
Why would you believe Mrs. Lin's granddaughter

259
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:43,469
more than me?

260
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,937
Because she has no reason to lie to me.

261
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,503
She is just an outsider.

262
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:48,469
She could also be considered half…

263
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:51,102
Or rather an insider.

264
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:52,102
What do you mean?

265
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:53,602
So, I strained my back.

266
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:56,203
And I can't reach to apply
the medicinal patch on my back.

267
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,937
Every time Mrs. Lin helps me stick it.

268
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,669
Then the neighbors started saying

269
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,435
that something was going on between her and me.

270
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,969
So she asked me to come back

271
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,403
to avoid suspicion.

272
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:07,770
That's not it.

273
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,036
She is mad because I told someone else

274
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,102
that she and I are just friends.

275
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,268
Now she won't help me apply it

276
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,969
and had her granddaughter call you.

277
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,737
Pops, let me tell you.

278
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,435
You've had so many girlfriends.

279
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,370
Don't you want to settle down?

280
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,235
She kindly helped you apply the patch.

281
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,703
And you call her just a friend?

282
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,036
You really are…

283
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,536
You don't need to worry about it.

284
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:36,669
Who is that boy who drove you back home?

285
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,036
He's my friend.

286
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:41,435
I thought you said

287
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:42,969
that someone so enthusiastic

288
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,036
can't be just a friend.

289
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,435
Mr. Zhang

290
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,036
is a rather special friend.

291
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:52,836
Be careful with your words later.

292
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:54,102
Don't ruin your daughter's happiness.

293
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,336
You know.

294
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:56,870
Of course, I won't.

295
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,135
Right now, I am going

296
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,635
to defend my daughter's happiness.

297
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,536
It has to grow up slowly like this.

298
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,370
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

299
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,268
- Hello, Mr. Wang.
- Hello.

300
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,635
They say every encounter is fate.

301
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:13,770
Moreover, you've come from afar.

302
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,036
How about this?

303
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:18,268
Later, you can stay for a quick meal.

304
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,068
Then I will

305
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:23,669
humbly accept your kind offer.

306
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,770
Really? That's great.

307
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,370
After dinner tonight,

308
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,403
just stay over for the night…

309
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,169
For the night chat.

310
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,469
A chat.

311
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,969
- Night chat.
- It means chatting.

312
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,135
Chatting.

313
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:47,435
It's me.

314
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:49,703
What are you doing here?

315
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:52,235
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

316
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:53,268
I…

317
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,536
Come in.

318
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay.

319
00:15:58,403 --> 00:15:59,870
Should I take off my shoes here?

320
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,203
I'll help you.

321
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,836
- Thank you.
- Come on, try it.

322
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,169
How is it?

323
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:23,403
It's very good.

324
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:24,635
That's good.

325
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,169
By the way, you…

326
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,836
Are you feeling well now?

327
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,770
Do you have a fever?

328
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,737
Or should I check for you?

329
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:40,937
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,969
I'm afraid of infecting you.

331
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,836
Don't get too close to me.

332
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:51,802
You, you don't have to be afraid.

333
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:53,870
Didn't someone

334
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,370
say

335
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,669
that if you pass the cold to the next person,

336
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:00,570
you'd get better?

337
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,102
Rest assured, I can handle it.

338
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:07,602
There's still some time
before the exhibition ends.

339
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:10,069
You can still make it.

340
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,702
Don't miss it because of me.

341
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,836
Seeing the exhibition

342
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,169
is to appreciate beautiful things.

343
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:22,836
But I think,

344
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,503
what I'm seeing now

345
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:27,336
is the most beautiful thing.

346
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,169
Zhou.

347
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,769
You know right now…

348
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:39,303
- I know.
- I'm not…

349
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:42,535
I know.

350
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:45,035
How could I not know?

351
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,268
I know

352
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,669
what you need most now

353
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,470
is rest.

354
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,503
But just resting isn't enough.

355
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:58,236
You also need

356
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,769
to drink more water and exercise.

357
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,737
That's how you can get rid of the bad bacteria

358
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:04,069
out of your system,

359
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:06,069
and your body will recover.

360
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,470
Zhou.

361
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,737
- I…
- I know.

362
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,336
I know.

363
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:17,202
The process of expelling bacteria from the body

364
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,169
might be a bit tough.

365
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,936
And it might,

366
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:24,336
it might even cause you a lot of pain.

367
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:28,636
But I want to tell you

368
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,702
that I'll always be by your side

369
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:36,003
accompanying you through it

370
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:39,769
until you are fully recovered.

371
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,108
♫ I wait for you ♫

372
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:50,146
♫ To become no longer illusory ♫

373
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:53,669
By the way,

374
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:55,803
do you know that besides cooking classes,

375
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,702
what else I take?

376
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:00,435
Aerobics classes.

377
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,602
Look.

378
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:04,702
Like this.

379
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:08,669
After you finish drinking,
you can do it with me like this.

380
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,869
I guarantee you'll be able to sweat it out,

381
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,102
burn fat,

382
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:14,669
and expel all

383
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:16,369
the bad bacteria.

384
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,236
Just do it like this with me.

385
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,268
You really take a lot of classes.

386
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,669
I've been single for a while, you know.

387
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:26,069
So I pick up a little bit of this and that.

388
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,503
Just like this.

389
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,769
- Let me get it.
- I will. You can enjoy your soup.

390
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:34,503
- Thanks.
- Okay.

391
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:42,136
Thank you.

392
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,769
Yun, the administrator said it's for you.

393
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,069
Did you order delivery?

394
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:58,236
I bought your favorite red bean cakes.

395
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:01,403
It's from that lady
with the curly hair on the street.

396
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,202
No.

397
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,303
They probably delivered it to the wrong person.

398
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:08,169
Did they?

399
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,169
I wonder who it was for.

400
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,470
There's no name written.

401
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:17,636
Anyway, it's not good for you
to eat sweets while sick.

402
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:20,236
Shall we…

403
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,470
throw it away?

404
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,069
It's safer.

405
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:33,202
Have some soup.

406
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:34,336
Okay.

407
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:42,970
Almost there.

408
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,236
- Okay.
- Come on, straight ahead.

409
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:46,268
- A bit to the left.
- Okay, to the left.

410
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:48,136
To the right, good, move forward.

411
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:49,102
- Wait a minute, to the left.
- What are you doing?

412
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:50,602
- Move forward.
- So mysterious.

413
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:53,303
Of course, we need to simulate
your date with Cindy.

414
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:54,636
Okay, in a moment,

415
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:55,836
you can cover her eyes

416
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:57,403
and take her here.

417
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:01,069
But,

418
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,803
if I take her here,

419
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,869
what about Zhang Shiping and Yi?

420
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,570
I will get them out of the way.

421
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,470
This is a very important part of the plan.

422
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,069
When you get to this point,

423
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,202
you will ask her,

424
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:13,470
'Are you ready?'

425
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,936
- And then…
- 'Are you ready?'

426
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:21,836
You…

427
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:23,202
When did you prepare this?

428
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:24,470
And that.

429
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,470
Of course, I did it in secret.

430
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,069
Otherwise, how would it be a surprise?

431
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,169
So,

432
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,035
the lighting is beautiful,

433
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:34,169
and the atmosphere is great.
When she arrives later,

434
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,535
I can just confess directly to her, right?

435
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,570
No, that's too direct.

436
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,169
- Is it?
- You need to set the stage.

437
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:40,903
Come, come over here.

438
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:42,102
Set the stage for what?

439
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,636
Let me teach you, come, sit here.

440
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,403
Let's simulate it.

441
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,403
Pretend you're Cindy.

442
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:50,268
The external atmosphere now

443
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,737
is all set.

444
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:54,268
But the internal buildup is also important.

445
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,702
With gourmet food at hand,

446
00:21:55,702 --> 00:21:57,936
you should chat while eating with her.

447
00:21:57,936 --> 00:21:59,336
Ideally,

448
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,102
drink a little wine.

449
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,970
And when she feels cold,

450
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,435
you can

451
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,570
do this.

452
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,152
♫ I'm going to love you ♫

453
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:24,287
♫ Whether the world allows it or not ♫

454
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:27,584
♫ Ignoring rumors, it pours like rain ♫

455
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,656
♫ As long as you're willing, I'll be firm ♫

456
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,344
♫ I'm going to love you ♫

457
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:35,602
♫ No matter who disapproves ♫

458
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:36,836
Well…

459
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,169
I get it, yes.

460
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,268
That's a nice move.

461
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:44,836
Weird, it's already dark.

462
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,369
Why haven't they arrived yet?

463
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,268
I'll send a message and ask her.

464
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,803
Okay.

465
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:57,268
- Once washed, just put it over there.
- Okay.

466
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,268
I'll leave the rest to you.

467
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,570
Working in exchange for accommodation.

468
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,936
Okay, Boss.

469
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,136
[Meng Heng]
Where are you now?

470
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,535
Have you arrived at the villa?

471
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:10,570
I'm just asking.

472
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,535
Haha.

473
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:14,136
We've arrived

474
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:16,869
at my dad's country mansion.

475
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:23,035
What's wrong?

476
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,570
Sorry about today.

477
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,503
Your country villa trip

478
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:29,535
turned into this.

479
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:31,702
Not at all.

480
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,069
I think

481
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,236
this kind of simplicity is wonderful.

482
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:37,069
It's an unexpected episode.

483
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:40,669
But Yi must be very disappointed, right?

484
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,769
Don't worry.

485
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,936
She is the most excited one right now.

486
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:46,336
Your dad keeps coming up with
new things for her to play with.

487
00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:48,169
She just came over and told me

488
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,702
that she wanted to tell her classmates
when she goes back

489
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:53,369
about her visit to her grandpa's
place in the countryside.

490
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,403
Give it a try.

491
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:03,535
Is it sweet?

492
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,470
Yes. Do you want to try it?

493
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:09,769
It's very sweet.

494
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:18,435
Plans can't keep up with changes.

495
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:20,970
Changes can't keep up with a call from Cindy.

496
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:23,470
Meng Heng.

497
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,003
Did you get the address of Cindy's hometown?

498
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,003
I asked.

499
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:28,803
She just doesn't read or reply.

500
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:30,636
Then you should call her.

501
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,503
Calling directly to ask
seems too deliberate, right?

502
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,136
She'll notice.

503
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:36,268
Right.

504
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,069
What are you doing?

505
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,202
He's putting Yi to bed.

506
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:45,636
What exactly are you up to?

507
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:51,903
[Rejuvenation and Kidney Tonic Wine]
This is made with deer antlers and Chinese yam.

508
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:54,236
Rejuvenation and Kidney Tonic Wine.

509
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,503
In a moment, pour a glass for Shiping to drink.

510
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:58,602
I guarantee it will make him full of energy.

511
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:00,268
Stop talking nonsense.

512
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:02,069
How can there be a dad like you?

513
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,769
My kind of dad

514
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,702
is rare to find.

515
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:09,503
You're considered a high-risk
pregnant woman now.

516
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:11,035
Fight on.

517
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:14,435
Do you really hope that I date him?

518
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:16,602
He has a daughter. You don't mind?

519
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,903
If you don't mind, why should I?

520
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,136
Besides, I've always wanted a grandchild.

521
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,737
Now is just the right time.

522
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,003
Yi is adorable, isn't she?

523
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,035
Right.

524
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:28,336
Of course she's adorable if you are
not the one taking care of her.

525
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,702
Really?

526
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,003
Do you not think Yi is cute?

527
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,903
I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth.

528
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,303
You'll be a stepmother.

529
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:36,435
Be careful not to end up disliked by everyone.

530
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,602
How could that be?
Is there anything I can't handle?

531
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:42,869
Listen to me.

532
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:45,503
You need to be mentally prepared.

533
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,303
You and Shiping

534
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:49,970
are not like other couples.

535
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,136
Others start off one-on-one,

536
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,503
treating each other as their whole world.

537
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:57,102
But if anything happens between you and him,

538
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:59,636
his daughter will always come first.

539
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,970
Is that why your previous

540
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,869
girlfriends all dumped you?

541
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,003
Don't talk nonsense.

542
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:09,570
I dumped them.

543
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,869
I got tired.

544
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,169
Is that so?

545
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:14,369
Of course.

546
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,268
- Sorry.
- No problem.

547
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:18,836
- Yi got very excited.
- Come on, have a seat.

548
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,570
She has only just fallen asleep.

549
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,936
Let me tell you,

550
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,503
in our countryside area here,

551
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:24,769
there's a big temperature difference.

552
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:27,003
So, I prepared a medicinal liquor

553
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,602
for strengthening the body.

554
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:29,702
Thank you.

555
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,035
Come on.

556
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:33,737
Come on.

557
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:35,136
You really know I'm weak.

558
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,035
Thank you, I'll drink first.

559
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,169
I'm sorry.

560
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,403
How could I have known I would

561
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,702
get so dizzy?

562
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:47,136
- I…
- Come on.

563
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,435
Let me sit for a bit.

564
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:49,470
I'll sit for a bit.

565
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:52,236
Never mind, I'll lie down.

566
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,136
Just let me lie down for a while.
That will be good.

567
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,836
I'll lie down for a bit.

568
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:58,102
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

569
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,289
[Certificate of Award]

570
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:24,470
No, not that one.

571
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,503
No.

572
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:28,169
You can't.

573
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:32,336
You can't look.

574
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:34,336
You've got quite a talent for art.

575
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:36,602
This is

576
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:38,169
what I did as a joke

577
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:40,136
when I was a kid.

578
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:45,669
People say

579
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:46,702
you can tell from a person's room

580
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:48,570
what kind of person they are.

581
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,003
I truly believe you are

582
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,169
someone who is straightforward
and has a personality.

583
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:56,003
I used to cut out

584
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,268
pictures I liked from magazines

585
00:27:58,268 --> 00:27:59,336
and paste them

586
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:00,869
on the wall.

587
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:02,570
It's a bit messy, sorry.

588
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,803
I saw in your sketchbook just now

589
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:07,869
that there was a drawing

590
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,503
of Wonder Woman.

591
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:10,803
Right?

592
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:13,369
Which signifies

593
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:16,570
that you've had a strong sense
of justice since you were little,

594
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,336
willing to stand up against injustice.

595
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,602
I want to thank heaven

596
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:38,803
for giving me the chance to know you

597
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:43,003
so we can start our future together.

598
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:12,069
That liquor.

599
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:15,836
Good, take it easy and spit it out.

600
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:35,836
I know.

601
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:37,503
I know.

602
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,836
The process of expelling bacteria from the body

603
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,970
might be a bit tough.

604
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,202
But

605
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:46,003
I want to tell you

606
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,102
that I'll always be by your side

607
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,570
accompanying you through it

608
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:57,236
until you are fully recovered.

609
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:05,998
♫ The person who has nothing to do with me ♫

610
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:08,352
♫ I've entrusted myself to him ♫

611
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:11,840
♫ Memories are not default ♫

612
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,922
♫ I provide false testimony ♫

613
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:17,991
♫ The role of a passing character ♫

614
00:30:17,991 --> 00:30:21,200
♫ No one plays it better than me ♫

615
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:27,208
♫ As you turn around,
there's a new journey ahead ♫

616
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,260
♫ I'm still standing here responding ♫

617
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,856
♫ The eternal self-questioning ♫

618
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:42,069
♫ It's also a kind of responsibility ♫

619
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:44,336
Look, it's a river.

620
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:46,702
- It's a field.
- Yi.

621
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:48,202
Is it fun?

622
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:49,602
Yeah!

623
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:50,737
Grandpa, look.

624
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:52,636
It's a scarecrow.

625
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:53,669
Scarecrow.

626
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,069
They don't have those in Taipei, right?

627
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,202
Yeah.

628
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,535
I've only seen it in cartoons

629
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,303
or in online videos.

630
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:03,769
And this is my first time seeing

631
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,169
an actual scarecrow.

632
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:06,236
Really?

633
00:31:06,236 --> 00:31:07,769
Later, when we come back,

634
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,236
let's take a picture with the scarecrow.

635
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,836
Grandpa will take it for you, okay?

636
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,035
Okay.

637
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,069
Pops, what kind of alcohol is that?

638
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,769
It's got such a strong kick.

639
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:18,869
You were not helping me at all.

640
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:20,602
You're basically laying me out flat.

641
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:21,769
You're up.

642
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:25,268
Let me do it.

643
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:27,136
It's okay, I'm almost done.

644
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,737
Sit down first, take a rest.

645
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,803
To ease the hangover headache,

646
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:34,236
you can admire this handsome guy's

647
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:35,669
clothes-drying show.

648
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:40,470
Well, mister,

649
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,836
aren't you wearing too much?

650
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:44,470
If you wore a little less,
it would be more pleasing to the eye.

651
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:46,102
Do you want to see that?

652
00:31:46,636 --> 00:31:47,803
Sure.

653
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:49,535
User pays.

654
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:57,869
Where is my dad?

655
00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:59,470
And Yi?

656
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,602
Your dad said he was going to buy breakfast,

657
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:03,503
and Yi volunteered to help.

658
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:04,970
They have been out for a while.

659
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,136
They should be back soon.

660
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,769
Excuse me, is anyone there?

661
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,636
Meng Heng?

662
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,970
Are you surprised?

663
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:24,003
I bought a lot.

664
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,035
Eat as much as you can.

665
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:27,136
If it's not enough, I'll buy more.

666
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,102
- Here you go.
- Help yourself.

667
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:29,268
This egg pancake.

668
00:32:29,268 --> 00:32:30,403
This egg pancake is really good.

669
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:31,202
- Thanks.
- Give it a try.

670
00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:32,602
- It's great.
- Thank you.

671
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:33,602
Let me tell you.

672
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:36,003
This egg pancake is one of those
traditional, old-style batter pancakes,

673
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:37,702
which are rare in Taipei.

674
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,035
It's really special.

675
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:41,169
So, Yi, do you want to eat
an egg pancake or a steamed bun?

676
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,268
- I want a steamed bun.
- Okay.

677
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:44,936
It's okay, Daddy will share some
of my egg pancake with you.

678
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:46,369
Come on.

679
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:47,403
Here.

680
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:50,268
Mr. Wang, this is a gift for you as we meet.

681
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,003
Wishing you good health and all the best.

682
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:55,003
That's so kind of you.

683
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:57,403
Okay.

684
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:59,936
But how did you know where my hometown was?

685
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,035
I took Meng Heng's car out for fun.

686
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:06,737
I was just chatting with Duomi in the car,

687
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,702
and somehow we talked about how

688
00:33:08,702 --> 00:33:11,535
your hometown was nearby, so we
thought we'd stop by and say hello.

689
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:14,535
Right, you said yesterday that you were
going back to your hometown.

690
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:17,035
So we thought we'd swing by and say hello.

691
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:18,268
Yeah.

692
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:21,003
Young man, that's very considerate.

693
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:22,470
Just play if you're out to play,

694
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,936
and to go out of your way to visit your master.

695
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,303
I know my daughter's personality best.

696
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:29,236
Her personality is tough and hard to deal with.

697
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,102
As her apprentice,

698
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:33,669
it's hard work, isn't it?

699
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:35,336
Not at all.

700
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:37,702
You know how Cindy is.

701
00:33:37,702 --> 00:33:39,069
She's sharp-tongued

702
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:40,737
but kind-hearted.

703
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,336
Did you hear that?

704
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:43,403
Wait a moment.

705
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:45,702
I, I bought this for you.

706
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:46,836
Here.

707
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,369
Oat milk latte, no sugar.

708
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,236
Thank you.

709
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,836
Grandpa.

710
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:57,936
What are we going to play in a bit?

711
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,903
We're going to play

712
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:02,669
roasting sweet potatoes in a kiln.
How about that?

713
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:04,003
Yeah.

714
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:05,937
I don't think so.

715
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:07,603
The kiln roasting will get our hands dirty.

716
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:09,136
No, let's not do that.

717
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:11,035
I knew you Taipei greenhorns

718
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:13,068
wouldn't have done it before.

719
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,937
Today, I

720
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:16,636
will take you all to experience

721
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:17,937
what's called

722
00:34:17,937 --> 00:34:20,169
the local rural life.

723
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,603
Eat up quickly.

724
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:25,736
- Okay.
- Okay.

725
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:29,369
Let me tell you.

726
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,436
Wrap that egg with the sweet potato

727
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,470
and bring it over later.

728
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,269
- Okay.
- Bring it here.

729
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:34,535
Yi, come, let's go.

730
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:35,503
- Alright, it's almost time.
- Let's go.

731
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:36,503
Let's go.

732
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:37,470
- Be careful.
- Go, hurry up.

733
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,702
- Okay.
- Let's hurry.

734
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,702
Go.

735
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:42,535
We're number one.

736
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:43,770
- Hurry up.
- Come here.

737
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,937
Come on.

738
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,736
Use the aluminum foil and wrap

739
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:50,035
- the sweet potatoes up. Leave the rest to me.
- Okay.

740
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:51,970
- Alright.
- Wrap this one.

741

Come on.

742
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:55,569
Good, this will be quicker.

743
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:00,636
- It's just soil, right?
- Let's wait for the sweet potatoes.

744
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:03,436
It's nothing, right?

745

Are you okay?

746
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,503
- Okay, is this okay?
- Yeah.

747
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:10,169
- Okay.
- Don't.

748
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:12,103
I'll take this plate to Mr. Wang first.

749
00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:13,202
Okay.

752
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:26,269

753

to show her that I'm someone who isn't
afraid of hardship, fatigue, or dirt.

754
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:33,436
You're basically just creating more alone time
for Zhang Shiping and Cindy.

755
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:37,702
- Well, you take it, I'll go back to my defense.
- Okay.

756

Hey, that young person, come here.

757
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,669
Young people have greater lung capacity.

758
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:44,003

759
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:45,402
- I…
- Come over here.

760
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:46,636
Okay.

761
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,836
Doing chores for Mr. Wang
should also score points.

762
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:54,503
Alright, go quickly.

763
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:01,303
Don't make any noise with your blowing.

764
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:05,470
Okay.

765
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,603
Like this.

766
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:10,303
According to what your dad and Yi said,

767
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:11,569
I think

768
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,836
Yi seems to be having a lot of fun.

769
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:15,702
I just need some time

770
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:17,503
to overcome my fear.

771
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:19,068
It's fine.

772
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,535
Are you sure?

773
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:21,970
It's not a big deal.

774
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,503
I… I can do it.

775
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,836
Is this better?

776
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:36,235
Holding me tighter would be better.

777
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,369
How about this way?

778
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:43,669
Much better.

779

No worries.

00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:07,736
Much better.

By the way, is there new furniture

789

790
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:18,636
Like a dining table or a sofa or something?

791
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:21,535
All of it.

792
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:23,702
I want to replace all the furniture that I can.

793
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:26,202
I want to have a new life.

794
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:31,470
That's pretty good.

795
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,068
Changing decorations, changing furniture,

796
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:34,803
it's also a good chance to change the mood.

797
00:37:34,803 --> 00:37:36,068
I'm with you.

Okay, it should be fine.

Okay.

Wait a moment.

- Okay.

If there's more behind, will you look back too?

00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,103

As if that's true.

If you ask me,

00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,035
I would choose Shiping.

Is your friend also called Han Xinzheng?

848
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:50,202
Just like the name of our

It's him.

851
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:57,770
Why is he calling you?

852
00:42:00,535 --> 00:42:03,803
Because he is the Executive Director
of my new company.

853
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:43,470
Did you see me at the furniture store

854
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,970
and feel bad?

855
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,068

856
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:56,402
Don't call me.

Stop sending things to my house.

And don't ask the administrator
about me anymore.

859

Close the door.

860
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:31,202
Why?

00:43:31,202 --> 00:43:32,470
Why exactly?

862
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,136
Do you know what he has done?

863
00:43:34,136 --> 00:43:35,669
He's corrupt, and he framed me.

864
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:36,937
He's scum.

865
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:38,103
Why would you employ someone like him?

866
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:40,569
Are there really no other people
in the world you can use?

Can I have my turn now?

870
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:48,402
Give me a reason.

871
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:51,702
Because I…

872
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:53,336
My company is in urgent need of people,

873
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:55,202

from land development to PR engagements.

00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:01,970
He is not a good person.

878
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,269
Of course, I've considered that.

879
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,603
But he has already been punished,
