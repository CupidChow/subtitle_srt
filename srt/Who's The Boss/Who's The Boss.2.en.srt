Not at all.

someone to maintain contact.

180
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,465
Cindy doesn't quite fit as a secretary?

181
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:16,197
It's not that she's unsuitable.

182
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,931
It's that she wouldn't last long, honestly.

183

With Cindy Wang's personality,

184
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,465

She would definitely feel
that the secretary's job isn't challenging,

186
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,130
and would quit immediately.

187
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,163
I don't think so.

188
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:28,931
She just bought a house
and is under mortgage pressure.

189
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,298
And with her personality,

190
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,497
She'll definitely investigate

191
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,197
the plagiarism incident to the end.

192
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,398
I also think so.

193
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,298
I actually think she should hurry up
and find a man

194
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,330
to get married.

195
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,265
That way, I can avenge myself.

196
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,697
What do you mean?

197
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:45,465
Do you have an issue with Cindy?

198
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:51,364
Director, why did you
tell the client that I resigned?

199
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,098
The client misunderstood on their own.

200
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:57,030
I meant that you're married
and on marriage leave.

201
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,465
Then why did you say you don't know

202
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:00,163
when they asked when I would be back?

203
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,364
Even if I come back from leave,

204
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:04,163
I'd still have time to handle
this development case.

205
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,030
I really didn't notice the time.

206
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,130
And what if you have to extend your leave?

207
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,765
Shouldn't I explain to the client?

208
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,130
You're actually misleading the client.

209
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,398
Do you have an opinion about me?

210
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:17,731
No.

211
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,765
I'm just taking precautions.

212
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,265
You're on marriage leave now.

213
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:23,098
What if you accidentally
find out you're pregnant?

214
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,231
Then you'll have to take maternity leave,
and paternity leave as well.

215
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,465
Don't you think you should
find a job substitute first?

216
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,064
Isn't that reasonable?

217
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,697
What if your life plans change later on,

218
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:31,163
and you want to return to family life?

219
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,130
Shouldn't I just wish you well and let you go?

220
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,364
In the end, someone will still
have to take your place.

221
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,465
It's only been three days.

222
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,163
But it feels like three years.

223
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:51,864
I can hardly hold on anymore.

224
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:53,864
Think about your mortgage, hang in there.

225
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:57,497
But do you know how many sarcastic comments
I've heard these three days?

226
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,665
With your intelligence,

227
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,330
you can surely turn around gracefully.

228
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,832
Yes, I can be graceful.

229
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:03,864
I can listen to the sarcasm.

230
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:07,265
The work of a secretary doesn't even
require one percent of my brain power, okay?

231
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:08,898
Isn't that good?

232
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:10,997
Just do whatever the higher-ups assign.

233
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,598
One command, one action.

234
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,298
Why bother using your brain?

235
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,832
Otherwise, do you want to be like us?

236
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,197
Calculating accounts every day

237
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:18,798
until you get a lot of gray hair?

238
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,898
I'd rather be this way than be a vase.

239
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:24,265
Being a vase is quite nice.

240
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:27,364
Looking pretty every day for others to admire.

241
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,098
Let me tell you, without a bit of charm

242
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:31,163
you can't be a secretary.

243
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,632
Is that so?

244
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,330
Then do you think Chen is beautiful?

245
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,431
Chen.

246
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,598
Speaking of Chen, let me tell you.

247
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,163
I'm really afraid of ending up like Chen.

248
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:44,765
I think Chen is very good.

249
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,731
Do you know what her work entails every day?

250
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,598
It's to accompany Mr. Cai to play golf.

251
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,098
Handing towels, and handing water.

252
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,130
Sometimes serving tea.

253
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,231
And giving medication,

254
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,465
I really don't know if she's a secretary

255
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:56,130
or a nurse.

256
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,465
Chen is right behind us.

257
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:00,163
Also, did you know she sits by
Mr. Cai's office door every day

258
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,564
doing some clerical work?

259
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:02,997
Such a simple job

260
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,030
doesn't really need her at all.

261
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,564
Don't you think anyone could do it?

262
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:10,098
See, you've got nothing
to refute me now, do you?

263
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:12,963
Indeed.

264
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:22,765
Chen.

265
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,931
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:25,465
I didn't mean that, I…

267
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:27,431
No need to apologize.

268
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:29,530
You must find the job of a secretary

269
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,765
- very easy to handle.
- I don't…

270
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,398
No need for my guidance anymore.

271
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:37,465
I…

272
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,098
Chen…

273
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,798
Why didn't you say anything just now?

274
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,364
I didn't hint you?

275
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:45,697
I gave you so many hints.

276
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:46,931
You ignored them all.

277
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,465
Can you speak plainly?

278
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:51,330
I do, I just haven't…

279
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,598
Plain language.

280
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:56,098
Could you please not create rubbish?

281
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,632
Then what is this?

282
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:58,931
I threw them on the table.

283
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,130
Why did you throw it on the floor?

284
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:05,864
Eat well before dying.

285
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:08,497
I wonder if it's better to die spicy

286
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:11,431
or to die salty.

287
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,931
Better die spicy.

288
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:19,098
Seriously…

289
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:22,439
I'm sorry.

290
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,364
Director Zhang.

291
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,697
What a coincidence.

292
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,197
I understand.

293
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,798
Sometimes when people are in a bad mood,

294
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:45,898
they rely on eating this
to calm their emotions.

295
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:53,197
Like this kind of frozen food,

296
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:55,030
these snacks, and everyday items.

297
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,665
It's best to store them separately.

298
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:02,030
I…

299
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,497
Director Zhang.

300
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,931
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,098
Regarding that proposal,

302
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,497
it must have troubled you.

303
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:11,898
But please believe me.

304
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:15,765
I definitely didn't plagiarize.

305
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,530
You don't have to apologize to me.

306
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,465
Although we haven't known each other for long,

307
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,798
and don't know each other that well,

308
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,731
but I'm good at judging people.

309
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,098
So, you believe me?

310
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,364
I do.

311
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:30,632
Because your self-respect

312
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:33,398
will absolutely not allow you to do that.

313
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,864
Right, self-respect and self-confidence

314
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,864
are the two major elements for success.

315
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,265
I really like your proposal.

316
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:45,832
And the construction company
is a company with integrity.

317
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:49,265
So, I'll insist on continuing cooperation.

318
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,832
Thank you.

319
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,697
But what I'm more curious about is

320
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,064
what exactly happened

321
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:57,765
during this time.

322
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,398
I'm even more curious than you.

323
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:00,731
But give me some time.

324
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:03,731
I'll definitely find out.

325
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,997
But before that…

326
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,665
It seems you are not in a good mood.

327
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:14,231
I have a quick way to soothe the mood.

328
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,330
You have cola.

329
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,731
We need to buy ice cream and paper cups.

330
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:21,298
Come on, follow me.

331
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,931
Here.

332
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,665
Then I'll pour you some cola.

333
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,231
Half a cup is fine.

334
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:35,832
- Half a cup.
- Right.

335
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,064
Is that enough? OK.

336
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:41,465
Okay, you hold this.

337
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:48,731
Then take this ice cream.

338
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,364
This is…

339
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:53,364
And put it in.

340
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,098
Stir it up.

341
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:56,997
How could it be like this?

342
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,798
The magic has begun.

343
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:01,731
Isn't it amazing?

344
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,931
- Right.
- Here it comes.

345
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,898
This…

346
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,697
You know what's really amazing?

347
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:16,130
It's that when you burp,

348
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,431
all the unhappy and unfortunate things

349
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:21,064
will all vanish like smoke.

350
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:26,465
Alright, your turn.

351
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:27,731
My turn?

352
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:30,098
- I…
- Here, fill it up to seven-tenths.

353
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:32,564
Aren't you in a bad mood too?

354
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,265
Come on, fill it to seven-tenths.

355
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,898
Seven-tenths full.

356
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,997
Yes.

357
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:44,798
All right, that's enough.

358
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,465
Let me tell you.

359
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,731
Adding this chocolate flavor

360
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:52,765
makes it even better.

361
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,963
Here it comes.

362
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,364
Be careful.

363
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:58,898
So magical.

364
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:01,231
You try.

365
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:16,431
How is it? Are you feeling a bit better?

366
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,765
Yes.

367
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,564
Do you want to know

368
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:27,765
why I chose your proposal?

369
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,264
Why?

370
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,831
Livability is also about relocation.

371
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,898
When you move your living space,

372
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:40,365
you get more freedom to express yourself.

373
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,064
Allowing the home space
to be without constraints.

374
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,131
But instead a bigger playground.

375
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,831
This is our concept for young people

376
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,564
starting families.

377
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,031
Livability

378
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,064
is also relocation.

379
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:54,031
I like this title.

380
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,430
But I like

381
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,465
the way how you're

382
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,531
people-oriented,

383
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:03,430
planning sales with the heart
to take care of the family.

384
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,264
Making having a home of your own.

385
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:08,365
No longer about compromising.

386
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:11,698
Nor so unattainable.

387
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,298
Maybe it's because

388
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,764
I also desperately want a nest of my own.

389
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:20,064
But why did this move you?

390
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,698
My phone.

391
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,231
Hello.

392
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,731
You're home now.

393
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:34,731
Okay.

394
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:36,497
Such a gentle expression.

395
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:39,398
Must be talking to his girlfriend, right?

396
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,997
I'll be back in a moment.

397
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:46,131
I thought he was single.

398
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,231
Sorry.

399
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,298
Thank you for the little tip.

400
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,163
I'll go back first.

401
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,330
Of course.

403
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:57,064
Bye.

404

Then the Coke…

405
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,764
I'll handle it.

406
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:00,930
Thank you.

407
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,131
Bye.

408
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:09,898
Director Zhang trusts me

409
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:12,497
and appreciates me so much.

410
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,731
I must find the person who framed me

411
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,097
to prove my innocence.

I'm Cindy Wang from the construction company.

415
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:32,497
I wanted to ask about your recent proposal.

416
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:35,330
Did you come up with it yourself?

417
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:37,865
Okay, then tell me

418
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,597
how did you get that data?

419
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:41,531
Hello?

420
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,632
Hello?

421
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:45,097
Can't believe this person hung up on me.

423
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:49,798
Vice President, good morning.

424
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,430
It's not my boyfriend.

425
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,632
Then why did you sound so agitated?

426
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,298
It's just someone I knew before.

427
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:57,564
An employee at Tai Yue Construction.

428
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:59,831
I asked him if their proposal
was their own idea,

429
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,731
and he actually hung up on me.

430
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:02,964
Even if he's foolish,

431
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:04,764
he couldn't possibly tell you.

432
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:06,264
I know that.

433
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,764
But even if it's a foolish way,

434
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,365
I have to try it.

435
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,465
Besides, he just hung up on me,

436
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:13,031
which means he's feeling guilty.

437
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,264
Have I told you

438
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,831
that I really appreciate

439
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:20,698

442
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,064
Of course.

443
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:30,764
After all, I've been in this industry
longer than you have.

444
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:33,698
I have a wider network and definitely
more information than you.

You have to find me even for a paper jam?

Strange, back when the department
didn't have a secretary,

00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:13,531
Don't worry.

556
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:14,698
Aside from dropping the phone,

557
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:16,999
I don't remember anything else.

558
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:20,455
OK.

559
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,865
Done writing.

560
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:27,131
Is this manager's signature for you to sign?

561
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,798
Do I look like a manager?

562
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,798
Sorry.

563
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:37,264
Hello, Zhou.

564
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:41,031
The vice president is looking for me?

565
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:42,131
What?

566
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,398
It was actually Lu Yicheng who betrayed me.

567
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:45,465
Stay calm.

568
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:46,465
Don't get excited, sit down.

569
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:47,632
How do you expect me to stay calm?

570
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:51,163
Why, for what reason, for what cause?

571
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:54,398
According to what I've found out,

572
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,597
Lu Yicheng says you scold
and berate him all day long.

573
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,231
And you steal his achievements.

574
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,531
If he hadn't done anything wrong,

575
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:02,632
would I scold him?

576
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:03,831
I'm teaching him.

577
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,264
Who's stealing his performance?

578
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,865
He himself has low EQ.

579
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,964
Telling customers not to buy
if they can't afford it.

580
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,430
I was just smoothing things over.

581
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,365
In the end, it was the customer
who specifically requested my service.

582
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,930
I know all this.

583
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,964
So, you see,

584
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:18,731
it's just that young man, Lu Yicheng,
who doesn't understand.

585
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:20,465
That's why he would take your proposal,

586
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:21,764
and sneak it to Tai Yue.

587
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:23,330
Trying to disrupt the market.

588
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,997
I'm going to find him right now.

589
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:27,264
What are you going to find him for now?

590
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:29,163
To confront him and clear my name.

591
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:30,898
And to tell him that's not
how one should behave.

592
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,831
Do you think he'll admit it?

593
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,097
I can't just act like this never happened,

594
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:36,698
and pretend he never did this.

595
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:38,031
Of course.

596
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,064
But your rash actions might tip them off.

597
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:44,330
Then we won't be able to find
the evidence to clear your name.

598
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,531
Right.

599
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,798
I need to find evidence.

600
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:48,798
Then how should I look for it?

601
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:50,365
What can I do?

602
00:26:50,365 --> 00:26:52,898
As for you, there's nothing you need to do.

603
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,898
That way they won't be on their guard.

604
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:59,031
Only then will I have a chance
to help you find the evidence.

605
00:27:00,198 --> 00:27:02,298
You're always so considerate.

606
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:03,798
Thank you, Vice President.

607
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:05,531
Don't mention it.

608
00:27:05,531 --> 00:27:07,764
I really hope this matter can end soon.

609
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,865
Clear my name and let me get back
to work as soon as possible.

610
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:11,330
And continue working as a secretary

611
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,365
is really bored to death.

612
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,798
This is the first time I've heard someone say

613
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,330
'The work is too easy, it's boring'.

614
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,831
What I mean is

615
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:26,064
the work of a secretary
is a bit less challenging.

616
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,564
Rest assured.

617
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,398
Just give me a little more time.

618
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,865
I promise to let you showcase your talents,

619
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:35,163
and return to the top.

620
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:37,298
Thank you, Vice President.

621
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:40,398
You really are a good person.

622
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:00,398
I have finished reading this one.

623
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:02,632
OK.

624
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:06,497
Are you in a good mood or a bad mood?

625
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:08,163
Isn't it obvious?

626
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:10,564
I'm humming a song.

627
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,597
Not really, because you're tone-deaf.

628
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,865
I can hardly tell.

629
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,163
Forget it.

630
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,163
I'm in too good a mood today
to nitpick with you.

631
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:24,031
Here, this is the personnel structure
of our company,

632
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:26,097
and the business scope of each department.

633
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:27,298
Familiarize yourself with it.

634
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,930
So that, when we have meetings
or need to send out documents later,

635
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,664
you'll know where to send them.

636
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:33,764
Okay.

637
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:37,564
Construction Company Business Division, hello.

638
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:40,097
[Director Zhang Shiming]
You sound in a good mood.

639
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:42,531
Is there any good news?

640
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:44,997
Director Zhang.

641
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:46,698
Indeed, there is good news.

642
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:50,731
To put it simply, I should be able to return to

643
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,198
my original good condition soon.

644
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,231
I'm looking forward to

645
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:56,798
you who was so spirited during my presentation.

646
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:58,731
Thank you, Director Zhang.

647
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:01,298
Are you looking for our Miss Gao?

648
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:03,564
(No, she has gone out)

649
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:05,398
She had social engagements and has left first.

650
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:08,731
Do you have anything special
you need to see her for?

651
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:12,330
It's nothing urgent. The day is almost over.
I'll come bother you tomorrow.

652
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,531
Alright, we'll be in touch tomorrow then.

653
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:17,798
Bye.

654
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,997
May I ask you?

655
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:26,865
Why do you have to be so gossipy
when talking with clients?

656
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:30,964
I was going to scold you.

657
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,798
But I'm really in too good a mood.

658
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,497
So, I'll just take the chance to teach you.

659
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:36,564
You can increase your chances of making a deal

660
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:38,231
by speaking

661
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:40,664
with genuine emotion.

662
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:42,698
Do you understand?

663
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,064
Got it.

664
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,231
Did you finish watching it?
Have you memorized it?

665
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,597
I'll go watch it now.

666
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,632
Let your enemy indulge in comfort.

667
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:04,764
And lose their fighting spirit.

668
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:08,198
[The Art of War]

669
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:09,898
Miss, please come this way.

670
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:11,997
Thank you.

671
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:22,632
Why did you choose this restaurant
so unexpectedly?

672
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:24,865
Why not choose the one you like?

673
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,231
I did choose the one I like.

674
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:30,264
I've chosen my favorite person,

675
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:32,997
and the restaurant I like.

676
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,564
You really know how to talk.

677
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:39,264
To celebrate your promotion to Sales Manager,

678
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,930
I'm giving you a gift.

679
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,831
That's great, there's also a gift!

680
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:52,097
It's so beautiful.

681
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:53,531
Do you like it?

682
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:55,198
I like it a lot.

683
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:57,664
Let me put it on for you.

684
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,497
Does it look good?

685
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,531
Yes.

686
00:31:13,531 --> 00:31:16,764
I indeed understand my woman well.

687
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:20,564
It's so pretty, can't stop looking at it.

688
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:24,531
As beautiful as I had imagined.

689
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:26,865
I thought you would say

690
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:30,163
it's even more beautiful than you imagined.

691
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,231
I just like you now

692
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:33,564
with a confident smile.

693
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:36,731
That sets my heart fluttering all over again.

694
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:41,198
Stop teasing and hurry up to order.

695
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:45,898
Oh, that's right.

696
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:47,731
How did I hear

697
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:50,163
that you don't let Cindy Wang work?

698
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:52,632
Why?

699
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:55,231
You don't understand me well.

700
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:57,930
Then you guess.

701
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:01,131
I guess

702
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,865
you want to make Cindy Wang

703
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:05,298
so bored she panics,

704
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,997
and then come to beg you.

705
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:12,465
I just want her to fall into the trap herself.

706
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,831
Hearing you say this,

707
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:18,564
was it not me pursuing you in the beginning,

708
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:22,031
but me walking into a trap?

709
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:28,264
A smart hunter often
disguises himself as the prey.

710
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:35,330
What do you want to eat?

711
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,231
Zhou.

712
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,430
- Morning.
- Morning, Cindy.

713
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,997
Could you buy me a cup of

714
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:04,865
oat milk latte, no ice?

715
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:06,865
Thank you.

716
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:08,632
Okay, I'll buy you the oat milk latte.

717
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:11,487
Good, thank you.

718
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:12,798
Wait for me outside.

719
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:14,632
Okay, thank you.

720
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:16,365
Good morning,
what would you like to order today?

721
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:19,064
Hello, I want an oat milk latte, no ice.

722
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,131
And then…

723
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,031
Thank you.

724
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:26,365
You also help out.

725
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:28,531
In the morning, Xiaoyun…

726
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,131
Miss Gao…

727
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:34,264
How is it enough for Miss Gao
to only drink oat milk latte for breakfast?

728
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,665
So, I bought her

729
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,365
an extra smoked chicken sandwich.

730
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:39,365
You bring it to her together.

731
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,064
This oat milk latte is mine.

732
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:43,930
I didn't plan to buy her breakfast.

733
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,464
Then let the mistake be mistaken.

734
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,898
I'll take this to her for you.

735
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:52,764
So, you buy breakfast
for Vice President Han every day?

736
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:53,797
Otherwise, how could you misunderstand me

737
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:57,198
buying breakfast for Gao Shuangyun?

738
00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:00,498
- Going to work.
- I'll transfer money to you later.

739
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:07,764
Chen delivers water,
medicine and takes blood pressure.

740
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:11,464
Zhou is responsible for buying breakfast.

741
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:15,031
Do secretaries really
have to do so many things?

742
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:17,064
People climb to higher places.

743
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:19,865
The limbs are really weakened.

744
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:23,464
And need the secretary to be your nanny.

745
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,231
Cindy.

746
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:30,130
Thank you for preparing breakfast for me.

747
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,264
How did you know I don't like
mayonnaise on my sandwich?

748
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:33,698
How much is it?

749
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,331
That sandwich was bought
by the vice president's secretary, Zhou.

750
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:39,264
I'm not that considerate.

751
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:40,698
I was wondering why

752
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:42,930
you would know my preferences?

753
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,764
It's okay, I'll thank him

754
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:46,631
when I see him.

755
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:49,930
Zhou actually knew?

756
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:53,797
Have you ever thought about

757
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:56,631
what your secretary should be like?

758
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,865
Then have you thought about

759
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:03,097
what kind of secretary you should be?

760
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:05,631
This is beyond my understanding.

761
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:07,564
I feel like I could never be
a secretary in my life.

762
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,331
I don't know.

763
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:12,331
Right, please help me find the intern,
Meng Heng.

764
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:13,531
While everyone is here,

765
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,097
let's make a formal introduction.

766
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,831
Okay.

767
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:21,130
Hello everyone, I'm the new intern
in the sales department.

768
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,498
My name is Meng Heng.

769
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,930
Meng as in Mencius, Heng as in eternal.

770
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,365
Please guide me in the future, seniors.

771
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:29,464
If there's anything you need,

772
00:35:29,464 --> 00:35:30,597
just let me know.

773
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:33,331
- Welcome.
- The young one has a good attitude.

774
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,264
Okay, you chose the sales department correctly.

775
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:37,698
The key point is that he's handsome.

776
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,464
Suits our sales department.

777
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:41,130
Alright, this time,

778
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,631
the managers of several departments
have discussed

779
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:44,898
in order to allow this group of interns

780
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,531
to learn more systematically,

781
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:48,264
we've decided to adopt a one-on-one

782
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:51,797
master-apprentice approach.

783
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:54,130
Because all the seniors are very good.

784
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,797
So, it's a bit hard to choose at the moment.

785
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:59,498
Just pick one first.

786
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:02,564
After all,
everyone will take turns mentoring you.

787
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:04,998
Okay then.

788
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,430
I choose…

789
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,930
Cindy.

790
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,264
- Cindy.
- He chose Cindy?

791
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:15,832
And here I was saying he's smart.

792
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:16,865
I got it now.

793
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:18,297
- It was just yesterday.
- Yesterday.

794
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:19,430
When Meng Heng

795
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,564
was bringing flowers into the office,

796
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:22,164
he called Cindy Miss Wang.

797
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:23,631
So, you two knew each other before.

798
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,764
We…

799
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:27,498
Yeah, kind of knew each other before.

800
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:29,731
No, because…

801
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,097
Cindy went

802
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:32,430
to the place I work last week

803
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,930
to drink and celebrate.

804
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,264
So, I did help her deliver some drinks, right.

805
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:39,430
Right, I remember Yingjun too.

806
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,764
And Xiao…

807
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,331
- Ting.
- Ting, right.

808
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,064
I remember, at that time.

809
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:45,998
It's alright, it has been said.

810
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,998
We should respect the young people's wishes.

811
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,398
Then let's respect Meng Heng's choice.

812
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:51,731
Thank you, Miss Gao.

813
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,631
I'll work hard and learn from Cindy.

814
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,865
Okay, everyone,
regarding the case of Sustainable Residence,

815
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,564
there are still some matters to discuss.

816
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:02,031
Everyone, see you in the conference room
in ten minutes.

817
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:04,764
Okay, Xiaoyun.

818
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,331
Cindy.

819
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,464
Please prepare some tea and snacks

820
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:10,865
for the conference room.

821
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:37,464
Are you upset?

822
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,731
Is it that obvious?

823
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:43,231
Are you upset with me?

824
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:45,731
Is there anyone else here besides you?

825
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,231
OK.

826
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:49,297
You're upset with me,

827
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:52,331
but what did I do wrong?

828
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,998
Do you still remember

829
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:56,998
when you were going through
the onboarding process,

830
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,031
you said you squeezed your way in,

831
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:00,398
and went through a lot of hardships
to intern at our company?

832
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:02,665
I remember.

833
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,464
Just now so many people
wanted to be your master.

834
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:05,531
Why didn't you choose them?

835
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:06,998
Why did you choose me?

836
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,198
Don't you know that I am just

837
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:09,597
a secretary?

838
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:10,963
I know that.

839
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:12,130
You know that, yet you still chose me?

840
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,297
You don't know secretary's work is just

841
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:15,198
to serve tea, deliver water,
and do some unimportant tasks.

842
00:38:15,198 --> 00:38:16,597
Is this really what you want to do?

843
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:18,297
I'm telling you,
it's not too late to regret it now.

844
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,297
I can tell Gao Shuangyun

845
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,297
that you want to choose again.

846
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,797
It depends on whether you want
to choose Xu Yazi or Guo Shijie.

847
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:23,231
Either is fine. They're both quite experienced.

848
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:24,398
No, the point is

849
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:27,531
I'm not choosing either of them.

850
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:30,097
I understand now.

851
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,832
You just want to make your resume look good.

852
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:34,430
That's why you chose
to intern at our company, right?

853
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,164
You just want to slack off.

854
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:41,130
Having that kind of attitude
is really unacceptable.

855
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,097
I came to the company right after I graduated.

856
00:38:43,097 --> 00:38:45,198
Always go where it's busiest.

857
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,198
You,

858
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,930
if you're afraid of being busy or tired,

859
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,365
then you'll never have
an opportunity in your lifetime.

860
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:52,198
I know that.

861
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:53,731
Are you sure you know?

862
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,597
You're about to enter the society.

863
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:58,631
You have to actively participate
in everything at work, everything.

864
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:59,698
You have to try it first.

865
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:02,764
- Then you'll understand what the details are
- Okay.

866
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,130
Have you finished speaking?

867
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,231
It seems you've finished.

868
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:15,865
Can I express my thoughts now?

869
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,597
Before I came to intern
at the construction company,

870
00:39:20,597 --> 00:39:22,031
I asked my senior.

871
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,097
She was the one who recommended you.

872
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:25,531
Because of that, I also looked up

873
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,832
the video of your lecture at our school.

874
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:29,865
What video?

875
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:32,898
The one you spoke at during
the career exploration camp.

876
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:34,498
I saw you showcasing your calendar.

877
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,865
Formulating sales strategies.

878
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:37,430
Making reports, managing clients.

879
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,764
Trading contracts.

880
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:40,097
You even personally visit construction sites,

881
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:41,832
and sales centers too.

882
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,231
I think it's impressive
you can do so much in a day.

883
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:44,365
That's amazing.

884
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:47,865
That's why I want to learn from you.

885
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:48,865
And didn't you say

886
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:50,564
to jump at the chance
to do anything that comes up?

887
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:53,597
So, the small tasks I do are also important.

888
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:56,597
Or is it just that you talk the talk?

889
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,297
Our company, Bosheng, supports the youth.

890
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:27,031
The venue for the Livable Taoyuan Sustainable
Housing press conference was well done.

891
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:28,631
There were no problems.

892
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:29,963
Next, we'll need to trouble Yazi

893
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:32,365
to follow up with the planning department
for adjustments.

894
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:34,430
I'll make adjustments
according to what you just mentioned.

895
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,164
Once adjusted, then I'll confirm with you.

896
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:37,264
Okay, very good.

897
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:38,998
Xiaoyun, I would like to suggest

898
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:40,963
that we can have an exclusive interview
with Director Zhang of Bosheng.

899
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:42,264
This would not only allow

900
00:40:42,264 --> 00:40:43,698
residents and homebuyers

901
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:45,430
to better understand
the architect's philosophy,

902
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,930
but also feel our company's

903
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,064
commitment to the Sustainable Housing project's

904
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:51,031
dedication and ingenuity.

905
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,297
This is a good idea.

906
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:54,164
I'll discuss it further with Director Zhang

907
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:56,391
Okay.

908
00:40:57,297 --> 00:40:59,498
It should be Cindy and Meng Heng
who help to open the door.

909
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,531
Alright.

910
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:05,665
Hello, Vice President.

911
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:07,531
Hello, Vice President.

912
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,031
Miss Gao, excuse me.

913
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,564
Okay.

914
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:15,064
Please discuss the outline
for the media interview with Director Zhang.

915
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:17,331
Okay, no problem.

916
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:23,597
Miss Gao, Mr. Xi from Shanshui Development.

917
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:24,731
Do you remember him?

918
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,264
Of course, I remember.

919
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:28,264
It was my first development project
when I started in the industry.

920
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:30,665
Mr. Xi, long time no see.

921
00:41:30,665 --> 00:41:32,164
Miss Gao, long time no see.

922
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:33,464
Still as beautiful as ever.

923
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:35,064
And you've been promoted to manager.

924
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:36,198
Congratulations.

925
00:41:36,198 --> 00:41:38,231
Thank you, Mr. Xi.

926
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:39,865
Well, to celebrate your promotion,

927
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,297
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

928
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:07,731
[A clever hunter
will disguise themselves as prey]

929
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:12,031
[Next episode preview]
I'm no longer the very powerful sales manager.

930
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:13,064
Dad.

931
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,930
Then, would you be very disappointed?

932
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,998
Then, in that case,

933
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:18,731
does this count as an unusual date?

934
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:22,559
I'm going home, why are you following me?

935
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,797
Good morning.

936
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:26,698
I must quickly prove
that I am competent, not just lucky.

937
00:42:26,698 --> 00:42:29,031
Zhou probably hasn't noticed anything, right?

938
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:31,564
Sneaking out to make a phone call
to book a room.

939
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:32,898
You don't need to keep urging me.

940
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:33,963
I won't shortchange

941
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:36,430
what I owe you.

942
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:41,375
♫ In the end, what can still ♫

943
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,742
♫ Be uphold ♫

944
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:47,156
♫ Can no longer believe ♫

945
00:42:47,156 --> 00:42:50,981
♫ In right and wrong ♫

946
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:54,901
♫ The boundless sea of stars ♫

947
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:57,783
♫ I wait for you ♫

948
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:02,938
♫ To become no longer illusory ♫

949
00:43:02,938 --> 00:43:07,863
♫ Those past hurts ♫

950
00:43:07,863 --> 00:43:11,095
♫ The involuntary evil ♫

951
00:43:11,095 --> 00:43:15,509
♫ All are left behind ♫

952
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:20,668
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

953
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:25,591
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

954
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:28,410

♫ I'm no longer afraid

959
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:49,097
How about it?

960
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:50,198
Who do you want to choose

961
00:43:50,198 --> 00:43:52,464
to be your first master.

962
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,531
I…

963
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,531
Come on.

964
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,698
I'm skilled in marketing,

965
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:57,365
and I know many promotion girls.

966
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:59,930
If you choose me,
I'll help you sell a lot of houses.

967
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,731
And by the way,
let you screen for your future girlfriend.

968
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:05,898
Will you teach him well?

969
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:08,331
Who doesn't know you just want
to find a tool person?

970
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,963
Come on, Meng Heng, let me introduce you
to the sales representative of this project.

971
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:13,963
You better perform well.

972
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:15,164
Sun.

973
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:16,264
Miss Xu, long time no see.

974
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:17,331
It's been a long time.

975
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:19,597
- How have you been lately?
- Not bad at all.

976
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:21,564
I've brought some snacks, cookies,

977
00:44:21,564 --> 00:44:23,898
and your favorite wine to visit.

978
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:25,963
Choose me.

979
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,665
We're all young and easy to work with.

980
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:29,930
Stop it.

981
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,031
Letting you lead an intern,

982
00:44:31,031 --> 00:44:33,597
the two of you will go crazy.

983
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,198
Don't we need to go
to the construction site first?

984
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:37,365
Meng Heng, take a photo for me.

985
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:38,631
I want to post it on social media.

986
00:44:38,631 --> 00:44:40,130
- Okay.
- Wait for me, okay?

987
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,365
Let me comb my hair.

988
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:44,498
Does it look good?

989
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:45,631
Beautiful, another one.

990
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,665
This one.

991
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:49,597
Young man, you choose me.

992
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:52,097
I'll pass on
my lifetime's secret techniques to you.

993
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:53,698
Definitely not.

994
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:55,498
Your life's secret skills
are just stock trading.

995
00:44:55,498 --> 00:44:56,631
Trading to the point where now every month,

996
00:44:56,631 --> 00:44:58,297
you only have eight thousand
in pocket money to live on.

997
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:01,531
Following you means
waiting to live in a suite together.

998
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:02,631
Yingjun, every stock you told me to buy

999
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:03,930
has hit the limit down.

1000
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,531
The market surges up and washes down.

1001
00:45:05,531 --> 00:45:08,231
I'm also utterly confused.

1002
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:11,832
Choosing me is right.

1003
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:13,164
Development, construction, sold out.

1004
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:15,064
The two of us, the double cuties, join forces,

1005
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:16,164
coupled with this smart brain

1006
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:19,164
is sure to be successful in every endeavor.

1007
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:20,865
Whether one is handsome or not
is a matter of personal opinion.

1008
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:22,130
I won't comment on that.

1009
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,297
However, I guess Guo Shijie
aimed for a young liver.

1010
00:45:26,297 --> 00:45:28,064
Heroes come from the youth,
let's toast to that first.

1011
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:29,698
Here's to Director Zhuang!

1012
00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:31,430
From now on, we'll rely
on Director Zhuang for the projects.

1013
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,064
- It all depends on us newcomers.
- Here, let me pour for you.

1014
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,665
This is how newcomers are,
a real talent at first sight.

1015
00:45:41,764 --> 00:45:42,930
I…

1016
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,930
I personally feel
that I'm not up to par anymore.

1017
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,130
So, if possible,

1018
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,531
please don't choose me.

1019
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:53,631
Looking at these unreliable guys.

1020
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:58,597
Choosing me seems appropriate.
