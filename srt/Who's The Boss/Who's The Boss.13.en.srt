and hold her hand, how wonderful it would be?

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,864
Zhou, what do you think Gao Shuangyun is really thinking about?

26
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:05,897
Do you think it'd be okay if I just called her,

27
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:07,963
or went to her house right now to talk to her about it?

28
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:10,364
Don't be impulsive.

What if she doesn't take our side?

31
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:18,330
I think we should let her cool down and think it over.

32
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,431
Anyway, I believe that Xiaoyun will probably take some action when she goes to work on Monday.

33
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,898
We'll just play it by ear when the time comes.

34
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,730
She's so upset right now.

35
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,297
Pressuring her will only backfire.

36
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,597
All right, that makes sense.

37
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:40,197
It's dawn already.

38
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:41,897
Okay, you guys go back to sleep.

39
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:44,163
I can go back to sleep now.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,770
You must have been pretending to sleep.

41
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:49,964
No, I wasn't.

42
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:52,897
I heard a buzzword while I was sleeping.

43
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:54,897
And that woke me up.

70
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,163
It's just a bit of hormonal reaction.

Ex-wife.

75
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,930
I can't believe I didn't know you had an ex-wife.

76
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:49,297
We have been divorced for many years.

77
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:51,496
She has been living in the U.S. for most of these years.

78

Our lives have no interactions for a long time.

Xiaoyun, I really love you very much.

80
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:02,963
I hid it from you

81
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:06,931
because I was afraid you couldn't accept that I had a marriage before.

82
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:10,129
Do you still love her then?

83
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,129
Of course, I don't.

84
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:14,030
Other than paying her alimony,

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,931
we basically have no contact at all.

86
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,797
You say you don't love her.

87
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:26,363
But you gave her the same bracelet as you gave me.

88
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:28,297
What does that mean?

89
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,031
It was really just a coincidence.

Mr. Han, excuse me.

91

I have just entered your membership information.

92

It shows that you have already reserved a bracelet.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,090

Would you like to purchase another one today?

95
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,296
My wife?

96
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,831
She's not even in Taiwan.

97
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:58,396
Why keep the bracelet?

98
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:01,496
It's okay.

- Okay.

I am telling the truth.

108
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,196
At that moment, I didn't want to explain so much to a stranger.

109
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,464
That's why I checked them out together.

110
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,420
Xiaoyun,

111
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,650
my feelings for you are genuine. I can swear.

112
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,298
No need.

113
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,930
I'm very clear about how you've treated me over the years.

114
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:55,296
But right now my mind is really messy.

115
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,830
I've found that you seem to be dishonest with me.

116
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,298
You're keeping a lot of things from me.

117
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,764
I can't think straight right now.

118

I've also prepared a picnic basket, red wine, and cheese.

125

I've even deliberately prepared an '85 Lafite.

134
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:32,964
Can this really solve the question Yiyi asked me?

135
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,163
I'm not sure either.

136
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,563
But at least we have to try.

137
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,296
It depends on how you reason with her afterwards.

138
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,964
I'm thinking if when I was young,

139
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:46,530
my dad or some auntie was willing to enlighten me,

140
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,864
or if they had a talk with me,

141
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,896
maybe my personality would have been a bit warmer.

142
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,297
I think you're very warm.

143
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:01,363
At least the warmth you have makes me feel very comfortable.

144
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,031
Not scalding.

145
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:05,596
That's you.

146
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:08,030
My colleagues don't think so.

147
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,029
That's because they haven't felt it wholeheartedly.

148
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,629
You really have a way with words.

149
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:22,097
Can I ask you a question?

150
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,629
Forget it.

151
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,297
Go ahead.

152
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:30,230
Beating around the bush isn't like you.

153
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:37,131
Did you and Yiyi's mother divorce, or…

154
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,164
She fell ill and passed away when Yyii was two.

155
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,196
There was one time,

156
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:57,231
I asked Yiyi if she still remembers what her mother looked like.

157
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,131
She shook her head at me.

158
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,997
Yiyi has been with me since she was little.

159
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,896
That's why she is so obsessed with me.

160
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:17,964
Yes, life is unpredictable.

161
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:23,464
Sorry to have brought up something that makes you unhappy.

00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:25,310
It's okay,

163
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,960
that's why I cherish the present even more now.

164
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,864
By the way, when does Yiyi come back from dance class?

165
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,030
She should be back soon, I guess.

166

Focus on tying it then.

167
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,630
Then we might need to hurry.

168
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:52,429
The rules of the game are to take the balloons from here

169
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,798
to the open space on the other side.

170
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,229
Adults can only use one hand.

Children have no restrictions.

172
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:02,030
The one who gets more balloons is the winner. You have one minute.

173
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,730
One minute.

174
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,832
The winner can get a wish from the loser. Is that okay?

175
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,096
- Got it.
- Got it.

176
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:09,284
Are you ready?

177
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,296
- Ready.
- Ready.

178
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,296

Okay, it's pretty clear who won.

194
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:12,264
So, the winner and loser please discuss. What wish do you want to make?

195
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,163
Okay.

196
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:16,430
Then... I'll go get some water.

197
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:23,531
Yiyi, how is it?

198
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:27,130
Auntie Cindy thought of a fun game, right?

199
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,164
Did you ever think you would lose in the beginning?

200
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,697
Daddy's hand is bigger than mine.

201
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:43,231
And can hold so many balloons.

202
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,729
If that's the case, why did you want to play in the beginning?

203
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:52,964
Is it because you wanted to play with me?

204
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:57,698
And even if you lose, you would lose happily, right?

205
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,430
So, do you know?

206
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,596
Making friends is actually a lot like playing games.

207
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:14,831
The focus isn't on the outcome.

208
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:17,564
But during the process in between,

209
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,963
you'll have a lot of fun.

210
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:23,464
Just like daddy befriends Auntie Cindy.

211
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:26,096
As long as you don't hate this process,

212
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,497
even just like when we play games.

213
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:31,596
You clearly know you won't win,

214
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:35,364
but you still want to play with Dad, right?

215
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:39,230
Daddy promises you,

216
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,530
I definitely won't make you take sides.

217
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,931
I'm not Anderson.

218
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:47,631
So, I won't forbid you from playing with Elsa, okay?

219
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:51,196
So, I let you be friends with Auntie Cindy.

220
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,696
Are you two going to be in a relationship now?

221
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,297
That's more or less the idea.

222
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:09,430
Okay, you two can kiss now.

223
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,264
Yiyi, it's not polite to say that.

224
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,497
What do you mean I'm not polite?

225
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:15,964
Anderson's older sister said,

226
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:19,763
dating means you have to kiss.

227
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,764
But dating isn't just about kissing.

228
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:30,464
Often, just being together can make two people very happy.

229
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:35,064
But still, in a relationship, kissing happens, right?

230
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,464
You're right.

231
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:39,864
Then hurry up and kiss.

232
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,212
- I just thought of something.
- What's that?

233
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:51,364
I won the game just now, right?

234
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:52,497
I haven't made a wish yet.

235
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:55,297
Daddy, what wish will you make?

236
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,431
Daddy's wish is…

237
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:03,729
I'll kiss Auntie Cindy when the lights are beautiful and the atmosphere is good.

238
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,930
Okay?

239
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,663
Please sit.

240
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,730
Okay.

241
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,264
Auntie Cindy, let me tell you.

242
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,464
My daddy has been very busy lately.

243
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:21,129
- Try not to bother him.
- Okay.

244
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:26,164
And then he doesn't like not eating on time.

245
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:28,663
And he also doesn't like…

246
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,863
Is she still sleeping?

247
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,864
Forget it, when the time comes,

248
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,130
there she goes again, overthinking everything.

249
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,731
Your "past-life lover" (daughter) really loves you, you know.

250
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:09,097
She told me a lot about your secretive side.

251
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:11,331
I admit there is a bit of a contrast.

252
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:14,598
But it should not be secretive, right?

253
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,431
You, Director Zhang, you know…

254
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,564
Must not go hungry, and you fight with kids for gummy bears.

255
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,031
That's still not secretive?

256
00:16:25,997 --> 00:16:29,130
I was just pretending for Yiyi to see.

257
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,597
Yiyi didn't like eating when she was little.

258
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:36,063
I did it to get her to develop the habit of eating on time.

259
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,696
The habit of obediently eating her meals.

260
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:43,131
So, that's why I told her that I get unhappy whenever I'm hungry.

261
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:48,663
As for those gummy bears you mentioned.

262
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:51,264
I didn't want her to eat something so sweet.

263
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,964
So, I had to fight her for them.

264
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,898
I see.

265
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:58,163
Actually, you don't need to explain so much.

266
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:00,496
Eating candy is not a big deal.

267
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,130
Besides, I think it's quite cute.

268
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,996
Makes sense.

269
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,263
The lighting is beautiful, the atmosphere is great.

270
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:23,164

00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:07,897
I must say. Your transit plan concept is really convenient.

358
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,430
No matter what position, your work ability is always so great.

359
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,130
No wonder even the people from the Planning Department come to borrow you.

360
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:21,297
Borrow me?

361
00:22:22,964 --> 00:22:24,964
Anyway, about the sustainable housing in Taoyuan,

362
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:28,396
we still need to formulate a strategy for future sales.

363
00:22:28,396 --> 00:22:31,897
I think you can stay in the Planning Department for the next few days.

364
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,430
Oh yes, Meng Heng's assignment should be almost done.

365
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,798
I will revoke your authorization.

366
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,864
Manager, are you sure you want to do this?

367
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,663
You'll accumulate some work experience in the Planning Department,

368
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,330
which will be good for you as well.

369
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,130
Anyway, don't do anything for the next few days.

370
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,964
Just focus on the sustainable housing project.

371
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:05,630
Or, Director Zhang might have a better position for you there.

372
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,964
You could consider it too.

373
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:15,863
That's it for now. Don't come back to the Sales Department for the next few days.

374
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:22,830
If this is your decision,

375
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,796
then I'll respect it.

376
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:03,360
I bought the red bean cakes you love to eat.

377
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,931
How long have you been here?

378
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:09,363
I'm very worried about you.

379
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:13,197
I thought I'd come over to see how you're doing.

380
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:19,697
I'll give you a ride to work.

381
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:21,397
Get in the car first.

382
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:25,597
Okay, I also have something to tell you.

383
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,028
Xiaoyun, I truly have only you.

384
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,996
Not just Shanshui Development,

385
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:03,297
the matter of you taking kickbacks as the acting Sales Department manager,

386
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:05,429
Cindy knows about it too.

387
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,064
- How did Cindy…
- How she knows is not the point.

388
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:13,164
Promise me, you won't do such things again in the future.

389
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,564
I promise you.

390
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,464
I won't do it again.

391
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:29,430
But regarding Cindy…

392
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,796
You don't need to worry about Cindy.

393
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,163
You'll go to work as usual today.

394
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,731
I'll handle the company matters.

395
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:45,164
Give it to me.

396
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,529
Thank you.

397
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:08,996
She intentionally reassigned me.

398
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:11,830
Clearly, she doesn't want me to investigate further.

399
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:16,364
I really didn't expect Manager to be this kind of person.

400
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:20,197
I always thought she was very upright and intelligent.

401
00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:22,197
Manager Gao is not that kind of person.

402
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,531
She isn't the type to not distinguish right from wrong.

403
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:27,596
She must have been deceived by Vice President Han to act this way.

404
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,364
Duomi was right after all.

405
00:26:29,364 --> 00:26:32,797
Women become foolish when it comes to love.

406
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:36,163
This matter is really difficult to handle.

407
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:38,431
Why didn't you say something earlier?

408
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,597
At that time, we didn't have solid evidence and didn't dare to publicize it.

409
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,897
Yes, Sister Chen.

410
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,730
Originally, we were worried

411
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,229
that if they found out we were investigating this matter,

412
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:48,764
and then became guarded.

413
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:51,830
Then it would be even harder for us to find evidence.

414
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,297
And yet, we've been discovered now.

415
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,531
Sister Chen, what should we do now?

416
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,464
If this issue isn't handled well,

417
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:08,830
you'll all be branded as traitors to your superiors.

418
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,764
By then, no one will dare to employ you.

419
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,197
My reputation is already not good.

420
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,364
Anyway, everyone hates me, so it doesn't matter to me.

421
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:18,130
- Indeed.
- I don't mind.

422
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,163
I believe there is fairness and justice in this world.

423
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:23,464
If Vice President Han has truly made a mistake,

424
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,297
then I can't be a silent accomplice.

425
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:28,696
Brother Zhou, a real man.

426
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:34,330
But now, if this matter is to reach the highest levels,

427
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,364
and let the President know,

428
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:39,096
we must have solid evidence.

429
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:42,696
But now they are already on guard, right?

430
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,297
Unless…

431
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:52,496
I use my position,

432
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:56,596
and their guilty conscience…

433
00:27:58,496 --> 00:28:00,730
Vice President Han, please have some tea.

434
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,780
Thank you.

435
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,190
Did the President mention what he wants to see me for?

436
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:07,663
The President didn't say.

437
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:11,063
I was just instructed to ask you wait here for him.

438
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:15,264
Okay.

439
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,364
Do you need anything else, Vice President Han?

440
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:24,229
Coffee, snacks, or magazines?

441
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,331
No, thank you.

442
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:33,220
Hello?

443
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,197
Yes, he's still here.

444
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:36,997
Don't worry, I'm keeping an eye on him.

445
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,964

[Xiaoyun]
What's not right?

449
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:33,000
I think Sister Chen seems to be intentionally trapping me here to monitor me.

450
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,297
Monitoring you? Why does Sister Chen need to monitor you?

451
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:40,864
They couldn't possibly have taken the boss to my house, could they?

452
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,363
Zhou has the passcode to my house.

453
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,397
Don't panic, I'll go check if Zhou is in.

Are you looking for Vice President?

He just happens to be out.

Is there anything I can help you with?

459
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:15,864
I want to discuss the Shanshui Development case with him.

If he's not in, then please leave it on his desk.

Sure, no problem.

[Middle-Aged Detective Group]
Manager Gao just came by.

466
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:45,264
Just as Sister Chen said, they are indeed making a move.

467
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:49,531
Fortunately, the boss is out playing golf all day today.

468
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:52,164
I can play to my strengths.

00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:05,036
Zhou is at his seat.

470
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:11,096
I think you better go home for a bit.

471
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:13,564
Help me take away the laptop, cash, and passbook.

472
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:14,930
It's safer that way.

473
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,664
I'll tell you where to put the stuff.

474
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:12,897
I must say, Sister Chen, this camera of yours is really powerful.

475
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,364
The autofocus is super fast. It takes crystal clear pictures no matter what.

476
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:16,698
It's really clear.

477
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:19,464
But what do you need such a good camera for?

478
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:21,930
Is bird-watching your hobby?

479
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,296
No, not really.

480
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,564
What's this?

481
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,464
- This is…
- Cool.

482
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,630
These, no need, no need to look at these.

483
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,730
- What kind of group is this?
- That's not the point.

484
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,163
No, that's not the point.

485
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,563
The point is what's in Manager Gao's hands.

486
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:41,864
Right.

487
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:43,497
It must be criminal evidence.

488
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:47,563
Yes, so what's in that box

489
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,431
is a laptop and cash.

490
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:53,231
But that painting…

491
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:58,964
It's always in the movies.

That's a possibility.

494
00:33:03,697 --> 00:33:06,430
Because the Vice President does indeed deal with several art galleries.

495
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,797
I'll look into this tomorrow.

496
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,430
So, what happened next? Where did Gao Shuangyun go?

00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,630
I saw her get into a taxi, and then she went straight home.

Just when there was a bit of progress, we're stuck again.

How are we supposed to go to her house now?

00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:24,130
Wait a minute, I know her home passcode.

501
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,064
I have taken her home before.

Gao Shuangyun, please think it over with the little rationality you have left.

503
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,698
Is your passcode your birthday?

It's my dad's birthday.

You know this period has been my many years as a secretary,

having partners with a common goal working together.
