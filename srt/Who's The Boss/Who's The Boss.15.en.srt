Okay, a pricy one.

That would be more accurate.

Okay, that makes sense.

I heard about it yesterday.

00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,950
He embezzled so much money.

269
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,082
He's lucky that he wasn't sued.

00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:46,817
and thought it was just a rumor.

I heard

276
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:52,749
that Mr. Han and Manager Gao

277
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,416
have been dating for a while now.

- Oh my god.

They had a secret affair.

Are there some unspeakable reasons?

281
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,249
Maybe they didn't want to

282
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,483
be gossiped about like this.

283
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,215
But I've been thinking.

284
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:09,749
Yun is such a nice person.

285
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:12,116
Wouldn't she not know about the embezzlement?

286
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,517
She might be an accomplice.

287
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:18,884
Then would she

288
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,049
be kicked out?

289
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,916
I don't know about that.

290
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,817
But from what I've learned,

291
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,116
she has taken a special leave.

292
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:27,483
That's it then.

293
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:29,950
After special leave, it's usually…

294
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,382
I like Yun quite well.

295
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:36,416
I didn't know she was that kind of person.

296
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,182
I guess she just dated the wrong guy.

297
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:42,283

00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,616
It's exactly her ability and personality
that I appreciate.

562
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,883
You're not just poaching my employee.

563
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:14,250
You are poaching my treasure.

564
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,215
You can try to poach her.

565
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:20,716
But she has her own judgment.

566
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:22,016
If you want to poach her,

567
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,616
let's see what terms you can offer

568
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:25,116
to attract her.

569
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:29,116
That's what I wanted to hear from you.

570
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,750
So I've given you a heads-up.

571
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,716
A real talent

572
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:36,649
should be allowed to shine and excel.

573
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,583
If I really can't keep them around,

574
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,283
I will wish them well.

575
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:44,149
I certainly won't try to bury them.

576
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,684
So from now on,

577
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:48,616
let's bring our A-game as competitors.

578
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,616
Of course.

579
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,450
Here.

580
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,883
Let me introduce today's main course to you.

581
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,750
Chicken Provencal

582
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,083
with Mediterranean extra virgin olive oil

583
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,283
and local high-altitude cauliflower.

584
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:14,316
And this one.

585
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:18,382
Local-style marinated radish
with pan-fried organic egg.

586
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:19,712
That's all.

587
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:24,417
No wonder you're the ace salesperson.

588
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,716
A simple fried chicken
and an omelet with pickles

589
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:27,850
seem extraordinary

590
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,049
through your presentation.

591
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:33,450
I was thinking about how to thank you.

592
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,183
You know more about fine dining than I do.

593
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:37,616
And it feels too impersonal to buy you a gift.

594
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,583
I thought cooking for you
would be the most sincere.

595
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,684
Thank you.

596
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:43,517
I've felt your sincerity.

597
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,316
But I'm curious.

598
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:51,283
Why these two dishes?

599
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,517
This is how far I can go with cooking.

600
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,350
Instant noodles and dumplings are easier.

601
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,417
But even the dumplings

602
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,350
sometimes fall apart.

603
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,382
There are many restaurants out there.

604
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:03,116
And it's easy to order takeout.

605
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,783
Even if neither of us can cook,

606
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:06,382
we won't starve.

607
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,684
Let's start then.

608
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,783
Wait.

609
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,950
The most important part.

610
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,183
Wait.

611
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:19,616
Here.

612
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:25,783
I can finally open a bottle of champagne
to celebrate with you.

613
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,450
Well…

614
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,850
Let me do it.

615
00:29:36,783 --> 00:29:37,950
Be careful.

616
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,684
Then I wish you

617
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,417
clear your name and get justice.

618
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,549
Thank you.

619
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:58,982
Oh right, I haven't asked.

620
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:01,783
How much do I owe the handsome AI processor?

621
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,816
You helped me settle matters
with Manager Gao and Mr. Han.

622
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:07,917
Now it's my turn to fulfill your wishes.

623
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,382
Tell me what you want.

624
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:12,049
I do have a wish.

625
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,183
I'm all ears. Consider it done.

626
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,183
I want you.

627
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:36,583
Hi, Mom.

628
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:44,684
Don't worry. I just had dinner with colleagues.

629
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:46,684
I've been having fancy meals every day.

630
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:49,250
Okay.

631
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,649
Love you. Okay. Goodnight, go to sleep.

632
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:54,850
Bye-bye.

633
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,482
Fancy meals?

634
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,783
It's 9 p.m. and I still haven't had dinner.

635
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:15,215
Yes, Manager Wu.

636
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:18,583
It's so late. What's wrong?

637
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,649
Hello?

638
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:22,083
I'm drunk.

639
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,750
Pick me up. I'll send you the address.

640
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,750
Hurry up. Now. Bye-bye.

641
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,750
- Where are you--
- Be careful.

642
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,816
- taking me?
- We're almost there.

643
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:45,783
Okay.

644
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:47,283
Right here.

645
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:49,049
Get ready.

646
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:52,382
One, two, three.

647
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,816
What do you think?

648
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,183
Here?

649
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,549
Yeah, here.

650
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:02,649
I just think

651
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:05,583
that this place might be a bit too humble.

652
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,982
What do you mean?

653
00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:11,183
Actually, it's just fine at home.

654
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:12,982
Don't you like my place?

655
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:16,049
D-Don't you like it here?

656
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:20,083
I actually prefer

657
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:23,049
somewhere comfortable and warm.

658
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:24,917
That's okay.

659
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,350
We can just imagine the decor

660
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,816
as comfortable and warm.

661
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:31,417
Okay? That area over there.

662
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,649
That area over there is our office.

663
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:37,083
Office?

664
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,083
You want to pretend to be in the office?

665
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,450
You should have told me

666
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,482
that you're into cosplay.

667
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:46,417
I would have worn stockings and a skirt.

668
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,283
You can make this place

669
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:53,482
as comfortable as your home.

670
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:54,883
It's all up to you.

671
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,450
So y-you brought me here

672
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,382
because…

673
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:02,850
I brought you here

674
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,350
because I'm expanding my firm.

675
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,350
I want to share

676
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,382
the design of my new office with you.

677
00:33:09,382 --> 00:33:11,149
I hope you will be working here.

678
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:14,283
I would like to invite you

679
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,482
to be the Executive Director

680
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:18,382
of Boseng.

681
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,750
Anyway,

682
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,283
you can think about

683
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:26,616
how to arrange this office.

684
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:28,215
And you can think ahead

685
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,482
about what style you want.

686
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:31,382
It's all up to you.

687
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:37,049
I must say you're really not a good father.

688
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,482
At times like this,

689
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,482
shouldn't you first fulfill

690
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:44,417
Yi's wish?

691
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:54,179
♫ I confess that I can't hide my love for you ♫

692
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,115
♫ No one has your proud smile ♫

693
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,283
I think it's time

694
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,149
for Yi to go to bed.

695
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:18,015
Then I'll do my job as a good father first.

696
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:21,417
Thank you.

697
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:24,383
Hello?

698
00:34:24,383 --> 00:34:25,516
Amy.

699
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:02,149
Guys.

700
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:04,083
Meet the lady who's always on standby

701
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,417
and puts me as the No.1 priority

702
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,450
as I just mentioned.

703
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,516
Where did you find her?

704
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:12,717
Tianfu, we really envy you.

705
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:14,083
You're single and free.

706
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,982
And you have a secretary at your disposal.

707
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:18,015
And you're getting promoted to Vice President.

708
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,116
You're basically winning at life.

709
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:22,917
- Come on, cheers.
- Hi, pretty.

710
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:23,950
Let's have a drink.

711
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,316
Once Tianfu gets promoted,

712
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:27,216
you'll be the secretary of the Vice President.

713
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:28,283
Yeah.

714
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:29,349
Serve the right master.

715
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:30,816
When the master rises,

716
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,849
every lackey around them benefits.

717
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:34,250
Who's the lackey here?

718
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,516
Don't talk nonsense.

719
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:37,849
The Vice President had a secretary.

720
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,450
Despite Manager Wu's promotion,

721
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,816
I don't know if I'll rank up as a secretary.

722
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,450
Why would you say something like that?

723
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,116
Listen to me, no matter how high I reach,

724
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,516
I will never leave you behind.

725
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:51,550
You will always be my secretary.

726
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,683
Our Manager Wu is so dominant and protective.

727
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:58,316
He would never abandon his wife.

728
00:35:58,316 --> 00:35:59,717
Yeah.

729
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:01,316
No, I'm just a secretary.

730
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:02,550
I'm not his wife…

731
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,216
Come on, drink with my buddies.

732
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:05,349
Okay? Have a drink.

733
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:06,816
Come on.

734
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:07,849
Cheers to you guys.

735
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:14,717
- Awesome!
- She knows how to drink.

736
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,000
Awesome.

737
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:17,917
Tianfu.

738
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:20,649
Come on, let's sit down.

739
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:21,884
That's crazy.

740
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:24,383
Yang, fix us some shots, will you?

741
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:25,450
Come on.

742
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,516
Well…

743
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:37,149
Who is it?

744
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:46,149
It seems you're having a tough time.

745
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:57,783
You must be happy to see me like this.

746
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,783
Of course, I am.

747
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:01,283
Why wouldn't I be happy?

748
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,849
I must say, Gao Shuangyun

749
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,216
is even more formidable

750
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,649
than I imagined.

751
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,750
How did you get in?

752
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:14,884
Don't forget.

753
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:16,849
We are still married here by law.

754
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:19,383
The receptionists were concerned and let me in.

755
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,616
Now that you see I'm fine, you can leave.

756
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:27,116
You want me to go? Alright.

757
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:28,616
Apologize to me first.

758
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:35,083
I'm the most miserable person here.

759
00:37:35,982 --> 00:37:38,216
I've lost my job. I've lost everything.

760
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,550
I should apologize?

761
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,250
You're the most miserable?

762
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:42,950
Think about it.

763
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,182
Who borrowed money

764
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:46,516
from her maiden family for your investment?

765
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:47,783
Who put up with

766
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,083
the pointing fingers
after your investment failed?

767
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:51,783
And I stayed abroad

768
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,149
all by myself to retain permanent residency.

769
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:58,450
Don't make it sound like it's all my fault.

770
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,849
Speaking of investment,

771
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,816
who kept urging me to befriend

772
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,316
those wealthy ladies

773
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:04,383
and make money

774
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,015
to not be looked down upon?

775
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:07,783
And the immigration?

776
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,182
Who kept saying,

777
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:10,450
"This guy has immigrated.

778
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,750
He got a green card. So happy."

779
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,982
Who kept preaching about life abroad?

780
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:17,050
You wanted me to stay abroad?

781
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:18,917
Would you work to sustain us?

782
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:21,683
Who would pay the bills? You?

783
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:22,750
Han Xinzheng.

784
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,683
How do you have the nerve to say that?

785
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:26,583
Haven't you wasted my prime years?

786
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,616
Haven't you used me?

787
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:28,849
Don't I deserve an apology?

788
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,015
Haven't I borne the consequences?

789
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,982
Haven't I tried everything
to make money to please you?

790
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:37,316
But you're insatiable.

791
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,482
Even today, you're talking

792
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,216
about money with me.

793
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,717
I'm not here to settle scores with you.

794
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:47,649
You want a divorce? Fine.

795
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:49,216
Apologize to me first.

796
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,450
Yun, wait.

797
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,616
Yun.

798
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:11,917
It's raining too much.

799
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,516
Yun, why did you have to come out right now?

800
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:24,015
The rain is pouring.

801
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,683
This is another punishment from the boss.

802
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:31,116
He wants me to observe the leaves on the tree

803
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:33,816
to see which ones are about to fall off.

804
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,149
I need to collect three of them.

805
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:39,182
Observe the leaves?

806
00:39:40,149 --> 00:39:42,884
What an innovative punishment from the boss.

807
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:46,050
But it's raining so much right now.

808
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,982
Can't we do it another day?

809
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,083
Zhou, don't get rained with me.

810
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,482
Go back to work.

811
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,280
I…

812
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,383
It's okay. I'll stay with you.

813
00:39:58,383 --> 00:39:59,616
No need. Seriously.

814
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:01,349
- This is my punishment.
- I'll stay with you.

815
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,950
Anyway, it's pouring rain right now.

816
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,516
It will be easy to see

817
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:17,884
which leaves are knocked down by the rain.

818
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:45,383
- One leaf.
- One leaf.

819
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,917
Does something need fixing?

820
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,683
W-What are you doing?

821
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:45,516
W-What are you doing here?

822
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:46,616
I…

823
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:47,649
I was blowing…

824
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:48,917
- Good job.
- blowing…

825
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:51,283
You're blowing…

826
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:52,550
Do you need my help?

827
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,583
No need.

828
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,250
T-This is a men's restroom.

829
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,116
- I got this.
- Get out.

830
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:58,116
I swear I can help.

831
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,683
- No.
- I can do it.

832
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,884
No.

833
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:02,149
This is a men's restroom.

834
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:05,649
She's crazy.

835
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,149
Unbelievable!

836
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:10,783
I must hurry back home.

837
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:14,884
Okay, here we go.

838
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:16,950
One, two, three.

839
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,550
I won big time!

840
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:26,383
Hurry up. Finish it.

841
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:27,717
I accept my defeat.

842
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,783
I'll do it.

843
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,816
Not just the reimbursements.

844
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,349
You can leave whatever you don't want to do

845
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:36,849
to me today.

846
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:39,383
I stick by my friends, don't I?

847
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:41,849
Alright, let me thank you

848
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:43,417
for giving me that luck charm.

849
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:45,383
So let me help you

850
00:42:45,383 --> 00:42:47,216
put these cards away

851
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,283
so you can work.

852
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:51,783
Thank you so much.

853
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:52,982
No problem.

854
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:58,450
But I'm really glad

855
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,015
you came back.

856
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:01,649
When you weren't here,

857
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,250
I was really bored.

858
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,250
Thank you.

859
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,717
Okay.

860
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:10,583
Yingjun.

861
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,316
- Lunch menu?
- No!

862
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:13,982
Shall we do it now?

863
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:16,383
Cindy Wang.

864
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:17,917
Okay.

865
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:19,649
Okay, let's go.

866
00:43:20,383 --> 00:43:22,750
- There's no black pen.
- Why didn't you bring one?

867
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,717
We have so many pens in the office.

868
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:26,917
Is it so hard to find a black pen?

869
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:29,683
This one is blue.

870
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,717
- Okay.
- This one is blue.

871
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:41,783
I asked for a black pen.

872
00:43:41,783 --> 00:43:44,750
- But it's more noticeable.
- You need to sign in black…

873
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:47,417
Cindy.

874
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,182
Welcome back to the business department.

875
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:54,250
Congratulations on clearing your name.

876
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,550
Thank you.

877
00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:57,783
Well…

878
00:43:57,783 --> 00:43:59,816
If I had done anything

879
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:02,050
that seemed disrespectful to you,

880
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,450
it was just a misunderstanding.

881
00:44:23,176 --> 00:44:28,111
[There are no permanent allies in the workplace
but enemies ready to replace you at any time.]

882
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:30,683
[Next Episode]
You both came to pick me up for work?

883
00:44:30,683 --> 00:44:33,050
- I'm on my way to work.
- But I came for you.

884
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,583
Mr. Han has a list

885
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,717
in the business department.

886
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,750
Let him take the blame for this.

887
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,015
Xu Yazi, I want to make peace with you.

888
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:43,015
But Chen, you're not hoping to see me mess up

889
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,583
and get scolded by the chairman, right?

890
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,149
Today, I'd like to talk about

891
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,015
the vacant position of Vice President.

892
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:50,616
Do you have time for a quick chat?

893
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:52,482
How about I show you a clear path?

894
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,149
What do you think?

895
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,250
So,

896
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,450
