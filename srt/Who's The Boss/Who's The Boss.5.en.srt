00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,325
Yes.

22
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,393
I am just foolish.

23
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:22,560
I deserve to be fooled, alright?

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,860

you're not talking to me either, right?

26

I don't know.

27
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,060
Good night.

28
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,259
I don't know how you girls

29
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,560
get along.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,793
But for us guys, as soon as someone
experiences a breakup, and gets dumped.

31
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,727
It's definitely a beer opened straightaway.

32
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,392
Drinking and talking all night long.

00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:09,226
And if girlfriends
don't let us play video games,

34
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:12,627
then we just play three days

00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,927
Anyway, we must present a united front.

36
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,860
Even if you want to scold someone,
you should scold the other party,

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,226
and not your friends.

38
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:29,994
After you drive me to Bosheng,

39
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:32,692
you go back to the company first.

40
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:36,392

Dear

The bracelet you gave me

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,192
has a problem with the clasp.

44
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,627
Do you still have the receipt?

45
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:01,093
Give it to me, and I'll get it fixed.

46
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:08,492
No need to trouble my woman with this errand.

47
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,826
Give me the bracelet, and I'll handle it.

48
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,112

are well written.

52
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,492
I'll practice well according to this content.

53
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:44,259
As long as you're satisfied.

54
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,293
I'm quite satisfied.

55
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:53,026
However, you seem not quite satisfied.

56
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:58,125
Is it that obvious?

57
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,226
I mean to say

58
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:03,994
that you usually look

59
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,093
radiant and full of vitality.

60
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,026
But today your eyes

61
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,927
are totally lackluster.

62
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,994
You have something on your mind?

63
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:17,060
No, it's just that…

64
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,126
I don't seem to be on the same track
with my colleagues.

65
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,393
After the press conference is over,

66
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:39,493
where should the celebration party be held?

67
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,894
How about the izakaya we visited last time?

68
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,959
Or shall we go singing?

69
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:53,092
I'm fine with either.

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,794
Meng Heng isn't in the group chat.

71
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:07,493
Should we invite him in?

72
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:11,527
We should get them to join
the celebration banquet, right?

73
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,592
Maybe not.

74
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:19,592
Then we'll have to add Cindy
to the group as well.

75
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,626
Last time, because of Cindy,

76
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:25,493
I had to leave before I could enjoy my drink.

77
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,726
Meng Heng, it's fine by me.

78
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,126
But Cindy…

79
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:32,592
is very…

80
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,359
Why did you bring me here?

81
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,192
What do you think about that guy
with the backpack,

82
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,826
and wearing a black T-shirt?

83
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:53,225
What do you think his dream is?

84
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:57,826
And the girl in white, what about her?

85
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:00,192
I don't know.

86
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,260
Do you remember we talked

87
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,126
why your proposal moved me last time?

88
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,592
When I was a child,

89
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,459
my family was not wealthy.

90
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,527
And it was a single-parent family.

91
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,459
I grew up with my mother,

92
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,927
being chased around by landlords.

93
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,927
So, when I grew up, I set a goal for myself

94
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,760
to build my own house,

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,225
and to let more ordinary people like us

96
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,959
be able to own their own homes.

97
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,927
Congratulations.

98
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,560
It seems your dream has come true.

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,927
But I didn't succeed on my first try.

100
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,859
I failed many times,

101
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,760
and it took a lot of experience
to get to where I am now.

102
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,225
I remember when I first started out
in the field,

103
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,527
thinking that having an architect's license

104
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,859
made me invincible.

105
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,560
But in reality, there were many things
to compromise on.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,225
And ultimately, I didn't share
the same vision with my partner.

107
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,794
So, we split up.

108
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:01,859
Shi Ping.

109
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:05,293
Won't you really consider staying?

110
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,660
Since our philosophies don't align,
there's no need to force me.

111
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,993
I'll leave the company to you.

112
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:12,160
From now on, we'll each put in our effort.

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,293
I'm leaving.

114
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:16,660
Shi Ping, can we talk about it again?

115
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,192
Later, I opened my own office.

116
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:22,427
Still with a strong personality,
and was very persistent.

117
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:24,192
If an employee made a mistake,

118
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,560
then I'd immediately tell her to leave.

119
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,626
Did you bring a ruler when you were measuring?

120
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:31,092
Yes.

121
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,325
Yes?

122
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:35,794
Then that means you didn't bring your brain.

123
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:36,927
The measurements for all sizes

124
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,027
can vary by more than plus
or minus two centimeters.

125
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,527
It's not simple.

126
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,192
You're fired.

127
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,459
Director Zhang, can you give me another chance?

128
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:48,027
Get out.

129
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:53,393
In the end, only I and the accountant
were left in the office.

130
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:56,126
I almost caused it to shut down.

131
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:01,192
One day, I was just sitting by the street.

132
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:03,459
Originally, I was thinking

133
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,192
whether my dream was too unrealistic.

134
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:09,427
Whether I should give up.

135
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,760
But looking

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,427
at the passersby on the street,

137
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,894
everyone is headed in different directions.

138
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,393
Coming and going.

139
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:20,225
All in a hurry.

140
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:22,826
I suddenly realized something.

141
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:26,060
My dream is mine.

142
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,192
Not my employees'.

143
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,359
They come to work at Bosheng

144
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,492
for their own future and dreams,

145
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:35,960
and not for me.

146
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:43,093
So, I shouldn't take

147
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:46,492
them sacrificing for my dream for granted.

148
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,692
Instead, I should be thankful to them.

149
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:52,026
And even persuade them

150
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,760
to consider working at Bosheng

151
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,093
as one of their dreams.

152
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,760
And make them understand

153
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,060
that everything they give

154
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,125
is also paving the way for their own dreams.

155
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,627
Just like that.

156
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,726
If you say it like this,
then they'll believe you.

157
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:10,794
And you have to add my sincere eyes.

158
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,794
After all, the eyes can't lie to people.

159
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:13,960
You can tell just by the look in the eyes

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,627
that whether it's sincere or not.

161
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,794
Truly worthy of being you.

162
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:36,060
Indeed clever.

163
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,627
Admirable.

164
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,292
Sorry.

165
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:01,927
I didn't carefully check the condition
of the product during packaging.

166
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:03,827
It was our oversight.

167
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,760
It's okay, can this be fixed?

168
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,192
Of course.

169
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,359
But I would like to confirm

170
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,560
is there a problem with the other bracelet

171
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,460
that was taken away that day?

172
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,325
I don't think so,
there shouldn't be any problems.

173
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,859
Good, then that's fine.

174
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,393
I'll create a maintenance order for you now.

175
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:19,427
Please wait a moment.

176
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,526
Okay, thank you.

177
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,927
I don't like younger men.

178
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:27,927
And the way you are doing this

179
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:28,927
is like taking advantage of the situation.

180
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,125
I can't accept that.

181
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,859
That's really too bad then.

182
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:33,859
I was originally going to say,

183
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,093

00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,393
Superconducting blanket.

369
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:24,325
Why buy something
if you're not going to use it?

370
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:31,693
People like you with cold hands and feet,

371
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:33,092
don't take proper care of themselves.

372
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,226
Seriously.

373
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,938
[Uncle]

374
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,193
That's too nosy.

375
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:01,527
To think you overworked yourself
to the point of sleeping at the office.

376
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:02,759
If it's because of the press conference,

377
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,659
then why not involve everyone?

378
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,592
Good morning, Chen

379
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:29,092
Cindy

380
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,360
[Who's the Boss]
Could you help check when you're available

381
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,259
that transshipment plan
of our business department.

382
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:48,159
If anything needs to be modified,

383
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,592
then give me some feedback.

384
00:22:49,592 --> 00:22:51,693
Thank you.

385
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,759
Meng Heng, please wait a moment.

386
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,259
Look into my eyes.

387
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,259
Stop messing around.

388
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,492
Please take every piece of information

389
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:14,092
you send out right now seriously.

390
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:19,092
Take it seriously.

391
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,759
I understand.

392
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:30,159
Didn't expect Director Zhang's teaching
to be quite useful.

393
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,460
Make them understand

394
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,826
that all their efforts

395
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:38,226
are also paving the way for their own dreams.

396
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,993
Don't you still have
to see Chen about something?

397
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:43,092
Your approval document
hasn't been signed yet, has it?

398
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:44,193
I'll take care of it.

399
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:45,426
Don't worry about it.

400
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:47,360
My document has already been signed.

401
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,293
I went to see her in person.

402
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,592
Chen.

403
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:01,693
Cindy.

404
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:02,759
Sorry.

405
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,492
My phone has been acting up
these past few days.

406
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:06,960
It made it difficult for you
to contact me when the approval was ready/

407
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,460
I'm really sorry about that.

408
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,926
It's okay.

409
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,226
I knew you would be generous,

410
00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:16,293
and wouldn't fuss over it.

411
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:17,794
But I was thinking

412
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,759
whether we should start

413
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,960
a secretary group.

414
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,426
This way, if there are any
documents or approval forms

415
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:23,527
with issues,

416
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,560
then you can address them in the group.

417
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,126
I've asked Zhou and Secretary Li
from the planning department,

418
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:30,527
and they both said okay.

419
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:33,027
What do you think?

420
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,193
Recently, I've felt

421
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,492
like I've underestimated

422
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:40,092
the job of a secretary.

423
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:42,193
So, in fact, there is a lot

424
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:44,726
I would like to learn from you seniors.

425
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:46,193
It isn't too good

426
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,492
for a rookie like me

427
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:50,259
to constantly making mistakes, is it?

428
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,627
Right?

429
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:01,759
Okay, then.

430
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:09,826
Then I'll create a group chat.

431
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,226
Thank you, Chen.

432
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,027
Goodbye.

433
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:23,293
Truly able to bend and stretch.

434
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:24,893
Admire.

435
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:25,993
If we, the salespeople

436
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,926
aren't a bit flexible,

437
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,048
then you can't achieve great things.

438
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:33,160
[Uncle]

439
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:41,092
Miss Gao.

440
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,325
Gao Shuangyun.

441
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,560
Is everyone here?

442
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,893
Yes.

443
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:52,492
Do you need to return a call first?

444
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:54,460
It's alright.

445
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,527
Let's start as soon as everyone is here.

446
00:25:57,527 --> 00:26:01,159
Start with the venue arrangement
for the press conference.

447
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,826
The person in charge of the venue layout is…?

448
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:06,960
Yun, I'm in charge.

449
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,794
The planning department is busy
with another project now.

450
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:10,794
So, they won't support this event for now.

451
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:13,193
But we have already contacted
the people from Bosheng.

452
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:14,926
So, we'll arrive at the site early

453
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:16,960
to start with the setup.

454
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,993
Okay, very good.

455
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,926
[Jingdu Sustainable Residence in Taoyuan]

456
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:23,193
Thank you.

457
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,592
It's about time.

458
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,293
Everything is ready.

459
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:29,659
Got it.

460
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,860
- Sorry, please sign in here, thank you.
- Hello.

461
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,659
If you would like to join the lucky draw later,

462
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,759
then you can scan the QR code here.

463
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,027
And this is today's folder and a small gift.

464
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,360
It contains water and drinks.

465
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,527
I mean water and some snacks.

466
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:42,627
What are you talking about?

467
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:43,759
Please sign in here, thank you.

468
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,060
Editor Liao.

469
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,193
Long time no see.

470
00:26:46,193 --> 00:26:47,092
- Let me introduce you.
- Hello.

471
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:48,926
This is Director Zhang from Bosheng.

472
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,193
Here's my business card.

473
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,659
Hello, I'm Zhang Shiping.

474
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,393
Okay, that's basically it
for our press conference.

475
00:26:57,393 --> 00:26:59,259
We'll follow this procedure for the event.

476
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:02,325
- After that, it's time for the lucky draw.
- Okay.

477
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,693
Yingjun, is the short video okay?

478
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:05,259
- No problem.
- Good, okay.

479
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,464
Come on.

480
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:07,659
Hello, everyone.

481
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,126
Hello, please take a seat inside.

482
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:11,993
Please be careful going up the stairs.

483
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:15,360
Very good, everyone take charge
of your own tasks.

484
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:17,527
Miss Gao.

485
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:18,560
The VIPs and media have all arrived.

486
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,592
We can begin now.

487
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,226
Okay, get ready to start the press conference.

488
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:22,726
This is bad.

489
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,926
The Hope Girl and the mascot
responsible for the opening performance

490
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,426
got into a car accident
because they were rushing to the venue.

491
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:28,426
How could this happen? Is anyone injured?

492
00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:29,592
There is no life-threatening danger.

493
00:27:29,592 --> 00:27:30,693
But they definitely won't make it.

494
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:31,960
The opening performance has to be canceled.

495
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,860
We might have to use the introduction video
made by Yingjun

496
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,492
as the opening act.

497
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:37,060
Do we have any other backup plans?

498
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,893
Starting with the video directly is too abrupt.

499
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,659
We'll…

500
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,659
Miss Gao.

501
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:47,092
I have an idea but I'm not sure if it'll work.

502
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,592
Thank you to all the VIPs
and media friends for attending

503
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:55,293
Bosheng Architecture & Design's

504
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:56,592
collaboration

505
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,259
for the sustainable housing in Taoyuan.

506
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:01,426
So, at the beginning of today's event,

507
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,460
I would like to invite all the guests

508
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,659
to welcome our opening act
with the warmest applause.

509
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:06,325
Welcome our opening performance.

510
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:09,527
Welcome the Hope Boy!

511
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:12,492
Go up.

512
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:15,560
You can do it.

513
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,960
Hope Boy.

514
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,325
Due to a little situation,

515
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:36,993
the girl has turned into a boy.

516
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,826
This press conference,

517
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,926
Cindy also put a lot of thought into it.

518
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:49,659
Why haven't I seen her?

519
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,293
She's dealing with important work.

520
00:28:52,293 --> 00:28:55,527
Director Zhang, you'll see her in a moment.

521
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:09,860
Watching the Hope Boy's dance steps,

522
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,259
it also symbolizes
this sustainable housing project

523
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,492
is full of hope

524
00:29:13,492 --> 00:29:15,560
and suitable for living in Taoyuan.

525
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,794
Human-centric.

526
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:18,259
With the heart to care for family members.

527
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:21,460
Giving more vitality to the architecture.

528
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:29,993
Let's give another round of warm applause

529
00:29:29,993 --> 00:29:31,759
to our Hope Boy.

530
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,293
Thank you.

531
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,624
Thank you.

532
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,460
Following this stage,

533
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,659
we would like to invite

534
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:41,659
Director Zhang of Bosheng

535
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:44,060
and Miss Gao from the construction company
to make your way

536
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,759
to the front of our model

537
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,226
for the unveiling ceremony.

538
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,193
Alright, when I count

539
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:57,426
to one, two, three.

540
00:29:57,426 --> 00:30:00,193
Please have the two honored guests
lift the red cloth.

541
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:01,860
Are you ready?

542
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,393
One, two, three!

543
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:09,926
Wishing the construction company's
sustainable housing in Taoyuan

544
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:12,659
success in advance.

545
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,860
Next, we invite Director Zhang

546
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,060
to come up and say a few words for us.

547
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,126
Welcome.

548
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:28,872
Thank you.

549
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:30,527
Ladies and gentlemen.

550
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,193
Friends from the media,

551
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:34,226
and our partners at Bosheng.

552
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:37,226
Hello everyone, my name is Zhang Shiping.

553
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:41,226
It is an honor to collaborate
with the construction company this time.

554
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:44,193
We hope that through this project for youth
to establish homes.

555
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:46,693
Every willing and hardworking person

556
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:50,426
can easily have their own home. Thank you.

557
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:52,993
Thank you, Director Zhang.

558
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:54,960
Next, we invite Miss Gao to come up on stage

559
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,860
to take a photo with our mascot.

560
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:10,492
No, you're not supposed to pull it up.

561
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:12,893
- No, you need to move it forward.
- What is it?

562
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,492
- Towards, no, not upwards.
- That's not it.

563
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:15,826
- There's a strap inside.
- Move it forward.

564
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:16,960
- There's a strap.
- Where?

565
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,492
The strap needs to be untied first.

566
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:20,627
Do you even know how?

567
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:21,826
Wait a minute.

568
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:24,560
Don't move.

569
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,659
Can you do it?

570
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,759
I've never seen this before.

571
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,426
Weird, it's so hot.

572
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,460
Actually, you look quite good like this.

573
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,759
From now on, you should go to work like this.

574
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,993
What are you laughing at?

575
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:39,393
You were laughing when I was dancing.

576
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,893
What are you laughing at?

577
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,159
I was just very nervous.

578
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,527
Nervous about what?

579
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,659
You've worked hard.

580
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:46,159
Wait a moment.

581
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,193
Miss Gao.

582
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,627
Director Zhang.

583
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:52,627
Sorry, today didn't go according
to the original plan.

584
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,627
I think it's very good.

585
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,226
Although it's not quite the same
as the original plan,

586
00:31:57,226 --> 00:31:58,993
but Miss Gao told me.

587
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:02,325
The event was livestreamed and shared by many.

588
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:04,193
Thousands of people watched.

589
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:05,759
I think the numbers are impressive.

590
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,293
Good, the online platform's streaming rate

591
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,759
has also reached over ten thousand.

592
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,027
The key point is that more people want to learn

593
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:14,560
about this sustainable housing project
for young people.

594
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:17,393
So, I think today's event was a success.

595
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,860
There's no reason to blame.

596
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,460
As for you.

597
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,627
Are you hot?

598
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:29,126
It's tough dancing in a mascot costume.

599
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:30,826
It's really super hot.

600
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,993
I'm all messed up like a crazy woman, thanks.

601
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,092
I'm dying of heat.

602
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:53,293
I think serious women are the most beautiful.

603
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:56,659
You truly deserve this compliment.

604
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:05,060
It's okay, I guess.

605
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,627
Meng Heng, come back with me
to deal with the follow-up work.

606
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,393
Director Zhang, please excuse us for now.

607
00:33:11,393 --> 00:33:13,860
- Thank you.
- Then this…

608
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,060
I'll take care of it.

609
00:33:21,794 --> 00:33:23,893
It's hot, isn't it? Here.

610
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:26,360
It's fine now.

611
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,527
Do you want me to get you a glass of water?

612
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:28,627
No need.

613
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,693
It's quite heavy.

614
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,092
You're stuck.

615
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,393
No way.

616
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,993
Yazi, this way.

617
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:40,560
Is anyone else not here yet?

618
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,794
Chen Han and Yun.

619
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:43,060
Okay.

620
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,360
I'll take a call. My wife is calling.

621
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,926
Come on.

622
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,659
Miss Gao said she'll be here soon.

623
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:50,993
It couldn't be

624
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,860
that Cindy and Meng Heng are coming together?

625
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Please, no.

626
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
If Cindy Wang comes,

627
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,226
then it'll be a huge downer.

628
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:02,293
After all, Cindy is one of
the major contributors to this event.

629
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:03,626
We are all adults now.

630
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,092
Just treat this as a social obligation.

631
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,326
A minor issue.

632
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:08,125
Okay, let's leave it at that, okay.

633
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,360
Bye.

634
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:13,527
Yingjun, what's wrong?

635
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:16,193
No, Cindy just called my home

636
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:18,592
for my wife.

637
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:20,827
Why did Cindy call your wife?

638
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,693
She said I was coming to sing,

639
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,125
and helped me ask for leave.

640
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,259
Ask for leave?

641
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:26,827
She called your wife for you

642
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:28,693
to ask for leave for you?

643
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,326
Why do you need to ask for leave
to come out and sing?

644
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:31,459
Your wife is strict?

645
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:33,926
It's just that we had a get-together before,

646
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:35,226
and I wanted to slip away early.

647
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:36,393
So, I lied to Cindy saying

648
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:38,860
my wife demands that I be home
before eight o'clock.

649
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,793
Now…

650
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:42,693
So, this matter has

651
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:44,226
been exposed.

652
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,360
Forget it, I'll go explain to her.

653
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,860
Kneel on an abacus, you must not lie.

654
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,393
Under tight wife control.

655
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:51,560
- I'm not.
- That's so pitiful.

656
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,360
Alright, let's go, go up.

657
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,527
Let's go.

658
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:56,994
Let's go, what's the number?

659
00:34:58,027 --> 00:35:00,259
Why do you have to bring the stuff right now?

660
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:02,360
Wouldn't it be fine
to just leave it in the office?

661
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,926
Haven't you heard the saying
'finish today's work today?'

662
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:06,626
Besides,

663
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,125
I have nothing to do tonight anyway.

664
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:13,259
Actually, they're making excuses
not to have dinner with you.

665
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:15,527
It's probably for the best.

666
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:18,393
After all, you used to be their boss.

667
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,893
Why?

668
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:32,592
Nothing.

669
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:35,393
I'm not their boss anymore.

670
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,060
Actually, if you think about it.

671
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,959
The workplace is pretty similar to our school.

672
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,660
Some teachers in our department would

673
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,626
try to get closer to students
for grading purposes.

674
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,060
So?

675
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,259
It's super awkward.

676
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:56,560
Who can speak their mind freely with a teacher?

677
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,959
So, we just make up all sorts of excuses.

678
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,160
Like the cat suddenly got temperamental.

679
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,326
Someone suddenly fell ill.

680
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,860
Dodge if you can.

681
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,693
You should understand this principle, too.

682
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:08,125
You're not trying to teach me
corporate culture now, are you?

683
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,193
No.

684
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:10,326
I'm teaching you

685
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:12,626
the principles of being a person.

686
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:15,560
Let me tell you, I'm good at being a person.
You don't need to worry.

687
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Right, you're really good at being a person.

688
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,592
So good that all coworkers alienate you.

689
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:25,626
Okay.

690
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,292
Since I've been alienated,

691
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,259
then there's no reason for me
not to go to the celebration party.

692
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:30,959
If I, this cannon fodder, am not here,

693
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:34,027
then how bored must they be.

694
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,027
Are you serious?

695
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,248
Yes.

696
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,827
Cindy.

697
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,426
I'll go with you.

698
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:45,626
Aren't you supposed to drive a taxi?

699
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:47,125
Money can be earned.

700
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:52,860
But a good show, once missed,
is missed forever.

701
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,292
Alright.

702
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:56,693
Pack up the stuff,
someone'll come to collect it tomorrow.

703
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:58,393
- Do you want to reconsider?
- No.

704
00:36:58,393 --> 00:37:00,027
I'll take your car, hurry up.

705
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:02,393
Sure.

706
00:37:02,393 --> 00:37:03,560
Everyone.

707
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,860
Let's celebrate the successful launch event.

708
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,860
- Cheers!
- To success!

709
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,994
- Everyone has worked hard.
- Well done.

710
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:14,027
Well done.

711
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,759
Quickly pick some songs, don't be shy with me.

712
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:17,292
This one's on me, dig in.

713
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,994
Thank you, Yun.

714
00:37:18,994 --> 00:37:22,259
- Let me know what you want to order.
- You're welcome.

715
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:23,426
I want to order that.

716
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:26,292
Chen Han 103486.

717
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:29,160
Why haven't Cindy and Meng Heng arrived yet?

718
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,994
I don't know, let me ask.

719
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:32,259
Yingjun.

720
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:34,527
Cindy and Meng Heng.

721
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:35,893
Meng Heng said he went to drive the taxi.

722
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:39,592
- I don't know about Cindy.
- Right.

723
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:40,994
It's better if she doesn't come.

724
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:43,459
Saves the scene from being spoiled.

725
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:44,660
Yazi, don't be like that.

726
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,827
We're all colleagues.

727
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:47,959
No, when Xiaoting and Yingjun

728
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,393
were in the same group with her,

729
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,527
the two of them

730
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:54,459
were never happy in the celebration party.

731
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:57,092
If you don't believe me, then ask them.

732
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:59,592
Go on, tell her.

733
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,060
If that's the case,

734
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,726
then I'm really sorry.

735
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:26,027
In the past, I've made everyone unhappy.

736
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:29,759
It was my lack of consideration and empathy.

737
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,693
I want to apologize to everyone first.

738
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:32,926
So, this drink,

739
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:35,060
I'll finish it.

740
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,208
♫ Still need to go with the flow
and show off together ♫

741
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:43,298
♫ How can you and I appear so bewildered ♫

742
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:47,527
♫ Since the world is already beyond saving ♫

743
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,060
I know it's not easy for you all
to forgive me so quickly.

744
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,027
It seems quite unlikely.

745
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:54,393
Then, let's start from tonight.

746
00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:55,959
Any dissatisfaction you have with me,

747
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,092
or anything you dislike about me,

748
00:38:57,092 --> 00:38:58,626
feel free to speak up.

749
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:01,493
- I'll take it
- Okay.

750
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:14,193
Awkward.

751
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:16,292
You guys enjoy yourselves.

752
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:18,393
I'll head back first.

753
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:22,626
That's not even an apology.

754
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:27,493
There's not an ounce of sincerity.

755
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,426
Guo.

756
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:33,092
Pour three drinks for Cindy.

757
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,626
Okay.

758
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:35,726
Chen Han, pick a song.

759
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:36,827
Something upbeat.

760
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:39,112
Okay.

761
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,027
If you really want to apologize,

762
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:44,125
then you should

763
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,994
dance the song you taught the Hope boy today,

764
00:39:46,994 --> 00:39:48,393
and show us all.

765
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:51,226
Make everyone happy.

766
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,459
Yes, you did an amazing job today.

767
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,092
- Perform it for us again, it's great.
- Cindy, you can do it.

768
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,326
Right? Do you guys want to see it?

769
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,426
Clap hands.

770
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,393
Come on, clap.

771
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:06,626
Do it again.

772
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:09,292
Cindy.

773
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,860
Fine, who's afraid? Come on.

774
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,060
Music!

775
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:17,592
Five, six, seven, eight.

776
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:21,292
Not bad, right?

777
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:25,092
Let's get high.

778
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:29,226
Superstar.

[Next Episode]
I'm not about to go on a date.

781
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,292
I'm actually on a date right now.

782
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,027
- Come on in.
- So domineering.

783
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:23,459
Even if you buy me something really expensive,

784
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:25,125
it doesn't have that intention anymore.

785
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,060
Being a secretary really wrongs you.

786
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,560
I clearly worked so hard.

787
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,759
Why is it always me who gets punished?

788
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:33,860
No one can take

789
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,759
her position.

790
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,860
Did I ever ask you to help me like this?

791
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,459
Vice President Han actually never got divorced.

792
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:41,560
Zhou is talking about the mistress.

Yun.

794
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:43,860
I'm sorry.

795
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,393
You know my personality.

796
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:48,326

Who told you to sleep on the company's sofa?

816
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:06,092
No wonder you got a stiff neck.

817
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,160
I had no choice.

818
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,626
There's too much to do.

819
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,726
Is it too much work to be done,

820
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:15,893
or are you avoiding something?

821
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:19,393
What happened

00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:24,125
It still hurts here.

824

Help me massage it again.

825
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:33,994
Thank you, you're the best.

00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:36,326
You…

827
00:43:36,326 --> 00:43:38,994
I made you a special cup of coffee.

828
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:40,926
Also,

829
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:42,560
here's your favorite red bean cake.

830
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,560
You're so nice.

831
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,626
I really wanted to eat red bean cakes.

832
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:50,259
Thanks to the best man in the world.

833
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:51,560
I know.

834
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,893
When you're in a bad mood,

835
00:43:52,893 --> 00:43:56,459
you would want to eat red bean cakes.

836
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,660
Take your time eating.

837
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,793
I'm here with you.

838
