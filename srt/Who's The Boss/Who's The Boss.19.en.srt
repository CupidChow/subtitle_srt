Guys, now is not the time
to cover for each other.

82

Once the planning department has this list,

83
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:52,864
they can provide an end-to-end service.

84
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,730

90
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:11,463
that list was originally on your computer.

91
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:12,630
You've always had it.

92
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,929
There was clearly no issue.

93
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:16,263
Why did it leak exactly at this time?

94
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,497
Isn't the timing just perfect?

95
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:20,829
Speak with evidence if you have any, alright?

96
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,963
And what benefit does it
yield for me to leak it?

97
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,130
Benefit? Why would you
ask me about the benefit?

98
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,530
You should ask yourself.

99
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,162
Stop hinting around, say it directly.

100
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,630
Alright, stop arguing.

103
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,864

107
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,230
Yingjun, what are you talking about?

108
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,363
It's out of the blue.

109
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,596
That developer's list,

110
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,696
turns out you weren't using it to find a job.

111
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:16,363
You were going to give it to Wu Tianfu
from the planning department.

112
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,062
You know, I was forced

113
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,864
by the society's rules.

114
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,230
Who knew this was the task assigned to me

115
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,030
when I went to the planning department?

116
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,530
And I couldn't even refuse.

117
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,997
Please.

118
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,929
We've worked together for years.

119

is in a terrible state right now?

120

You've ruined me!

121
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,897
I didn't know Manager Wu was so ruthless.

122
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,162
And he acted so quickly.

123
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,195
I just handed it to him,

124
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:43,030
and he took the whole bowl instantly.

125
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,295
It's great.

126
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,162
Your job is safe now,

127
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:48,497
but what about me and Cindy?

128
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:50,463
We're about to get fired, you know?

129
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,929
It shouldn't be that bad, should it?

130
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,295
You think so?

131
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,162
Miss Gao.

132
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,195
I really didn't leak the list.

133
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:06,463
I know.

134
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:09,195
When I said would fire the one
who leaked the list,

135
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,130
it was mainly to let them know
the severity of the situation.

136
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,963
Now, apart from finding that person,

137
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,195
the most important thing
is to deal with the aftermath.

138
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,463
I know.

139
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,130

140

141
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,963
Oh right.

142
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:31,497
You should check on
the other developers on the list

143
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:32,829
and arrange meetings with them
as soon as possible.

144
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,062
Okay, I know. Personal
interactions do count, after all.

145
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,062
Wait.

146
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,997
In desperation, people really
can make a mess of things.

147
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,596
Let's go, confess to Yun.

148
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,530
Yingjun, calm down a bit.

149
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,662
- Calm down, don't be impulsive.
- Let's go.

150
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:55,195
Maybe there's a perfect solution to this.

151
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:56,929
By the time you think of it,

152
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,195
I'll be done for.

153
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,662
What are you two doing?

154
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:13,463
I got it.

155
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,530
Yingjun, are you interrogating Guo

156
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,630
about why the planning department got

157
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,630
the developer's list, right?

158
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,262
Well done.

159
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,897
Continue to question him.

160
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,897
I'm going to get these to Miss Gao.

161
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,295
You were about to make it clear

162
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,863
but when we saw Cindy, you gave up.

163
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:56,930
Yingjun,

164
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,430
since you also dare not admit it,

165
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,530
shall we just keep silent?

166
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:04,797
Look, you take me to turn myself in.

167
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,295
My position in the planning
department will be ruined,

168
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,662
and you can't even save yourself.

169
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:12,629
Let's just pretend it never happened.

170
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:13,996
Okay?

171
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,030
Silence means consent, you know.

172
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,063

I still have work, I'll go first.

173

I know the planning department
has contacted you.

177

Can we talk about the details when we meet?

178
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,397
Yes, it was Vice President Han
who previously contacted you.

179
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:36,063
How about we switch to pretty ladies

180

181
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,730
this time?

182
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,363
Okay, goodbye.

183
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,897
Yazi.

184
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,162

185

00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:50,230
I don't know, we can only communicate slowly.

187
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:54,462
It's clearly someone's improper
handling of data that leaked it,

188
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,030
and now our whole department
is cleaning up the mess.

189
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,030
Are you referring to me when you say 'someone'?

190
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,563
What do you think?

191
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,730
We're all colleagues.

192
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,629
Helping each other out

193
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:11,797
is only right.

194
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:13,162
Exactly.

195
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:26,430
I'm sorry, guys.

196
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,430
I should have been the only one
contacting these land developers.

197
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,797
Thank you for your help.

198
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,030
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,095
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,629
You guys should stop now.

201
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,430
Have something to eat first,

202
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,863
and then get off work early.

203
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:42,829
I can handle the rest by myself.

204
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,462
Off work?

205
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:57,129
I'll go first.

206
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:06,829
Come on, you guys can stop now.

207
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,430
Have something to eat first.

208
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,095
You can eat it here

209
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,530
or

210
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,597
take it home.

211
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:13,996
Thank you.

212
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:16,996
I will stay.

213
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,496
We'll face it together.

214
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,996
It's okay.

215
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:22,397
Right, I've contacted so many
developers already.

216
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,897
It's not much left now.

217
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:26,262
Besides, it's the anniversary
celebration period now.

218
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:27,797
Outside is more dangerous than here.

219
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:28,829
I'd better behave

220
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,363
so as not to end up broke next month.

221
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:31,730
That's actually true.

222
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,262
Thank you all.

223
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,295
Where is Yazi?

224
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,430
She's gone?

225
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:40,662
How disloyal.

226
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,996
Have your wings gotten strong?

227
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,629
No, I'm going to prepare

228
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,696
gifts for visiting the developers.

229
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:47,764
Here.

230
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,295
Take this and eat it on the way.

231
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,563
Thank you.

232
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:52,162
Thank you, Cindy.

233
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,696
You're welcome.

234
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,563
Wait for me, I'll come back
and continue the work with you.

235
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:58,363
- Keep it up.
- Keep it up.

236
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:12,363
Manager.

237
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:13,430
Guo.

238
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,030
What's the rush to find me in such a hurry?

239
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,730
Manager, I am thinking

240
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:20,964
can we consider

241
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,262
using another way for land development?

242
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:27,462
You know the planning department
and the sales department not crossing lines

243
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:29,563
has been an unspoken agreement all along.

244
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,295
Guo.

245
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:36,063
Do you know what success is?

246
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,829
No, Manager,

247
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,262
but we have already harmed people this way.

248
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,797
Does your family own a mine?

249
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,329
No.

250
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,329
Then on what basis do you play
the generous big philanthropist?

251
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,397
Let me tell you,

252
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,930
success

253
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,964
is about adapting to circumstances
by hook or by crook.

254
00:12:57,964 --> 00:13:00,162
Don't be held hostage by professional ethics.

255
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,696
Good, come, have a seat.

256
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:03,964
Sit down.

257
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:08,897
Thank you, Manager.

258
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,530
Guo, let me ask you.

259
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,930
Why did you decide to switch jobs
to our planning department?

260
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,662
I wanted to get promoted

261
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,563
and find opportunities.

262
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,964
You wanted to get promoted

263
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:22,764
and find opportunities?

264
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:23,996
The ultimate goal

265
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:26,829
is to hope for a higher salary.

266
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,430
Let me remind you of one more thing.

267
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,329
Vice President Han, do you remember him?

268
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,430
Do you remember how much money
he embezzled from the company?

269
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,730
And the result?

270
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,930
All was settled after the money was repaid.

271
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:41,430
Did the boss sue him?

272
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:45,764
Why?

273
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,462
Because suing him would take time.

274
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,797
For successful, wealthy people,

275
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:55,797
time is money.

276
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,897
What you are doing now

277
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,095
is buying us time.

278
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,530
As long as we have time,

279
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,530
we will have

280
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,696
money.

281
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,597
Guo.

282
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,930
You lean back.

283
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,095
Lean back, let's do it together.

284
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,262
Feel this place.

285
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,996
Don't you really wish to have

286
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:21,162
a home of your own?

287
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:24,996
As long as you work hard,

288
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:28,430
we can definitely make money.

289
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,897
From now on,

290
00:14:29,897 --> 00:14:31,930
never work for others again

291
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,730
or take others' money.

292
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:37,930
Cindy.

293
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,363
Sorry, but I'm going to see a client later,

294
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:43,063
so, could you please upload
this information to the cloud for me?

295
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:44,563
- Okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

296
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,730
Also, you don't need to feel sorry.

297
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,462
You are the ones who are
having a tough time now.

298
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,262
I'm the one who should be sorry.

299
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:51,563
Cindy.

300
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,196
The one who should apologize isn't you.

301
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,095
It's the teammate who leaked the list.

302
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,563
When I find that bad guy,

303
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,563
I'll definitely punch him to death.

304
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:04,462
- Yingjun,
- I arranged it in that order.

305
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:06,196
Okay, thank you.

306
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,196
- Okay.
- There's a lot.

307
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:16,730
Meng Heng.

308
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,964
Didn't you take leave to go back to school?

309
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,430
What are you doing here?

310
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,530
I was thinking…

311
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,262
Don't tell me you're already
used to being a corporate slave,

312
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:25,829
and can't wait to join
the ranks of the oppressed, huh?

313
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,129
I just missed you guys.

314
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:29,863
Alright, I'll get back to work.

315
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,063
- Okay.
- Thanks for your trouble again.

316
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,230
- Alright.
- Okay.

317
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,095
What's up?

318
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,095
Are you free?

319
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,430
What now?

320
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,730
I have a secret to tell you.

321
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,563
- What is it?
- Hurry up.

322
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,829
What's the matter?

323
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:11,829
This is very serious.

324
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:12,964
You can't just blabber about it.

325
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:14,162
I'm not blabbering.

326
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,696
I have proof.

327
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:16,829
Wait a second.

328
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:18,030
Didn't you take a day off to go back to school?

329
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,397
How do you know about this?

330
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,964
Yazi complained in the chat group without you.

331
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,829
So, I asked Chen Han what was going on.

332
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,530
And I don't know why, but that night,

333
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,996
my gut told me

334
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:30,095
that something was off.

335
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:34,162
Let's go.

336
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,262
So I turned on Yingjun's computer.

337
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,730
But when I opened it, there was
some sort of print record.

338
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,863
I didn't understand it,

339
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,730
but I took a photo of it.

340
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,496
I can't believe Guo would do such a thing.

341
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,629
This…

342
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:56,496
Do you think this evidence is enough?

343
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,329
Otherwise, should we check
the surveillance camera?

344
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,096
Because they left together that night.

345
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:19,462
You're home so late today.

346
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,863
Working overtime again, huh?

347
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,330
Look what this is.

348
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,497
Also,

349
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,363
what is this?

350
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,363
What beautiful flowers!

351
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,963
That health food looks really tasty.

352
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,696
[New Sweet]
Pops, you're so considerate!

353
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,597
This is what Mr. Zhang sent you.

354
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,530
He was afraid you were in a bad mood,

355
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,062
and sent you flowers, for you to look at.

356
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,330
He was afraid you were too tired
from working overtime

357
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,263
and gave you this health supplement.

358
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:14,663
Also,

359
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,764
he also gave you a card.

360
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,663
I definitely didn't peek.

361
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:25,597
You obviously did.

362
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,930
I really didn't look.

363
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,330
So you guys

364
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:33,263
made up?

365
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:40,530
I know.

366
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,629
You don't want to run into that Han, right?

367
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:50,930
I know you've been wronged.

368
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:52,963
But in life,

369
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,963
there are no permanent enemies.

370
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,030
Right?

371
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,562
How old are you now?

372
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,930
Throwing a little temper
tantrum should be enough.

373
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,196
Don't be like a child

374
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:05,062
throwing a fit all day long.

375
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,363
Calling me out?

376
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:07,796
What about you then?

377
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:08,930
You've come to Taipei for days.

378
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,530
What about Mrs. Lin?

379
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,629
I…

380
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:14,096
I just told others
that we are just good friends.

381
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:16,196
How can I have the face to go there again?

382
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,096
So you basically came to my place

383
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:19,764
to avoid romantic entanglements.

384
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,997
I'm suddenly feeling so sleepy.

385
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,764
I'm not arguing with you.

386
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,229
I'm going to sleep now.

387
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:29,663
Good night.

388
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,129
Your good companion in life

389
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,330
I know you've been busier lately.

390
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,530
So

391
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,530
I specially prepared a surprise

392
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,396
to let you relax a bit.

393
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,729
What is it? So mysterious.

394
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,530
I'm going to open my eyes now.

395
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,030
You can't.

396
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,863
Don't look yet.

397
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:11,129
You can't look.

398
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:14,896
I'll count to three.

399
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:16,696
Then you can open your eyes.

400
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,096
One.

401
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:22,196
Two.

402
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,295
Three.

403
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,430
Red bean cake.

404
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,896
Yes.

405
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,129
Do you like them?

406
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,930
Why is it red bean cake?

407
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,295
You were sick last time, right?

408
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:43,096
Wasn't there a red bean cake
delivered to your house by mistake?

409
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,863
I noticed you paying attention to it.

410
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:47,062
So,

411
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:48,597
I tried making it myself.

412
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:51,729
You made these?

413
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:52,796
Yes, I did.

414
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,396
I went to the cooking class
to borrow the equipment.

415
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:59,663
I also searched online for recipes

416
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:01,330
and adjusted the proportions myself.

417
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,129
Just thought I'd give it a try.

418
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,530
But…

419
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,497
This red bean cake is my first attempt.

420
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:08,729
So,

421
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,363
I'm not sure about the taste.

422
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,396
Do you want to know

423
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,330
why I like red bean cakes?

424
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:23,530
Yes, I do.

425
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,764
They say the first time
is always the most beautiful.

426
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:36,363
To me, this red bean cake

427
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,896
holds special memories.

428
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:43,430
I especially brewed a cup of coffee for you.

429
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,562
And also,

430
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,462
here's your favorite red bean cake.

431
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:47,830
Yun, the administrator said it's for you.

432
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,295
Did you order delivery?

433
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:50,764
I wonder who it was for.

434
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:52,062
There's no name written.

435
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:56,062
Don't send things to my house anymore.

436
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:59,597
And don't ask the administrator
about me anymore.

437
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:04,050
♫ It's my greatest anticipation ♫

438
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,434
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

439
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,030
♫ Because of you ♫

440
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,830
But I believe

441
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,497
as long as you're willing to try,

442
00:22:13,764 --> 00:22:16,263
sometimes things that seem the same

443
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:17,263
can actually

444
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:18,696
be different.

445
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:22,764
What do you mean?

446
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,696
You'll understand once you try it.

447
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:42,229
The inside…

448
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,629
Little pearls.

449
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:49,830
Well,

450
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,696
it is what you look like in my heart.

451
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:03,796
I always thought you were very clumsy.

452
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,729
I didn't expect you to have this side too.

453
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:08,930
I…

454
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,462
Is it good?

455
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,764
It's tasty.

456
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:17,096
I'll have one too.

457
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:20,129
Not bad.

458
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:21,663
How did you make it?

459
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:25,030
I've searched for many recipes on the internet.

460
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,562
I didn't know which one was correct.

461
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:27,696
So I just…

462
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:36,363
Thank you.

463
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:40,896
Wait a minute.

464
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:49,263
These were originally for me to do myself.

465
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,363
But because of someone,

466
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,196
I have too much to do and can't finish all.

467
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,597
Don't think that I'm pushing
all the work onto you.

468
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:58,963
I only have 24 hours in a day, after all.

469
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:00,796
- So…
- I will verify them.

470
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:02,062
Thank you.

471
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:18,663
Yazi's attitude was really not OK.

472
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:20,629
She's being really sour.

473
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:22,096
It's alright.

474
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,497
She's just under a lot of stress.

475
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,896
If this can help her relieve stress,

476
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,363
I'm OK with it too.

477
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:30,396
Cindy, you've changed a lot.

478
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:32,295
It feels like there's a halo behind you.

479
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:34,497
- Is that so?
- Yes.

480
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:36,330
Since you're here, let me tell you.

481
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,229
Although we've uploaded the progress
of Bosheng to the cloud,

482
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,597
if there are any documents
that need to be verified,

483
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:41,997
they're inside this folder.

484
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,229
The hard ones, the rigid ones, this one.

485
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:44,796
This booklet.

486
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:45,896
And then,

487
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:48,530
if the finance department needs
documents for verification,

488
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,196
I will organize them and put them here.

489
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:51,629
You can help me deliver them
to the finance department.

490
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:52,729
I will label the more urgent ones in red.

491
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:53,963
No, wait a minute.

492
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,764
Why are you telling me all this?

493
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,163
It sounds like you're about to resign.

494
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,764
You're delegating responsibilities one by one.

495
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:02,295
For the remaining tasks
that need to be assigned,

496
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:03,830
I will ask Yingjun to help.

497
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,229
But if there's any unfair distribution,

498
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:08,263
I apologize for making you work hard.

499
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:12,430
No way, Cindy.

500
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:14,764
Are you really leaving?

501
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:18,196
There always has to be a scapegoat.

502
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:20,129
Only if this matter comes to an end,

503
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,497
can everyone move forward, right?

504
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,129
I'll tell you when I've got it sorted.

505
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:28,629
Thanks a lot.

506
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,597
[Business Manager Office]

507
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:46,663
Impossible.

508
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:49,295
Just a few days ago you told me earnestly,

509
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:51,462
that you definitely weren't
the one who leaked any secrets.

510
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,229
Now you're saying it was you again.

511
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:54,997
How do you expect me to believe you?

512
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:56,462
I was too scared that day,

513
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:57,863
so I lied.

514
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,530
Wang Cunfeng.

515
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,363
We've been colleagues for so long.

516
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,629
When we were competing before,

517
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,363
you guarded against me flawlessly.

518
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,696
You kept confidentiality better than anyone.

519
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:11,830
I just got careless for a moment

520
00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:14,629
that it was such important data.

521
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:16,663
With your professionalism,
it's impossible to be negligent.

522
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:18,764
- It's true, the list was really leaked by me.
- Come on.

523
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,497
Who are you really trying to cover for?

524
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:24,997
Manager, I know who it is.

525
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:49,629
As for the matter of leaking the list,

526
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:52,096
I have already found evidence.

527
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:54,263
I know who did it.

528
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,396
Yingjun.

529
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,229
You should know

530
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,663
the data in the computer
is very important, right?

531
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,030
Yes.

532
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,363
- I'm sorry.
- Meng Heng.

533
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,295
Apologize to everyone.

534
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:16,163
What…

535
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:17,163
What? What do you mean?

536
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:18,462
- Meng Heng.
- You.

537
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:23,629
I'm sorry, everyone.

538
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:24,863
I… I really didn't know

539
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:26,295
that things would turn out like this.

540
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,663
But how… How could it be you?

541
00:27:29,363 --> 00:27:31,696
Because that day I left work later,

542
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:33,562
Guo happened to come looking for the list.

543
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:35,096
I just thought

544
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:36,163
that we were all from the same company.

545
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:38,562
It should be fine to give it to him.

546
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:40,729
I didn't know things would turn out like this.

547
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:41,796
I'm sorry.

548
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,696
You're just an intern.

549
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,997
Firing you won't help matters either,

550
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:50,030
but one learns from one's mistakes.

551
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,896
You must remember,

552
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:53,430
no matter which industry you are in,

553
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,796
a list is an important asset.

554
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:58,062
You can't just give it to others.

555
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,764
- Got it.
- Right.

556
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:01,396
A list is as important as personal information.

557
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:02,663
If someone suddenly asks you for it,

558
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:04,096
there must be something fishy.

559
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:07,030
I apologize to everyone. It won't happen again.

560
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,129
But things can't just end like this, right?

561
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,163
Besides, Meng Heng is just an intern.

562
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:14,629
Punishing him is of no use.

563
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:18,062
If someone is to be punished,
it should be the person in charge of him.

564
00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:24,263
I'm in charge of Meng Heng now.

565
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:26,363
I'm willing to accept whatever punishment.

566
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,096
Punish me.

567
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,229
Let's settle it this way.

568
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,163
Let's discuss the disciplinary matters later.

569
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:36,696
I'll take Meng Heng to buy
some snacks and drinks first.

570
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,129
Everyone else, go ahead with the meeting.

571
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,330
You're paying.

572
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,764
Of course.

573
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:42,930
I'll pay.

574
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:45,263
Meng Heng.

575
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:01,163
Do you think some snacks
are going to buy us off?

576
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,997
Meng Heng is too incompetent.

577
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:05,129
But I really didn't expect it to be him.

578
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:12,430
- Okay, that will do.
- Okay.

579
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,629
This is your pager.

580
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,729
- Pick up your order when it vibrates. Thank you.
- Thank you, okay.

581
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,363
What are you doing?

582
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:20,696
Why are you taking the blame?

583
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:24,764
Then why are you taking the blame?

584
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:29,363
Because…

585
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:30,629
I know…

586
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:32,530
Yingjun has financial pressures.

587
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,729
But don't you?

588
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,330
Don't you also have a mortgage to pay?

589
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,863
You couldn't possibly have paid it off, right?

590
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,263
But if you did,

591
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:45,963
you can support me.

592
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:47,597
Stop joking around, will you?

593
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:49,129
Do you even know what you're doing?

594
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:51,229
I know, alright.

595
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:53,729
You protect Yingjun, and I'll protect you.

596
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:10,790
♫ In the end, what can still ♫

597
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:14,344
♫ Be upheld ♫

598
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,696
I don't need your protection.

599
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,163
Of course, I know that.

600
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,196
But even if you are going to resign,

601
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,497
you can't allow your resume
to be tarnished, right?

602
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,562
Haven't you said before…

603
00:30:26,562 --> 00:30:27,930
that your connections and qualifications

604
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,497
took great effort to build up?

605
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:31,497
How regrettable it would be
to lose them just like that?

606
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,430
You're not like me.

607
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,764
I can afford not to care about anything.

608
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,764
Then how did you know
I was going to take the blame?

609
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,363
I just happened to hear Xiaoting say

610
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:44,096
that you've assigned all your clients to her.

611
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:45,830
It's obvious what you're planning to do.

612
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,981
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

613
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,663
Thank you.

614
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:55,396
You're really loyal.

615
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:58,723
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

616
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:03,904
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

617
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,062
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

618
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:08,597
Just like that?

619
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:09,830
Or what?

620
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:13,129
No sincerity.

621
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:14,330
Fine.

622
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,830
What do I have to do for you
to believe I'm sincere?

623
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,330
Why are you smiling like that?

624
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,629
Strange.

625
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,663
Help me fulfill a small wish.

626
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,764
What wish?

627
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:31,629
Haven't thought of it yet.
I'll tell you when I do.

628
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:38,930
It can't be illegal.

629
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,196
And you can't force someone to do
something they don't want to.

630
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:41,729
Of course not.

631
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,663
Mr. Wang, happy birthday.

632
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:50,163
Thank you.

633
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:52,363
Grandpa.

634
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,062
Happy Birthday.

635
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,229
Yi, my little treasure.

636
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:58,930
You're so well-behaved.

637
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,963
Pops, when is your birthday? I didn't know.

638
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:06,196
Mr. Wang, happy birthday.

639
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:09,263
Happy. When everyone's happy, I am happy.

640
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,396
The birthday person should make a wish.

641
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:13,764
I want to make a wish.

642
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:16,629
My first wish is…

643
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,462
Come on, you press it.

644
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,033
♫ No matter who disapproves ♫

645
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:38,497
Alright, let's go.

646
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:39,597
We'll compete in teams.

647
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:40,997
Come over here.

648
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:42,363
Let me tell you.

649
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:45,430
One dad pairs with one daughter.

650
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,930
Then I'm with Yi.

651
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:52,663
Shiping, you're with Chunfeng.

652
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,963
Then please take care of Yi.

653
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:58,263
No problem.

654
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:00,997
Then please take care of Chunfeng.

655
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:07,963
Let's go, Daddy.

656
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:09,096
Good daughter.

657
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:15,363
Actually,

658
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,330
today is not my dad's birthday.

659
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,196
I know.

660
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:22,129
You knew?

661
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,129
The last time I went to your hometown,

662
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,196
in your family's living room,

663
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,764
I saw it.

664
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:27,830
On your dad's medicine bag,

665
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,229
there was a birth date written.

666
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:32,729
And yet you still went along with him.

667
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:34,597
Why not?

668
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,597
Your dad clearly set up the game for me.

669
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,796
Wouldn't it be such a waste
if I didn't take it?

670
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:40,696
And everyone had a lot of fun today.

671
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:42,030
Didn't they?

672
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,196
Do you know why he wanted
to arrange this match today?

673
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,096
He probably hoped

674
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:53,597
that his precious daughter
would teach me hands-on.

675
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:17,964
I'll only demonstrate once.

676
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,095
Watch closely.

677
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:20,330
Yes, teacher.

678
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:24,130
Pull it tight in front.

679
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,497
Cast it out.

680
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,330
Then the float will pop up.

681
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,225
[Han Xinzheng]

682
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:42,429
It's okay, you take it.

683
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:45,863
Really?

684
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:47,095
It's okay.

685
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:48,296
Go ahead.

686
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:56,729
Hello?

687
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:03,296
Okay.

688
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,536
I know.

689
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,363
The big director has already shown goodwill,

690
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:12,429
willing to reduce his design fee.

691
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:15,596
Doesn't this score points for your performance?

692
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,696
Yes, but…

693
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,163
Listen to me again.

694
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:23,229
If you're willing to face Han Xinzheng,

695
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:24,830
you'll be a magnanimous good woman

696
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,429
who understands the bigger picture.

697
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,630
Doesn't that earn you more points?

698
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,196
Yes, it does.

699
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:35,229
But I can't get over it in my heart.

700
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,929
Dear,

701
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,130
I know you can't get over it.

702
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,429
So this is the time for you to thoroughly

703
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,830
crush him.

704
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,429
So you're saying,

705
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:49,630
I was here, and then…

706
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,896
If it were me,

707
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:56,696
I would definitely take the opportunity
to play a prank on him.

708
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,130
Chen Duomi, I feel, I feel you're different.

709
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,830
I feel like you've recently been

710
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,262
thinking.

711
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,095
I have a secret weapon.

712
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,530
My net friend gave me

713
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,363
an essential oil for unlocking wisdom.

714
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:11,363
I find it very effective.

715
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,830
It's invigorating and mind-awakening.

716
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:17,997
Be careful, let me tell you.

717
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:23,363
It seems to smell quite nice.

718
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,896
But I feel like this taste is very familiar.

719
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:28,363
It's like…

720
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,163
It seems like I've smelled it somewhere before.

721
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:43,997
So early in the morning, who is it?

722
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:45,530
Come in.

723
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,363
Good morning.

724
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,429
Zhou.

725
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:51,429
Didn't you say you were going
to come to the office early today?

726
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:54,997
So I thought you probably hadn't had breakfast.

727
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:56,830
Smoked chicken sandwich.

728
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,463
No mayonnaise.

729
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:00,964
You remembered.

730
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,330
That's so thoughtful.

731
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,229
Of course.

732
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:05,262
Ever since

733
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,463
we started interning at the company together,

734
00:37:08,463 --> 00:37:09,596
I noticed

735
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,663
that every time you order a sandwich,

736
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,562
you never add mayonnaise.

737
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:16,130
So I've remembered it all this time.

738
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:19,262
Also, during our company meals,

739
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:21,163
whenever there's meat on the menu,

740
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,296
you always choose chicken first.

741
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,497
Then I'll help myself.

742
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:28,630
Thank you.

743
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,896
What's this?

744
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:49,463
Don't open it yet.

745
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,530
Why?

746
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,997
I thought

747
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:57,497
when you are

748
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:59,929
bored in a meeting or feeling down,

749
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,262
you can open it.

750
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,262
So mysterious.

751
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:05,463
Can't I take a peek first?

752
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:07,530
No, it's a surprise.

753
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,929
You can't.

754
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:13,363
Being so secretive first thing in the morning.

755
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:15,062
This makes me very curious.

756
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:17,429
Anyway, it's a surprise.

757
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:19,262
Just promise me you won't open it.

758
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,030
Got it.

759
00:38:23,863 --> 00:38:26,130
Enjoy your breakfast.

760
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,196
Don't go hungry.

761
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,262
I…

762
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,095
Go ahead with your work.

763
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,262
Bye.

764
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:35,696
Bye.

765
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:41,763
Bye.

766
00:38:49,497 --> 00:38:51,396
Bro, good morning.

767
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,729
What's up?

768
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,130
Coming so early,

769
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:58,797
you're probably not here to talk
about official business, right?

770
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:01,330
Bro.

771
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,497
I think I'm about to win.

772
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,964
Really? Are you serious?

773
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:12,929
How is it going on your end?

774
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:15,429
Very good.

775
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:16,663
Incredibly great, yeah!

776
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:17,863
You better watch out.

777
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,630
We still don't know who will win or lose.

778
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,663
Right, it's not over yet.

779
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,330
You are also quite impressive.

780
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:33,830
Meng Heng.

781
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,396
In the race between the tortoise
and the hare, the tortoise wins in the end.

782
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:39,229
You can do it, tortoise.

783
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:40,463
Wait.

784
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:41,797
You can do it, Meng Heng.

785
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:47,330
I've generally greeted all the developers now.

786
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,896
Everyone has been working hard these days.

787
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,429
Actually, the boss knows about this too.

788
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,696
However, it's quite obvious

789
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:57,463
he doesn't want to get involved
between us and the planning department.

790
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:00,497
No wonder they say Manager Wu
has strong backing at the company,

791
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:02,062
with the boss supporting him.

792
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:04,196
But clearly, it's the planning
department's fault.

793
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,630
Why doesn't the boss take action against him?

794
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,964
Wu Tianfu fought side by side
with the boss in the old days.

795
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:10,262
He's an old comrade-in-arms.

796
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:11,262
Unless he messes up big time,

797
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:13,030
it's hard to take him down.

798
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,863
But we can't just let
the planning department people

799
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:17,497
bully us like this, right?

800
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:18,763
I agree.

801
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:21,062
We should teach Wu Tianfu a lesson.

802
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,729
Then let's all think together

803
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:28,429
about how to make the planning
department learn respect.

804
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,896
I have an idea.

805
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,163
What is it?

806
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,429
Just pick a night when it's dark and windy

807
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:42,964
and lie in wait in an alley.

808
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,130
When the right moment comes…

809
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:52,843
[Wu Tianfu]

810
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,296
You scoundrel!

811
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,596
- Take this!
- Get this.

812
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,095
- Does it hurt?
- Stealing data, huh?

813
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:11,095
Who is it?

814
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:12,596
Take this.

815
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,630
It's my fault, I'm sorry.

816
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,062
It hurts.

817
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:22,330
What kind of ridiculous idea is that?

818
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,929
That's terrible.

819
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,596
Can you think of something practical?

820
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:28,896
If anything, you should use a bag
to cover him and beat him up for real.

821
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:29,997
That won't do.

822
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:32,363
We would not do anything illegal.

823
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,696
That's not our style.

824
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,663
Say something constructive.

825
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:38,562
Alright, let me
think about what else can be done.

826
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:41,163
- I think…
- Got it.

827
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:43,229
- Countermeasure at hand.
- Countermeasure…

828
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:44,630
at hand.

829
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:50,229
Yazi.

830
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:51,396
Cindy.

831
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:53,396
You two are in sync for the first time.

832
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,095
Yazi.

833
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:02,429
Elaborate.

834
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:03,964
What do you mean?

835
00:42:06,497 --> 00:42:09,497
Doesn't the planning department
still have a list of developers?

836
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:11,095
Then let's use this list of developers.

837
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,997
Let's plot another diversion…

838
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:16,576
[Sales Department]

839
00:42:17,296 --> 00:42:18,964
What for?

840
00:42:18,964 --> 00:42:19,964
Let me say it first.

841
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:21,497
I won't turn myself in.

842
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,062
Anyway, what's done is done.

843
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:25,196
From now on, we can rely on our own skills.

844
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:26,196
Got it.

845
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:27,997
Why are you so defensive?

846
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,763
Let me tell you.

847
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:36,262
A little angel took the blame for us.

848
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,296
Really?

849
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:38,396
Who would be so kind?

850
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:44,863
Meng Heng.

851
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,330
He took the blame for us.

852
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:49,095
No, he's one of Cindy Wang's people.

853
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:51,163
How could he possibly help us?

854
00:42:51,163 --> 00:42:53,363
I'm not anyone's person.

855
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,530
It just so happens

856
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,163
that Yingjun's stocks made me some money.

857
00:42:58,997 --> 00:43:00,530
Consider it compensation for the heartache.

858
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,196
That's a small matter. No need to mention it.

859
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:05,729
So it's because of the money.

860
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:08,296
Yingjun and I have something
to discuss with you.

861
00:43:09,763 --> 00:43:10,964
Right.

862
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,363
It's about a deal we want to discuss with you.

863
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:15,964
What kind of deal?

864
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,997
Here's the thing.

865
00:43:22,696 --> 00:43:24,062
Come in.

866
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:31,456
Manager.

867
00:43:32,497 --> 00:43:35,095
I have something important to report to you.

868
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:37,497
Come in and say it.

869
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:45,095
Manager.

870
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:46,130
I found out

871
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,830
that Vice President Han
has another secret file.

872
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:50,562
It contains records

873
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:53,095
of In-depth descriptions of land developers.

874
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,497
In-depth descriptions?

875
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:57,530
The personalities and various preferences

876
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,130
of those developers.

877
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,663
I believe that as long as we get this list

878
00:44:00,663 --> 00:44:01,830
before interacting with them,

879
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,396
we can definitely seal the deal.

880
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,330
Is that so?

881
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:12,763
If that's the case, why haven't
you brought it over quickly?

882
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,363
I want to as well.

883
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:15,997
But…

884
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:19,396
The other party is asking

885
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:21,763
for 200,000.

886
00:44:21,763 --> 00:44:22,763
200,000?

887
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:39,297
[In the shadows of the truth,
sincerity is the only light.]

888
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,363
[Next Episode]
What has to be faced will have to be faced.

889
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:45,262
- Vice President Han.
- She probably won't give you a hard time.

890
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:48,997
- Be careful.
- What should I call you in the future?

891
00:44:48,997 --> 00:44:50,296
Mr. Cai, the planning department has decided

892
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:52,830
to start trying land development.

893
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,997
Next, Wu Tianfu will fall into our plan

894
00:44:54,997 --> 00:44:56,729
step by step.

895
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:57,797
What is this thing?

896
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:59,830
- Okay, it seems like a virus.
- Virus.

897
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,863
Poaching from others,

898
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:02,330
stealing others' secrets,

899
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,130
is that what a good colleague would do?

900
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:06,696
Rest assured.

901
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:07,763
She is busy this afternoon.

902
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:09,296
