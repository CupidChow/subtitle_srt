Mr. Chen.

Mr. Chen.

19
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,566
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,033
- You look so young.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,868
I am the planning department manager of Jingdu Construction, Wu Tianfu.

22
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,133
Talent Wu.

23
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,300
Right. Hello.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,834
I also know Director Zhang.

25
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:29,900
As for Secretary Wang, we have always been good colleagues.

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,800
- So you are colleagues.
- Yes.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,466
Hello.

28
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:37,833
Poaching others, stealing others' secrets,

29
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,467
is that what a good colleague would do?

30
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:47,267
Director Zhang, this is a misunderstanding.

31
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:50,167
I really don't know what the subordinates did.

32
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,366
However, if Secretary Wang is unhappy,

33
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:57,467
then… I can apologize to you right now.

34
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,367
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,366
Manager Wu,

36
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,999
let's not discuss company matters at a private gathering.

37
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,566
If you have anything to do, you can leave first.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,934
What a coincidence. Since you are here anyway,

39
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:23,834
how about having a dart competition together?

40
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,633
Good idea.

41
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,334
Shall we play darts together? Do you know how to play?

42
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,700
Sure, darts it is.

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,999
Then I'll go first.

44
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,000
How should we play?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,534
Okay.

46
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll explain the game rules.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,934
Each person gets three darts.

48
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,034
The one with the highest score wins.

49
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:38,734
There's a penalty for the loser.

50
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,133
Is that okay?

51
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,834
No problem here. You?

52
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,266
I'm okay.

53
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,034
Don't go easy.

54
00:02:58,467 --> 00:02:59,534
It's your turn. Good luck.

55
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,033
Watch me.

56
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,934
- This dart is really…
- The posture was perfect,

57
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:08,666
but the score might…

58
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,266
Daqi, no worries.

59
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,235
It's a friendly match, come on.

60
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,266
Didn't you see they all went crooked?

61
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,333
Yes, yes.

62
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,366
Normally, when Daqi plays darts, he gets very high scores.

63
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,634
- Is that true?
- Yes.

64
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,601
He's been practicing a lot recently.

65
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,833
Here, your turn.

66
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,001
Okay, my turn.

67
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,967
Sorry.

68
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,667
I forgot to explain the rules clearly.

69
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,434
Besides the penalty for the loser,

70
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:36,700
the loser also has to foot the bill today.

71
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,400
Is that okay?

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,367
I'm okay.

73
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,534
I'm okay with that.

74
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:07,200
Did you hear

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,934
Wu Tianfu's piercing scream?

76
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,834
It was really satisfying.

77
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:18,533
I guarantee that he will never dare to mess with you again.

78
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,966
Maybe.

79
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,699
What's wrong?

80
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,134
I helped you teach Wu Tianfu a lesson.

81
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:36,434
Aren't you happy?

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,099
Thank you for your intention,

83
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:41,766
but I don't recall asking for your help.

84
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:48,401
If that's the case,

85
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:53,434
why did you complain to me about Wu Tianfu before?

86
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,301
Complaining is one thing,

87
00:04:55,301 --> 00:05:00,101
what I was hoping for was his respect at work instead of using this method.

88
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:05,934
So you can play a prank on Han Xinzheng,

89
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:09,233
but when I helped you vent your anger on Wu Tianfu, you were not happy.

90
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,567
What-What is your standard? I don't understand.

91
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,833
You could have at least discussed it with me.

92
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,301
Or do you also think I'm not capable?

93
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:20,267
Of course, I think you are capable.

94
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:24,833
I… I just thought that if I could help you with anything, I'd do it.

95
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:30,001
See, just like today when I connected you with Daqi.

96
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,334
But from beginning to end, you never mentioned my work capability.

97
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,168
You made me feel like decorative flowers that can only be placed next to you.

98
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,901
No.

99
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,867
You have to get familiar first when you meet each other, right?

100
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,599
We can't cooperate immediately, can we?

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,801
Why can't you be like Lily

102
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,833
and try to understand my real intention?

103
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:57,634
Do you also want me to be like Sister Lily and stay quietly on the side

104
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:00,301
when you men talk about serious matters?

105
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,734
Or do you want me to wait for you at home, offer you slippers, and tell you that you've worked hard?

106
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:06,133
That's not what I meant. Why do you have to misinterpret me?

107
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,900
This is the only feeling I have today.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,767
Okay.

109
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,333
Even if this is really the case,

110
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,267
those bad guys you encountered before exhausted you.

111
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:26,700
But now it's different. You don't have to struggle so hard anymore.

112
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,467
I can take care of you. I can support you for a lifetime.

113
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:37,833
You've drunk too much.

114
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,300
Let's talk during the meeting tomorrow.

115
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,033
Let the driver take you home first.

116
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,401
Sorry.

117
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,967
I… Let's talk tomorrow.

118
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,567
I drank too much.

119
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,900
I'm drunk.

120
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,466
Good night.

121
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,267
- Women are so hard to understand.
- Women are so hard to understand.

122
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,234
Not at all.

123
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,500
You two chose to challenge above your level,

124
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,001
loving those who don't love you.

125
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:48,034
However, I'm not one to criticize you.

126
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,866
I also tend to love those who do not love me back.

127
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,634
No, wait a minute.

128
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:56,168
You two. As to who loves whom, and who can be with whom,

129
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:57,434
there is no conclusion yet.

130
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,267
Why sentence yourself to death?

131
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:02,001
If anyone, it's me.

132
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,234
I've already received the verdict.

133
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,101
What do you mean?

134
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:21,301
Xiaoyun, do you want to have dinner together?

135
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:26,333
I just found a newly opened highly rated restaurant.

136
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm busy. Maybe next time.

137
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,966
Brother Zhou, what exactly did Manager Gao reply to you?

138
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,101
See for yourselves.

139
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,999
"I'm busy. Maybe next time."

140
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,701
If there's a next time, it means there's hope.

141
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:24,000
She didn't put a period on you. Why scare yourself?

142
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,467
Is that so?

143
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,767
Is that what Xiaoyun really thinks?

144
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,999
If she had gotten back together with Vice President Han,

145
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:33,601
she definitely wouldn't have replied to you like that.

146
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,267
I think you're being too optimistic.

147
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:39,300
I think Brother Zhou is being too pessimistic this time.

148
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,267
- Quickly.
- What?

149
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:44,468
- Cindy.
- Where are you going?

150
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,167
Where were you?

151
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,133
It's none of your business.

152
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,100
- Did you drink?
- No.

153
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,134
Yes, you did. You can barely stand.

154
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,301
Are you in a bad mood?

155
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,168
Not really.

156
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,434
You all are here.

157
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,234
Sister Cindy.

158
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:07,768
- I told you not to bother me, go over there…
- Just wait.

159
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,799
- Open another bottle.
- Why?

160
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,566
This one got shaken.

161
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,934
So sweet.

162
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,666
What are you kids drinking?

163
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,299
Cindy can't beat me,

164
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,166
so she asked her man to take revenge on me.

165
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,933
I accept my loss gracefully. We already agreed earlier.

166
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,100
This meal is on me.

167
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,199
- Okay.
- But don't forget

168
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,868
there's also the penalty of flicking the ear.

169
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:43,899
One, two, three.

170
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,566
Darn it, I was planning to connect with that pretty boy Mr. Chen.

171
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,734
Daqi.

172
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,934
Didn't you see they all went crooked?

173
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,534
Yes, yes, it's all crooked.

174
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:58,768
Normally, when Daqi plays darts, he gets very high scores.

175
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:16,034
Finally had a meal with the senior who cares about me the most.

176
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:25,834
No wonder I found Mr. Chen's wife a bit familiar.

177
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,500
Morning.

178
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,066
Morning.

179
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,401
What's wrong with you? Didn't sleep well last night?

180
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,966
Really? Do I look that bad?

181
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,334
I slept very well.

182
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,133
I'm fine, right?

183
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,034
Did you sleep well?

184
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:50,066
Or did you catch a cold?

185
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:58,000
Maybe, maybe I've just been tired recently.

00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:07,267
Hurry up.

00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,566
Thank you.

190
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,104
Manager.

191
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,601
Brother Zhou, can you only see the manager?

192
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,800
We were rushing over.

193
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,033
Sorry, I didn't see you earlier.

194
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,533
Apologies.

195
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:23,567
By the way, I think our construction project can add some new features.

196
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,034
I sorted it out yesterday and sent it to your mailbox.

197

Did you receive it?

198
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,500
I haven't looked at it yet.

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,466
Last night.

200
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,780
Sorry.

201
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,434
Last night, I…

202
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:38,334
Are you sure you're okay?

203
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,400
You're coughing, maybe you should see a doctor.

204
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,660

205
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,801

00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,668
I'll go check on him.

209

Brother Zhou.

210
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,933
Your cough was so fake.

211
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,167
Even you could tell.

212
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,500
It's so obvious, okay?

213
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,599
What's wrong with you?

214
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,466
No, I…

215
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:41,667
I just didn't want to hear Xiaoyun talking about what happened last night.

216
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,600
Why?

217
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:51,500
If she lies, it means she's hiding something.

218
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,701
What if she just wanted to be honest?

219
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:59,434
- Honest?
- Yeah.

220
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,334
Honesty would be worse.

221
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,166
Because it means she doesn't feel anything for me.

She isn't worried at all about me being upset.

223

You like me?

I don't want to hide my feelings for you

I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

Thank you for being willing to say it.

You should erase what I just said with an eraser.

Why?

241
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,900
I was too impulsive.

242
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,066
I should have suppressed my feelings for you.

243
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,868
I can't offer you anything right now.

244
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,234
Previously, I was set up by the sales department.

Don't say that.

00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:35,050
to make me meet a real estate developer

264
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,700
who just returned from Southeast Asia.

265
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,448
Who?

266
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:47,201
Mr. Chen of Xin Daqi Real Estate Development, Chen Daqi.

267

He is a good opportunity for us.

If he is a good opportunity, why are you sighing?

Does it hurt?

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,367
Ouch.

278
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,000
Exactly.

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,234
I downloaded that app.

280
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:30,468
Provoking me was the biggest mistake of his life.

281

You saying that even scares me.

Don't worry, I only deal with bad people.

I really don't get it.

How can you drink coffee with him calmly, after all he's done to you?

286
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,967
You wouldn't still have feelings for him, right?

Since childhood, he has given us siblings various goals to achieve.

292
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,266
Being top three in exam results was the most basic.

293

Even for future careers, it can only be a doctor or a lawyer, either one.

294
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,967
In terms of academic performance, I couldn't meet his standards.

295
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:28,434
So in life, I tried my best to follow his rules.

296
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,900
You wouldn't believe it even if I told you.

297
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,700
But before I became an adult, I had never even eaten from a street vendor.

298
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:38,434
Later, I got used to it.

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,234
Speaking of how I had a bit of ordinary life,

301
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:48,467
it was because when I joined the company, Vice President Han took me on business trips.

302
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:53,934
He taught me a lot, and also let me try many street snacks.

- No need to thank me.

By the way, Manager, why did you pull out a blade of grass just now?

Let me tell you a little secret.

If you see a street food stall, you can test its wind direction.

If you stand downwind and smell the aroma,

323
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,260
it means the food must be good.

I really can't do this.

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,633
This is too deliberate.

Forget it, since we are in the company, let's talk business.

So last-minute. Did something happen to Yiyi?

After all, the status of a secretary is determined by the boss's power in the company.

00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,400
However, I have to say something first.

361
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,867
I will definitely do my best, but I can't guarantee it.

362
00:22:55,867 --> 00:23:00,333
After all, the decision-making power is with my husband.

363
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,067
I'm aware of that.

364
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:05,000
You've taught me before.

365
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,080
To be a proficient secretary,

366
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,300
you need to make your superiors think they're in charge.

367
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:17,100
So you remember everything I've said.

368
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,334
In that case,

369
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:24,900
not helping my own junior apprentice would be unreasonable.

370
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,899
Thank you, Sister Lily. I love you the most.

371
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,934
I have handed over today's meeting materials to Executive Manager Han.

372
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:46,568
If you have any questions, contact me anytime.
[Zhang Shiping: OK]

373
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:49,167
Did something really happen?

374
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:52,000
Why did he only send one sticker all day?

375
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,533
Could you be mad at me?

376
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,101
Do straight men also have fragile hearts?

377
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:09,380
[A new message]

378
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,700
[Meng Heng]
Do you want to have a late night snack?

379
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,966
The boss gave an extra portion again.

380
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,433
It's at the door.

381
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,234
Luckily you opened the door.

382
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:27,367
Otherwise, I'd have to eat both portions myself.

383
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,800
My workout would be for nothing, man.

384
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,700
Why do you have to finish it all at once?

385
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,633
Because I have to drive a client later.

386
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:38,734
And the noodles won't taste good if they get soggy. It's a waste.

387
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:42,167
I thought you were part of the "lying flat" generation. I didn't expect you to be so hardworking.

388
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:44,901
And you don't waste food, not bad.

389
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,467
That's your stereotype,

390
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,668
thinking all Generation Z are the same.

391
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,067
I've never said I was going to lie flat.

392
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:56,300
It's just that my goals are different from others.

393
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:00,001
What is my motto?

394
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,601
- How would I know?
- Of course, you wouldn't know.

395
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,466
My motto is, "When others lie flat,

396
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:07,834
I stand."

397
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,767
As long as I put in a bit more effort than others,

398
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:13,033
I'm closer to success than they are.

399
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:16,034
I didn't expect you to say those mottos.

400
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,800
What?

401
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,700
Working harder than others.

402
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,466
I just came up with an idea that I want to include in my proposal.

403
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:32,401
Do you want to finish the noodles first?

404
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:34,200
It's fine, you can eat them.

405
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,401
Remember to wash the dishes after eating.

406
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,134
Make sure to eat everything clean.

407
00:25:38,134 --> 00:25:40,366
You're really not eating?

408
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,334
Cindy.

409
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,533
Are you looking for Manager Gao?

410
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,867
Yes, the boss is at the course right now.

411
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,533
He wants to introduce Manager Gao to a foreign real estate developer.

412
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,001
So I came to ask.

413
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,334
But she went to meet a small developer.

414
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,267
She just left and won't be back so soon.

415
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:06,101
She went out?

416
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:13,600
Well, I'll ask the boss if you can come with me.

417
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,134
Are you okay with that?

418
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:18,067
You're familiar with the cases in the sales department anyway.

419
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,616
Do me a favor.

420
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,200
Okay, let me just hand over my current work first.

421
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
If you're sure it's okay, let me know.

422
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,668
Okay, I'll confirm with the boss.

423
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,433
If it's okay, let's meet in the parking lot later.

424
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,467
- Okay.
- Thanks.

425
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,133
Thank you.

426
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:33,934
This real estate developer

427
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:36,533
is an emerging developer from the Thailand and Southeast Asia regions.

428
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:39,100
Collaborating with our Jingdu this time, he wants to hear our

429
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,933
township development plans or small housing products planning and sales.

430
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,267
Are you listening to me? What are you looking at?

431
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,800
Yes. Wait.

432
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,267
Your tie is crooked. Let me take these.

433
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:53,767
Here, well,

434
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,967
I think we can incorporate the sustainable housing concept

435
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:57,967
into this new idea. What do you think?

436
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:01,167
- Great.
- So which room are we going to?

437
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:02,901
Second floor at the front.

438
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,633
- Let's take the elevator. Here.
- Let's go. Hurry.

439
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:08,234
Okay, got it.

440
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,900
Thank you.

441
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:19,300
Mr. Qin is almost done playing.

442
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,334
He said to wait for him.

443
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,400
Okay.

444
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:32,600
Last time at the café, thank you.

445
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,533
Thank you for speaking up for me.

446
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:36,700
Don't say that.

447
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,834
I should be the one thanking you for helping me connect with Mr. Qin on this project.

448
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,633
Maybe it's because…

449
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,434
Because I've always been thinking about you.

450
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:54,534
So naturally, you were the first to come up in my mind,

451
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,866
just like before.

452
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,834
Mr. Chen.

453
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:11,700
- This is…
- Cindy.

454
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,634
- Mr. Chen.
- Such a coincidence.

455
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:15,601
- Did you also come to play golf?
- No.

456
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:17,567
Do you know each other?

457
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,100
He was introduced by Director Zhang.

458
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,733
He is Director Zhang's university classmate.

459
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,000
Where is your Zhang Shiping?

460
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,966
Why didn't I see him at today's game?

461
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,033
Doesn't he love playing golf?

462
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,867
He is probably busy.

463
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,033
What about our boss?

464
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:33,399
He's still showering and hasn't come out yet.

465
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,867
- All right.
- Come on, sit.

466
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,401
Since we all know each other, don't be shy.

467
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,167
Let's sit and chat.

468
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,366
Thinking about it, it's been a while since I played golf with your Shiping.

469
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:47,234
You know, he has a coach's soul. Do you know that?

470
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,000
A coach's soul?

471
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,300
He loves teaching others to play fastballs when playing.

472
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,167
He has a famous saying,

473
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,433
"In all martial arts, only speed is invincible."

474
00:28:57,433 --> 00:29:01,167
So he plays golf with speed, accuracy, and precision.

475
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:07,901
Cindy, it's all thanks to you today.

476
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:10,033
You know, the boss was originally worried

477
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,600
that this cooperation project with Xin Daqi might not work out.

478
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
But I think he can rest assured now.

479
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,734
After all, we met a familiar face.

480
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,633
It should go very smoothly.

481
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,834
It will be smooth.

482
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,501
But this project is a bit big,

483
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,501
so I think we'll need some time.

484
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,000
After a discussion within the sales department,

485
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,300
we'll present the final, complete plan to the boss.

486
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,834
Okay, no problem.

487
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,260
As long as the plan is done before the boss and I

488
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,590
go abroad for the field trip.

489
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,167
Actually, I think the boss treats you differently.

490
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:43,800
I have never heard of him taking a secretary abroad on field trips.

491
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,199
I think he must be intentionally training you.

492
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,366
Really?

493
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,133
Perhaps.

494
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:56,301
But I don't think too much about it. I just do my job well.

495
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,567
Well said.

496
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,599
Don't overthink it.

497
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,834
Sometimes opportunities take you places,

498
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,300
and you just need to follow.

499
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,633
Sometimes, don't be too attached to the current situation.

500
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:13,434
Maybe you can meet new people abroad

501
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:16,499
and start a whole new life.

502
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,467
I saw it.

503
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:26,934
Today. I saw Xiaoyun and Vice President Han.

504
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:37,333
Well, actually, that place is a place for business negotiations.

505
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,367
We also went there for business, right?

506
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:41,800
It's just…

507
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,000
Especially since Vice President Han is now with Bosheng,

508
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,967
so they probably went there for business.

509
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:51,033
Then, why did you just advise me

510
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:55,334
about meeting new people abroad and starting a different life?

511
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,767
Meng Heng.

512
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:09,834
Meng Heng, where are you?

513
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,100
I'm here. Wait a minute.

514
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,540
Here.

515
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:17,800
Why did the power suddenly go out?

516
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,801
That's so scary.

517
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:22,933
I didn't know you were so afraid of the dark.

518
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,800
Why weren't you afraid when we went to see the night view that day?

519
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,300
That's different, okay?

520
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,501
Outside, there was still moonlight.

521
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:33,133
But indoors, once it's dark, you can't see anything at all.

522
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,966
And it's a closed space.

523
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:36,934
It's really scary.

524
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,833
I thought you were going to trick me again.

525
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,067
It's possible.

526
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:48,000
Maybe I wanted to hold your hand, so I put on an act.

527
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,834
Don't let go.

528
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,633
I really am very scared.

529
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,452
Really?

530
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,734
It probably won't last long.

531
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,434
- Let's sit and wait.
- Okay.

532
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:05,100
- Don't let go.
- All right.

533
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,300
- Let's sit.
- Okay.

534
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:15,700
You're being dramatic.

535
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:21,833
Although you always say you don't like me,

536
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:25,634
don't you think the way you just saved me was very natural?

537
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,500
I just turned on the flashlight.

538
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:34,033
Perhaps, in your subconscious,

539
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,366
you've already fallen for me?

540
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:38,801
What do you say? Do you want to try kissing?

541
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,966
Maybe we'll feel some power (chemistry).

542
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,133
There's the power.

543
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
- I mean the power is back.
- Right.

544
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,233
I'm going to the bathroom.

545
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,501
- Morning, Sister Cindy. I'm going up first.
- Morning.

546
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,052
Okay.

547
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,199
Mr. Chen. Lily.

548
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,334
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hi.

549
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,033
What are you two doing here today?

550
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,834
We came to have a meeting.

551
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,001
To have a meeting?

552
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,668
But the boss didn't tell me.

553
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:38,366
Besides, I told the boss that the project proposal would take some time.

554
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:42,267
Cindy, I believe your sales department will come up with a good proposal,

555
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:45,199
but you have to know that when there are options,

556
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:48,267
the first to act usually has the advantage.

557
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,801
Just like your Zhang Shiping said,

558
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,734
"In all martial arts, only speed is invincible."

559
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:54,000
Everything must be fast.

560
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,733
- What do you mean…
- Mr. Chen.

561
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,034
- Sister Lily.
- Madam.

562
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,600
Please come inside.

563
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,733
The overall plan has been prepared.

564
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:06,033
We will give you a detailed report soon, satisfaction guaranteed.

565
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:08,134
- Okay.
- Please, come inside.

566
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,434
Our front door uses a four-in-one electronic lock,
[4-in-1 Electronic Lock]

567
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:18,100
providing you with the safest front door protection.

568
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,134
When you enter, this is the entrance hall.

569
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:22,600
Next to it, there is a long island.

570
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,868
Behind it, you can have a hidden appliance cabinet.
[Hidden Appliance Cabinet]

571
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:29,333
Overall, it applies an open-concept style.

572
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,900
Next, you will see the living and dining rooms.

573
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,099
They also use an open-concept design,

574
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,501
making your living experience more spacious and comfortable.

575
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:50,001
Moreover, we have another great advantage,

576
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:52,600
which is the clear distinction between public and private areas.

577
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,633
So from the living room, you won't directly see your room.

578
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:02,134
Mr. Chen, what you just saw was virtual VR.

579
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,300
- 360-degree zero dead angle viewing.
- It scared me.

580
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,367
This way, our consumers can even view houses from abroad, with zero error.

581
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,966
They can choose to view any introduction by clicking.

582
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:14,100
It's convenient and efficient.

583
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,167
The idea is quite innovative.

584
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,734
Apart from that,

585
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:23,966
our Jingdu also offers 0800 online real-time customer service.

586
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:27,133
If consumers have any questions, just go online,

587
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:30,401
we will provide the perfect answer with zero time difference,

588
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:33,967
truly achieving the three services of zero dead angles, zero errors,

589
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,101
and zero time difference.

590
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:43,534
Stop sighing.

591
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:45,234
"A sigh brings poverty for three years."

592
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,267
You've sighed away all your good luck.

593
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:50,500
Good luck has long left me, all right?

594
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,767
I have truly become a tool now.

595
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:58,034
It was hard to train Fang Aisi to do live streams and shoot videos.

596
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:02,500
Now look at it. When the big shots come, I'm immediately told to get lost.

597
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,066
If I hadn't found my next job yet,

598
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:08,901
who would still be here suffering this?

599
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:14,233
You… You deserve it.

600
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,434
You should have resigned with the list of those land developers

601
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:19,800
and gone to another company.

602
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,701
Yet you gave it to Wu Tianfu,

603
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,966
turning yourself into a tool of the planning department

604
00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:26,400
and a traitor to the sales department.

605
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,134
Okay, Brother Yingjun.

606
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:30,200
I already have a headache.

607
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,901
Stop nagging.

608
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:34,234
I think... you should resign.

609
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:38,333
Helping Fang Aisi with live streaming everyday isn't a solution.

610
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,400
Brother Yingjun,

611
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,234
I know it's shameless to say this, but...

612
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:48,900
Wait, don't say it then.

613
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,501
No, I must say it.

614
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,834
Brother Yingjun, please, I'm counting on you.

615
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,467
Can you help me ask Sister Xiaoyun

616
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,434
to let me return to the sales department?

617
00:36:58,434 --> 00:36:59,834
Okay?

618
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:04,300
It's really shameless.

619
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,633
Brother Yingjun, please.

620
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,200
Help me out, please.

621
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,934
I object.

622
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,801
I also don't agree.

623
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:15,868
Brother Yingjun, are you an amnesiac or afraid to remember?

624
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:21,067
Guo Shijie, that ungrateful person, turned our sales department upside down.

625
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:25,368
I know. But I think he's at his wits' end.

626
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,300
That's why he's begging me.

627
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,101
After all, he's my bro. He really seemed pitiful. So…

628
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:33,567
"The pitiful must have something despicable."

629
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:36,466
Yazi, calm down first.

630
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:38,867
Let's hear everyone's opinions.

631
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:42,534
Cindy, you haven't said anything.

632
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:46,200
Do you not oppose Guo Shijie's return to the sales department?

633
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,401
I am thinking. The planning department is clearly going against us.

634
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,800
You've heard about what happened with Mr. Chen this morning.

635
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,401
They're trying to steal our clients.

636
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:56,834
Then let's take them back. Are we afraid of them?

637
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,634
Yes, I thought the same at first.

638
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:01,467
But I think this back-and-forth struggle is endless.

639
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:05,066
So we should open up a new battlefield.

640
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,167
What? What battlefield?

641
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:18,334
This case with Mr. Qin. In short, it's a small developer

642
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,633
who ran out of funds halfway through the project.

643
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:21,767
They hope our Jingdu can take over.

644
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,667
Meng Heng, these are documents for Manager Gao.

645
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,966
Please pass them on for me.

646
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:27,166
Thank you.

647
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,000
Wait.

648
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:33,334
Why don't you wait for the manager to finish the meeting and give it to her yourself?

649
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:35,833
No need.

650
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,867
Xiaoyun and I…

651
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,999
I have discussed it with Cindy.

652
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,166
Since Yazi still has Changyi Assets,

653
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,434
so we decided to give this case to Yingjun.

654
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:51,800
What do you all think?

655
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,566
I have no objections.

656
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,966
I'm okay.

657
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,399
Good.

658
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,372
Okay.

659
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,133
We got a good deal on this case.

660
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,333
Who was so kind to make the connection?

661
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,599
Vice President Han made the connection.

662
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:21,334
Feel free to speak if you have any comments.

663
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,467
Well, do we need to give Vice President Han

664
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,600
a kickback?

665
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,634
If needed, I can ask the engineering department

666
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:36,901
to pay attention to cost control.

667
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:38,801
No need.

668
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:42,034
Vice President Han only facilitates the connection for this case.

669
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:44,999
You can directly contact Mr. Qin for follow-ups.

670
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,267
I see.

671
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:51,501
That's the way to do it.

672
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:52,600
That's not the point.

673
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,466
- Let me massage you while we wait for them.
- I just think it's inappropriate.

674
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:57,400
Sit down.

675
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,567
I didn't expect Sister Xiaoyun and Vice President Han would still contact each other privately.

676
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:04,567
I think there must still be feelings left.

677
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:08,067
Women, oh women.

678
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,534
What are you all doing?

679
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,367
Massaging.

680
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:16,400
It's my turn later.

681
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,466
Is this okay?

682
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:41,067
Come in.

683
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:44,999
Manager.

684
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,401
The documents approved by the president have been sent back.

685
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,001
Put them on my desk.

686
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:53,800
By the way, is Director Zhang's company doing okay?

687
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,999
What happened to his company?

688
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,601
You don't know?

689
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,734
Take your Sister Cindy there.

690
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:06,100
Okay.

691
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:13,568
[Bossdom (Bosheng)]
Is Director Zhang in? I want to see him.

692
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:16,200
Director Zhang instructed not to see anyone today.

693
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,166
Tell him it's Miss Cindy Wang from Jingdu Construction.

694
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,901
But the director said, no matter who it is, he won't see them.

695
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:24,933
Even if it's Miss Wang.

696
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:28,534
Wait for a moment.

697
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:38,466
Not answering the phone, not replying to messages.

698
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:40,300
What's going on?

699
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,334
Tell me. What happened at your company?

700
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:47,201
- Say something.
- Cindy.

701
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:49,500
Let's go outside and talk.

702
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,966
A Japanese contractor suddenly terminated the contract.

703
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:06,900
Director Zhang is currently dealing with this matter.

704
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,801
Terminating the contract without any warning?

705
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:12,702
There must be a reason. What did the other party say?

706
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,800
The other party said many things, but...

707
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:20,267
maybe it's because I have a bad reputation.

708
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:22,333
The other party is a bit opposed.

709
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:25,566
Why didn't he tell me about this…

710
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,267
Shiping must think I would laugh at him

711
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:36,633
and tell him, "See!

712
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:40,966
Employing Han Xinzheng comes with this risk."

713
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:44,601
Come on, do you think I'm the type of person who hits someone when they're down?

714
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,868
Fine, even if I really would say that,

715
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,100
it's still the truth.

716
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,833
If it were me, I wouldn't just disappear suddenly.

717
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,500
I would always be there.

718
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,300
Can't I share the hard times together?

719
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,401
Something this big happened at the company, and he didn't say anything.

720
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:03,100
You guys are all the same.

721
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,334
You hope we women stay quiet

722
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,867
and act like decorative flowers on the side.

723
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:08,100
And when you need us, you want us to praise you and say well done.

724
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,667
When you don't need us, you want us to stay quiet.

725
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,367
- Is that so?
- You're being absurd.

726
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,701
You have an unpleasant experience with him,

727
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,034
but why do you think I'm the same as him?

728
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:18,133
I'm not like him.

729
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:21,567
If you really don't get along with him, just don't do it.

730
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,500
Sorry.

731
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,467
I just…

732
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:35,534
All right.

733
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:38,301
Never mind. I'll head home first.

734
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:32,667
[Pure love does not need fancy packaging. It only requires sincerity and courage.]

735
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:35,967
[Next Episode]
By the end of this month, I will decide who will be the vice president

736
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,167
according to your performance.

737
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:41,301
Let's make Aisi our Jingdu ambassador.

738
00:44:41,301 --> 00:44:42,700
As for Wu Tianfu,

739
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,301
he needs another lesson from me, Teacher Wang.

740
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:47,366
- Manager Wu.
- If I take that document,

741
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:48,467
I can go back to the sales department for real?

742
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:50,799
You just need to say, are you in or out?

743
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:52,366
Xiaoyun, I'm sorry.

744
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:55,166
Look at what you left at my place last night.

745
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,434
I can understand things.

746
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:57,833
You don't need to say anything specific to me.

747
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,700
Thank you for your company during this time.

748
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,000
Now listen to me, strike while the iron is hot.

749
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,902
- Cindy.
- Cindy.

750
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:05,001
What's going on now?

751
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,000
♫ In the end, what can still ♫

752
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,267
♫ Be upheld ♫

753
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:14,581
♫ I can no longer believe ♫

754
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:19,100
♫ In right and wrong ♫

755
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,326
♫ The boundless sea of stars ♫

756
00:45:22,326 --> 00:45:25,208
♫ I wait for you to become no longer illusory ♫

757
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:29,963
♫ I wait for you to become no longer illusory ♫

758
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:35,388
♫ Those past hurts ♫

759
00:45:35,388 --> 00:45:38,620
♫ The involuntary evil ♫

760
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,034
♫ All are left behind ♫

761
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:48,293
♫ Meeting you is the most beautiful accident ♫

762
00:45:48,293 --> 00:45:53,216
♫ I can hardly believe there will be ♫

763
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:55,935
♫ Such a lucky arrival ♫

764
00:45:55,935 --> 00:46:01,216
♫ Meeting you is my greatest anticipation ♫

765
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,402
♫ Fall in love with the present ♫

766
00:46:04,402 --> 00:46:06,597
♫ Because of you ♫

767
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:12,712
♫ I'm no longer afraid of loneliness and solitude ♫
