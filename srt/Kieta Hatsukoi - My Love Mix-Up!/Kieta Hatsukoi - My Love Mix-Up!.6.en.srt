[Previously on My Love Mix-Up!]
Why not confess to him during this outing? I'm sure it'll go well.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,020
Be courageous and take one step forth.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,050
I'm... going to confess to Ida.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,460
I've come to actually like you.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,520
Should we try dating?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,110
Since you confessed your love sincerely, I want to respond to your feelings.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,640
A-Are you serious? Way to go, Aoki!

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,360
Akkun, you're too loud.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,510
Oh, sorry.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,670
Well, good for you.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,240
Yes.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,330
That's only... if I'm remembering it correctly.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,480
Hey.

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,820
Was that camping trip a dream?

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,760
- What are you so anxious about?
- I never thought he' would accept me.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,130
- I wasn't prepared.
- What a pain.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,820
You were the one who liked him first, right?

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,600
I know, but...

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,400
You would never understand my complex emotions.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,070
I originally wanted to get confessed to by a cute girl,

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,940
- then go on dates with her.
- Isn't this fun, Hashimoto?

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,860
That's how I imagine my high school life would be.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,490
It is fun, Aoki.

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,550
It's so much fun, Aoki.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,750
Now am I doing that with Ida?

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,400
Your imagination has gone haywire.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,380
Nothing else matters as long as you like him.

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,370
I wonder if he is serious about me.

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,460
So that's what you're worried about.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,330
Stop moping and just go ask Ida.

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,650
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

32
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,440
- Where are we going?
- To the gym.

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,650
- Right now?
- Yes!

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,020
Ida...

35
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,610
Now, go find out how serious he is.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,030
Aoki?

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,600
Gather around!

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
Okay!

39
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,430
You idiot, what have you done?

40
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,490
Why are you so upset?

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,770
Before the practice game against Shiroyama High School tomorrow,

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,230
there are a few things I want to remind you of.

43
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,720
- Does he have a game tomorrow?
- The player you should look out the most is...

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,500
You should go cheer for him.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,550
Like hell I will.

46
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,930
You're so dishonest with yourself.

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,700
And there's one more person who could really distract us.

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,010
That's right. Their beautiful manager, Kokomi Matsuuchi.

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,840
What is he going on about?

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,530
That has nothing to do with volleyball.

51
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,350
I heard Ms. Kokomi Matsuuchi has a crush on someone

52
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,920
on our team.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,140
What?

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,180
You all know that Toyoda has a girlfriend at Shiroyama High, right?

55
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,140
Apparently, she heard the news from Kokomi personally.

56
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,830
She's going to give him a gift at tomorrow's game.

57
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,840
Toyoda... Is this true?

58
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,590
- Yes.
- Who could it be?

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,500
We've never had girlfriends except for Toyota. Who could it be that she likes?

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,640
The most likely candidate has to be...

61
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,630
Well, it has to be Kosuke.

62
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,320
What?

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,640
You're in trouble, Aoki.

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,870
Your rival has appeared.

65
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,240
I don't care. Not one bit.

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,060
Your legs are shaking like crazy.

[My Love Mix-Up!]
[Episode 6]

68
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,810
What are you going to do?

69
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,520
What do you mean? About what?

70
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,540
The beautiful manager might steal Ida away from you.

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,060
Ida will be fine. He's not a player.

72
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,860
I don't think he would cheat on me.

73
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,000
Cheat? You don't even know if he's serious about you.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Good point.

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,150
- Did you ask Ida how he feels?
- What?

76
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,520
About if he really likes you or not.

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,000
I... can't ask him that.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,100
If you're going to date him, shouldn't you confirm his feelings?

79
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,120
No way! I could never ask him that to his face.

80
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,020
- Then why not ask him via text?
- What?

81
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,930
Just text him casually.

82
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,350
- What do I say to him?
- How should I know?

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,140
- This is between you and Ida.
- You're right.

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,970
That's right.

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,600
Good luck.

Hasshi, we're going without you.

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,740
"Do you like me?"

91
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,020
No, that's too direct.

92
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,270
Should I sound him out with a sticker?

93
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,310

Sota?

98
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,360
Take a bath now, so the water won't get cold.

99

Okay!

100
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,880
Seriously...

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,240
What? N-No way. Crap.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,370
He read it so quickly.

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,910
I wasn't even ready to send it.

104
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,620
But he didn't respond...

105
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,030
Maybe it was just a dream, after all.

106
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,890
I'll tell to you at school next time.

107
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,510
Next time?

108
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,640
When is next time?

109
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,490
Is he putting off his answer

110
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,750
and taking up with the pretty manager?

111
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,880
Calm down. Ida isn't that fickle.

112
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,780
Sota, do you know where my opera glasses are?

113
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,550
Watch them closely.

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,250
Yes, Sir.

115
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,190
She's folding them perfectly right.

116
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,910
She is amazing.

117
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,900
I want a manager like her in our team.

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
- What a beauty.
- She's perfect.

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,020
She's devoted and a hard-worker.

120
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,610
She is the kind of earnest that doesn't slack off even when no one is looking.

121
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,860
A true beauty that would sacrifice herself for someone else's sake.

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,180
Kokomi Matsuuchi, you're incredible.

Well...

You see...

135
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,800
- Gather around!
- Okay!

Well, excuse me.

Sure.

138
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,290
Mr. Taniguchi, what did she say to you?

139
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,700
She was holding something like a present.

140
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,600
Oh, yes. I guess there was someone she wanted to give it to,

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,100
but I told her to give it to them in person.

142
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,500
I knew it. She likes Ida.

143
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,800
She definitely has her eye on him.

144
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,710
That was close.

145
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,560
He almost saw me.

146
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,780

147
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,570
Busted.

148
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,950
Oh? Ida, what are you doing?

149
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,160
We have a practice game today.

150
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,330
Aoki, did you come to cheer for me?

151
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,180
N-No way!

152
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,330
I just forgot something, yo! I'm not interested in your game!

153
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,320
Well...

154
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,070
I was curious about your text yesterday.

155
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,830
Right.

156
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,270
I thought it would be quicker for us to talk at school.

157
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,510
You thought wrong.

158
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,560
That defeats the purpose of texts. You should've given me a hint, at least.

159
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,290
I'm not really good with phones.

160
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,620
What are you, a grandpa?

161
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,990
You know, I realized something when I read your message.

162
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,420
Pardon?

163
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,230
About what?

164
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,420
I don't think I ever properly told you.

165
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,340
Properly told me...?

166
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,460
Is he...

167
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,380
going to say that we should stop?

168
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm looking forward to it.

169
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,370
We're dating, aren't we?

170
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,500
What?

171
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,570
O-Oh, yes.

172
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,570
Me, too.

173
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,200
Well, I have a game to play.

174
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,990
Wait. Is that it?

175
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,880
Nothing's really changed between us, though.

176
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,620
You're right.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,940
Listen,

178
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,600
Ida, do you...

179
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,670
li... li...

180
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,690
- like me?
- I don't know.

181
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,200
What?

182
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,020
I've never liked anyone before.

183
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,140
I don't have any experience to compare you to.

184
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,350
It's weird to date someone without liking them.

185
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,470
Hi, Kosuke.

186
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,400
- Kosuke...?
- She is on a first name basis?

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,960
Matsuuchi.

188
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,040
What? Do you guys know each other?

189
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,830
Yes. I hung out with her before with Toyoda and his girlfriend.

190
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,220
You're not on the volleyball team, are you?

191
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,290
Is he your friend?

192
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,610
Well...

193
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,200
I'm Aoki, his classmate.

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,090
- Are you mad or something?
- Not at all.

195
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,400
So what is it?

196
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,560
Right. Well...

197
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,140
I wasn't sure if you heard

198
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,280
my conversation with Mr. Taniguchi.

199
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,990
- Not really.
- He's a bonehead, and not interested in that kind of stuff.

200
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,880
He's also bad at using phones and barely replies to messages.

201
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,130
According to him, I'm a grandpa.

202
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,010
I like that about you.

203
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,960
You are calm and mature in my eyes.

204
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,240
He's mature because he's a grandpa.

205
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,610
- That's exactly my type.
- What?

206
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,780
I wore makeup and dyed my hair to look more mature,

207
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,050
but it didn't work.

208
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,730
- Isn't dying your hair against school rules?
- Are you a model student?

209
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,130
- You're so straight-laced, Kosuke.
- What?

210
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,200
- I think it makes you so cool.
- What?

211
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,110
Please... use this if you want to.

212
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,970
- What is it?
- A bag for your shoes.

213
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,460
I worked hard making it, but don't use it if you don't want to.

214
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,880
Well, good luck with your game.

215
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,170
Matsuuchi, wait.

216
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,660
Kosuke, the game is about to start.

217
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,550
Is that you, Aoki? Why brings you here?

218
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:31,060
Oh, I heard a pretty manager would be here, so I came to check.

219
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,450
But Ida snatched her up now.

220
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,410
Good for you, Ida. Good luck!

221
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,710
Thank you.

222
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,240
We're no match for them.

223
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,200
Is something wrong, Kosuke?

224
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,790
Nothing, really.

225
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,540
Oh, there you are.

226
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,920
Matsuuchi.

227
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,800
- Were you looking for someone?
- What?

228
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,630
You look down. Is something troubling you?

229
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,650
Well...

230
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,490
Listen.

231
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,710
Listen, do you...

232
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,960
like me?

233
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,660
I don't have any experience to compare you to.

234
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,610
It's weird to date someone without knowing that.

235
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,790
Kosuke!

236
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,700
Yes?

237
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,640
You weren't even listening, were you?

238
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,340
I said I think you're a really great guy, Kosuke.

240
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,290
So...

241
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,300
do you want to go out with me?

242
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,970
Why?

243
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,350
Because...

244
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,540
- I like you.
- What?

245
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,280
Why?

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,320
- Weren't you listening?
- But you like someone else, don't you?

247
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,080
- What?
- Sorry.

248
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,700
I actually overheard your conversation earlier.

249
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,310
It's a bag to carry your shoes.

250
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,330
Teacher, please use it, if you like.

251
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,990
I appreciate it, but I can't accept this.

252
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,390
Isn't this important to you? I'm returning it to you.

253
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,040
Why didn't you say so before?

254
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,390
Aoki was there. I didn't think you would want him to know.

255
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,600
You're very considerate.

256
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,690
You're like Mr. Taniguchi in that regard.

257
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,010
- The first time I came here for a match,
- Are you all right?

258
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,420
- an out-of-bounds ball hit me.
- I'm okay.

259
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,520
Mr. Taniguchi was worried and stayed with me the whole time.

260
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,350
I started talking to him after that,

261
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,580
and even told him how I felt a few times,

262
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,690
but he always treated me like a child.

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,680
I decided to give up if he rejects me today.

264
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,910
You're so much like him, that's why I asked you out.

265
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,780
I'm really sorry. I didn't think it through.

266
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,360
I must look like an idiot, liking him so much.

267
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,180
You're not an idiot.

268
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,330
It's amazing that you like someone so dearly.

269
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,390
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

270
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,130
You're great.

271
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,680
I see.

272
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,710
Oh, there you are.

273
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,560
Mr. Taniguchi.

274
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,000
Everyone from Shiroyama High is looking for you. You guys are leaving soon.

275
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay.

276
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,360
Do you think he and I are similar?

277
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,410
I do.

278
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,230
- Let's both do our best.
- What are you talking about?

279
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,220
You also have someone you like, right?

280
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,740
Your mind was elsewhere when we were talking. It was obvious.

281
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,270
You can't help watching them or thinking about them, right?

282
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,710
Is that what it means to like someone?

283
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,780
That's right.

284
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,980
I see.

285
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,340
If you need my advice, talk to me anytime. See you around.

286
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,060
Bye.

287
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,870
I can see you.

288
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,060
Are you still upset?

289
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,160
I'm not upset.

290
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,810
I mean... I'm sorry for being a nuisance earlier.

291
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,720
I hope you'll be happy with Kokomi.

292
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,670
There is nothing going on between her and me.

293
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,000
Besides, Matsuuchi likes someone else.

294
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,860
What? For real?

295
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,040
Yes. You saw me giving her back the shoe bag, right?

296
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,860
I did, but what about you?

297
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,060
What?

298
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,320
You would be better off with a cute girl like her,

299
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,740
don't you think?

300
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,480
Try comparing her to me, as you mentioned earlier.

301
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,240
I understand now.

302
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,260
The feeling of love cannot be compared to one another.

303
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,670
What is that supposed to mean?

304
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,460
I started to understand

305
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,790
the feeling of liking someone.

306
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,350
I...

307
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,360
wonder if I like you, Aoki.

308
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,490
What?

309
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,700
Don't ask me.

310
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,660
I think it's amazing that you're so honest about your feelings.

311
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,830
Cut it out! Stop complimenting me all of a sudden.

312
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,390
Maybe it's too early to say we're dating,

313
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,500
but I hope that...

314
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,680
we will date one day.

315
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,200
♫ I didn't know she was setting ♫

316
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,170
I'm glad you told me your honest feelings.

317
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,710
♫ I want to know true feelings of hers and mine ♫

318
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,240
♫ The timeline I read repeatedly, my embarrassing hotline ♫

319
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,150
♫ Ah, what do I do if someone sees? ♫

320
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,980
I think

321
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,500
I would like it if, one day,

322
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,450
you asked me out for real.

323
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,530
I mean it.

324
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,980
Okay.

325
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,330
♫ I want us to fall in love. It wasn’t supposed to be this way ♫

326
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,010
You have a good fashion sense.

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,250
- You think?
- Yes.

328
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,080
Thanks.

329
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,190
Morning, Class President! Please take good care of our class today.
