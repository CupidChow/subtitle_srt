I'm curious to know. When high schoolers date, they want to hold hands and kiss.

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,330
- Wow!
- I won't do it again.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,490
There's no way I would think of you as gross.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,860
We are dating! What's wrong with that?

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,940
I didn't pick a random guy to date.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,170
I like Ida.

00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,570
Is the Illumination Festival spectacular?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,690
- Are you a 10th grader?
- Yes, Sir.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,240
The courtyard will be filled with lights. Look forward to it.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,330
- Wow, that sounds exciting.
- Yes, seriously.

13

At last, the Illumination Festival is coming up soon.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,100
Our class, Grade-11th Class-3,

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,000
would like to hold a Christmas party.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,920
- Yes!
- That sounds great.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,250
Drinks will be paid via admission fee, so please bring food for a potluck.

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,270
- Okay.
- All right.

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,240
By the way, it was me who suggested the party.

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,480
Hashimoto, are making sweets for Akkun?

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,510
- What?
- After all, the Illumination Festival is a chance for confession.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,610
Is it?

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,160
- You didn't know?
- You didn't know?

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,640
Legend says if you give your crush a cake during the Illumination Festival,

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,540
your love will be fulfilled.

26
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,020
Ida, you seriously have no interest in these things, do you?

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,330
Anyhow, why not confess again during the festival?

28
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,660
You two seem to be getting along well lately.

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,230
He might accept your love this time.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,700
I know, but I just got rejected not too long ago.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,970
What are you guys talking about?

32
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,020
Oh, we're just excited for the Christmas party.

33
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,120
Are you making sweets?

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,170
Y-Yes, with the home economics club.

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,670
I'm planning on handing out sweets at the party.

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,780
Hashimoto, this is your chance. Seize the opportunity.

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm debating what to make.

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,330
Oh? Only the cupcakes have an X mark on them.

39
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,300
Oh, I already made them to hand out

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,690
on last Valentine's Day.

41
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,110
They look delicious.

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,520
I'll make these again.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,590
Oh, nice!

44
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm glad you came to a decision.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,250
Yes.

46
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,740
I'll do my best.

47
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,500
Let me borrow that.

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,370
It's decided.

49
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,150
It looks like they'll do fine.

50
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,700
The homemade cake she gave me on Valentine's Day was really delicious.

51
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,780
Did she give you one?

52
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,870
D-Don't get the wrong idea. She didn't like me.

53
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,070
They were leftovers that were supposed to be for Akkun.

54

Rather, are you "jelly"?

55

What's "jelly"?

That's crazy.

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,360
So is he making a request?

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,060
Not at all!

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,320
He just suggested making cupcakes.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,120
That means he wants them.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,660
He even marked the page.

63
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,290
Aoki, did Aida say anything afterward?

64
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,550
Not really. We just talked about games.

That's it? Whatever.

66

Was I called here to be asked about the silly questions?

- Aoki.
- Let's have a little chat.

68
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,670
Am I... popular now?

At least, that's what I thought.

I hope he likes it.

Good luck, Hashimoto. It'll be a success this time for sure.

that, right?

If that's what you want,

- No, no.

- I strongly oppose to it.
- Why?

101
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,450
Because it would be bad if weird rumors spread around.

102
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,970
You're too cautious.

It's fun since we can talk leisurely.

that Ida and I are dating, and being together like this.

It'd be bad if people found out we were dating.

- Outside of school, you won't be so worried about others, right?

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,860
It got good reviews.

165
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,680
Whenever I saw the trailer, it reminds me of your Mametaro.

166
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,310
D-Don't misunderstand.

167
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,960
- It's not like I was always thinking of you.
- I get it.

168
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,150
Thanks.

169
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,510
I don't think you do understand.

170
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,420
Forget it.

171
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,690
Let's go.

172
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,080
Did he put a lot of thought into this?

173
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,870
Aoki's amazing.

174
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,260
What's wrong?

175
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,400
What are you staring at?

176
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,250
It's nothing.

177
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,390
By the way, is the movie a tear-jerker?

178
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,780
- What?
- It looks like the dog goes to heaven in the end.

179
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,900
No, I don't think so.

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,510
In conclusion,

181
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,280
Pochi went to heaven.

182
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,600
It was a good movie.

183
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,730
I'm sorry. All because I didn't search up the ending.

184
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,330
It's fine.

185
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll give Mametaro lots of love when I go home.

186
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,520
You should do so.

187
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,550
- Aoki, you're such a good guy.
- Excuse me?

188
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,560
You only met Mametaro once, yet you're so worried about him.

189
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,880
Anyone would worry after watching that!

190
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,050
Do you want to stop by my place?

191
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,800
What?

192
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,500
Seeing a lively Mametaro may lift your spirits too.

193
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,060
Ida... thank you.

194
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,370
Don't cry.

195
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,630
I can't help it.

196
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,390
[Ida]

197
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,000
Mametaro!

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,970
I'm so glad you're in good health!

199
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,350
I feel so relieved.

200
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,030
Make yourself at home.

201
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,910
My family won't be back for a while.

202
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,790
What?

203
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,870
Is no one home?

204
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,420
Is that okay for me to be here?

205
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,700
Sure. No need to be considerate.

206
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,210
B-But...

207
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,700
Do you feel uncomfortable being alone with me?

208
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,400
Like I said, don't ask me stuff like that.

209
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,060
I have no idea how to react.

210
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,960
Wait a second.

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,580
This is a huge opportunity.

212
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,390
Or maybe,

213
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,190
Ida was also after that, and invited me over?

214
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,580
Want to play some games?

215
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,380
Yes.

216
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,040
Let's do that.

217
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,370
Aoki is easy to read.

218
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,110
Sometimes watching him makes me feel shy.

219
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,510
Is this what happens,

220
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,960
when you like someone?

221
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,690
I lost again.

222
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,050
I was confident that I could play the game well.

223
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,130
Are you laughing? You seem awfully pleased.

224
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,770
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

225
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,170
Hey, trade controllers with me, and let's rematch.

226
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,230
- I do better with the red one.
- They're the same.

227
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,780
They're totally different! Come on, hand it over.

228
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,010
- Are you a child?
- Just hand it over—

229
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,710
Oh my, I'm sorry.

230
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,070
It's fine, it's only tea. I'll just change.

231
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,670
W-Wait!

232
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,840
You spooked me.

233
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,250
- What's the matter?
- It's not, "what's the matter,"

234
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,530
put your abs away! Don't strip in front of me.

235
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,850
Don't we change for P.E.?

236
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,600
Fine.

237
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,760
Hurry.

238
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,420
Are you done?

239
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,030
Not yet.

240
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,340
Are you not done yet?

241
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,800
Nope.

242
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,290
You're so slow.

243
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,810
You are done!

244
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't make fun of me.

245
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,420
Is it fun

246
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,990
to laugh at my reactions?

247
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,550
- That wasn't my intention.
- That's exactly it.

248
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,920
You didn't go easy on me when we played games.

249
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,850
You're totally calm, even when we're close and alone.

250
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,770
This is serious for me!

251
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,990
You're not serious about going out with me, are you?

252
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,740
That's why you tease me.

253
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,290
- My bad.
- At least deny it.

254
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,370
- I'm sorry.
- Get out.

255
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,050
I got it.

256
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,280
Wait, this is your house! I'm leaving!

257
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,260
- Wait up, Aoki!
- I want to be alone.

258
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,540
Thanks for having me.

259
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,350
Aoki is right.

260
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,380
If I was seriously in love, I wouldn't tease my partner like that.

261
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,620
Oh, here it comes.

262
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,210
Looking good.

263
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,500
Good, good.

264
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,800
I see. Your precious first date was ruined.

265
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,750
I wonder if we're actually dating.

266
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,820
He's treating you like a friend.

267
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,220
That's not true! Be confident, Aoki.

268
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,150
Treating me like a friend...

269
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,770
I guess you're right.

270
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,530
- Don't let it get to you.
- Don't listen to him.

271
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,280
Actually, Ida has never told me he likes me.

272
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
Has he not?

273
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,790
He doesn't even know if he likes me,

274
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,500
but he can't leave me alone, so we're dating.

275
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,130
Was Ida always such an irresponsible person?

276
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,250
That's not irresponsible. There are things you don't know till you date.

277
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,740
As I thought,

278
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,190
I knew Hashimoto would be dissatisfied with that.

279
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,450
Are you saying I'm uptight?

280
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,690
She's snapping at me.

281
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,190
I'll be heading home first.

282
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,860
Aoki, let's make a cake together.

283
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,880
What?

284
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,550
Try handing it to Ida, and confirm his feelings.

285
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,180
- Water is over here.
- Oh, that?

286
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,470
- I'll pour it in.
- Thanks.

287
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,190
Okay.

288
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,430
After all, I like Ida.

289
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,740
Please go out with me again.

290
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,590
Thanks, Aoki. I like you, too.

291
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,520
Has he lost his mind?

292
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,290
I bet he's having a blast making cake.

293
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,210
I'm going to cheer him up.

294
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,470
- He seems depressed.
- What should we do?

295
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,380
Kosuke.

296
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,470
If you're worried about something, I'll listen.

297
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,410
Come with me.

298
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,110
Where are they going?

299
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,080
Are you worried about Aoki?

300
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,670
What?

301
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,590
I kinda noticed you two were in a romantic relationship.

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,150
- Did you?
- Yes.

303
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,520
Kosuke, did you convey your feelings to Aoki?

304
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,160
Did you date him without knowing if you liked him?

305
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,510
Kosuke, I hope this isn't one of your "I can't neglect people" disease.

306
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,250
- "I can't neglect people" disease?
- Yes.

307
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,440
You have a soft spot for people in need.

308
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,470
It was the same reason when you picked up Mametaro and your previous dog.
[Adopt me]

309
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,090
- Please, we're short on members!
- Join the team!

310
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,490
- I've never played volleyball.
- No worries, we're all beginners.

311
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,500
- It was the same when you joined the volleyball club.
- Please, Ida!

312
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,470
All right, I'll join.

313
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,490
I did it of my own will. Besides, Mametaro and volleyball are both important parts of my life now.

314
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,490
You see, those are totally different from a relationship.

315
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,930
Since he likes you, it's disrespectful to date Aoki out of pity.

316
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
Pity...

317
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,130
It's not pity.

318
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,200
I have fun being with Aoki.

319
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,390
Is that the same as Aoki's feelings of affection?

320
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:04,100
Isn't your "fun," the same as hanging out with me and the volleyball team?

321
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,550
You should properly figure out your feelings.

322
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,390
If you date him half-heartedly,

323
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,190
it would only bring pain for the both of you.

324
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,350
- Chocolate.
- And this is store bought.

325
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,020
- Store bought?
- It's delicious, I promise.

326
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,660
- Try it.
- You sure?

327
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,690
- Oh, it's good.
- Good chocolate, right?

328
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,450
It's delicious as it is.

329
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,030
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's a good flavor.

330
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,980
Ida?

331
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,620
Ida...

332
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,040
What brings you here?

333
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,850
That's my question. What are you doing here?

334
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,120
Making a cake for the Christmas party.

335
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,630
They asked me to help.

336
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,930
I'm finally becoming popular.

337
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,600
Are you now?

338
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,700
Good... for you.

339
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,570
Aoki.

340
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,690
Well... good luck.

341
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,390
Sure. I'm having lots of fun here.

342
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm totally motivated.

343
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,660
So which flavor would it be?

344
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,280
- Chocolate, right?
- No, blueberry.

345
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,690
I'd have to choose chocolate.

346
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,830
♫ I'm happy and want to cry ♫

347
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,760
♫ The flowers that bloomed are still small, Strawberry ♫

348
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,170
♫ I just wanted to love you ♫

349
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,670
Ida, do you have a minute?

350
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:04,960
You know, we went to Yokohama on Sunday and saw you holding hands

351
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,490
with Aoki. Ida, are you...

352
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,000
dating Aoki?

353
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,240
[This is a work of fiction]

354
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,190
[Next Episode]
There's something I need to tell you, Aoki.
[Their loving hearts wavered, by decisions made]

355
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,680
I've decided not to interact with Ida anymore.

356
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,600
Is that really how you want it to end it?
[A Christmas of feelings, that miss one another]

357
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
I'm sorry
[A first love, which began from a misunderstanding, heads... ]

358
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,610
for taking too long.

359
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,920
Who cares? We don't need to be with them.
