[Previously on My Love Mix-Up!]
I hope you're perplexed as much as I have.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,960
Does that mean you've been thinking of me the whole time as well?

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,620
Aoki liking you was just a misunderstanding.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,650
- That's not true, I...
- Look, it's fine.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,990
I'm relieved about this, too.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,710
Now that I can't take back my words, I've finally realized.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,280
My feelings for you... were real.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm so glad that the misunderstanding was resolved.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,640
He's a real bonehead, but please continue to be friends with him.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,890
You're really touchy-feely.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,150
That's right.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,940
Aoki?

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,930
Oh, my bad. Sorry for causing you trouble.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,550
What's the matter?

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,070
Well, you were spacing out for some reason.

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,600
I wasn't. I just feel at ease.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,490
It freaked me out when you took me seriously.

18
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,910
You're the cause of the trouble. Show your remorse.

19
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,170
- Wait, ouch!
- Let's go!

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,180
- Don't hurt him.
- Stop it. I'm going to die.

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,520
- Cut it out.
- Do you bear a grudge against me?

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,460
And that was how my fleeting love came to an end.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,420
The end.

24
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,000
No, you can't end it like that.

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,900
It was my own fault,

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,890
because I wasn't honest with my feelings,

27
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,250
and I lied to him.

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,060
I'm a piece of trash.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,010
I just want to disappear.

30
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,080
Don't say that.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,950
You kept your promise to me by not telling anyone about the eraser.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,640
That's right.

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,310
It'll be our little secret, okay?

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,040
That's why...

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,910
That's why I was punished.

36
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,730
I had you, yet I started to have feelings for Ida.

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,880
What? Aoki, did you like me?

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,190
- I'm sorry!
- What a quick rejection.

39
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm really sorry, Aoki.

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,070
No, it's fine.

41
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,300
I know you like someone else.

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,340
It doesn't surprise or hurt me.

43
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,000
That must be the proof of you seriously liking Ida.

44
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,890
Well, I guess you can say that.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,790
But it's over now.

46
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,680
I don't want to bother Ida anymore. The misunderstanding was cleared up.

47
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,330
It wasn't cleared up.

48
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,190
I mean, your feelings for him were real, right?

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,640
You shouldn't lie to yourself.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Thanks.

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,170
But Ida was relieved to learn that it was a misunderstanding.

52
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,360
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,010
I can't tell him... how I really feel about him.

55
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,690
Aoki...

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,560
Where are you going?

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,700
- I'm going to seclude myself on a mountain.
- A mountain?

58
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,880
Hashimoto, be happy for both of us.

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Wait, Aoki!

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,050
You can't entrust me with that, Aoki!

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Sorry! Are you okay?

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,930
- Why were you in such a hurry?
- Well...

63
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,800
A big problem. Aoki is going to seclude himself on a mountain.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,210
What? That's so eccentric of him.

65
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,440
What do we do? He's gone.

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,410
Don't worry about him. It's probably nothing serious.

67
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,690
It is serious.

68
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,340
Aoki was really depressed.

69
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,590
Is that because of Ida?

70
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,090
Yes.

71
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,090
Is he still sulking about that? What a pain.

72
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,640
He should've told him the truth right away.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,240
But it's hard to tell the truth sometimes.

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,670
Is it?

75
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,470
Considering the mood, or how the other person reacts,

76
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,980
there are lots of things you have to consider.

77
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,990
I suppose... there are things that are hard to say,

78
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,720
but being so worried about the other person's reaction that you can't say it, is just an excuse.

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,920
You're afraid of getting hurt.

80
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,510
He shouldn't have deceived him in the first place. He deserves the punishment.

81
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,000
He should reflect on his action.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,190
By the way, don't you think you're being too soft on him?

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,430
What? What was that for?

84
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,230
Not everyone is as strong as you are.

85
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,170
There are things people can't say. And...

86
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:41,260
I used to respect that about you, but now... I hate it!

87
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,030
Why is she so upset about me?

88
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:56,640
[My Love Mix-Up!]
[Episode 4]

89
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,160
Mama, what's that guy doing?

90
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,740
You shouldn't point a finger.

91
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,080
I had a feeling this was your mountain retreat.

92
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,030
Akkun?

93
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,380
Hey, Mr. Hermit.

94
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,630
Why are you here?

95
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,820
Hashimoto slapped me because of you, so I came to complain.

96
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,010
Did she slap you?

97
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,710
She smacked me when I dissed you for waffling the Ida thing.

98
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,140
That's when the Great Detective Akkun had a bright idea.

99
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,960
What do you mean, the Great Detective Akkun?

100
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,730
According to my amazing assumption, her criminal motive was...

101
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:51,130
Hashimoto likes you, so she snapped when I criticized you.

102
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,490
Don't ever say that to Hashimoto. You're way off the mark.

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,160
- But according to my assumption—
- Whatever, that's enough.

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,760
Your assumption is wrong, anyway.

105
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,160
I don't care about liking someone, and whatnot.

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,750
- I've made up my mind.
- Aoki?

107
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,360
I should get rid of my feelings for Ida.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,860
I'm returning your midterm test.
[Grade-11 Class-3]

109
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,120
If I do that, I won't get hurt anymore.

110
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,880
Aoki?

111
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm sick and tired of love.

112
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
Good job.

113
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,380
Is this for real?

114
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,530
Ida! Ida! Look at this!

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,740
It's all thanks to the study group.

116
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,290
What are you laughing at?

117
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,870
Because you seem so happy.

118
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,550
Great job. You did well.

119
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,040
No! Why am I mesmerized by him?

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,370
Why did I even start the conversation? I'm an idiot!

121
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,640
Ida is treating me as a friend.

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,960
I decided to let go of my feelings for him, didn't I?

123
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,370
I want to forget, but...

124
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,900
it's hard when he's right in front of me.

125
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:28,790
Here's the new seating chart. I picked it randomly as always, so take a look.

126
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,700
What? Sir, my seat didn't change at all.

127
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,790
What are the odds? You're rather lucky.

128
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,700
- Hiro.
- Don't go, Rumi.

129
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,970
- Stop playing and just sit down.
- I don't want to be apart from you, Hiro.

130
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,210
Aoki?

131
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,340
Come on, get moving. Your seat is over there.

132
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,020
Oh, okay.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,160
Now we're totally separated.

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,780
I guess my wish came true.

135
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,370
Now I can go back to my uneventful life.

136
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,800
Aoki, we're neighbors again.

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,160
Aoki?

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,200
What's that for?

139
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,800
Don't you think you're staring too much at Ida?

140
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,930
What? I wasn't looking at him! Stop being weird.

141
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,620
Hey.

142
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,480
Tell me why you slapped me.

143
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,570
I'm not going to apologize.

144
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,310
I don't need your apology. Just tell me the reason.

145
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,540
Does he...

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,710
like Ida for real?

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,520
Seriously?

148
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,890
I can't believe it.

149
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,120
Don't be rude. It's the truth.

150
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,070
- My method of studying?
- Yes.

151
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,300
You only scored six points on the practice test,

152
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,960
but it jumped up to ninety-two on the midterm.

153
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,010
So I was wondering how did you do it.

154
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,040
Are you... suspecting me?

155
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,810
- Of what?
- Well...

156
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,010
- I know other classes had a cheating incidence.
- No, no.

157
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:07,130
That's not it. I simply want to know your miraculous study tips to go from 6 to 92.

158
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,650
I didn't cheat.

159
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,450
I know that, just calm down.

160
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,180
But you think I did, don't you?

161
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,740
- Now you're acting a little suspicious.
- I did not cheat.

162
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,950
Aoki didn't cheat.

163
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,200
We studied together.

164
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,370
Besides, Aoki isn't someone who would do that.

165
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,380
Ida, why...?

166
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm here to give the club journal to Mr. Taniguchi.

167
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,440
I see.

168
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,260
That makes sense. So Ida tutored you.

169
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,170
Well, yes.

170
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,130
Ida, thank you. I know teaching students is my job.

171
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,990
No, it's fine.

172
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,560
But it'd be a huge help if you two kept studying together.

173
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,350
Thank you.

174
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,130
I'm glad you didn't get in trouble.

175
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:05,550
Yes, but it wasn't Mr. Tachiguchi's fault. I just misunderstood him.

176
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,580
You're always getting into trouble.

177
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,160
Don't say that so seriously!

178
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,960
You knocked over the bucket at the culture festival.

179
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,110
Next thing I know, you're playing the role of Cinderella.

180
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,770
If you find me annoying, just leave me be.

181
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,980
Even if you say so...

182
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,690
Don't look at my face and sigh.

183
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, I'm going to my volleyball practice now.

184
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,780
Wait, Ida.

185
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,880
You see... thanks about earlier.

186
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,390
You're very welcome.

187
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,760
Ida...

188
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,360
It's too late now.

189
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,590
I have no choice but to give up,

190
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,380
for Ida's sake.

191
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,980
♫ Two perplexed silhouettes ♫

192
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,790
♫ Feel uneasy in the sunlight filtering through trees ♫

193
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,750
♫ When I think only the two of us are in the world, ♫

194
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,200
♫ Why does it make me feel uneasy? ♫

195
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,500
Before I knew it, I liked the person. I have no real reasons.

196
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,680
Look, I'm not asking for an apology. I'm fine, really.

197
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,330
Since you stood up for me.

198
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,400
I thought I was the only one spinning my wheels about this.

199
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,370
I hope you'll be perplexed as much as I have.

200
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,670
Ida! Ida! Look at this!

201
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,580
This is all thanks to the study group.

202
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,620
Here I go!

203
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,070
What's wrong, Kosuke?

204
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,640
Sorry.

205
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,290
Are you still pretending to be a detective?

206
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,350
Let's go home, Akkun.

207
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,190
- I solved the mystery.
- Yes, whatever.

208
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,300
Aoki, you really do like Ida, don't you?

209
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,810
He finally got something right.

210
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,530
That reaction tells me I'm correct.

211
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,960
About what?

212
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,390
I don't know what you mean.

213
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,530
I almost got slapped by Hashimoto again.

214
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,770
It's true, all right. How rude of you!

215
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,340
Wait! I didn't mean it like that.

216
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,400
But if that's true,

217
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,930
I've said a bunch of terrible things to Aoki.

218
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,770
I'm a failure as his friend.

219
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,490
Aida.

220
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,780
That must be why he never tells me anything.

221
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,380
That's not it.

222
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,790
I bet he didn't tell you because you're an important friend to him.

223
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,620
Indeed! In other words,

224
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,780
the culprit that made you unable to tell your truth

225
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,930
is me.

226
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,120
Aoki, I'm sorry.

227
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,580
A great detective doesn't turn himself in.

228
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,300
Come on! I'm seriously apologizing here.

229
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,120
This is the first time I've seen you look so down.

230
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,190
It's fine! I think your reaction was normal.

231
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,430
Normal?

232
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,830
Commonly, people would think it's weird, right?

233
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,080
That I feel that way about Ida.

234
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,710
Then... the normality is wrong.

235
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,760
Get angry. You can hit me.

236
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,740
But on this side, because I got slapped on the other side.

237
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,980
I'm not going to hit you. I'm not mad.

238
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,650
I'm happy.

239
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,530
I never knew that you felt that way.

240
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,660
It doesn't matter who you like.

241
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,830
You'll always be Aoki, right?

242
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,370
I'm starving! Let's get something from the convenience store on the way home.

243
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,730
Sure.

244
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,440
- There you go.
- What? I don't want it.

245
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,300
I assumed of my own accord,

246
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,200
that he'd hate me if he ever finds out.

247
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,920
I should've known he's not that kind of guy.

248
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,150
It's too embarrassing to tell him in person,

249
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,420
but I'm really glad I'm friends with Akkun.

250
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,320
By the way... what happened with Hashimoto after that?

251
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,680
We totally reconciled.

252
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,370
Sorry!

253
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm sorry for slapping you.

254
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,760
You didn't do anything wrong.

255
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,160
No, I was wrong. I totally deserved the slap.

256
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,110
Aida...

257
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,030
Hashimoto...

258
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,930
Yes?

259
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,580
I...

260
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,990
am going to apologize to Aoki.

261
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,230
Thanks for slapping me. It made me see the light. See you!

262
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,470
That's how it happened.

263
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,390
You probably gave everyone around you the wrong impression.

264
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,450
You know, Hashimoto is unexpectedly cool.

265
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,440
She had the strength of a gorilla when she slapped me.

266
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,980
I wonder what she eats to get that strong.

267
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,680
Akkun,

268
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,500
never say that to her.

269
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,700
It's a compliment.

270
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,330
No, it's definitely not.

271
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,620
Kosuke?

272
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,380
Did something happen?

273
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,230
Well...

274
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,410
What is it? Tell us.

275
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,530
Someone confessed to me recently.

276
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,370
What?! Confessed?

277
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,480
- I was seriously considering how to respond, but...
- Yes?

278
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,740
I guess it was my misunderstanding.

279
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,320
Now that I think about it, I don't think they ever told me they liked me.

280
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,840
That's terrifying!

281
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,570
How could you misunderstand something like that?

282
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,360
Can't you tell if someone likes you by how they act?

283
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,700
I couldn't tell at all.

284
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,220
But you liked the person, right, Kosuke?

285
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,480
That's how falling in love with someone.

286
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,750
You've known this guy your whole life, Toyoda. Knock some sense into him.

287
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,590
Kosuke has always been thickheaded to romance.

288
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,790
I may be thickheaded, but...

289
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,260
What does it mean to like someone?

290
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,190
I don't quite understand it even at my age, so I wanted to find out.

291
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,510
I never thought the day would finally come for Kosuke to brood over love.

292
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,920
Look at how much you've grown.

293
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,700
Just forget about it.

294
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,050
A lost love is like a tossed volleyball... you should strike it down.

295
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,820
- Captain.
- Ida!

296
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,060
You can always come to me for advice.

297
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,890
All right, let's go clean up.

298
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,760
He's always so full of confidence despite having zero dating experience.

299
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,420
That's because he reads so many "light novels".
(T/N: Short novels)

300
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,930
Anyway, now that you're sure of your feelings,

301
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,290
- let's go tell Ida you really like him.
- What?

302
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,390
If things remain unsettled, you'll keep being gloomy.

303
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,650
Forget it. I've already decided to give up.

304
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,070
He said he was glad it was a misunderstanding, anyway.

305
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,160
Come on, lighten up.

306
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,540
I feel so guilty when I see you so depressed.

307
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,100
Besides, you've got the world's most encouraging ally with you.

308
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,680
It'll definitely go well this time.

309
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,590
I don't want you meddling with it anymore.

310
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,690
I've just thought of a great idea.

311
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,890
The perfect chance is coming up for you to confess your love to him.

312
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,900
What perfect chance?

313
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,440
The school's camping trip.

314
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,880
Camping trip?

315
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,400
Camping trip is a magical trip where love will bloom.

316
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,060
The refreshing great outdoors will soften his heart and your feelings will flow into him.

317
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,830
Anyone would instinctively answer, "Yes!"

318
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,620
Really?

319
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,810
With the help of the air's negative ions and the God of the Mountains,

320
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,080
you'll start dating Ida for sure.

321
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,690
I told you, it's impossible.

322
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,490
Are you really okay with giving up?

323
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,650
If you act quickly, you might be able to start over with him.

324
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,450
Try telling him how you really feel.

325
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,910
Whatever his answer may be,

326
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm sure Ida will give serious thought to it

327
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,160
before he gives you the answer.

328
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,860
♫ Two umbrellas form the shape of a heart
when walking side-by-side ♫

329
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,690
♫ I can't believe it. A miracle was waiting for me ♫

330
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,980
You're right. He is that type of person.

331
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,480
♫ I want us to fall in love. It wasn’t supposed to be this way ♫

332
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,530
♫ It disheartens me but it also excites my innocent heart ♫

333
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,970
♫ Just like a magnet, we stick together and then
we separate, oh my god, oh my god ♫

334
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,330
♫ Love isn’t easy ♫

335
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,390
♫ I’m smitten with you. You’re my sunshine ♫

336
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,090
Dear god of the Mountains,

337
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,420
please lend me your strength.

338
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,590
♫ Let us be Romeo and Juliette that never give up ♫

339
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,710

I'm going to confess my love to Ida.
[He finally made up his mind to confess!?]

343
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,600
