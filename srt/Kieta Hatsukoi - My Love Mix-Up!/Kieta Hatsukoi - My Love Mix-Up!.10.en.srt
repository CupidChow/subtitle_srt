[Previously on My Love Mix-Up!]
The legend says, if you give your crush a cake during the Illumination Festival,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,460
your love will be fulfilled.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,540
Don't make fun of me!

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,060
You're not serious about dating me, are you?

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,280
Aoki, let's make a cake together.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,450
Then hand it to Ida, and confirm his feelings.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,940
[0 Days until the Illumination Festival]

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,400
- It's so good!
- It's so good!

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,510
It's not too sweet, so Akkun will love it for sure.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,000
Ida will definitely enjoy it, too.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,590
- Oh, I'm so nervous.
- Oh, I'm so nervous.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,510
Aoki?

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,030
Can we talk?

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,020
Sure.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,450
There's something I have to tell you.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,000
I know you said not to tell anyone, but

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,670
I told the guys from the volleyball club we're dating.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,730
What?

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,980
They saw us together at Yokohama.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,710
Ida, are you dating Aoki?

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,210
I should have told you guys.

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,920
Aoki and I are dating now.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,750
Why did you tell them?

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,060
Like I said, they saw us together at Yokohama.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,350
You should've just bluffed them out with some excuse.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,430
Don't be so upset.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,020
It's not something we should hide.

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,020
Yes, it is.

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,540
Does this mean you're

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,750
embarrassed to date me?

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,470
That's not what I meant.

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,620
Then what do you mean?

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,340
You don't understand anything!

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,650
No, I don't understand.

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,870
Not a thing.

36
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,650
Let's break up.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,950
What?

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,130
Although we weren't even seriously dating in the first place.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,510
Anyway, it's over between us.

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,120
Bye.

41
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,490
You're such a big help.

42
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,120
That's so sweet of you to say.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,270
Thanks!

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,150
- What should we decorate next?
- I wonder...

45
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,020
This one? Shall we?

46
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,510
- All right, this one!
- That one?

47
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,280
Where does Santa go? Here?

48
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,930
Are you not attending the Christmas party?

49
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,290
I have a practice match.

50
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,850
Come back when you're done.

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm sure we'll still be celebrating the Illumination Festival.

52
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,910
"It'll make Aoki happy, too!"

53
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,320
His height really came in handy.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,000
- Thanks for your help.
- Yes, you're so helpful.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,890
I'm happy to help. Thanks, guys.

56
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,780
Let's get hyped to win.

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,130
I can't wait.

58
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,640
Let's go.

59
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,440
What's wrong, Ida?

60
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,460
Let's get going.

61
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,400
I have to talk to you guys.

62
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,990
I said I was dating Aoki before,

63
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,280
but that was just a joke.

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,770
So could you not bother Aoki about it?

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,710
Really? Okay.

66
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,420
So it was a joke?

67
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,960
You took us by surprise.

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,490
Ida, you'll be getting the balls today.

69
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,110
So get your head in the game.

70
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,540
All right, let's go.

71
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,650
- Let's go!
- Let's win!

72
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,970
That's right!

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,320
That was the first time I've seen you lie, Kosuke.

74
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,910
Merry Christmas!

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,050
Hashimoto?

76
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,990
What about the cupcake?

77
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,690
It's in Aida's desk.

78
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,360
Are you not going to give it to him in person?

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,610
I can't do that.

80
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm scared of getting rejected again.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,410
Cheers!

82
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,040
- I should just give up.
- Hold on a second.

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,210
You went through the trouble of making them.

84
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,450
- Wow!
- It looks delicious.

85
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,700
- Nonomura, you're amazing.
- I made a bunch, so eat them up!

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,910
I want one, too.

87
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,360
Do you want one, Aida?

88
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,870
Here.

89
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,610
Well... I'll pass.

90
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,880
I don't eat homemade food.

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,200
He doesn't eat

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
homemade food?

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
But thanks for the offer.

94
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,860
Are you a germaphobe or something?

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,010
- Then I will–
- In that case, Nonomura...

96
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,960
I'll take another.

97
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,030
So good! I could eat a bucket full.

98
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,860
Kariya...

99
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,970
Woo-hoo, the legend has it.

100
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,280
Everyone, look this way!

101
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,170
I'm so glad the class

102
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,120
has united as one.

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,220
What the heck?

104
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,500
Hashimoto?

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,000
He didn't ask me to make it after all.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,260
There wasn't any deep meaning to it.

107
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,430
But...

108
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,390
But...

109
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,630
What?

110
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,380
Hashimoto, your grip strength is nuts.

111
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,660
But if you don't like homemade stuff,

112
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,200
you should've said so to begin with.

113
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,770
Hashimoto?

114
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,970
Are you mad because I didn't notice this?

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,110
No.

116
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,150
I'm not mad at you, Aida.

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,660
I'm upset with myself because I'm embarrassed.

118
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,350
I got myself all worked up.

119
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,890
I wanted to make you happy, although you didn't ask me to.

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,920
If I knew you didn't like homemade stuff,

121
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,180
I wouldn't have...

122
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,510
That's why you're upset.

123
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,900
Oh, right.

124
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,800
- I'll go buy something now.
- Don't!

125
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,030
I didn't ask you to make them for me,

126
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,280
but somehow I knew you would.

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,610
You would probably end up giving it to me.

128
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,910
What?

129
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,320
You were so excited about it.

130
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,780
That's why I turned down the vice president's cake.

131
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,500
You should've guessed it.

132
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,160
I didn't want anyone else's but yours.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,460
Can I eat it now?

134
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,030
Yes.

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,080
So good. It's scrumptious!

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,350
The illuminations are about to begin.

137
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,380
Come guys, let's go.

138
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,930
Let's go look.

139
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,570
The illuminations will begin in five seconds.

140
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,220
Four.

141
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,630
Three.

142
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,190
Two.

143
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,620
One.

144
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,040
Zero.

145
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,110
Illuminate!

146
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,090
Would you like to look around the lights with me?

147
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,700
I would love to.

148
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,990
They're so pretty!

149
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,470
My goodness.

150
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,870
Fascinating.

151
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,790
Sorry, Ida.

152
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,920
We couldn't get the ball to you at all.

153
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,770
We haven't practiced the basics enough.

154
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,010
Hey...

155
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,870
why were you trying to get the ball to me so badly?

156
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,800
To respect Aoki's wish.

157
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,150
Actually, before we went to the match today...

158
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,730
That would be difficult.

159
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,640
Aoki?

160
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,040
Wow!

161
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,410
If you're looking for Ida, he isn't here.

162
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,220
Listen.

163
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,340
It's about that...

164
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,650
who else knows?

165
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,310
Just the four of us.

166
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,350
Please...

167
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,790
don't tell anyone else that Ida and I dated.

168
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,020
I mean...

169
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,360
it was me who forcibly invited him on the outing,

170
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,050
we weren't dating or anything at all.

171
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,690
He was merely being nice, that's all.

172
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,760
I know you saw us holdings hands in Yokohama,

173
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,700
but I forced him into that.

174
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,940
And I was just being a nuisance to him.

175
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,460
I've decided...

176
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,160
not to interact with Ida anymore.

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,260
So I hope you'll keep on being Ida's good friends,

178
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,990
just like you've always been.

179
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm begging you.

180
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,130
Please.

181
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,640
Aoki, raise your head.

182
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,710
When we heard you guys were dating,

183
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,730
we were going to celebrate it.

184
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,480
I tried telling them we should leave you guys alone.

185
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,770
We were not going to make fun of you or Ida.

186
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,910
We won't tell anyone, so you can relax.

187
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,330
I'm so relived.

188
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,030
- Were you that worried?
- I was.

189
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,350
I was worried that you guys would ostracize him during the game,

190
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,130
and force him to pay an absurdly high club fee,

191
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,100
which means he has to work every single day.

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,790
He has his graduation match, but he has to work.

193
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,000
So he would become a delinquent and drop out of school.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,200
Aoki, even your imagination is negative.

195
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,540
Anyway... knowing that Ida has good friends like you guys,

196
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,070
make me feel happy.

197
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,910
Thank you, guys.

198
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,080
To respect Aoki's passionate feelings toward you,

199
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,410
we decided to pass you the ball a lot today.

200
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
They're so pretty!

201
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,300
I made some cake too, so help yourself.

202
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,810
Really? Cake?

203
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,430
- Amazing!
- Let's go! Hurry!

204
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,920
There you go.

205
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,030
Thank you.

206
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,890
Thanks, Aoki!

207
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,320
Happy Merry Christmas.

208
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,810
Likewise.

209
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,710
Thank you.

210
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,530
Bye bye.

211
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,820
So you lied for Aoki's sake.

212
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,500
Aoki desperately came to seek our help for your sake.

213
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,610
Kosuke,

214
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,410
are you really okay to end it like this?

215
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,620
My goodness, losing games always end so quickly.

216
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,690
Mr. Taniguchi.

217
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,580
Excuse me. I have to go now.

218
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,900
Since when have you two started dating?

219
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,650
About five minutes ago.

220
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,260
Aoki, your cake was so good.

221
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,250
- Good to hear.
- Thanks.

222
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,350
Aoki!

223
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,330
Hashimoto.

224
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,010
Did it go well with Akkun?

225
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,640
Yes.

226
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,040
Aida said,

227
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,010
he didn't eat the cake because he only wanted mine.

228
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,200
I see.

229
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,060
I'm so glad!

230
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,950
It's all thanks to you, Aoki.

231
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,820
Thank you so much.

232
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,350
Hashimottsan!

233
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,960
Let's go over there.

234
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,220
Hashimottsan? Why did you call me that?

235
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,100
You don't like it, Hashimottsan?

236
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,450
It sounds like a sumo wrestler.

237
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,560
With your strong slap, it's perfect.

238
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,740
I absolutely hate it.

239
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,390
So you won't come with me?

240
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll go with you.

241
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,930
Let's go.

242
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,650
I guess...

243
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,470
that's how things are supposed to be.

244
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,680
♫ While I feel my heart ♫

245
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,550

247
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,980
What?

248
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,630
You got the wrong idea. This isn't mine.

249
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,670
I've come to really like you!

250
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,750
Should we... try going out?

251
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,010
♫ Two perplexed silhouettes ♫

252
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,290
I'm glad you told me

253
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,940
how you really feel.

254

♫ When I think only the two of us are in the world, ♫

255

♫ Why does it make me feel uneasy? ♫

256

259
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,730

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,820
♫ While I feel my frustration ♫

261
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,720

Merry Christmas.

266
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,260
It was fun being able to date you.

267
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,300
Thank you.

268
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,050
Why...?

269
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,870
Ida?

270
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,320
Aoki?

271
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,990
Why are you here?

272
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,490
Well...

273
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,940
I was cleaning up the home economics room.

274
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,430
What about you? Why are you here?

275
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,410
I sent you a text, but you didn't even read it.

276
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,370
Well...

277
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,110
I said everything in the text.

278
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,580
Bye.

279
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,100

284
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,650
I was wrong.

286
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,560
What's gotten into you?

287
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,620
I heard everything from my teammates.

288
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,250
You were sinerely worried about me,

289
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,780
but I didn't realize it.

290
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,420
I'm really sorry.

291
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,030
I'm sorry, too.

292
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,020
I suggested you to lie. I couldn't be open about us.

293
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,100
That's because you were worried about me.

294
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,900
It wasn't just for your sake.

295
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,680
I was scared.

296
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,890
Scared of other people finding out.

297
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,510
You are truly amazing, Aoki.

298
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,340
You understand and are honest with your own feelings.

299
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,770
That's nothing special. I should know my own feelings.

300
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,530
What a weirdo.

301
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,320
I finally figured out my own feelings, as well.

302
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,840
I... really love you, Aoki.

303
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,800
Wh-Why? Are you kidding me?

304
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,580
I'm not.

305
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,150
But you've always teased me and made fun of me.

306
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,050
I didn't make fun of you.

307
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,410
I just wanted to see your reactions.

308
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,370
You're...

309
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,240
cute when you were being shy and freaking out.

310
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,650
Whenever I see you acting cute like that,

311
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,440
you make my heart skip a beat.

312
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,980
I can't see you as a mere friend.

313
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,420
You made your point. That's enough.

314
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,570
I need a time-out.

315
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,720
To put it simply... I love you.

316
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,140
I'm sorry... for taking me so long.

317
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,220
It's fine since now I know you took your time to think about it.

318
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,840
Aoki,

319
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,230
will you date me again?

320
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,450
Well...

321
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,660
if you insist, it's fine with me.

322
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,130
This means our love is mutual, doesn't it?

323
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,180
Do you have to spell everything out? Take a hint.

324
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,170
I'm glad.

325
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,420
♫ I want us to fall in love. It wasn't supposed to be this way ♫

I don't have any cake left for you, though.

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,340
- And it's already half-eaten.
- Here.

336
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,210
What are you doing?

337
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,850
That's a huge piece.

338
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,080
♫ Ah, what do I do if someone sees? ♫

339
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,940
People usually prepare a cake,

340
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,040
something special for Christmas.

341
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,500
That's all right. We don't have to be like everyone else.

342
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,680
That's true.

343
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,480
♫ Two umbrellas form the shape of a heart
when walking side-by-side ♫

344
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,090
♫ I can't believe it. A miracle was waiting for me ♫

345
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,290
♫ I want us to fall in love ♫

346
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,280
♫ It wasn't supposed to be this way ♫

347
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,270
♫ It disheartens me but it also excites my innocent heart ♫

348
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,850
♫ Just like a magnet, we stick together ♫

349
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,360
♫ Then we separate. Oh my god, oh my god ♫

350
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,520
I've randomly picked your new seating chart again.

351
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,640
Please take a look.

352
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,580
Sir, I am sitting in the same seat again.

353
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,860
Amazing. We're sitting so close.

354
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,210
Mr. Tanugichi must've planned this.

355
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,020
We'll be taking a quiz. Please clear your desks.

356
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,600
Akkun. Akkun, lend me your eraser.

357
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,930
Heck no.

358
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,080
Did you forget it again?

359
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,230
Aoki, use mine.

360
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,490
Oh!

361
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,750
Thank you.

362
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,800
Here.

363
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,230
[A...]

364
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,270
[Aoki ♡ ]

365
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,520
Is this for real?

366
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,210
You...

367
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,690
Do you not like it?

368
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,340
I didn't say that.

369
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,990
Did you know only people with unrequited love do this?

370
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,590
Really?

371
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,960
I'll get rid of it then.

372
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,640
Well, I think... you should keep it as it is.

373
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:15,760
[My Love MIX-UP!]
