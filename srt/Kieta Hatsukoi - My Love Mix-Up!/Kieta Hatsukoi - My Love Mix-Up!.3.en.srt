[Previously on My Love Mix-Up!]
"Ida♡"? What does that mean?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,500
It isn't mine.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,050
What sort of feeling is this?

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,040
Are you okay?

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,100
I also may have...

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,470
fallen in love

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,630
with him.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,420
What?

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,690
Say what?

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,330
Did you really?

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,070
I'm really sorry.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,990
I didn't mean to deceive you.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,850
I realized it just recently.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I'm pretty confused myself, but...

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,180
Tell me...

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,280
Do you think I'm weird?

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,410
You're not weird.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,360
It's not weird at all. I totally get it.

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,570
I started liking him because he was kind to me.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,850
When he helped us fix the background pieces, I fell in love all over again.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,870
I know, right? He was so charming, right?

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,250
He put me at ease when I was having a hard time.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,270
I know exactly what you mean.

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,680
The way he's so casual about it makes my heart flutter.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,640
Exactly.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,720
Wait... what am I saying?

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,830
I know exactly how you feel,

28
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,640
because I feel the same way about him.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,230
It's not weird at all.

30
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,570
Hashimoto...

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,220
This means we're rivals now.

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,080
Indeed, we are.

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,980
I have mixed emotions about this, but we have no choice.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,960
No, we don't.

35
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,490
- Because he's so cool.
- Because he's so cool.

36
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,940
- Ida is.
- Aida is.

37
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,730
What? Wh-Wha... Hold on!

38
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,100
Hashimoto, what did you just say?

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,640
I said, he's so cool.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,650
Who is? Who are you talking about?

41
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,540
Why are you asking now? You know who it is.

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,940
Wait a second. I'm so confused right now.

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,260
The one you like is...

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,230
Ida, right?

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,020
You're trying to make me say it out loud, aren't you?

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,740
The guy I like isn't Ida,

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,720
but Aida.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,990
Aida?

49
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,070
Aida...

50
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,940
What?

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,420
The guy Hashimoto likes

52
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,230
isn't Ida, but Akkun?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,330
But you wrote "Ida♡" on your eraser, didn't you?

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,410
- My eraser?
- The one you lent me.

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,730
Oh, it does say that.

56
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,110
I used up the "A" part.

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,110
The "A" was worn away.

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,970
Were we not talking about the same person?

59
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,720
Then the guy you like

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,020
is Ida?

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,990
Well, I'm not totally sure myself, but...

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,850
I think so.

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,320
I see. Thank goodness.

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,150
That means we're not rivals after all.

65
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,660
I can cheer you on whole-heartedly now, Aoki.

66
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,350
But nothing will happen between him and me.

67
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,180
I mean, Ida and I being together would be weird, right?

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,050
There's nothing weird about liking someone.

69
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,210
You have to treasure that feeling.

70
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,380
So let's both give it our all, Aoki!

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,060
Okay.

72
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:27,100
[My Love Mix-Up!]
[Episode 3]

73
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,880
Make sure to review your weakest subjects before midterms.

74
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,670
- Nakabayashi?
- Yes.

75
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,240
You did very well.

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,030
- Thank you.
- Nonomura?

77
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,850
It's my first time getting a single-digit score.

78
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,630
But I couldn't help it!

79
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,250
I've had a lot going on, I wasn't able to focus on my studies.

80
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,540
Ida really does make my heart flutter.

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,540
Hold on now. I dragged him into this because of my misunderstanding.

82
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,730
Sorry, Ida! He probably wasn't able to focus on the test, either.

83
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,230
- What's wrong with you?
- What upset you so suddenly?

84
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,780
Don't be jealous. You should be ashamed, Mr. Six Points.

85
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,270
But... But...

86
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:34,150
If you score like that on midterms, you'll get held back.

87
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,370
Hey, Ida. You should tutor him.

88
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,980
- What are you saying?
- Why not? There are no club activities until after the tests.

89
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,300
I want him to tutor me, too.

90
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,950
Fine with me, but I'm only good at math and science.

91
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,820
Then why don't we start with math?

92
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,440
- No, I hate math—
- Excuse me?

93
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,280
I'm pretty good at humanities.

94
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,720
[Ida]
Sorry

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,340
for barging in your house like this.

96
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,180
I don't mind. My family is out today anyway.

97
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,940
I can't believe this. We're lucky, Aoki.

98
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,730
- You seem pretty pleased, Hashimoto.
- Of course, I'm studying with Aida.

99
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,080
It's a little late to ask, but why do you like Akkun?

100
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,620
- Coming in.
- He's a pretty careless guy.

101
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,520
What? But he's super nice.

102
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,020
Nice?

103
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,360
Actually, I...

104
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,550
met him before high school.

105
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,460
Are you okay?

106
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,130
That was really loud. What happened?

107
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,070
I forgot my admission ticket for the entrance exam.

108
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,880
Is that all? You'll be fine.

109
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,820
What?

110
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,270
I forgot mine, too.

111
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,050
Great. You smiled.

112
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,860
It'll be fine. Let's go.

113
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,010
It was probably insignificant to Aida,

114
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,970
but it's a precious memory to me that I'll never forget.

115
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,220
Akkun...

116
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,150
You lucky dog.

117
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,520
Come on. What's the hold up?

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,990
Sorry!

119
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,380
- You must be excited, too.
- Pardon?

120
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,400
You'll be going into your beloved's room.

121
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
What?

122
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,660
She's right.

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,720
Ida's room...

124
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,550
Dog.

125
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,130
It's so cute.

126
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,580
What's it's name?

127
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,990
- Mametaro.
- Mametaro?

128
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,500
It looks rather like a daifuku mochi than a bean.
(T/N: "Mame" means a bean, it also means small)

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,680
Just be careful around him. He's a guard dog.

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,740
He doesn't seem very defensive.

131
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,340
Sit wherever you like. I'll go grab a table.

132
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,810
- Okay.
- Wow.

133
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,810
So this is what Ida's room is like.

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,100
I have this manga, too.

135
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,310
We're here to study.

136
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,510
I'm confiscating this.

137
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,740
Do you have a yearbook?

138
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,060
N-No, I don't.

139
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,730
What a liar. I want to see it.

140
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,230
It's embarrassing.

141
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,430
Don't tell me... Is he being shy?

142
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,380
Hey, you two, stop flirting.

143
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,900
What?! W-We're not! W-What?

144
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,770
Let's study.

145
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,630
You jerk! Stop your nonsense. It's making me nervous.

146
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,690
- Teacher?
- Yes, what is it?

147
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,690
I'm not sure what this grammar here.

148
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,700
I see. Looking at them now,

149
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,370
I can actually picture them being together.

150
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,650
On the other hand, I can't really picture myself being with Ida.

151
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,250
What is it?

152
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,090
Nothing.

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,070
I'll go get us something to drink.

154
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,630
By the way,

155
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,870
there is something I've wanted to ask you for a while.

156
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,460
Yes?

157
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,370
What is it?

158
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,330
To be blunt,

159
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,890
the person you like is Ida, isn't it?

160
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,580
What?

161
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,020
I'm genuinely rooting for you.

162
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,730
I really think you guys would be a cute couple.

163
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,970
What are you doing? Quit it. Come on.

164
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,260
Don't spout nonsense.

165
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,390
- I'm just curious.
- Don't be nosy.

166
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,820
I have a feeling that they're already dating.

167
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,090
Ouch! That hurts! Stop it.

168
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,760
Listen,

169
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,630
there is someone I like,

170
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,620
but it's not Ida.

171
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,990
What? It's not Ida? My hunch was wrong.

172
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,920
I can't believe it.

173
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,590
Who is it? Tell me who.

174
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,830
Well...

175
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,690
the guy I like...

176
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,440
is...

177
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,020
- It's a secret!
- What the heck? She teased me.

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,270
What are you guys talking about?

179
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,000
I have to call my mom real quick.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, that's my favorite tea.

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,640
How thoughtful of you, Ida.

182
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,040
I'm totally invisible to him.

183
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,070
Sorry. He's really dense.

184
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,190
Why are you apologizing?

185
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,690
I'll just have to get him to notice me.

186
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,920
Well, let's go study.

187
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,460
Yes.

188
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,070
Math should perish from the planet.

189
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,630
Math?

190
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,180
How did you get into high school?

191
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,670
I can't do this anymore. My brain is fried.

192
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,030
Well, I should be heading home now.

193
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,830
- I've finished up all my homework.
- Already?

194
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,470
I have a curfew, so I should head home soon.

195
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,870
Well, I'll keep studying a little longer.

196
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,310
Good idea. Detentions will do you good.

197
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,990
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.

198
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,920
Thanks for having me.

199
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,620
Hashimoto, good luck.

200
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,390
Are these all you have left?

201
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,890
We can finish them.

202
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,440
Yeah... right.

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,760
Crap!

204
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,050
I was too focused on cheering for Hashimoto, I forgot about my own predicament.

205
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,670
The two of us alone in Ida's room...

206
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,050
Is this...?

207
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,800
Is there something you don't understand?

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,180
You haven't made any progress at all.

209
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,660
Oh, right.

210
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,280
This one.

211
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,070
Let me see.

212
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,280
♫ The timeline I read repeatedly, my embarrassing hotline ♫

213
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,980
♫ Ah, what do I do if someone sees? ♫

214
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,770
♫ Let's do this and that ♫

215
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,400
♫ I'm worried on my own like an idiot. Whenever our eyes... ♫

216
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,230
Were you listening?

217
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,810
I wasn't listening!

218
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,880
That's honest of you.

219
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,130
Don't laugh! I couldn't help it since I'm nervous.

220
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,500
- Why?
- Why, you say?

221
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,220
Geez.

222
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,530
I confessed to you before, remember?

223
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,120
How could you stay so calm?

224
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,070
Have you forgotten about it? You're heartless.

225
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,520
I haven't forgotten.

226
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,080
I may seem calm, but you've been on my mind a lot lately.

227
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,190
- No, that's not what I meant.
- What?

228
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,830
Well, it's true, but...

229
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,020
Your confession made me curious about you.

230
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,200
I don't know much about love

231
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,440
since I don't have much experience in this,

232
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,900
not with a guy anyway.

233
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,190
But you're a good guy, so I haven't forgotten about it.

234
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,080
I've been thinking about how to interact with you.

235
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm sorry for making you anxious.

236
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,630
Are you being serious?

237
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,280
Don't be so dumbfounded.

238
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,500
I'm not.

239
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,130
It was just unexpected of you.

240
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,430
I thought I was the only one spinning my wheels about this.

241
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,990
I hope you'll be perplexed, as much as I have.

242
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,710
Does that mean... you've

243
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,960
been thinking of me all this time, too?

244
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,990
Well, I mean...

245
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,100
Come on. Let's keep studying.

246
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,880
Okay.

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,660
Sorry for barging into your house suddenly.

248
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,020
No problem. You should come over again.

249
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,720
It was fun.

250
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,440
I will if I feel like it.

251
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,410
Kosuke, did you have a guest over?

252
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,210
Welcome home, Mom.

253
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,510
It's nice to meet you. Thank you for looking after my son.

254
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,660
Good evening. I'm Aoki.

255
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,950
Wait...

256
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,640
Are you... Cinderella?

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,490
- Pardon?
- Take a look at this.

258
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,140
It was you, wasn't it?

259
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,060
Oh my, you're so cute in person.

260
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,890
- Wait, how did you...?
- Kosuke gave me the picture.

261
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,460
You looked so cute, I saved it as my wallpaper.

262
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,440
It used to be a picture of Mametaro, our dog.

263
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,000
But now it's a picture of you.

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,420
- I'm a fan of yours, Aoki.
- Thanks.

265
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,580
I can't believe Kosuke invited you over.

266
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,940
I didn't know you guys were that close. You should've told me.

267
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,340
Rather than being friends...

268
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,520
What are you saying?

269
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,030
We are classmates.

270
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,470
Come over again. You're always welcome at our house.

271
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,810
Be careful on your way home, okay?

272
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,530
I'll be going now.

273
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,750
Wait, Aoki.

274
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,650
What are you so upset about?

275
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,070
We're not even friends. Just classmates.

276
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,000
Are we friends then?

277
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,840
That's up to you.

278
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,030
Aoki is serious, so I have to give a serious thought about this, too.

279
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,030
But... I can't even imagine...

280
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,030
Would Aoki and I go on dates and stuff?

281
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,860
However, he looks cute every now and then.

282
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,820
What is it? You've been staring at me the whole time.

283
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,480
I have to look at you to draw you.

284
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,040
Why did I have to be paired up with you?

285
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,850
- It's based on our names.
- I know, but...

286
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,350
Wow, you're excellent at drawing.

287
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,950
That's impressive.

288
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,220
Since we're not submitting the drawing, you can have it.

289
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,410
No, thanks. I don't want that.

290
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,470
Is that me?

291
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,980
I hate this. Akkun, can you switch with me?

292
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,980
What? Heck no. I've already gotten so far.

293
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,720
- Please!
- Be quiet, Aoki!

294
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,160
Sorry.

295
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,940
He's going through a rebellious phase.

296
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,770
He used to be cute, though.

297
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,840
Do you also think Aoki is cute?

298
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,820
Not one bit. It was a joke.

299
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,670
So you think he's cute, don't you?

300
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,140
Speaking of which, you were curious about the person Aoki likes before.

301
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,360
No way!

302
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,860
Wait. What is it?

303
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,380
What's going on?

304
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,590
- Aoki, calm down and listen to me.
- What?

305
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,170
- C-Calm down, you idiot!
- You calm down first.

306
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,530
Right.

307
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,840
Aoki...

308
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,550
Ida has an eye on you.

309
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,540
Excuse me?

310
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,970
There you are, Kosuke. Let's go eat lunch in the clubroom.

311
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,050
Not today. I want to finish this.

312
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,370
What's that?

313
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,590
Something I drew during sketch practice.

314
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,710
Oh... Is that Aoki?

315
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes.

316
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can draw him really well

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,070
without even looking at him.

318
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,220
I guess.

319
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,940
So a girl lent you an eraser with Ida's name written on it.

320
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,070
When Ida saw it, he misunderstood you.

321
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,240
What a weird story!

322
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,100
I know, right?

323
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,330
Ida is such an earnest guy, so he took it very seriously.

324
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll give it a serious thought, so please wait for my answer.

325
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,810
Aoki, let's tell him the truth.

326
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,450
The truth?

327
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,240
That you liking him was just a misunderstanding.

328
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,350
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

329
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,090
Well... because...

330
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,230
You're both agonizing over it because you're clouding the issue.

331
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,780
- It's better to clear the misunderstanding now.
- But...

332
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,830
I'll go apologize with you.

333
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,330
What? No!

334
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,870
- Just leave it to me.
- I said, no!

335
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,940
So Aoki liking you was a misunderstanding.

336
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,230
Right?

337
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,160
What? A misunderstanding?

338
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,680
I mean... well, I...

339
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,440
Come on. Apologize to him, Aoki.

340
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,190
Well, I'll leave you two to talk.

341
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,030
♫ While I feel my heart leap with excitement, ♫

342
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:50,400
♫ I catch your gaze over and over ♫

343
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,490
Seriously? I got really worried about this.

344
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,700
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,640
- But, I...
- Well,

346
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,410
it was also my fault for jumping to conclusions.

347
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,560
You couldn't tell me the truth because I took it so seriously, right?

348
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,740
- That's not true, I...
- Look, it's fine.

349
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,610
It's all settled now.

350
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,920
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

351
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,020
I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding.

352
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,780
This is my fault.

353
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,630
I've been lying to myself about how I feel.

354
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,860
Listen, Ida.

355
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,910
I'm relieved, too.

356
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,550
I'm going to the club activities now.

357
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,260
And now that I can't take back what I said, I've finally realized.

358
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,680
My feelings for him... was real.

359
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,580
[This drama is a work of fiction]

360
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,800
[Next Episode]
I can't tell him how I really feel anymore.

361
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,510
I'm a piece of garbage.

362
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,880
Even if he tells me to leave him alone...

363
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,180
Do you really like Ida, do you not?
[Their feelings progress...]

364
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,870
I've decided to forget about my feelings for him.

365
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,520
What does it mean to like someone?
