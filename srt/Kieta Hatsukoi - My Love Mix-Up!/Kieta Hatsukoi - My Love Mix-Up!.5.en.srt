You don't have to worry about it anymore, either. I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,210
I can't tell him my real feelings anymore.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,960
What does it mean to love someone?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,090
Are you all right with just giving up?

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,990
The perfect chance for confessing is coming up.

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,500
The school camping trip!

Dear God of the Mountains, please lend me your strength.

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,300
What are you, some assassin tracking down prey?

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,130
If you act foolishly, he'll reject you before you even confess.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,840
Keep it down. Ida will hear you.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,470
Just relax, Buddy.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,400
After all, this trip is a golden opportunity. I'll also go for it.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,160
Hey, your bags seem heavy. Do you want me to carry them?

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,620
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,020
- Just joking.
- What?

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,520
If only I was as free-spirited as he is...

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,900
I'm envious of him. Seriously.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,410
Hashimoto has fallen to the dark side.

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,460
Why not confess to him during the trip?

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,780
He seems like he's having fun. I'm sure it'll go well.

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,300
I don't want to hear that from a coward like you, Aoki.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,600
Sure, I did give up on my love, but...

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm so sorry, Aoki! I was way out of line.

24
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,660
It's fine. After all, it's the truth.

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,600
We're both cowards and quick to give up.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,500
We are similar from the perspective.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,560
I heard rumors from a 12th-grade upperclassman.

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,310
Legend has it that the trip is magical, where new love blooms.

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,280
But it's a lie, just a trap laid out for students.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,560
What awaits us is no magical trip.

31

It's a hellish, spartan orienteering.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,910
We will now begin Higashigaoka High School's annual orienteering course.

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,820
As is tradition, our supervisor for this course

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,690
is a former member of the Self-Defense Forces, and an expert at mountain survival. Please, welcome Mr. Akutsu.

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,050

Very good.

45

You brats will now undergo a game of orienteering.

46
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,960
Sounds fun.

47

The rules are simple.

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:28,670
Enter the mountain and rely on the map to gather ingredients at designated checkpoints.

49
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,110
Ingredients?

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,810
You have until 4:00 p.m.

51
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,250
Once you return to the campsite, each individual will cook whatever they brought back. That is all.

52
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,930
Is that all?

Wait, do we have to cook our own meals?

Sir, may I ask a question?

55
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,260
- What is it?
- What happens if we fail to bring back any ingredients?

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,210
Do as you will.

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,480
What?

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,280
- You'll have nothing to eat. That's all.
- No way!

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,180
You, brats, will have orienteering for two days.

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,180
- Two days?
- That's the entirety of this outdoor training camp.

He is useless.

- What is this?
- Wait, all the ingredients are super far from each other.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,930
If you can't return here before 4:00 p.m., all ingredients will be confiscated.

If we gather all the ingredients, I think we can make beef curry.

- The curry roux, of course.

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,760
We're so pathetic.

162
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,810
- All because I'm slow... I'm sorry.
- No,

163
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,410
my fear of bugs hindered us.

164
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,740
- No it's my fault.
- No, I'm sorry, too.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,810
Hey,

166
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,640
why don't we make curry with everyone?

167
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,810
Obviously, our stamina and map reading skills may vary by individuals.

168
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,850
Judging and ranking us based solely on that is unacceptable.

169
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,250
Ida...

170
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,390
You're seriously a super-duper good guy!

171
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,020
Do you have any ideas?

172
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,220
Gather everyone's ingredients, and make the curry in this big pot. We can also cook the rice together.

173
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,960
Let's divide our portions between everyone, equally.

174
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,790
Agreed! The curry isn't as delicious if I'm the only one full.

175
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,380
That's a great idea! Right?

176
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,470
All right, everyone, put your chopped vegetables and roux in here!

177
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,860
Let's cook all the rice over here.

178
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,710
- Okay, let's do this.
- I'll go get us knives.

179
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,440
Thank you.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,910
Hey, guys!

181
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,030
We're sorry.

182
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,210
Sorry for being your burden.

183
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,980
Don't sweat it. All these will be our good memories.

184
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,420
- Thanks.
- Vegetables go here.

185
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,270
You brats!

186
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,210
I see you decided to shape it with your class.

187
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,470
How we use the ingredients is to our discretion, correct?

188
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,900
- You all pass!
- What?

189
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,230
You've won against the harsh mountain through kindness.

190
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,180
It's your victory!

191
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,780
Excuse me?

192
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,370
Sorry, this is like a game to see if our class can work as a team.

193
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,400
Since you all decided to share the curry, this game has ended!

194
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,010
"This game has ended"?

195
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,110
- Winners get... a prize!
- No way!

196
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,620
- What? M-Meat?
- There are even stir-fried noodles.

197
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,730
Juice! That's juice, isn't it?

198
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,750
These are your spoils of war, fit for victors!

199
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,770
Enjoy the rest of the camping trip, to your heart's content.

♫ Whenever our eyes meet, I feel like I'm in a dream ♫

202

♫ Two umbrellas form the shape of a heart
when walking side-by-side ♫

♫ I can't believe it. Miracle was waiting for me ♫

The times of spartan training may be a thing of the past.

205
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,350
Watching them, makes me think it's no longer necessary.

206
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,060
- I'm so glad.
- Pardon?

207
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,610
To be honest, I'm also not a fan of the whole "spartan" thing.

210
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,750
It's fine. Everyone helped us out, so this is the least we can do.

211
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,070
- Yes.
- Are you sure? All right.

212

Do you know why things didn't work out for you two?

217
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,740
Because I hate bugs and can't read maps!

218
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,680
Because I have no stamina!

219
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,070
The mountain is equal to all. Your abilities have nothing to do with it.

220
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,190
Then why did we fail?

221
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,840
Because you two are cowards.

222
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,730
You made excuses and gave up before you even tried.

223
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,360
Be courageous and take one step forward.

224
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,710
Once you start, you'll find a path.

225
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,440
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

226
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,890
Mr. Akutsu is right.

227
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,250
We gave up without trying.

228
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm... going to confess to Ida.

229
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,210
Aoki...

230
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,000
I need to change.

231
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,000
- So exhausted.
- Sanshiro, do you have some snacks?

232
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,170
You look so cute.

233
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,670
That's ridiculously funny.

234
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,490
What did you want to talk about?

235
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,270
Well, the night sky is pretty, isn't it?

236
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,940
Isn't it raining?

237
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,080
Even if it is, the air tastes crisp.

238
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,570
So... what is it?

239
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,230
Oh, well...

240
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,030
It's about that eraser from a while back.

241
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,510
Remember? You said you were glad it was a misunderstanding.

242
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,730
So I couldn't say it at the time.

243
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,460
It's all settled now.

244
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,680
You don't have to worry about it anymore, either. I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding.

245
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,730
What? Did I say that?

246
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,700
You did say that on the roof. Don't you remember?

247
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,410
I was quite hurt by that.

248
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:14,950
Oh! I said that because you were worried, so I was glad it resolved.

249
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,250
What? Is that it?

250
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,090
That's it.

251
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,010
I'm glad that's the case, but...

252
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,720
Wait.

253
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,780
Did you say... you were hurt?

254
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,220
I did.

255
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,540
Wasn't the eraser a misunderstanding?

256
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,310
Well... it was, at first.

257
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,990
But I... really...

258
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,770
Li... Li...

259
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,880
- Li...
- Li?

260
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,020
I can't do this! It's so embarrassing!

261
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,000
Let me go further away and tell you!

262
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,530
I've... come to...

263
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,770
I've... come to...

264
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,600
You're too far, I can't hear you!

265
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,430
I've... come to...

266
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,900
What did you say?

267
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,100
I said, I've... come to actually like you!

268
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,720
- So close!
- Watch out.

269
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,260
I thought I was going to die.

270
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,990
Ida! Ida! This can't be happening.

271
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,020
Don't leave me behind! Ida...

272
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm not dead.

273
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,900
- Are you alive?
- Of course I am.

274
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,900
I'm so relieved.

275
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,050
Are you hurt? Did you hit your head?

276
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm all right. What about you, Aoki?

277
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,450
I'm totally fine.

278
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,060
I couldn't keep on living if you died.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,180
J-Just kidding.

280
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,730
Sorry.

281
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,790
I keep causing you trouble.

282
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,660
Not at all.

283
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,290
The incident with the eraser too.

284
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,760
What?

285
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,630
At first, it was a misunderstanding, but you seriously considered my feelings.

286
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,850
It made me think you were a nice guy and all.

287
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,760
At the time, I'd just been rejected.

288
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,250
So your kindness really touched my heart.

289
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,000
That's when...

290
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,500
I fell in love with you.

291
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,190
At this point, I don't think you would believe me.

292
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,030
Just reject me at once.

293
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,510
I won't bother you anymore.

294
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,380
I'm well aware that you're serious.

295
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,570
Should we... try dating?

296
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,400
Excuse me? What do you mean?

297
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,800
Like I said, should we try going out?

298
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,960
Did you hit your head and injure your brain?

299
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,500
How rude.

300
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,720
Being confessed to so many times makes me happy.

301
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,280
- Plus, I just can't leave you alone.
- What?

302
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,520
You can't leave me alone? Is that your reason?

303
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,430
I thought you seriously considered my feelings.

304
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,570
I did. And I came to the conclusion that

305
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,320
there is something I don't understand, no matter how much I think about it.

306
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,500
What the heck? What an idiot.

307
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,730
Anyway, after you sincerely confessed to me,

308
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,070
I wanted to give you an honest answer.

309
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,180
Is that not an adequate enough reason to date you?

310
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,340
It's fine with me.

311
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,490
- It stopped raining.
- Right.

312
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,900
- Do you have everything?
- Yes.

313
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,270
Thus, both our camping trip and my confession came to an end.

314
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,800
I can't even imagine what will happen next.

315
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,620
With that said, thank you, God of the Mountain.
