[Previously on My Love Mix-Up!]
Maybe I was too hasty to suggest us dating,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,840
but I hope that we will date one day.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,210
I'm glad you told me how you really feel.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,700
Aida turned me down.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,750
Hashimoto...

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,430
Oh, Aoki. Morning.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,220
Ida, morning.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,160
There's something I want to ask you–

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,020
Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I'll talk to you later.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
- Hashimoto?
- This is seriously delicious!
- Really?

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,110
Aoki.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,570
Good morning.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,410
Morning. What are you two doing?

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,780
It's our morning "rou-tea-ne"?
(T/N: word play with Morning routine and tea)

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,670
On Mondays and Fridays, we eat breakfast together.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,140
- Did you make these scones, Rumi?
- I did.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,490
That's great. Not that I care.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,540
Aoki.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,080
Hashimoto...

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,970
Did Akkun turn you down?

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,060
You must be joking. When and why?

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,380
During the camping trip,

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,180
I was inspired by your courage, so I also confessed.

24
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,690
Aida!

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,490
Hashimoto?

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,010
Have you seen Aoki?

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,420
A-Aoki just left with Ida.

28
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,260
I see. He's finally made his resolve.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,230
Aida!

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,780
Well...

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,350
If I also...

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,720
If I also said I liked you, would you be troubled, Aida?

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,320
"Like"? What do you mean?

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,200
Would I be troubled?

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,550
Do you like me in a romantic way?

36
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,790
Hashimoto, do you like me?

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,080
Seriously? I didn't notice it at all.

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,470
Since when? But why?

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,710
The day of our high school entrance exams...

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,750
I remember. You told me about forgetting your exam ticket.

41
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,720
He saved me that day, so I told him

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,750
I've liked him ever since that day.

43
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,070
That story alone is good enough to accept your love.

44
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,960
You two had a fated encounter, and you've held that memory dear to your heart.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Akkun is a lucky guy.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,720
Well, it was nothing special on his end.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,090
Oh, yes...

48
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,610
That?

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,770
Don't tell me... you don't remember that.

50
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,080
Rather... was that actually me?

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,530
Are you sure it wasn't someone else?

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,390
Sorry for saying strange things.

53
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,760
- Please forget what I said.
- What?

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,100
I was totally invisible in his eyes.

55
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,480
I confessed, and now we're dating!

56
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,690
I was preoccupied with personal matters, and I forgot to tell you.

57
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,870
Aoki, congratulations.

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
Sorry for being the only one...

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,730
No, don't be sorry.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,880
It's only obvious he wouldn't remember a plain, dull human being like me.

61
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,290
Hashimoto, don't cry. Please.

62
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,520
There's something I want to ask you, Aoki.

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,530
Of course, ask me anything.

64
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,540
Which is better, a pompadour​ hair or a buzz cut?

65
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,030
A pompadour​ or...

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,850
Excuse me?

67
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,200
Maybe a pompadour​ stands out more?

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
H-Hashimoto?

69
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,560
Aida often reads delinquent manga.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,230
H-Hold on! Let's take deep breaths now.

71
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,620
You are seriously cute.

72
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,340
Come on, repeat after me.

73
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,140
I'm... seriously cute.

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,670
You're totally not plain.

75
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm... totally not plain.

76
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,610
Thank you. Aoki, you're so kind. I feel so energized now.

77
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,920
I'm so glad.

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,090
I'll get a pompadour!

79
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,720
Pompadour hair cut... done.
[Pompadour hair cut: Reservation Complete]

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,010
Akkun...

81
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,390
If we don't stop her, Hashimoto will have a pompadour.

What are you going to do about this?
[Gale Wind Boys]

84
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,570
Go stop Hashimoto from getting pompadour hair now.

85
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,750
If I went over, it'd only make things more complicated.

86

Hasshi...

87
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,690
It's pretty cute on girls, too.

88
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,190
Hey, Hasshi.

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,820
Pull yourself together.

90
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,440
Well... I'm sure she's not serious about the pompadour.

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,780
No, she's definitely serious.

92
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,210
She's on the public morals committee.

93
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,070
That's totally irrelevant.

94
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,070
You're the one who corrupted her refined morals.

95
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,900
Things turned out this way because you forgot about your memory with Hashimoto.

96
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,780
Even if you say so, I really don't remember.

97
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:48,600
Oh no, now the Hashimoto I loved so much will have a pompadour.

98
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,680
No, no, you see.

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,790
I liked Hashimoto before and not now.

100
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,870
Before I liked you, Ida!

101
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,050
I see. Aoki, you like many people.

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
Go after him.

103
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,230
This isn't time for you to be worried about Hashimoto.

104
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,320
Make sure you remember about that day.

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,230
Ida, wait up.

106
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,280
About Hashimoto... It's not what you think.

107

Right now, it's you.

What are you making me say?

111
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,310
You're the one who said it, not me.

112
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,260
- By the way, did something happen?
- What?

113
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,320
You were running around with a serious look this morning.

114
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,210
If something is troubling you, I'll listen.

115
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:09,220
It's nothing. By the way, didn't you have something to tell me this morning? What was it?

116
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,870
Oh, yes. So we're dating, right?

117
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,880
What the heck are you saying out in the open?

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,380
Come to think of it, I don't know what to do when dating.

119
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,330
I've never dated anyone, so I thought I'd consult you.

120
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,380
I don't know. I've never dated anyone either.

121
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,610
I thought you'd know since you confessed to me first.

122
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,030
What the heck? Are you saying whoever falls first loses out in a relationship?

123
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,880
Although, I'm the one at a disadvantage here.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,790
So what should we do, since we're "dating"?

125

Things to do when you're dating...

Ida and I...

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,870
Your reaction tells me you have some ideas.

128
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,810
I don't. Nothing at all.

129
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,610
Watch out.

130
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,530
Wait, hold on. There is one thing I want to do together.

131
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,290
What's that?

132
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,380
No, forget it.

133
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,530
What is it? Tell me. That'd help me out too.

134
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,250
Well... um...

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,300
Would you like to

136
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
eat lunch

137
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,390
on the rooftop together?

138
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,150
Lunch?

139
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,850
Only if you don't mind. If you don't want to, don't force yourself.

140
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,150
I don't mind.

141
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,600
- Seriously?
- We're just eating, right?

142
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,120
It's only the two of us, though. Are you sure?

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,700
Sure.

144
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,620
I remembered!

145
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,920
Then I'll see you later on the rooftop.

146
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,270
Okay.

147
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,120
So what did you remember?

148
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,020
- When we were in 10th grade, Hashimoto...
- Yes?

149
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,360
left a really bad impression on me.

150
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,070
How could you say that, Akkun?

151
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,260
H-Hashimoto... did you happen to hear...

152
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,220
You're the terrible one here. Badmouthing me behind my back.

153
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,220
I wasn't badmouthing you just now.

154
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,550
Forget it. I don't want to hear your excuses.

155
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,300
- No fair! I'm not making an excuse,
- Hold on—

156
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
- I was just saying the truth.
- The truth? What a jerk.

157
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,290
- Let me finish what I have to say first.
- Aida, you have no tact.

158
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,450
Stop arguing.

159
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,570
- This has nothing to do with you, Aoki!
- This has nothing to do with you, Aoki!

160
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,970
You're... absolutely right.

161
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,660
- Whatever. Bye.
- Hashimoto?

162
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,980
- Goodbye to you.
- Akkun.

Ida...

165
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,430
- It's time for lunch.
- What?

166
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,230
Right. Sorry.

167
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,660
What's wrong? Is everything all right?

168
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,990
Everything is fine. Let's go.

169
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,070
- What about Ida?
- Let's invite him.

170
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,590
No, he has other plans today. Let's go to the clubroom.

171
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,430
What nice weather we have today.

172
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,420
You're right.

173
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,940
This is... different from what I was imagining.

174
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,550
Is Ida having fun being with me in the first place?

175
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,820
I can't tell what he's thinking.

176
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,340
I have a feeling this isn't what dating's like.

177
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,310
Thanks for eating lunch with me today.

178
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,490
What? Sure.

179
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,040
But let's end it here.

180
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,470
Sorry for forcing you to hang out with me.

181
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,140
Why do we have to end it?

182
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,670
Ida, you haven't spoken a word.

183
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm sure eating with me is no fun.

184
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,670
You haven't spoken either. Why is that?

185
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,410
W-Well, I'm...

186
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,480
I was just waiting for you to speak up.

187
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,930
Isn't there something... troubling you?

188
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,150
What?

189
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,510
Ever since this morning,

190
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,000
your mind has been elsewhere.

191
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,740
Sorry.

192
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,830
Hashimoto will get a pompadour?

193
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,300
I tried stopping her and only complicated things further.

194
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,030
I'm a real busybody.

195
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:10,110
Since you found out I used to like Hashimoto,

196
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,490
I've been reluctant to tell you that I was worried about her.

197
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,140
I'm sorry for keeping it from you,

198
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,590
but I'm not in love with her any longer.

199
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,750
I know that already.

200
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,250
I'm such a fickle busybody.

201
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,610
Don't disparage yourself so much.

202
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:43,470
Didn't Hashimoto come to you for advice, because you worry alongside her?

203
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,560
I think you're supporting her plenty.

204
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,690
But you know... those two...

205
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,300
Aoki, you're always worrying.

206
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,990
I think I'm starting to understand you more.

207
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,260
Aoki, Ida!

208
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,240
There you are.

209
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,100
What? W-We were just

210
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,720
admiring the nice weather.

211
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,280
A problem has arisen in our class.

212
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,170
Problem?

213
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,190
Hashimoto has... disappeared.

214
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,460
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared?

215
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm telling you, she just left class early.

216
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,400
Even Hashimoto's close friends don't know why she left. Aren't you worried?

217
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,320
Aoki, you seem close to her. Ida, you're on the public morals committee with her. Did she tell you something?

218
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,980
No, nothing.

219
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,710
What exactly is occurring in our class?

220
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,330
You're overreacting. I'm sure she felt sick or something.

221
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,960
Let's go.

222
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,690
If you find out anything, let me know!

223
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,490
Go after her. You're worried, aren't you?

224
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,490
What? But... we were eating lunch together.

225
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,880
I’m… quite fond of Aoki,

226
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,910
who does everything he can to help others.

227
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,670
Thanks. I'll be on my way.

228
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,120
It's time for everyone's favorite class, math.

229
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,580
Oh? Not only Hashimoto, but Aoki and Aida left early as well?

230
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,010
Has anyone heard from them?

231
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,670
Ida, do you know anything?

232
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,190
They were both worried and went after Hashimoto.

233
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,580
I see. All right.

234
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,180
Then let us begin the class. Open to page 115.

235
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:04,130
We'll begin by reviewing the Functions of General Angles.

236
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,560
Stop, stop!

237
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,880
I said wait!

238
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,740
I don't want to leave things misunderstood.

239
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,210
Move!

240
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,890
Nope!

241
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,090
Her open-palm slap is so powerful.

242
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,920
I have a business to attend to.

243
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,210
Is your business getting a pompodour?

244
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,660
I heard from Aoki. Don't do it, I'm telling you.

245
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,140
Leave me alone!

246
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,040
I bet you'll regret it later.

247
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,940
It's none of your business, Aida.

248
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,790
Hold on!

249
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,510
Aoki?

250
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,050
What are you doing here? Isn't class in session?

251
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,470
I came to stop you, Hashimoto.

252
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,670
You should take a moment to calm down.

253
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,220
However, I already made the appointment

254
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,910
Just cancel it.

255
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,520
That's troubling to the store.

256
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,980
Then... I'll get a pompadour instead!

257
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,170
Thank you for your patronage!

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,720
Aoki!

260
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,040
Thank you.

♫ While I feel my heart leap with excitement, ♫

262
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,910
You sort of look like a Kokeshi doll.
(T/N: A Japanese wooden doll.)

263
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,830
When I called you Kokeshi-like in our first year,

264
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,110
you ignored me.

265
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,440
I remembered.

266
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,300
That's because I was embarrassed.

267
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,690
I thought you didn't like me.

268
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,500
Our vibes are completely opposite.

269
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,520
You're serious, and I'm not.

270
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,730
I never disliked you, though.

271
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:43,560
In 11th grade, you started talking to me more. I was really happy.

272
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,650
Still...

273
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:53,700
To be honest, I can't really picture myself dating you.

274
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,500
I'm sorry.

275
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:07,420
But I like you as a friend.

276
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,080
Today, I came to like you even more.

277
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,230
- Really?
- Yes.

278
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,290
Talking to you was a lot of fun,

279
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,840
and for some reason, you wanted to get a pompadour.

280
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,880
Don't laugh.

281
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,750
It was hilarious, though.

Yes?

289
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,330
Can I put more effort, so you get to know me better?

290
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,020
Sure, bring it on!

291

See you.

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,230
See you.

Ida...

328
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,220
- All right, I'll see you on the rooftop later.
- What?

329
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,360
Let's each lunch together.

[Next Episode]
Aoki, are you leaving? I'm going to miss you...
[The two go on their separate paths?]

332
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,710
- How far have you guys gone?
- Not far at all!

333
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,900
What do you want to do, Aoki?
[Moments of heartthrob progress!?]

334
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,310
I want to treasure the person who treasures me.

335
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,510
♫ Just like a magnet, we stick together then we separate ♫

336
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,500
Since we're dating, there's nothing wrong with that.
