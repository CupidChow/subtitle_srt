Wait, I can't expose Hashimoto's modest feelings.

First, let's organize my thoughts.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,240
The person I like is... Hashimoto.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,340
But Hashimoto likes Ida,

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,390
and I was rejected by her.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,000
However, the person Ida is trying to fall for is...

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,220
The arrow is unnecessary.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,100
If things go well between them, everything will end well.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,470
I decided to cheer on Hashimoto. What the heck am I doing?

18

Koguma, Tayama, and Isono will be in charge of costumes.

This is a good chance for Ida and Hashimoto to get closer.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,290
Hey, Ida.

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,720
- Volunteer for the stage setup.
- Why me?

25

Whatever. Hey, this guy here will work on the stage setup.

29

If it's a horse, you should draw the neck longer.

Don't let it get to you.

163
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,970
No, no, no. Why did that come to my mind suddenly?

164
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,890
No, you're kind.

165
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,460
What kind of feeling is this?

166
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,560
Stop making my heart flutter.

167
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,770
What will I do if I actually fall for you?

168
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,450
Wait, what am I thinking?

169
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,100
- Shut up!
- Okay!

170
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,650
- You're disturbing the neighbors.
- I said okay.

- Don't waste the water.

The two leads are absent sick with a cold.

176
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,010
Both of them? Why?

177
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,760
They practiced by the riverbed into the night yesterday.

178

One more time, Hiromu!

Don't call me Hiromu.

We're the Prince and Cinderella!

- The Prince and Cinderella!
- Yes!

182
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,880
Both of them are running fevers.

183
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,710
I warned them not to practice too much on dancing. What do we do now?

184
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,910
We all worked so hard on this. Can we pick understudies?

185
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,550
- No way.
- We have our hands are tied with lighting.

186
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,590
We have costume changes to worry about.

Aren't the only people with free time the stage setup team?

How about you, Hashimoto?

190
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,900
She fits the role. I can tell!

Hashimoto, will you be our Cinderella?

- I'm...
- Please, for the class.

But... I get easily nervous.

Especially in front of people...

It suits me better anyway.

If he wants to volunteer, I guess it's fine.

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,410
- Yes.
- Let him play.

Aoki...

203
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,290
- Then who should be our Prince?
- You know...

204
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,120
- nobody fits the role other than Ida.
- What?

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,320
- Right?
- Yes.

206
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,080
It'll work! I mean, the chemistry between the two of them is insane.

Nothing.

I didn't think you were "cool" or whatever.

217

Surprisingly, that suits you.

218
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,650
Shut it. Just to make it clear, I didn't volunteer because I wanted to act with you.

219
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,960
You don't have to tell me that. I know you were covering for Hashimoto, weren't you?

220

How gallant of you, Aoki.

That's exactly what stumps me. I don't know how to react.

- I was just complimenting you.
- Your empty compliments don't make me happy.

Please, let me live.

Why? I can't come up with a speech all of a sudden.

I'm sure you have something to say, especially to the Prince.

What? I don't have anything to say.

Don't be shy, Aoki.

262

After all, you guys looked so lovey-dovey together.

See?

- What a nice picture.
- Can you send that to me?

265

- Send it to me, too.
- Okay.

266
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,430
- Stop it.
- Ida looks like a real prince here.

267
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,470
- No wonder Princess Aoki was charmed.
- I can tell he's in love when you look at his eyes.

They're seriously falling in love.

Wh-What's the matter? Why are you so pissed off?

271
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,170
- Because—
- It's a joke! We were just teasing you.

272
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,520
We know it's impossible. Right, everyone?

273
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,690
Right. That's right.

274
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,060
It's nothing but a joke to them.

275
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,510
But it would be hilarious if they hook up for real. Right, Ida?

276
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,280
Not funny.

277
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,220
Besides, Aoki did it for the sake of our class.

278
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,440
Why are you making fun of him?

279
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,700
When you say that, I'll actually fall for you. Just joking.

280
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:10,310
Listen up. As a reward, I'll treat you all to ice cream.

Are you okay?

283
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,000
You're too straitlaced. You could just shrug them off.

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,990
But didn't it displease you?

285
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,520
Drop it already.

286
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,380
I didn't like it.

287
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,110
That's why I defended you. Sorry.

288
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,220
Look, I'm not asking for an apology. I'm fine, really...

289
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,160
since you stood up for me.

290
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,160
Why in the world did I say that?

291
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,590
That makes it sound like I actually fell for Ida.

292
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,410
Are you all right?

293
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,500
I didn't like it.

That was a close call.

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,360
I'm glad I chased after you.

299
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,070
You had me worry because you seemed you were pushing yourself today.

300
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,080
Sorry, I was spacing out.

301
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,440
Are you sure you're okay?

302
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,430
Why do you care for me so much?

303
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
Of course I do. Since we're friends, that's a given.

304
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,020
Hashimoto...

305
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,550
Besides, you're always helping me out, Aoki.

306
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,430
For instance, being an understudy for Cinderella today.

307
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,610
Thank you.

308
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,660
It made me super happy.

309
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,220
So if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to tell me.

310
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,310
I'm rooting for you with all my heart, you hear?

311
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,570
Hashimoto is so considerate of me.

312
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,000
Yet, I...

313
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,850
Hashimoto... I'm sorry!

314
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,170
What's the matter?

315
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,820
I... promised I would cheer on your romance,

316
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,620
but I can't cheer you on halfheartedly. I'm really sorry!

I'm not too sure of myself,
