Now, it's time for a pop quiz.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,520
What?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,540
Clear off your desks.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,330
Akkun. Akkun!

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,130
Let me borrow your eraser.

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,640
No!

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,890
- So unkind.
- I only have one.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,740
- Then split it in half.
- No way!

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,380
Are you leaving me to fail?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,430
A quiz without an eraser is like hell.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,130
Just use your finger. It'll erase well enough.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,430
It won't! It'll only smudge the paper.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,650
- Stop it.
- Hand it over.

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,190
- Nope!
- Aoki.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,890
Use this.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,560
I have two erasers.

20

I can't guarantee the taste, though.

You're so modest, Hashimoto.

- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,450
- I should thank you instead.
- Pardon?

100
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,390
I was a bit worried that you may tease me about it.

101
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,510
There's no way I would do that.

102

Thank you for keeping it a secret.

Hashimoto, aren't you going to go for it?

104
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,970

105
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,790
A confession.

106
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,540
Me? No, there is no way I can.

107
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,050
I'm sure he is into someone else.

108

Hashimoto, I think you have a good chance. I mean it.

Aoki, you're kind.

But I'm fine with being a bystander right now.

111
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,040
Since he's my first crush, I want to treasure the moment.

I understand your feelings all too well.

113

- Yes.

I vow to protect this.

121
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,050
Hashimoto, I will protect your happiness no matter what.

122
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,790
Sorry. Did you wait long?

123
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,280
Not really.

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,580
Please!

125
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,870
- I'm sorry!
- Don't tell anyone!

126
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,620
What?

127
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,820
I want you to keep quiet about the eraser.

128
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,250
I will. Spilling a secret doesn't benefit me.

129
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,460
But people might tease or it could start rumors.

130
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,610
As I said, it doesn't benefit me at all.

I see.

134
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,930
Your good nature is what led to love.

135
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,150
H-Hold on! That's not what that meant, okay?

136
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,580
Aoki, I didn't notice your feelings at all.

137
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,740
If I've misled you, then I'll apologize.

138
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,290
You're so wrong!

139
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,560
That's not what that eraser meant.

140
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,810
Then what did it mean?

141
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,280
Dammit! Anyhow, just forget that ever happened.

142

- Say what?

144
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,460
Well, I mean...

145
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,150
I don't think you have to pretend your feelings never happened.

146
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,370
Though I feel bad I can't accept your feelings.

Don't cry.

151
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,770
I don't want to cry, either, especially not in front of you.

152
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,070
Either way, I can't go out with you. I'm really sorry.

153
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,720
- Actually, can I punch you?
- Why?

154
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,670
Because I feel unsatisfied.

155
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,670
H-Hey! Wait a second!

156
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,050
I see. So that was for this guy.

157
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,450
Was it really okay for me to take the last one?

158
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,220
Yes. I was planning on throwing it away if no one would eat it.

159
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,740
Seriously? That would be a waste. This is delicious, though.

160
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,650
Thank you.

161
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,590
Handing someone a gift is so difficult, isn't it?

162
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,770
I was too nervous. Man, I'm such a coward.

163
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,070
She actually meant to give the cake to Ida.

164

Regardless, ever since that day, I...

165
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,400
It may sound stupid, but I seriously fell in love.

166
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,540
I bet you wouldn't understand that.

167
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,990
Looks good, looks good.

168
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,170
- Looking good.

172

What's wrong, Kosuke? Is something bothering you?

174
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,730
No, it's nothing.

175

How unusual for you to be so unfocused during practice.

Well, I wanted to ask you something.

180
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,460
What sort of guy is Aoki?

181
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,080
Excuse me?

182
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,900
You're friends with Aoki, right?

183
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,570
I am, but... why?

184
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,740
You see...

185
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,620
he's exactly as he looks.

186
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,270
He's an idiot, and he has a sweet tooth.

187
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,360
What about his crush?

188
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,690
Oh... we don't really do the whole, "romance talk" thing.

189

Why?

190
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,440
Do you want blackmail material? Are you two arguing?

191
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,410
No, I just didn't know him really well

192
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,720
and hurt his feelings.

193
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,780
I don't really get it, but do you want me to tell him

194
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,160
that you totally reflected on your actions?

195
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
No. I don't want to trouble you. Plus,

196
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I can't get my feelings across unless I say it in person.

197
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,300
I don't want to settle this half-heartedly.

198

200
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,420
a ridiculously good guy.

201

That's hilarious! You tripped in the bath and punched the floor? You're a real idiot.

Oh? Why are the two of you together? How unusual.

208
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,180
So are you two on good terms with one another?

209
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,630
We had a meeting for Disciplinary Committee this morning, so it is a coincidence.

210
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,800
It was merely a coincidence. Right, Ida?

211
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,550
What? R-Right.

212
00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:02,330
I see... your desperation to convince us otherwise, makes it even more suspicious.

213
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,640
What the hell! Dude, it hurts. You idiot!

214

I'm going to the school store. Bye!

215

Aoki.

217
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,840
Why did you run away? Wasn't that the perfect chance to talk to him?

218
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,650
It was, but...

219
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,660
I was so nervous. My heart couldn't handle it.

220
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,570
If I stayed any closer to him, it'd have ended badly.

221
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,600
Your face pretty much said it all.

222
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,680
I was doing my best to act natural, you know?

223
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,410
Man, why can't I talk to him like I talk to you?

224
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,600
Talking to you calmed my nerves.

- I'm not looking down on you.

I came up here because I was worried you would be crying again.

Don't worry about that.

To be honest...

277
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,300
I don't really understand what it means to "like" and "dislike" someone.

278

Hey, how does it feel to "like" someone?

279
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,080
Even if you ask me...

280
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,450
More importantly, have you never had a crush before?

281
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,390
Not once.

282
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,680

283

There is an opportunity for me.

What sort of hairstyle do you prefer? Long or short?

290
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,180
This long, or this short. You must have some preference.

291
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,980
I guess I like short hair.

What about height?

293
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,010
Short, or tall and slender?

294

I like that.

295
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,350
Then what about personality? Outgoing or conservative?

296
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,770
If I had to choose... I prefer a conservative type.
