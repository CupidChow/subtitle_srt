Aoki, you're always worrying. I think I'm starting to understand you more.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,480
Can I put more effort, so you get to know me better?

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,910
From now on, if there's anything troubling you, be sure to consult me.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,450
I want to help you when you're in need.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,220
Supplementary lessons?

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,360
That's right.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,710
What? Do you want to go to college?

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,360
Yes, that's the plan.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,340
I see.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,980
Sorry, but you won't get in unless you start cramming now.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,520
Your math and science scores are pretty low.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,600
That's a lot to take in now.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,870
Oh, I know the perfect person for you.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,340
The perfect person?

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,540
Someone who was terrible at math like me,

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,510
but he got into Higashigaoka International University by studying hard. He's coming here for training,

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,890
so he's going to give me intensive private tutoring.

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,770
I see. Good for you.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,010
It's not good at all.

20
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,750
Your grades did improve after Ida's tutoring. Have you really devolved into an idiot again?
[Grade-11 Class-3]

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,530
If you're that bad at math, why not switch to a humanities class?

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,870
But I barely know anyone in the humanities classes.

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,320
It's your own life. Don't be influenced by others.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,890
I know that!

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,690
Aoki, are you leaving this class?

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,210
I haven't decided yet! Don't get it in your head I'm leaving.

27
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,150
I would be lonely.

28
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,430
Did you... just say "lonely"?

29
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,730
I did.

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,680
Right... If Ida would be lonely, I should work hard at studying.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,000
He's totally being influenced by others.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,950
All right, take your seats.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,390
I want to introduce Mr. Okano, who will be joining us as a part of his training.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,780
I'm a student-teacher. My name is Ryohei Okano.

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,290
I'll be learning here with you for the next three weeks.

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,850
It's nice to meet you all.

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,070
Welcome to Grade-11th, Class-3.

38
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,700
- I'm the class president—
- President, be quiet.

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,750
Mr. Okano, my future depends on you.

[My Love Mix-Up!]
[Episode 8]

41
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,730
Sorry for the wait.

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,790
- Sota Aoki, right?
- Yes!

43
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,090
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you! I will work very hard!

44
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,850
Wow, you're motivated.

45
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,610
Let's take it easy on the first day.

46
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,280
Let's get to know each other first and figure out which subjects you're good at and which not.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,440
Wow... He's so cool and collected.

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,880
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,270
Don't be sorry.

50
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,170
I was at this level in my second year, too.

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,860
- Are you serious?
- That's right.

52
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,400
But my girlfriend was in the STEM class, too, so I studied like crazy and got better at it.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,070
I'm in that exact situation.

54
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,050
Way to go, Aoki.

55
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,530
Well...

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,980
Who confessed first? Was it you?

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,520
Well, sort of...

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,310
- Aoki confessed his feelings first.
- Hey, don't write that down!

59
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,690
Your study will progress better if we know about each other.

60
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,160
What are they like? What do you like about them?

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:05,570
Lots of stuff, like they're sincere and always think of my well-being first.

62
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,530
What about their hairstyle and their height?

63
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,840
They have short hair and are tall.

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
- Are they involved in an after-school club?
- Yes, they are.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
Nice, an athletic type, so...

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,440
how far have you gotten?

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,900
We haven't done anything.

68
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,950
Your reaction was a little suspicious.

69
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,160
I would be happy to give you some pointers.

70
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,270
Well... we eat lunch together, and...

71
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,310
Gosh... I'm sorry.

72
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,090
What? What is it? Did I say something wrong?

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,190
No, I just thought it was nice, how pure you are.

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,930
I'm curious to know. When high schoolers date,

75
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,420
they want to hold hands and kiss.

76
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,950
I haven't really thought that far yet.

77
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,360
We only started dating recently.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,830
- They might actually be waiting for you to make a move.
- What?

79
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,380
It could be only me who thinks so.

80
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,290
All right! That's enough chatting.

81
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,340
- Say, ah. Psych!
- Rumi, come on.

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,050
- Ready? Or not!
- Oh! Come on, Rumi!

83
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,650
Aren't you a member of the public morals committee, Ida? Go crack down on them.

84
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,610
Don't be ridiculous.

85
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,800
Besides, they weren't doing anything wrong. It seemed consensual.

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,420
What is that look on your face?

87
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,650
Do you know about that kinda stuff?

88
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,080
Well, yes.

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,200
He said it like it was obvious.

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,160
Wait... does he think about doing that sort of stuff with me?

91
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,130
"They might actually be waiting for you to make a move."

92
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,990
Seriously? Does he really? Does he think of doing that with me?

93
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,030
In that case...

94
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,690
In that case...

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,910
O-Oh, I was just trying to grab my juice! Don't put your hand there.

96
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,780
Y-You should drink more water too, Ida!

97
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:44,190
That was close! I was careless and almost made a fool out of myself.

98
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,160
And Ida said, Whoa! Whoa!

99
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,280
Aoki, what's going on? You've been focused on studying like a mad person.

100
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,300
Is school not a place for study? Besides, I can forget unpleasant thoughts, when I'm solving problems.

101
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,590
Don't tell me... did you get dumped?

102
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,670
Oh, sorry.

103
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,670
Aoki, look at this.

104
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,430
Wow, I did it! It's all thanks to your help, Mr. Okano.

105
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,200
It's the result of your efforts, Aoki.

106
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,190
Aoki?

107
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,770
Oh, Ida?

108
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,950
What are you looking at?

109
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,130
This!

110
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,390
I see. You're overjoyed with happiness.

111
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,570
I deserve to be happy. I worked really hard for this.

112
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,410
I've been doing so many assignments, too.

113
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,390
Is that why you've been down lately?

114
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,240
Well... that's...

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,330
Ever since then... you've started hiding your hand.

116
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,500
Did I startle you the other day, Ida?

117
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,240
What?

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,890
When we were eating on the stairs, I suddenly touched your hand.

119
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,750
I won't do it again.

120
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,640
So you don't have to be on your guard around me.

121
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,360
Aoki,

122
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,990
give me your hand.

123
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,590
What?

124
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,850
Wh-What are you doing?

125
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,190
Hot. It's hot.

126
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,490
I was startled because your hand was unexpectedly cold the other day.

127
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,660
Do you have an extreme sensitivity to cold?

128
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,290
Is that why you said, "Whoa"?

129
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,610
I was just shocked by how freezing your hand was.

130
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,170
Your reactions were so confusing.

131
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,530
It was you who jumped to the wrong conclusions.

132
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,010
I'm so glad I didn't gross you out.

133
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,920
♫ I feel discomposed. Is this the beginning of love? ♫

134
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
What?

135
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,510
Ida... how much do you know?

136
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,120
About what?

137
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,690
You know... the things

138
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,420
people normally do when they're dating.

139
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,850
I know about it.

140
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,370
Do you?

141
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm not thinking of doing anything right away,

142
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,610
but there's no way I would think of you as gross.

What's going on there?

150

That was Ida from our class. No doubt about it.

151
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,370
So that means... that means Aoki is...

152

Come to think of it, I feel like he looks up to me.

Look, Mr. Okano! Ta-da!

154
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,020
Did I startle you that bad?

155
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,800
That's amazing! Full marks.

156
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,300
- Yes! Mr. Okano, do you remember?
- Remember what?

157
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,770
You said, if I got 100 points on a quiz, you'd treat me to ramen.

158
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,890
Just disregard what I said.

159
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,390
What? Why? I was looking forward to it.

160
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,540
- Treat me. Treat me.
- I'm not interested in you in that way.

161
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,990
Oops, it slipped out.

162
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,880
Hey, listen...

163
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,090
I saw you yesterday on the overpass.

164
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,480
I didn't know

165
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,820
you swing that way, so...

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,530
I'm sorry, but I can't keep my promise.

167
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,630
I won't tell anyone, of course.

168
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,240
Okay.

169
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,270
Thank you, Mr. Okano. Sorry for not telling you.

170
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,250
No, it's my fault. Forgive me.

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,520
Sure.

172
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,490
There is no surprise there. It's normal for people to react that way.

173
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,650
So... why are we helping Aoki with his class chores?

174
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,800
Aoki, did something happen?

175
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,350
What?

176
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,320
Tell me. You promised me

177
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,610
you'd talk to me if anything troubles or worries you.

178
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,490
Ida, how did you know?

179
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,560
We can tell from your attitude.

180
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,650
You're slow at stapling.

181
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,210
Sorry about that.

182
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,670
Your face really is an open book.

183
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,190
So what happened?

184
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,580
Well, it's not really a big deal,

185
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,140
but Mr. Okano saw me with Ida.

186
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,470
I think he doesn't like me anymore.

187
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,400
Then he called off his promise to treat me to ramen.

188
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,490
I was really looking forward to the treat. It's so unfortunate.

189
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,430
Aoki...

190
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,790
That is a big deal.

191
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,790
Is it?

192
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm ticked off! What a jerk!

193
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,270
Hashimoto, something appeared behind you.

194
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,130
I bet he always says stuff carelessly without thinking it through.

195
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,360
I was the same way. My persuasiveness is on another level.

196
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,700
Is that something to brag about?

197
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,600
I guess... you're right.

198
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,170
You should file a complaint to a school forum.

199
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,690
Aoki should just quit his lesson.

200
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,490
- Why? Aoki hasn't done anything wrong.
- It's really fine.

201
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,080
Don't fight, guys.

202
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
Let's go, Aoki.

203
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,810
I'm simply worried about Aoki.

204
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,390
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

205
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,670
Thanks. Good work, guys.

206
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,510
Excuse us.

207
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,100
Excuse us.

208
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,110
Should I go talk to Mr. Okano instead?

209
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,370
What? Forget it. Don't you have your practice today?

210
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,690
- I'll skip it.
- You don't have to do that!

211
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,670
He said he wouldn't tell anyone. It's already settled.

212
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,170
If you're depressed about it, it's not settled.

213
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,010
Ida...

214
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
What do you want to do?

215
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,130
I want...

216
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,680
to treasure the person who treasures me.

217
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,390
Hey, do you have time today after your club?

218
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,600
What?

219
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,450
Why don't we eat ramen? Just the two of us.

220
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,330
I would refuse Mr. Okano, even if he invites me to.

221
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,740
It's a promise.

222
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,770
Okay. See you later. Good luck with your club!

223
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,320
Thanks.

224
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,490
Aoki's test score went up again.

225
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,890
You're good at drawing out a student's potential.

226
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,740
No, not at all.

227
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,400
It was you who taught us in spartan methods back then,

228
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,170
that's why my score went up.

229
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,250
That was good old days.

230
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:43,270
I've been at this job for many decades. I've met lots of different students.

231
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:48,350
Each of them had their own unique personality.

232
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,450
Sometimes I think being a teacher is about watching over their individuality.

233
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,450
Mr. Taniguchi, do you know about those two?

234
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,240
I have to get materials ready for my next class.

235
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,540
Sorry! Take care of the rest, okay?

236
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,070
Okay.

237
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,480
Are you in a hurry, Kosuke?

238
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,820
Yes. I made a promise to Aoki.

239
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,740
Leave it to me. I'll take care of the rest for you.

240
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm almost done, though.

241
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,950
Don't worry. Hey, don't leave him waiting.

242
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,320
Sorry. Well... thank you.

243
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,760
Sure.

244
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,790
Sorry, I'm running a little late. I'll meet you at the restaurant.

245
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,380
Got it! I'll be waiting out front.

246
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,640
- Excuse me, do you have a minute?
- Yes?

247
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,130
I'm trying to find my way to this hotel.

248
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,160
Here it is.

249
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,230
Thank you so much.

250
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,080
- How can I thank you?
- No worries. Bye, then.

251
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,840
Excuse me.

252
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,020
- Please accept this.
- I can't.

253
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,520
It's a token of my appreciation.

254
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,700
- Please don't.
- What are you doing?

255
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,490
Mr. Okano?

256
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,880
Don't just stand there. Come with me.

257
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,500
You need to value your body more.

258
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,500
Good night.

259
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,590
What are you saying? I was just helping him find his way.

260
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,530
Helping him find his way, right?

261
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,280
Were you helping him on the overpass the other day as well?

262
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,670
We are dating! What's wrong with that?

263
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,000
Mr. Okano, your prejudice is disgusting.

264
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,070
Prejudice?

265
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,230
I couldn't help it because I knew nothing of those things.

266
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,090
I don't want you to judge me because of it.

267
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,680
I was just happy to learn from you.

268
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,700
Getting advice from you, you were like a senior I never had,

269
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,410
like an older brother.

270
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:15,060
We... got along fine because I didn't know your sexuality.

271
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,510
I mean... In the beginning, you...

272
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,890
I haven't changed since the day I met you.

273
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,750
I wanted you to know that. Bye, then.

274
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,550
Aoki, sorry for the wait.

275
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,990
Ida!

276
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,480
- You could have waited inside.
- What?

277
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,010
Well...

278
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,130
Is something wrong?

279
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,150
Not really. Let's go inside.

280
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,630
Ida, I said let's go.

281
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,310
Would you like to have ramen with us?

282
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,830
- What?
- Hey!

283
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,760
Aoki, didn't you look forward to eating ramen with Mr. Okano?

284
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,140
Take a hint.

285
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,600
Aoki, Ida...

286
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,290
it'll be my treat. Shall we eat together?

287
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,610
Where are you going?

288
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,040
To wash my hands.

289
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,910
You're so prim and proper.

290
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,270
Listen.

291
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,780
Yes?

292
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,300
To be honest, it's not easy for me

293
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,860
to understand this about you.

294
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,720
But... I was wrong to break a promise.

295
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,550
Okay.

297
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,420
By the way, I was really helping that guy find his way before.

298
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,980
I'm really sorry for suspecting you were up to something weird.

299
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,870
You know what? You're being way too self-conscious.

300
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,930
You're too quick to jump to conclusions.

301
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,370
I couldn't help it! I may not look it, but I'm pretty popular, you know.

302
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,650
Are you sure? Even a biased jerk like you?

303
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,430
Jeez, don't call me that.

304
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,660
I didn't pick a random guy to date.

305
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,900
I like Ida.

306
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,930
Fair enough.

307
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,590
What are you guys talking about?

308
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,800
Nothing in particular.

309
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,740
- Thank you for waiting. Here is your miso flavored.
- Thanks.

310
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,390
- Here is your salt flavored.
- Good.

311
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,650
- And soy sauce flavored.
- Mine.

312
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,320
It looks so good.

313
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,050
We all picked different flavors.

314
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,170
The miso flavor is really good here.

315
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,660
But soy sauce ramen is my favorite of all.

316
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,370
Refreshing salt-flavored one is the best.

317
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,200
- Let's eat!
- Let's dig in.

318
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,300
Wow, it's delicious.

319
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,510
It's so good.

320
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,010
Oh well...

321
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,060
people are free to like whatever they like, I suppose.

322
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,260
♫ While I feel my heart ♫

323
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,200
♫ Leap with excitement, ♫

324
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
Oh, it's delicious!

325
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,660
Excuse me.

326
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,940
Could I have some gyoza, beer, and...

327
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,650
- two oolong teas?
- You got it.
(T/N: Oolong Tea - made from the same plant used in black and green teas, but the leaves are processed differently)

328
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm sorry, Aoki!

329
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,700
Mr. Okano, you had too much to drink.

330
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,630
- Sorry, Ida.
- It's fine.

331
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,770
And thank you.

332
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,080
It made me happy when you said you'd go talk to Mr. Okano.

333
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,630
Really?

334
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,900
But what should we do with him?

335
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,930
Let's see... should we just leave him here?

336
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,070
Ida, you're heartless.

337
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,080
It was a joke.

338
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,740
I was a little ticked off, too.

339
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,110
What?

340
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,750
Wh-What was that?

341
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,190
Nothing. I was just thinking about how kind you are.

342
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,280
Really? I'm not kind.

343
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,920
Ida always stars at me like that.

344
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,950
He's getting heavy. Maybe I should leave him in a random place.

345
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,590
[This drama is a work of fiction]

346
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,790
Should we go somewhere together?
[Next Episode]
[The wished-for first date!]

347
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,310
When you give a cake to the person you like,
your love will be fulfilled.
[A love-fulfilling winter event draws near]

348
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,900
Is it the same as the way Aoki likes you?

349
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,710
He's never told me he likes me.

350
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,590
You don't want to date me sincerely, do you?

351
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,680
You'll find out everything about their first love on a special episode on December 4th.
