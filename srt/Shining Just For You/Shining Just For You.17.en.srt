[Episode 17]

15
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,420
But there have been words going around the court

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,250
saying that while Bai Lu is proficient in astrology

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,330
and competent in her work,

18
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,720
Your Majesty's fondness for her

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,780
has exceeded that of an emperor and a subject.

20
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,220
If Your Majesty favors her romantically,

21
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,300
perhaps you should make her part of your harem

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,950
to prevent the officials from speculating

23
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,940
and risk damaging your reputation.

Who is saying such things?

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,750
We all share the same thought.

26
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,680
You shouldn't delve too much into it.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,600
You're the first one to make speculations, Fan Ruhui.

28
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,690
I merely share the same concern.

29
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,670
Bai Lu will not enter the harem.

30
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,100
I just want to treat her kindly.

31

Ruhui, if I don't trust you,

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,700
I wouldn't ask you to handle the royal court.

37
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,630
And I wouldn't ask you to look after Tianqi,

38
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,900

39

40
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,270
You should focus on the royal court.

41
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,170
Don't overthink.

42
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,420
And don't ever think that my preference for Bai Lu

43
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,060
will pose a threat to your position.

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,640
I don't even need to use Bai Lu

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,270

You're a wise ruler, Your Majesty.

47

I dare not deceive you.

48
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,860
I am wary of Bai Lu

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,010
because my son, Fan Zheng, is on bad terms with Bai Lu.

50
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,560
As a father, I wish to protect my son.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,290
I'm worried that if Bai Lu earns your favor,

52
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,320
she will exact vengeance on my son.

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,270

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,330
No need to confess.

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,800
Uncle, I do not think that we should act recklessly now.

168
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
[Cai Chen, Son of Cai Can's Second Brother]

169
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,180
Fan Ruhui is getting more powerful by the day.

170
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,720
We do not yet know what his goal is.

171
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,020
Uncle, we need to remain calm.

172
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,100
Where is the Zhongzhou Army?

173
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,790
Your Majesty.

174
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,530
Our 30,000 troops are stationed outside the city.

175
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,210
Another 30,000 have also been mobilized

176
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,610
and are coming from Ju City.

177
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,940
What? Who said you could act on your own?

178
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,050
We have 60,000 soldiers.

179
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,510
Fan Ruhui mentioned in his letter that Yu Xiuming only brought 2,000 imperial soldiers with him.

180
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,670
He won't be able to defeat us even if he receives help from a Truth Master.

181
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,560
We are willing to serve you, Your Majesty.

182
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,830
Reclaim what is rightfully Cai's.

183
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,010
We will serve Your Majesty and unify the world.

184
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,560
We will serve Your Majesty and unify the world!

185
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,410
Everyone here thinks we have the victory.

186
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,900
But the emperor's military tactic is secretive, to say the least.

187
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,300
Who knows if he has any backup plan?

188
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,840
Cai Chen is right.

189
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,990
Once our army enters Zhenxia Mountain

190
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,390
and severs all ingresses,

191
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,320
then it's either he dies or I die.

192
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,100
My life is yours, Your Majesty!

193
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,260
Old Master, I just received the news

194
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,590
that Cai Can has asked his subordinates to assemble the army.

195
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,930
I suppose they are on the move now.

196
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,480
Tell your people to get rid of all traces.

197
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,740
Don't let anyone find out we sent a letter to Cai Can.

198
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,340
Don't worry, Old Master.

199
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,540
[Temporary Palace]

200
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,040
I am Cai Chen, Director of Chuzhou under Zhongzhou's jurisdiction. Greetings, Your Majesty.

201
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,900
Greetings, Your Majesty!

202
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,100
Where is Cai Can?

203
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,750
Allow me to apologize on behalf of the Protectorate General of Zhongzhou.

204
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,280
Zhongzhou is rife with bandits.

205
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,680
In case they threaten Your Majesty's safety, he is now leading an army to raid their hideout.

206
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,010
He thus relegated the reception to me.

207
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,480
Rife with bandits? And why is that?

208
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,360
At ease.

209
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,100
Thanks, Your Majesty.

210
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,500
You are Cai Can's nephew?

211
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,200
Yes, I am Cai Chen.

212
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,080
My father is Cai Can's second brother.

213
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,470
I remember you.

214
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,010
I have read your memorandum.

215
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,460
The Cangjin Jade Mine in Jiuyu Mountain.

216
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,690
It was you who found it, wasn't it?

217
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,010
It's just a trivial matter. I am surprised to hear that you still remember it.

218
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,430
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

219
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,980
Zhongzhou Protectorate and Liaoyang ministers are organizing a reception banquet for Your Majesty.

220
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,470
On behalf of the Protectorate General, I would like to invite you cordially.

221
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,660
I don't think it's Cai Can's handwriting.

222
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,060
Your Majesty, the Protectorate General asked me to write it.

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,620
All right now. No need to coddle me.

224
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,260
I know Cai Can doesn't have this level of mindfulness.

225
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,100
If a banquet has been held, I shall attend it.

226
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,260
But please remind your uncle

227
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,860
that Zhongzhou has been owing the royal court its annual tribute.

228
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,760
And don't beg Fan Ruhui for mercy this time around.

229
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,620
Of course.

230
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,800
[Temporary Palace]

231
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,640
The Zhongzhou Protectorate

232
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,700
and Liaoyang ministers have prepared a simple banquet to welcome Your Majesty.

233
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,060
Greetings, Your Majesty!

234
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,680
I came because I miss home.

235
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,820
I know Zhongzhou is proud of its picturesque nature,

236
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,980
but I do not intend to stay here for long.

237
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,440
I shall leave tomorrow.

238
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,140
Noted.

239
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,300
All right. At ease.

240
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,420
Thanks, Your Majesty!

241
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,120
Your Majesty, your southbound trip will bring honor to your hometown.

242
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,260
Allow me to propose a toast to you.

243
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,520
May your governance last for an eternity.

244
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,480
Come. Bring them here.

245
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes, sir!

246
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,020
Your Majesty,

247
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,200
a souvenir for you from the officials in Zhongzhou.

248
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
They are a brush, inkstone, and a book box

249
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,900
made from the Cangjin Jade in Jiuyu Mountain.

250
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,020
They say documents kept in jade containers like these

251
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,980
can last for a millennium.

252
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,520
Do you like them, Your Majesty?

253
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,900
What the heck are these?

254
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,180
I am a warrior.

255
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,320
Delicate but impractical things

256
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,740
are for spoiled noblemen like you who seek the ideal of elegance.

257
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,860
I don't have a use for them.

258
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,440
Your Majesty, your unification of the nine states should be sung forever.

259
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,640
We know hardly any treasures in this world will be able to please you,

260
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,180
but we still wish to convey our gratitude.

261
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,720
Lying truly flows within Cai blood.

262
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,880
Gratitude, you said?

263
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,840
Our laws forbid forced labor,

264
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,140
but to mine Cangjin Jade, you imposed a harsh taxation system.

265
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,100
People who can't afford to pay their taxes are required to work in the mine.

266
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,580
And that's why Zhongzhou is in turmoil and it's rife with bandits.

267
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,200
Do you even respect the laws of Chao or me?

268
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,280
Your Majesty, I do not harbor this intention.

269
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,320
I have no idea about the forced labor in Jiuyu Mountain.

270
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,460
You have no idea?

271
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,120
Ling Yun.

272
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,080
Tell him whose pocket the money went to.

274
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,580
Wo Wu, an ex-official in Zhongzhou.

275
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,980
He was almost beheaded for releasing those laborers.

276
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,880
He then escaped to Tianqi to seek justice.

277
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,400
According to him, the Cangjin Jade was sold for more than 100,000 gold zhu.

278
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,390
All of which went to Protectorate Cai's residence

279
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,960
to forge weapons and to recruit soldiers.

280
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,000
Your Majesty, if my life is what you want,

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
just issue an edict.

282
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I will gladly accept my death.

283
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,100
Why would you buy into someone else's lie

284
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,400
and accuse me wrongly so?

285
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,400
If I wanted to take your life,

286
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
I wouldn't need a reason.

287
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,400
I did all this today to show you...

288
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,200
that I know what you and your cohorts are up to.

289
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,000
This is a warning from me.

290
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,700
If you make the same mistake again,

291
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,200
I will punish you right away.

292
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,200
Ling Yun,

293
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,800
is the divine hall of Zhenxia Mountain still there?

294
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,700
Yes.

295
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,000
It is still standing firm.

296
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
You mentioned the sights in Zhenxia Mountain in Tianqi,

297
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,200
so I had people investigate it prior.

298
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Well done.

299
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,500
Let's head to Zhenxia Mountain now.

300
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,540
Noted.

301
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
You're all dismissed.

302
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Prepare to attack.

303
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,600
How did they build a divine hall

304
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,400
on a precipitous mountain like this?

305
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,800
I heard it was the Heluo Clan on Mount Beimang

306
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
who prepared the stones

307
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,800
before delivering them one by one.

308
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,800
The stones here might look plain,

309
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
but they contain gold inside.

310
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
They do?

311
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,300
How is it, Bai Lu?

312
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,400
You have never seen a divine hall like this, have you?

313
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Never.

314
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,700
You seem to be familiar with this place.

315
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,800
How about it?

316
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,000
You have stayed here before?

317
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,200
I have fought many wars in Zhongzhou,

318
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,600
so I am well-acquainted with the geography of Zhongzhou.

319
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,000
And this place is no exception.

320
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,400
Your Majesty,

321
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,100
Zhenxia Mountain is dangerous, with only one exit.

322
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
In case we are besieged here,

323
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,000
we should split the imperial army and have them camp by the foot of the mountain.

324
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,700
The path to the mountain is dangerous.

325
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,900
Let them camp right there.

326
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
Noted.

327
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,800
What is on your mind?

328
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
Nothing.

329
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,700
It's just that you are acting weird today.

330
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,400
How so?

331
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,000
I can't put it into words.

332
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,800
I think you're just exhausted from the trip.

333
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
You should go to bed early today.

334
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,800
Thanks, Your Majesty.

335
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Why are the ants here carrying brick powder?

336
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,300
Glutinous rice powder?

337
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Glutinous rice powder dissolves in water

338
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,500
and can be used as a field ration.

339
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,300
- Official Bai.
- General Cao.

340
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,200
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

341
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm taking a stroll because I can't sleep.

342
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,060
It's bleak here and it scares me.

343
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,020
Official Bai, worry not.

344
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,600
Although the mountain is bleak,

345
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
the imperial army is guarding the place.

346
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,600
Please put your mind to rest.

347
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,400
Where is General Xie? I want to talk to him.

348
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
General Xie?

349
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
I did not run into him after I left Tianqi City.

350
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Is there anything, Official Bai? You can talk to me.

351
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,800
Everything is unusual.

352
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,200
Yu Xiuming attended a banquet in armor.

353
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Then, he came to this divine hall that shoehorns him into a defensive position.

354
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,800
Official Bai, is there something wrong?

355
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,400
Unless...

356
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Report!

357
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,600
Sir, there is an invasion.

358
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,300
How many of them? From where?

359
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,300
It's a sea of enemies. I can't possibly count.

360
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,500
Among the cavalry, only I managed to escape.

361
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,300
The enemy is carrying the Cai banner.

362
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,300
- Continue scouting.
- Noted.

363
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,400
Your Majesty.

364
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Ling Yun, what is the situation?

365
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,800
The Yangwei Division of the imperial army put up a great fight,

366
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,800
but they were outnumbered and suffered many casualties.

367
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Their morale is low.

368
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,500
Where is Xie Yu'an?

369
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,900
No news about him yet.

370
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,300
I thought he would arrive when Cai Can reached halfway up the mountain.

371
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,800
We can then subdue everyone.

372
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
He has always been a reliable person.

373
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Something must have come up.

374
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,900
We know nothing about our enemy.

375
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,400
But judging from the situation, their number should be several times ours.

376
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,800
The imperial army did not set up defenses by the foot of the mountain.

377
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,400
We can't break out with just a few thousand of us.

378
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,300
Where is the nearest encampment? How long will they arrive?

379
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,400
As for the nearest encampments, although their commanders do not side with Cai Can,

380
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,800
they must have been taken over by others.

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,500
Other encampments further than that are too far for us since we have no food here.

382
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
I see.

383
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,400
All of you are dismissed.

384
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
- All right.
- All right.

385
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,900
Bai Lu.

386
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,000
Stay here.

387
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,560
Your Majesty,

388
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,800
if General Cao is right

389
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,100
and we are outnumbered with no backup in sight,

390
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
we need to come up with a solution.

391
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
Bai Lu,

392
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,400
do you fear death?

393
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,700
I...

394
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,500
I do.

395
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,800
Now, you're honest.

396
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,600
Do you know Cai Can well?

397
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I do.

398
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,000
At the end of the previous dynasty,

399
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
the Cai Clan grew influential among the ministers.

400
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,900
Cai Can then ascended to the throne.

401
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,100
Many people thought he could overthrow the Xian Dynasty,

402
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,600
but your army rose from nowhere

403
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,000
and defeated Cai Can in one fell swoop.

404
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,400
But as to the assassination you mentioned...

405
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
That, I do not know.

406
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Seven years ago,

407
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I conquered 11 cities under Cai's rule in a row.

408
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,100
Cai Can was forced to surrender.

409
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,600
But when I arrived at Liaoyang,

410
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,800
he asked his guard commander to assassinate me.

411
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,000
It was a piercing arrow,

412
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,100
laced with a potent poison.

413
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,800
If someone else was at my spot,

414
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,500
he would have been dead.

415
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,700
I see.

416
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Cai Can was still powerful back then,

417
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,800
so you couldn't retaliate blatantly.

418
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,400
The guard commander was but another scapegoat.

419
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,800
For many years,

420
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,400
you two got along in mutual respect,

421
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,500
but in fact, you two were plotting something in secret

422
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
and were wary of each other. Right?

423
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
Yes.

424
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,400
I have been trying to sway his previous followers.

425
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,600
Cai Can hates me to the core.

426
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,500
The person Qihai Lian met, Huo Lo.

427
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,600
He used to work for Cai Can.

428
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,700
I was planning to use this tour of inspection to test him.

429
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,200
But I was careless.

430
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,000
I gave him a golden opportunity instead.

431
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,900
I suppose this is my end.

432
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
But aren't you immortal?

433
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Do you know what this is?

434
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,500
This dagger is called Zhuoyun.

435
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,400
It is said to contain the power to disrupt the galaxy.

436
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,400
It is the only weapon that can kill me.

437
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,800
If you bring my head to him,

438
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,300
you may still live.

439
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,800
When Cai Can is here,

440
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,000
none of the people beside me will be spared.

441
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,100
So?

442
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
If...

443
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,200
If he manages to reach here,

444
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,400
I will kill myself with this dagger.

445
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,000
If he's able to kill you,

446
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,500
he'll be able to kill me easily, am I right?

447
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,400
You want to die with me?

448
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Hurry up.

449
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
- General Li.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,200
Is this the only path?

451
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
General, this is the only way.

452
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
How long do you need to repair it?

453
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,600
Four to five days.

454
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Attention!

455
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,400
Repair the path before us at once.

456
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,800
His Majesty needs us to be in Zhenxia Mountain in three days.

457
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,500
Yes, sir!

458
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,000
Look. We're here now.

459
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,100
Cai Can and his troops are over here and here.

460
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
What do you think we should do?

461
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,400
The Zhongzhou Army here

462
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,800
is the Frontline Army of the Five Armies.

463
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,600
Cai Can is the commander of the Frontline Army,

464
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,800
but...

465
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,000
you still command the Five Armies.

466
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
Does that mean...

467
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,300
someone within the Frontline Army might still be loyal to you

468
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,200
and is just pretending to be obeying Cai Can?

469
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,800
There is.

470
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,300
Then maybe we can write to Wanzhou

471
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,100
and ask them to intervene.

472
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,600
We can't write a letter.

473
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,600
We can't write because a military coup to help an emperor in danger is a crime.

474
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,000
So even those loyal to you cannot act freely.

475
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,500
The one who's after me now can be the Yangwei Division or the Winged Guards.

476
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,600
It can be Ling Yun or you.

477
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,200
Without the military token,

478
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,900
no one will make a move.

479
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,000
So you want to descend and get help alone.

480
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,500
And Cai Can cannot know this.

481
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,400
I see. I will stay here and keep Cai Can at bay.

482
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,600
Okay.

483
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,700
When you have finished admiring the view here,

484
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,500
I will be here with backup.

485
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,900
- Ling Yun.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
I had this armor made for you.

487
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,700
So you predicted that I would stay here to defend

488
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,800
and you even prepared armor for me.

489
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,600
I will put it on you myself to make it up to you.

490
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,000
Official Bai, let us help you get changed.

491
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,000
Your Majesty, I can do it.

492
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,200
This is my first time helping someone put on armor.

493
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,300
Make me look good at least.

494
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,300
Now that you have it on,

495
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,600
make sure you live.

496
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,800
♫ Maybe I should continue to squander my life away ♫

497
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,600
♫ Or maybe once you leave, there'll be no more news of you ♫

498
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,600
♫ I had witnessed the grand fireworks several times,
flashing in the air ♫

499
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,700
♫ I had witnessed several beautiful sunsets ♫

500
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,400
You look like a female general in my armor.

501
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
What if I leave you here and not come back?

502
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,800
Impossible.

503
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,500
You unified the world and never lost a battle.

504
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,600
You won't abandon us here because of one Cai Can.

505
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,900
Good. Well said.

506
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,000
But this time, it's not just because of that.

507
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,800
It's because when I promise you something,

508
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,600
I will deliver it.

509
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,800
I won't break my promise.

510
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
♫ A cold and lonely moonlight that dissipates
with the night breeze ♫

511
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
♫ I'm willing to lie in your arms ♫

512
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,100
♫ So, I was gazing at the nearest distance all along ♫

513
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:36,800
♫ Pouring everything into your heart ♫

514
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
General Cao.

515
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Director Bai.

516
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,900
What is the current situation?

517
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,600
The Zhongzhou Army is relentless in its advance.

518
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,200
I just sent a trap specialist from the Yangwei Division

519
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
to lay traps down the mountain for the eventual defense.

520
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
Don't call them Zhongzhou Army anymore.

521
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If they serve Cai Can, they are the rebel army.

522
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
Ask our soldiers to yell this loud and clear.

523
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,400
Tell the enemy that His Majesty is ready to pardon soldiers who wish to quit the rebel army.

524
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
And if they kill an enemy, they will be promoted two ranks above.

525
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Will it work?

526
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Cai Can must have mobilized his most trusted men here.

527
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
The commanders are loyal to him,

528
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,600
but the lieutenants and the soldiers aren't necessarily.

529
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,000
If we can cast doubt on 30% of them,

530
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,700
we can defend for another two to four hours.

531
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,600
Okay.

532
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,100
Thank you.

533
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
We have suffered huge losses

534
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,500
and soldiers have lost the will to fight.

535
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,100
We might not be able to last till tomorrow.

536
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
I need to figure out a solution.

537
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
Director Bai.

538
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,900
Commander Feng.

539
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Why are you here?

540
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,800
His Majesty asked me to stay here to protect you.

541
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,600
So, he is in danger now?

542
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,700
His Majesty just told me that his path was blocked by boulders.

543
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,500
He wants me to take you away.

544
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,000
But what about this place?

545
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,400
You're not a soldier.

546
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
You do not need to defend the land

547
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
nor die with the imperial army.

548
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,300
I can't leave.

549
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
I have been with them for this long already.

550
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
There is camaraderie. I cannot abandon them here.

551
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,000
Director Bai, you...

552
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
If you have the time,

553
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,600
can you help me improve the soldiers' morale?

554
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,000
Maybe that will buy us more time.

555
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,200
But the task given to me by His Majesty is to protect your safety.

556
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
If the rebel army is gone, I will be safe.

557
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,400
All right.

558
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,100
I will do my best and fulfill your request.

559
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,800
That's right.

560
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
But when the rebel army reaches here,

561
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
you have to follow my order.

562
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
We'll see.

563
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
Help me do this, too.

564
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,400
Come.

565
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,400
Official Bai, tell us the truth already.

566
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,600
We fought for a day,

567
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,000
but we haven't seen His Majesty.

568
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,100
Where is he? Has he left?

569
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,300
- Exactly.
- Has he left?

570
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Official Bai, tell us the truth.

571
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Official Bai.

572
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,400
His Majesty...

573
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
did leave the mountain this morning.

574
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,000
Our duty is to protect His Majesty.

575
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,100
- If he is gone, we can retreat, can't we?
- Indeed.

576
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,500
Why should we stay here? This is just a meaningless battle.

577
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,700
We can't leave.

578
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,400
If we do, the seditious Cai will attack Tianqi right away.

579
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,500
By then, the people of Tianqi will be caught in the crossfire.

580
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Your families are going to be implicated!

581
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,700
But we can't defend this place for long.

582
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,600
- Exactly.
- We can't.

583
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,100
- We don't want to die.
- We want to live, Official Bai.

584
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,200
Therefore, we're not fighting for His Majesty.

585
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,800
We're fighting for ourselves.

586
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,600
We're fighting for our lives!

587
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,800
We're fighting for our families!

588
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,600
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

589
