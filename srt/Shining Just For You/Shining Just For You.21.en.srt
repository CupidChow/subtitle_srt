00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,400
You don't have to come so early since you are busy at work.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,900
It's your wedding.

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,100
Of course, I have to come early.

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,600
A'Rui would be really happy

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
if she got to see this, too.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,600
Maybe one day,

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
you'll find the right man, too.

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Then, you'll understand why I'm doing this.

00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400

Since you're already here,

38
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,700
why don't you join them?

39
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,000
Your Majesty, you didn't join them yourself.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm afraid I'll steal the groom's show if I head there.

41
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
This is great.

42
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Sister Lian can finally marry the person she loves.

43
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
You don't need to be envious of Qihai Lian.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
In the future,

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
you'll definitely have a grander wedding than her.

46
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,100
I know that all girls in the world

47
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,300
wish to have a grand wedding.

48
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,100
But that isn't what I want.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,200
What do you want then?

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,300
Your Majesty, you possess plenty of things.

51
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,600
However, I don't want much.

52
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
If Your Majesty insists on asking,

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
I just wish to return to the days

54
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,000
when I was together with A'Rui.

55
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,500
You wish to return to the past?

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Even I cannot do that,

57
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,000
not to mention you.

58
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
These should be enough, right?

59
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
I never expected you to gather that many Ice Crystals.

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
But you better think twice. If you activate the magic array, it will...

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
Magic array?

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Official Bai, what magic array is he talking about?

63
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Cheng Wu, stand guard in the front yard.

64
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Do not let anyone come in.

65
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
This time, even if His Majesty comes, I won't let him in.

66
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
That's right.

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
- See you.
- Go now.

68
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,900
Qingheng, I received news from the court.

69
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
They intend to collect extra tax from Yuezhou.

70
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Extra tax?

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How much?

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,800
Not sure yet.

73
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,200
But from what I know,

74
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
they said it might be an extra 50%.

75
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
50%?

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
What should we do?

77
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Qingheng, do you think we should ask Bai Lu

78
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
to plead with His Majesty for us?

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I'll give it a try.

80
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Have you made up your mind?

81
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,800
Yes.

82
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,700
Director Bai is observing the stars.

83
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,000
No one is to interrupt her.

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
But this is an emergency.

85
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
You have to be careful and return safely.

86
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,110
This dagger? The Snow Wolf King?

87
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I came back! I've returned to Yebei!

88
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
Yezi!

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,900
Are you okay?

90
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,800
A'Rui? This time, she's real.

91
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Yezi.

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A'Rui!

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Are you okay?

94
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I'm fine.

95
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,800
What's wrong with you today?

96
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm fine.

97
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
It's you?

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How dare you kill the Wolf God of Yebei!

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was me.

100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,400
Stop!

101
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,600
Tend to Prince Miao Li's wound immediately.

102
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,700
Who exactly are you?

103
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,500
Why did you commit such a brutal act in Yebei?

104
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,400
I don't care who you are!

105
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,600
How dare you hurt our prince!

106
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
General!

107
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Kill the cursed woman! She killed the Snow Wolf King!

108
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
I can't afford to let them pin the blame on me again for the Snow Wolf King's death.

109
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Someone!

110
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,200
Stop!

111
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Luo Wuyi.

112
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,600
His Majesty hasn't spoken yet.

113
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,000
What gives you the right to speak?

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
- You...
- Precisely! What gives you the right to capture Yezi?

115
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,400
What gives you the right to say that Yezi is a cursed woman?

116
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,600
Your Majesty, I didn't kill the Snow Wolf King.

117
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,000
It was him.

118
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,700
Do you guys dare to kill him?

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,900
You guys may get away with bullying me.

120
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,800
But the Snow Wolf King is a sacred symbol of Yebei.

121
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Even so, you guys are pinning the blame on me.

122
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
Aren't you afraid the Snow Wolf King might become enraged?

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
You! You're spouting nonsense!

124
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
- You're the one spouting nonsense!
- You're bewitching them!

125
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
You're the one bewitching them!

126
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
You only dare bully me!

127
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,900
Why don't you bully the general from Chao?

128
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

129
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Are you scared?

130
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
What a coward.

131
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,500
General Xie, you saved me just now.

132
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,200
Logically speaking, I should thank you.

133
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
However,

134
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,400
you've killed the Snow Wolf King of Yebei.

135
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,200
Please pardon me as I cannot bow to you.

136
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Don't mention it.

137
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
The heroes of Yebei are something else.

138
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
All of you are seasoned veterans,

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
yet you guys are bullying a little girl.

140
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Seems like you guys cannot tell right from wrong at all.

141
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,400
What an eye-opener.

142
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,800
Miss, you're a girl,

143
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,000
but you're braver and more decisive

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
than most of the men here.

145
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,400
It's my first time encountering a girl like you.

146
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
This is a token of Chao.

147
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
If you take it,

148
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,700
I'll fulfill one request of yours.

149
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,000
I can kill whoever you want me to kill.

150
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Will you keep your promise?

151
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Naturally. I'm a man of my word.

152
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,300
General Xie, since you admire her,

153
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,000
I will let her off.

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,100
Although the Snow Wolf King has appeared,

155
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,800
General Xie, it died because of you.

156
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,400
This might be the destiny of Yebei.

157
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Please come to our tent

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
so that we can welcome the envoy of Chao.

159
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please.

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
After you.

161
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,700
Yezi, you're fine now.

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
It's fine.

163
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,600
A'Rui, this time, I'll definitely protect you.

164
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,200
I wonder why they're here.

165
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
They seem like troublemakers.

166
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
Aren't you curious about the topic they'll talk about?

167
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,300
Should we eavesdrop on their conversation?

168
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,900
A'Rui! You cannot go.

169
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,200
They came all the way here from Chao to marry the princess.

170
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Promise me that you'll listen to me.

171
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,700
Yezi, you're hurting me.

172
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,200
I cannot allow A'Rui to go.

173
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,000
Yezi, did you dream about this too?

174
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,100
A'Rui, listen to me.

175
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Yebei will experience a major change soon.

176
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,200
We will change, too.

177
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Yezi, what do you mean by that?

178
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
Anyway, just listen to me.

179
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,800
After that,

180
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,300
we'll have a bonfire celebration to attend tonight. Right?

181
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,600
That's right.

182
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I've been looking forward to it for a long time.

183
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
But I need to go to my mother first.

184
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,400
Sure.

185
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
A'Rui.

186
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Well... Can you prepare a dress for me?

187
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Yezi, you're actually dolling yourself up now?

188
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
I...

189
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,300
In the past, you didn't listen to me

190
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,200
when I told you to wear them.

191
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Tell me then. Who are you wearing them for?

192
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,600
Don't tell me you fell for that general?

193
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
That won't do.

194
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

195
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,700
Can we really travel to the past with this?

196
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
In your opinion,

197
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,600
what is time?

198
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,500
Time is like flowing water,

199
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,600
flowing back and forth.

200
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
Returning to the past

201
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,300
is the action of going against the flow of time itself.

202
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,000
That's what laymen would think.

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
But this time-traveling passage is more exquisite.

204
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
Using the energy provided by the Ice Crystals,

205
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,900
the time-traveling passage can form an artificial time passage.

206
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,500
In this artificial time passage,

207
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,600
people can choose the time they want to return to.

208
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,400
However, the flow of time within the passage is different from reality.

209
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,300
And it's unpredictable.

210
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,600
It cannot be controlled by people.

211
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Just now, I saw the magic array lighting up.

212
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
Was it activated?

213
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
This is only the first step.

214
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,100
Next, it all depends on what she wants to do.

215
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,700
A'Rui died on the journey to her wedding.

216
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
This time, I will not let her

217
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,000
get on the wedding carriage no matter what.

218
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,200
For A'Rui's sake and for our sake,

219
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Yu Xiuming, you have to fall for me sooner this time.

220
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,800
Yezi.

221
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
A'Rui, you're here?

222
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,700
You actually did your own makeup?

223
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Goodness.

224
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,800
Yezi, you look so pretty.

225
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Since when did you become so good at dolling yourself up?

226
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,000
Stop teasing me.

227
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,200
So, have you brought the dress here?

228
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
It's here.

229
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,900
Take a look.

230
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,200
How is it? Does it look good on me?

231
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
This color suits you perfectly.

232
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,700
Let's go and dance later.

233
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,800
I want everyone to see

234
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400
how beautiful you are.

235
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,000
Princess Rui, join our dance.

236
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Come on!

237
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
Go now.

238
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
Come on!

239
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
Join us!

240
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,100
Let's drink.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
General Xie,

242
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,500
this is Spring of Yebei, the best liquor in Yebei.

243
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,800
Here. It's too strong.

244
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,400
You wish to drink with me?

245
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
That's right.

246
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Can't I?

247
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,400
I never expected us to drink together.

248
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,000
I've admired you for a long time. It's my honor to drink with you.

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,600
You always said you've admired me for a long time.

250
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Could it be that you knew me long ago?

251
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,000
General, I don't know you well.

252
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
However, the admiration I mentioned

253
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
is for the Emperor of Chao.

254
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,600
General Xie, you and your 3,000 Lanyi Army are renowned around the world.

255
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,000
However, no matter how strong your army is,

256
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
you're just a sharp blade.

257
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,000
However, the key to eliminating your enemies

258
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,100
lies on the blade wielder.

259
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,000
His Majesty is the blade wielder.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
Although His Majesty is the blade wielder,

261
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,500
it also depends on the way he wields the blade.

262
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,600
Maybe it's because...

263
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm a sharp blade.

264
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
General, no matter how well-made you are,

265
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,000
you'll be useless if His Majesty doesn't know how to wield you.

266
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
His Majesty was a commoner.

267
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,400
However, he has assimilated five clans over the past few decades.

268
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,000
Since he can take over the world,

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
that means he has more than just a good blade.

270
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,000
It's because of his impressive strategies.

271
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,700
General, you came to Yebei

272
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,400
to propose to our princess. Right?

273
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
That's a state secret.

274
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,000
Please pardon me as I cannot make any comments.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,300
General, you don't need to worry.

276
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,800
It's not like someone leaked the secret to me.

277
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,500
I found out through divination.

278
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I was born with this ability.

279
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,000
I can predict the future.

280
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,900
I never expected you to be able to predict the future.

281
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,600
Since you're so capable,

282
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
why do the people of Yebei detest you?

283
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,800
All right, then.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,200
Find a random person and prove to me

285
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,000
that you have the ability to predict the future.

286
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,600
Sure.

287
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
- Look at that person.
- Come on, let's dance together.

288
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,900
He will surely pick on me.

289
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
You don't need to predict that.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Most of the people here want to pick on you.

291
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
But he won't succeed.

292
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Not only that, but he'll also give me a vat of liquor.

293
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,900
- Come on.
- Chu Ye!

294
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's drink together.

295
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,300
Harbinger of disaster,

296
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
you're so close with the general of Chao.

297
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
Are you trying to betray us?

298
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
Chu Ye! Don't spout nonsense.

299
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
This world belongs to Chao.

300
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Chu Ye, how dare you say that in front of General Xie.

301
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,700
That's very inappropriate.

302
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,300
But if you beg me,

303
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,800
I will consider pleading with General Xie for you.

304
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,600
If not, King Qihai will punish you as you've offended

305
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,700
our precious guest from Chao.

306
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,200
- Screw you!
- Chu Ye!

307
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
You're drunk.

308
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
General Xie, the men of Yebei are brutes.

309
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
This is the best liquor we have.

310
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Here, please enjoy it.

311
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
- Let's go.
- I...

312
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Let's go.

313
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,500
See?

314
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Although I don't know why it happened,

315
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,700
I know...

316
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,600
that certain things will happen.

317
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,300
I think Qihai Zhenyu is foolish for treating you

318
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,300
as a harbinger of disaster.

319
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,400
You cannot blame him.

320
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,000
People always fear people with strange powers.

321
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,880
They're also afraid that bad prophecies will come true.

322
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,620
That's why they see me as a harbinger of disaster.

323
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,180
You do have a point.

324
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,160
Back then, when I was still a lowly soldier,

325
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,580
someone tried to suppress me when they saw what I was capable of.

326
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm afraid that person is already dead.

327
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,720
He must've died from his own ignorance.

328
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,380
General.

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm grateful to you when they saw what I was capable of.

330
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,920
Also,

331
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,500
I do have a favor to ask.

332
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,180
What is it? Tell me about it.

333
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,200
General, please help me to become the Empress of Chao.

334
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,720
I didn't expect you to be so ambitious.

335
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
General,

336
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
it's not that I'm ambitious.

337
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
I...

338
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,300
I admire the Emperor of Chao.

339
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,300
If I cannot marry His Majesty,

340
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,140
I might regret it for the rest of my life.

341
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,740
However, he'll also regret it if he misses me.

342
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,580
All right. I will help you out.

343
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,200
However, this is a huge favor.

344
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,460
How do you intend to repay me?

345
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,420
General, just tell me whatever you want.

346
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,360
I want you to spend the night with me.

347
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,580
General... I've already told you

348
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,600
that I admire His Majesty.

349
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,160
I will only spend the night with him.

350
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Who told you to spend the night with me?

351
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,800
I want you to spend the night drinking with me.

352
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,140
All right. Here.

353
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,920
This place is too crowded.

354
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,000
Let's drink somewhere else.

355
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,580
This is Yebei.

356
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,560
If you want to go somewhere else,

357
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,720
I should be leading the way.

358
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
Let's go.

359
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,740
The night sky of Yebei is indeed brighter than Tianqi's.

360
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,140
Is it because of the view in Yebei?

361
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,520
Is that why His Majesty is trying to marry the fairest lady in Yebei?

362
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,940
His Majesty only wants peace.

363
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,920
His Majesty is requesting

364
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,660
a marriage alliance because he's tired of witnessing war.

365
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,000
It has nothing to do with one's appearance.

366
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,420
If His Majesty seeks peace,

367
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,460
I can assist His Majesty to make Yebei pledge their allegiance to him.

368
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,280
I can do so as long as he stops hurting the person I love.

369
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,060
Is that okay?

370
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,160
The person you love?

371
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,540
If so, between her and His Majesty,

372
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,320
who do you care for the most?

373
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,440
♫ I had witnessed the bright fireworks several
times flashing in the air ♫

374
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,360
I can only live with a clear conscience if she stays alive.

375
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,740
I've already agreed to marry the Emperor of Chao.

376
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,560
It's not unreasonable for me to request him to protect my friends. Right?

377
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,120
As long as the bigger picture is untouched,

378
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,720
of course he can protect your friends.

379
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,710
- It's a deal then.
- Yes. It's a deal.

380
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,900
Here.

381
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,440
♫ Wandering and being lonely for most of my life,
but you came into my life and changed everything ♫

382
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,100
♫ You're my ups and downs ♫

383
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,440
♫ A cold and lonely moonlight ♫

384
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,060
I have a secret to tell you.

385
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,520
Do you wish to hear me out?

386
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
What secret?

387
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,380
I'll tell you about the kind of person the Emperor of Chao is in my heart.

388
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,440
He's someone intelligent and can devise many strategies.

389
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,900
He's amazing.

390
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,200
No matter the kind of person he wants

391
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,060
or the things he wants to achieve, he can do them all.

392
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:53,320
Say, he's so charming.

393
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,860
How could anyone not fall for him?

394
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,260
♫ It started as ripples and slowly turned into waves ♫

395
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,360
So, I was the person in your heart.

396
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,920
You're only willing to tell me the truth when we're here.

397
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,900
I told you before...

398
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,800
that I would make you my empress.

399
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,120
You mustn't go back on your words.

400
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,840
Bai Lu, don't wake me up.

401
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,740
What did you call me?

402
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,800
Bai Lu.

403
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,220
I didn't expect us to drink together.

404
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,980
Are you Yu Xiuming?

405
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,780
Didn't you find out last night?

406
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,180
You're not the Yu Xiuming that's from this time zone. You are...

407
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm the Emperor of Chao who came all the way to this snowy place

408
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,820
to protect you and drink with you.

409
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,300
What kind of sorcery is this?

410
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,380
Where did you send Bai Lu?

411
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,720
This has nothing to do with me.

412
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,540
She invented the magic array herself.

413
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,940
She bought the Ice Crystals, too.

414
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,840
I tried to persuade her to stop.

415
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Don't tell me this is a time-traveling passage?

416
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,800
She's bent on returning to the time before the Battle of Yebei so that she can save Princess Zhuyan.

417
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,300
She wouldn't heed my advice.

418
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,420
How many secrets are you guys hiding from me?

419
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,060
I didn't know she would do this.

420
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,360
Let me go after her. We can't just leave her alone.

421
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,960
Stop right there!

422
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,860
It's not what you should do.

423
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,600
Your Majesty!

424
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,580
I should've expected that long ago.

425
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,500
My plan would never progress this smoothly.

426
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,400
You don't need to belittle yourself.

427
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,100
Doesn't that mean you were watching me when I was embarrassing myself?

428
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,120
Was it that fun for you?

429
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,500
You didn't embarrass yourself.

430
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,120
Greetings, My Lord.

431
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,480
The Emperor of Chao is granting the Mirror of Youth to the fairest lady in the world.

432
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,220
She is also the future empress of Chao.

433
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,060
May the two states never fight again.

434
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,700
What...

435
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,500
What do you mean by this?

436
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:19,520
That means she's going to Chao and be our empress.

437
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,640
But why? Yezi doesn't want to marry that old man.

438
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,940
A'Rui, mind your manners.

439
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,380
General Xie, Ye Lingshuang isn't a princess of Yebei.

440
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,140
Is it appropriate for her to marry His Majesty?

441
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,160
If so, King Qihai, who do you think is a better choice?

442
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,720
The Emperor of Chao dictates whether the candidate is suitable or not.

443
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,890
All right.

444
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,280
Excellent.

445
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,880
We will prepare lavish gifts and send Ye Lingshuang off

446
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,200
like a princess.

447
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,900
Father!

448
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,320
How could you guys decide everything on Yezi's behalf?

449
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,680
She has no right to say no.

450
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,920
How so?

451
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,140
Yezi, are you willing to do so?

452
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,100
My Lord.

453
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,540
A'Rui...

454
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,220
I'm willing to do so.

455
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,200
Go inside.

456
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,780
Yes, sir.

457
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,180
General Xie, here's some fresh milk tea for you.

458
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,520
Thank you.

459
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,620
General, please.

460
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,760
Didn't you say it's milk tea? But this is liquor.

461
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,180
Your Majesty, I'm proposing a toast...

462
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,320
to you for keeping your promise.

463
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,160
Actually, I came here...

464
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,820
to make good on my promise.

465
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,900
Since when did you make a promise to me?

466
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,800
Did you forget? It was that day.

467
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Didn't I tell you that I was okay with the Emperor of Chao, too?

468
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,060
Have you truly made up your mind?

469
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,900
Yes, I have.

470
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,640
If I can love you without hiding anything,

471
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,960
I'm willing to give it a try.

472
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,080
Relay my order to the entire army.

473
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,700
Tell them that I have no intention of attacking Yebei.

474
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,320
No one should act without my permission. This is an imperial decree.

475
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,280
If so, Your Majesty, regarding the marriage alliance...

477
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,180
Qihai Lian has nothing to do with the marriage alliance now.

478
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,440
I'm sure you're happy to hear that.

479
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,440
Stop thinking about her. Get to work.

480
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,320
Queen Lan.

482
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,000
My child, you're here.

483
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,020
Where's A'Rui?

484
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,300
I told her to retrieve something for me.

485
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,320
My Queen, do you have anything to tell me?

486
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,720
You and A'Rui are best friends.

487
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,500
No one likes you...

488
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,420
in Yebei.

489
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,540
Only A'Rui treats you as her true friend.

490
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,580
I hope that you won't forget about A'Rui's kindness

491
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,980
after heading to Chao.

492
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,780
Queen Lan, are you afraid that I'll badmouth

493
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,400
the Seven Tribes of Yebei when I'm there?

494
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,000
You're overthinking it.

495
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,200
Besides, the Emperor of Chao is not foolish enough to believe in hearsay.

496
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,080
No matter what kind of person he is,

497
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,760
I have to say this for the sake of Yebei.

498
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:10,300
I believe that you don't want Yebei to fall into ruins. Am I right?

499
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,540
Queen Lan, all of us are aware of the crisis Yebei is facing.

500
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,060
If, one day, you have to choose

501
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,520
between Yebei and A'Rui, Queen Lan,

502
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,000
I hope that you will choose A'Rui.

503
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,360
There are countless daughters and sons in Yebei.

504
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,920
However, A'Rui only has you as her mother.

505
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,140
Please do not let her suffer the hardship she isn't supposed to.

506
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,020
Look at you.

507
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,340
Why are you giving me advice instead?

508
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,880
Yezi.

509
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,160
A'Rui.

510
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,120
Yezi, this is for you.

511
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,720
For me?

512
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,760
Initially, it was meant for me or Lian.

513
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,780
But Mother said no one had made a bridal gown for you.

514
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,440
So she wants you to wear this on your wedding.

515
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,280
A'Rui, I like everything you give me.

516
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,540
Yezi.

517
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,100
Wait for me.

518
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,820
Queen Lan, may I speak with A'Rui in private?

519
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,400
Let's go.

520
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,360
Yezi, do you truly wish to go?

521
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,600
I don't want you to force yourself to do the things you dislike.

522
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,660
A'Rui, I have a secret to tell you.

523
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Actually, I've met the Emperor of Chao before.

524
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,880
I truly wish to marry His Majesty.

525
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,380
So, you truly fancy the Emperor of Chao?

526
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,000
Marrying myself off to Chao is the best choice.

527
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,200
But, Yezi, I can't bear to part with you.

528
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,800
Even now, I still cannot accept the fact

529
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,120
that you'll be leaving me and heading to Chao.

530
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,540
I can't bear to part with you either.

531
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,540
If so, I'll visit you in Tianqi after you marry the Emperor of Chao.

532
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,600
A'Rui, I promise you.

533
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,300
We'll definitely see each other again.

534
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,980
And Wuyou is in Tianqi, too.

535
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,000
If so, I can see Wuyou as well when I go there to visit you.

536
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,900
Yezi.

537
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,640
Don't worry. We'll meet again soon.

538
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,660
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

539
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,980
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

540
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,060
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

541
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,760
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

544
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,220
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

545
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,460
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

546
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,900
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

547
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,120
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

548
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,920
♫ Void of someone ♫

549
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,993
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

550
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:55,300
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

553
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,220
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

554
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:18,020
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

555
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:24,100
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

556
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:30,480
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

557
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,640
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

558
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,840
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

559
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,500
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

560
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,660
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

561
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:56,260
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

562
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:02,440
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

563
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:09,320
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

564
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:21,980
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
