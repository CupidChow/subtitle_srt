[Episode 22]

15
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,760
Yezi.

16
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,870
Don't worry.

17
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,270
We'll meet again soon.

18
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,960
General Xie, although Yezi isn't my biological sister,

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,810
she's a good and sensible girl.

20
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,450
From now on, I'll entrust her to you.

21
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't worry.

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,320
I will definitely take good care of her.

23
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,970
It's already been six hours.

24
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,420
Will they be able to return?

25
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,130
If they succeed,

26
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,910
they will return here with a green flash.

27
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,160
However, if the Ice Platform is flashing rainbow flashes,

28
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,870
that means the alternate timeline wasn't built successfully.

29
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,800
Do you feel anything?

30
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,320
Feel anything?

31
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,910
Are you saying that this is related to us?

32
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,240
If you don't feel anything, that means they haven't succeeded yet.

33
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,750
If they succeed, people who are close to them

34
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,870
will most likely be affected.

35
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,540
There might also be a deviation in our memories.

36
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,900
We will have two contradicting memories,

37
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,620
and we won't know which of them is true.

38
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,830
What if they fail?

39
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,650
If they fail, everything will remain the same.

40
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,630
If that's the case, they will be the only ones who know what happened

41
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,130
in that alternate timeline.

42
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,250
However, our biggest issue right now is

43
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,950
that Bai Lu prepared enough Ice Crystals to last for seven days.

44
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,770
But now, His Majesty has joined her by accident.

45
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,720
I don't know how long

46
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,810
and if it'll affect her plan.

47
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,760
Can she truly change the past?

48
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,620
Someone!

49
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,940
Send this to Xiayang City.

50
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,590
My Lord, isn't this too risky?

51
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,520
What do you know?

52
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,140
Qihai Zhenyu has suppressed

53
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,420
the six other tribes for many years.

54
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,490
More of our men were killed by him than in the war!

55
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,540
I, Luo Wuyi, must avenge them.

56
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,870
Since Qihai Zhenyu has agreed to the marriage alliance with Chao,

57
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,340
the public is enraged by his actions.

58
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,860
This is our best timing.

59
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,200
Go now.

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,040
Understood.

I can take it!

I'm sure something's wrong with the magic array! She shouldn't die!

We've already tried our best!

A'Rui!

Yezi.

115
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,630
The past cannot be changed.

116
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,810
- We have to move on.
- We're still alive.

117
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,030
We still have a future.

118
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,620
But why can't A'Rui be the same as us?

119
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,270
I'm sure A'Rui wouldn't want to see you in this state.

120
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,910
No, Sister.

121
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,610
I want to save A'Rui again.

122
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,160
I wish to give it another try.

123
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,000
I was so close to saving her.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,600
You've changed too much during the past few days.

125
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,960
Don't be so obsessed.

126
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,200
I understand.

127
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm tired.

128
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,100
Rest well then.

129
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,700
I'll visit you next time.

130
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, we're the only ones left.

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We have to live well.

132
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,800
That's what matters.

133
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,800
Tell me what happened inside.

134
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Don't stare at me like that.

135
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
It's terrifying.

136
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,800
I want to go back in time again.

137
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
What?

138
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,900
No way.

139
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,400
You'll lose your mind if you enter the time-traveling passage more than once.

140
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,200
The more you enter the passage, the more repeated memories you'll have.

141
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,900
Eventually, you won't be able to differentiate between dream and reality.

142
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,500
Look at this.

143
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,100
This red mark is a sign that your body can't handle the pressure.

144
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
No.

145
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Nothing can stop me from saving ARui.

146
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,400
I will save her as long as there's a chance.

147
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
I have to save her.

148
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't do that.

149
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,900
I don't want to save you when you lose your mind.

150
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,400
I don't need you to save me.

151
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,800
Now, you don't need me anyway.

152
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
I will tell Yi Wuyou to gather more Ice Crystals for me.

153
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Why can't you listen to me for once?

154
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,500
Ling Yun.

155
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,500
Your Majesty, I've asked around.

156
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,100
No one in the Bureau of Astrology knows anything about this magic array.

157
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,800
Those from the Directorate of Astronomy are checking the books within Yunji Building.

158
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,900
Bring Yun Wen here.

159
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,700
Wait.

161
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,600
Don't let Bai Lu know about this.

162
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Understood.

163
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

164
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,500
Yun Wen,

165
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,200
I have something to ask you.

166
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
What is this?

167
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,200
That's the backlash you received from entering the time-traveling passage.

168
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,100
Truth Masters cannot cast a time-traveling magic array.

169
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,000
And you were blessed by them before.

170
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Therefore, the backlash you received

171
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
from the time-traveling passage will be worse.

172
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,000
It might even make you insane.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,200
So, there's actually a backlash to it?

174
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,100
You guys have only entered the passage once.

175
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,400
It won't be a big deal for now.

176
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,300
However, if you enter the passage repeatedly,

177
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,000
your mental state will be crushed.

178
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
Even if you don't die, you'll go insane from it.

179
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
How could you let her attempt such a dangerous act?

180
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Your Majesty, you know this too.

181
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
No one can stop her and her stubborn temper.

182
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,300
I won't stop her from doing what she wants.

183
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,400
However, the time-traveling passage is too risky.

184
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I can't let her hurt herself.

185
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Yun Wen,

186
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I need you to do me a favor.

187
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,400
Your Majesty, do you intend to destroy the time-traveling passage?

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
How's the search for Ice Crystals?

189
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,300
Ever since Miss Ye sent you a letter requesting Ice Crystals,

190
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,200
we couldn't find a single ice crystal in Tianqi.

191
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I suspect that someone in the palace is behind this.

192
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,600
Seizing all the Ice Crystals without telling anyone

193
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
sounds like something that person will do.

194
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Young Master, are you referring to the Emperor of Chao?

195
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Hejin, tell Yezi that I need to see her personally

196
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,200
regarding the Ice Crystals.

197
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
Yes, Young Master.

198
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,400
Yezi.

199
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,300
I called you here because I have something important to tell you

200
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,000
that cannot be written down.

201
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Did you find the Ice Crystals?

202
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,200
There's no Ice Crystal on the market.

203
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,500
How could that be?

204
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,200
Could it be that someone had bought all of them?

205
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,100
Although Ice Crystals had always been scarce,

206
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Tianqi had never run out of them before.

207
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,400
You need more than just money to buy all of them at once.

208
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,100
Who do you think in Tianqi will target you like this?

209
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,700
And who has the ability to do so?

210
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
What are you trying to say here?

211
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,500
That's all I have to say.

212
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Are you referring to him?

213
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,600
I don't want you to keep falling deeper into the abyss.

214
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
I know what I'm doing.

215
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
You don't need to worry about me.

216
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,800
I'll leave now.

217
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,900
Yezi.

218
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,500
I've been busy lately.

219
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
If I'm not available,

220
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,800
I'll send someone else here.

221
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Ye...

222
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,700
♫ If you have given up hope ♫

223

What are you calculating?

225
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,400
Ice Crystals are born out of celestial power.

226
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
It's related to the star pulse.

227
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,600
Ice Crystal mines with huge deposits must be located

228
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,800
around the field surrounding the main star pulse.

229
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,200
You're right.

230
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,100
However, if Ice Crystals were that easy to find,

231
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,700
humans would've harvested all of them by now.

The state of Chao is a vast place.

I'm sure I can find an Ice Crystal mine.

245
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Uncle Xue, it's been some time since we last met.

246
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,200
I wonder why you called me here today.

247
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,700
Come in.

248
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,400
Master, do you need anything?

249
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Nephew, let's forget about your marriage with my daughter.

250
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,200
However, I do wish to establish an alliance with you.

251
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,700
If you wish to establish an alliance,

252
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,500
you have to show me your sincerity.

253
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,800
Uncle Xue, where's your sincerity?

254
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,600
I've been ruling over Sheyun City, which once belonged to the Winged Clan, for many years.

255
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Since you're the one in charge right now,

256
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,000
I shall return this city to the Yu Family.

257
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm returning the city to its owner in good condition.

258
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,800
Uncle Xue, you're straightforward indeed.

259
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,700
If so, we shall establish an alliance.

260
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,800
However, Uncle Xue, I need you to do me a favor.

261
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,100
Please speak.

262
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,600
I heard that you and Great Steward Fan are close.

263
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I hope that you could invite Great Steward Fan to Jianyue Pavilion.

264
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,100
Sure.

265
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
If so, I shall wait for your good news.

266
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Farewell.

267
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,500
Lan'er, what exactly is on your mind?

268
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,800
Although Yu Linkong is useful to us,

269
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,300
he's not suitable to be my husband.

270
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,000
He doesn't have any feelings for me.

271
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And he will change his plans for other women.

272
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,800
I dare not get a husband like that.

273
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,600
I came here to find him as per your instruction.

274
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,400
I've also dealt with that woman of Yebei as per your instruction.

275
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,100
Now, he wants us to go to Fan Ruhui.

276
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,600
Should we take this risk for his sake?

277
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,800
I think it's viable.

278
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
If he joins hands with Fan Ruhui,

279
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
we will return Sheyun City to him.

280
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,400
No need to be unwilling to let go of it.

281
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
We're not returning the city to him for nothing.

282
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
We need him to express his stand.

283
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,600
We'll let the people of Ningzhou know that the Winged Clan

284
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,100
chose to establish an alliance with the Xue Family

285
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
and we will never lose.

286
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,300
We can't just let him have his way all the time.

287
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,800
There's one more thing.

288
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,600
If everything goes smoothly and the Yu Family establishes an alliance with the Xue Family,

289
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
I won't need to stay in Jianyue Pavilion again.

290
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,700
Will you return to Ningzhou?

291
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,000
I have something else to do in Tianqi.

292
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,100
Father, you don't need to worry about me. I will go to you.

293
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Old Master, we've arrived at Jianyue Pavilion.

294
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Official Fan, please.

295
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,400
Great Steward Fan, it's an honor to meet you.

296
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Your Highness, I've long heard about you.

297
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,800
I never expected the owner

298
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,800
of the restaurant most frequented by our officials

299
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,200
to be you, Your Highness.

300
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
It's just a small business.

301
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm trying to make a living here.

302
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Your Highness, you're being modest here.

303
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,400
You may call me Yi Wuyou.

304
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm no longer a prince.

305
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Young Master Yi.

306
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
Good.

307
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Great Steward Fan, please.

308
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Great Steward Fan, I need to depend on your guidance in the future.

309
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,600
Guidance? I'm not good enough to do that.

310
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I'm always busy with the affairs of the state.

311
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000
But I've heard about the name

312
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
of the famous Jianyue Pavilion long ago.

313
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Even so, I've never been here before.

314
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,800
I do regret it.

315
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,700
Great Steward, you flatter me.

316
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,000
Jianyue Pavilion is just an ordinary restaurant.

317
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's definitely a decent business.

318
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,700
Decent business?

319
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Excellent.

320
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,400
Great Steward, it's rare for us to meet.

321
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,900
We should become friends.

322
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,200
We're not foes, right?

323
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,800
Better a friend than a foe.

324
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Moreover, Young Master Yi,

325
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,200
we have a common foe.

326
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,520
and delay the construction.

486
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,120
During the construction of the canal in Yuezhou, there's a tribe in Heluo called Tubo.

487
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,980
They undertook the entire construction and banded together for selfish reasons.

488
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:18,560
And they know how to cover their tracks, thus speeding the construction by quite a bit.

489
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,160
So, if we wish to delay the construction, we have to get rid of the Tubo people.

490
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,100
Now, the canal in Yuezhou is basically completed.

491
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:33,260
I heard that they were planning to head to Ningzhou.

492
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,940
Official Fan, you seem to be asking for a huge favor.

493
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,440
After the deed is done,

494
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,340
Young Master Yi, I will assist you with anything

495
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,840
as long as you're in Tianqi or Ningzhou.

496
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,860
It's a deal then.

497
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,440
I shall take my leave first.

498
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,860
If so, Young Master Yi, I'll pray for your success.

499
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,840
Please.

500
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,020
Take care.

501
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,760
The Tubo people are heading toward Ningzhou to construct the new canal.

502
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,140
Once we kill them, it won't be that easy for them to construct the new canal.

503
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,420
We can ruin the plan of the human emperor

504
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,620
and avenge our clan members at the same time.

505
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,380
We'll show the Four Great Families and Xue Xuanjing our authority.

506
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,120
Not just that, but Fan Ruhui of Tianqi will also owe us a favor.

507
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,260
We're killing three birds with one stone here.

508
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,960
Hejin, tell the Four Great Families that I will deal with

509
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,080
the construction of the canal for them.

510
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,540
Yes, sir.

511
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,060
Tianying, gather our subordinates and head to Yuezhou.

512
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,160
Make sure the operation is clean and efficient.

513
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,540
Yes, Young Master.

514
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,040
Young Master, it's not hard to get rid of the Tubo people.

515
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,020
However, according to my knowledge, they once fixed the road for Qihai Lian before.

516
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,980
- They're allies of Miss Ye. If we kill them...
- That's her own business.

517
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,260
It has nothing to do with us.

518
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm not killing the Tubo people for Fan Ruhui's sake.

519
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,980
I'm doing it for Ningzhou, for the Winged Clan.

520
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,640
Tianying, you must be very careful with this.

521
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,580
Young Master, don't worry.

522
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,080
Father, Yu Linkong and Fan Ruhui have joined hands

523
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,560
to stop the construction of the canal.

524
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,240
Father, now that this is over,

525
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,180
I will leave Jianyue Pavilion to nurture my child.

526
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,180
If you need anything, feel free come to me.

527
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,880
Miss Tang Yuan, where are you going?

528
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,020
Sister He, do you need anything from me?

529
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,420
You've been here for so long.

530
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,320
Do you think you can get away this easily?

531
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,620
Tang Yuan, not only did you deceive us,

532
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,280
but you're also trying to sneak away. Why are you doing so?

533
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,340
Master, I still have several relatives in my hometown.

534
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,500
Although this is something unspeakable,

535
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,860
I still have to head back and tell them.

536
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,760
You and I are friends, right?

537
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,640
Is there anything you cannot tell me?

538
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,200
Or Princess Xue, is it because you cannot tell me

539
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,660
the plot devised by you and your father?

540
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,740
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

541
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,160
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

542
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,340
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,840
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:55,300
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

547
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,640
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

549
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,600
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

550
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,000
♫ Void of someone ♫

551
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,380
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

552
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,380

555
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:35,300
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

556
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:42,100
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

557
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:48,500
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

558
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,480
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

559
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,720
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

560
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,020
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

561
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:07,640
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:13,700
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,540
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

564
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,700
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

565
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:32,980
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

566
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:44,960
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
