15
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,810
Great Steward, you can do as you see fit.

16
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,350
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,970
Is there anything else?

19
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,260
It's regarding Bai Lu, the director of the Bureau of Astrology.

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,660
What's the matter with her?

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,170
Lately, rumors have been brewing in the palace.

23
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,550
Officials were saying that Bai Lu was the accomplice of the assassins in the Ceremony of Stars.

24
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,150
Everyone saw what she did. Her crime was undeniable.

25
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,530
However, Bai Lu wasn't punished or sent to prison.

26
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,170
Instead, she was released without any punishment.

27
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,450
Her post was also reinstated. We can't understand why.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,650
Even if everyone saw what she did, there was no evidence of her crime.

29
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,730
Your Majesty, you mean...

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,100
Bai Lu was the one who told me that someone

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,980
was going to assassinate me during the Ceremony of Stars.

32
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,540
That's how I was able to prepare for it in advance.

33
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,950
I was able to capture the assassins,

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,910
and the Ceremony of Stars wasn't affected at all.

35
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,410
Is there any issue with that?

36
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,240
No.

37
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,350
As the Great Steward, you should be more magnanimous.

38
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,100
Your Majesty, you're right.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,730
I was planning to seek the Bureau of Astrology's guidance

40
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,090

- What did Bai Lu say?
- Director Bai wasn't around.

42
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,960
They said she was fulfilling her duties under Your Majesty's order.

43
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,070
Under my order?

44
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,910
What order?

45
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,110
About that, I...

46
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,360
The patterns here have been broken into pieces.

47

I don't know what I'll get from piecing them together.

48

Director Bai, where have you been?

52
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,870
I was fulfilling my duties under His Majesty's order.

53
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,370
What happened in the palace?

54
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,830
Under His Majesty's order?

55
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,940
His Majesty ordered the imperial army to search for you, Director Bai.

56
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,900
Search for me?

57
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,750
That can't be.

58
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,520

Director Bai.

60
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,500
It seemed like Great Stewart was discussing something with His Majesty.

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,690
General, thanks for the heads-up.

62
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,350
Your Majesty, it's late now.

63
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,900
Could it be that something has happened to Director Bai?

64
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,560
What can happen to her in the palace?

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,340
Your Majesty is right.

66
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,930

Didn't you say you were going to see me?

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,320
How could you use me as an excuse?

71
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,770
I didn't do that. I didn't say I was going to meet you, Your Majesty.

72
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,040
I went to the South Palace for official business.

73
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,100

Do you really want me to tell you?

77
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,510
Why would it be at the South Palace?

78
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,040
I dare not confirm it. However...

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,760
All right.

I'll leave this task to you.

You need to update your progress once every three days.

Every three days?

89

Why don't you take a guess?

95
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,550
Great Steward, it's inappropriate for me to tell you

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,740
His Majesty was alone when he met Bai Lu.

100
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,350
His Majesty told me

101
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,120
that Bai Lu was the one who found out about the assassination.

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,630
She even lured them out and captured them.

103
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,830
Is that truly the case?

104
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,010
Of course, I don't believe it.

105
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,720
However, since His Majesty is covering up for her,

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
that means this woman is extraordinary.

107
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,040
It seems like they're hiding a secret from me.

I thought you would want to know.

- Miss Yezi, she...
- What happened to her?

116
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,600
Nothing happened to her. She was reinstated.

117
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,180
However, rumor has it

118
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,310
that she was the one who found out about the assassination.

119
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,700
That's why His Majesty spared her.

120
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,700
No. It won't be her.

121
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,650
Without Yezi's help,

122

all of us would've been captured during the ceremony.

I know it wasn't her.

124
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,170
I think His Majesty used that as an excuse to shut the public up.

125

But His Majesty...

126

I've never seen him being this tolerant of someone before.

127

A seal?

132

Take a look at this then. Does this belong to the Truth Master?

133

- Yun Wen!
- That's only a fragment.

134

You have to find its core before I can tell if it's related to the Truth Master.

135

How can I find this core then?

It's easy. You'll know when you head to Mianshi Bridge tonight.

How could I go to the South Palace at night?

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,060
It's something I've never heard before.

166
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,300
I wonder who the composer is.

167
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,140
The song was composed by the Winged Ones. It's called Maple Leaves.

168
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,210
I learned it from my owner.

169
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,600
My owner was the one who taught me how to play it.

170
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,770
Young Master, if you like it, I can play it again.

171
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,240
I love music, too.

172
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,410
I was touched by this song.

173
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,690
I wonder if I have the honor of meeting the owner of Jianyue Pavilion.

174
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm the owner here.

175
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm Pingye Qiao. Sorry for the interruption.

176
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,660
- Please.
- Please.

177
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,680
I heard from her that you taught her how to play Maple Leaves.

178
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,910
To be able to play such a lovely melody,

179
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,350
I assume you must be one of the nobles of the Winged Clan.

180
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,090
Young Master, you may call me Wuyou.

181
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,090
I'm just a mere commoner.

182
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,000
Many people who are surviving in the marketplace are elegant scholars, too.

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,840
The world is unpredictable. Due to the appearance of powerful ministers,

184
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,860
we might end up as a criminal overnight.

185
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,250
Even a down-and-out lyricist like you

186
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,110
could be a prince who had lost his home.

187
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,310
One's background doesn't matter.

188
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,710
Music and musical instruments do not recognize one's rank.

189
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,180
There are plenty of princes and nobles who know nothing about music.

190
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,910
Even commoners like us

191
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,060
are able to create beautiful lyrics and melodies, am I right?

192
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,690
Brother Wuyou, you're right.

193
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,400
I've made a fool of myself due to my stereotypical mindset.

194
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,290
I have to learn more from you in the future.

195
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,410
You flatter me.

196
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,240
Tang Yuan, since he admires you so much,

197
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,950
you should play another song for him.

198
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,200
Yes, sir.

199
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,910
Thank you.

200
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,320
Please.

201
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,380
Young Master, it's getting late. You should head home early.

202
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,470
Farewell.

203
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,630
Young Master, Wei Qi just made a report.

204
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,980
He said there was a surplus in taxes

205
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,980
for 43 counties this fall.

206
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,280
Our subordinates are doing pretty well.

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,050
Take out 30% of the sum and give them to the Protectorate Generals.

208
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,300
Understood. I will let them know

209
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,100
that the Great Steward is the one who's giving them benefits, not the imperial court.

210
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,270
Sir, as per your instructions, I will manipulate the accounts of the extra taxes we collect.

211
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,340
I'll only hand half of them to the treasury.

212
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,110
You should allocate more to Zhongzhou.

213
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,110
Although Cai Can didn't complete his task during the Ceremony of Stars,

214
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,380
he weakened the power of the Divine Mirror.

215
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,100
Yes, sir.

216
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,880
According to the Bureau of Situ, 43 counties

217
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,660
couldn't pay the required amount of tax this fall.

218
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,590
As for the other six cities, seven districts, and 49 counties, they...

219
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,420
Enough!

220
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,670
I don't feel like hearing it.

221
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,770
Your Majesty, we've spent a lot in building a canal.

222
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,300
And this year's harvest isn't as good as last year's.

223
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,370
It is really difficult to allocate funds for Yebei migration.

224
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,520
Did you think I established the Great Steward's Residence

225
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,040
so that you all could manage the imperial court for me?

226
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,490
Are you guys demanding money from me?

227
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,380
I dare not do so.

228
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,930
Leave, all of you.

229
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,890
We shall take our leave.

230
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,880
We'll reach Yebei after crossing this mountain.

231
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,110
General Zhu Ying, I'll leave the migrants to you.

232
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,560
Go now.

233
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,130
Your Majesty.

234
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,870
Bai Lu,

235
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,800
you've been wandering around in the palace.

236
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,230
Have you done the task I assigned you?

237
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,690
I have.

238
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,820
I'm doing it. I just found a way to do it.

239
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,520
Listen. I won't extend your deadline even by one day.

240
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,270
Do you wish to survive or not?

241
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,020
I got it. You're so petty.

242
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,420
What are you mumbling about?

243
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,990
I said, Your Majesty, I will remember your words.

244
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,670
Come. Come here.

245
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,460
I'll show it to you.

246
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,160
Zhu Ying and the rest should be arriving in Yebei soon.

247
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
They are leading large groups of people to migrate.

248
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
They need the treasury to provide them with funds.

249
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,290
What do you think I should do?

250
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,020
Provide them with funds?

251
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,750
Isn't that the duty of the Great Steward?

252
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,190
Or... you're asking me this question instead of him

253
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,480
because you can't keep him in check?

254
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Who said I can't keep him in check?

255
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,000
It's just that what I want to achieve is a centennial effort.

256
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,270
But Fan Ruhui has no foresight at all.

257
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,620
There are times he doesn't cooperate with me.

258
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,220
Naturally, the Great Steward wouldn't dare to do anything to the treasury's money.

259
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,920
However...

260
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,450
I do think the Great Steward is great at accumulating wealth.

261
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,770
Since that's the case, I'm sure he's wealthy too.

262
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,330
Are you saying that the Great Steward has a private vault?

263
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,600
You knew about it?

264
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,620
If so, he'll yield to you if you get the goods on him.

265
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,240
Fan Ruhui's weakness...

266
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,550
is Fan Zheng.

267
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,740
Although Fan Zheng is corrupted,

268
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,456
he did invent the Wind Bow

269
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:40,160
together with the Bureau of Sima recently.

270
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,880
Its shooting range is actually longer than Heluo's composite bow.

271
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,820
I'm very curious about the secret behind this bow.

272
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,380
Hurry, don't fall behind.

273
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,660
Your Majesty.

274
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,220
Your Majesty, I heard that you wish to witness the might of the Wind Bow once again.

275
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,530
That's why I brought it here.

276
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:32,190
Since I'm free today, I wish to see the progress you made with the bow.

277
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,410
Your Majesty, please don't worry.

278
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,250
I urged them to complete the bow as soon as possible.

279
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,790
The 3,000 Wind Bows will be ready in a few days.

280
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,810
Is that so?

281
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,890
Bai Lu.

282
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,500
Here.

283
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,620
Try out this Wind Bow.

284
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,760
Come.

286
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,830
Official Bai.

287
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,590
Excellent!

288
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,610
I was referring to the bow.

289
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,390
Your Majesty.

290
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,920
Isn't this an Ice Crystal shard?

291
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,960
Give me another arrow.

292
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,600
Here.

293
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,230
Fan Zheng, what's going on?

294
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,900
I...

295
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Your Majesty, you're holding the Ice Crystal of Genbai.

296
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,580
In the last six months, the planet, Genbai, will be close to Earth.

297
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,510
So, Genbai is wind-based.

298
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,920
Everything on the planet is affected by wind-based secret techniques.

299
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,960
Since there's a shard of it in the bow,

300
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,110
the bow can harness the power of wind

301
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,250
and increase its shooting range.

302
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,620
Your Majesty! This demoness did it on purpose!

303
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,830
She wants to frame me!

304
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,100
So, I can't use this bow without the Ice Crystal?

305
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,370
Doesn't that make it useless?

306
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,210
Your Majesty, once Genbai distances itself from Earth,

307
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,340
the power of the Ice Crystal will be reduced significantly.

308
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,060
By then, this bow will be inferior to Heluo's composite bow.

309
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,000
Fine. Even if it's the effect of the Ice Crystals,

310
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,470
I spent my own money on them!

311
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,230
You did spend a lot on the Ice Crystals.

312
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,910
However, if I'm not mistaken,

313
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,220
in order to showcase the power of this bow,

314
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,100
the Bureau of Sima must've written in the accounts

315
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,500
that you guys spent a huge sum on procuring its raw material

316
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,450
and its production cost.

317
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,150
However, these materials look ordinary to me.

318
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,750
That's nonsense!

319
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,530
You demoness! You're just trying to frame me!

320
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,100
Your Majesty, you'll know when you check the Bureau of Sima's accounts.

321
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,580
Second Young Master Fan, were you deceived by your subordinates?

322
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,450
Or were you trying to deceive His Majesty?

323
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,820
That, I have no idea.

324
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,480
Fan Zheng, tell me.

325
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,740
I was deceived!

326
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,560
Your Majesty, I was deceived!

327
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,940
You have to trust me!

328
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,600
Pass the bow to me.

329
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,300
Your Majesty.

330
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,860
Although its shooting range is not far, I'm making a close shot.

331
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,460
Let me see if I can shoot down your hairpin.

332
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,460
Your Majesty, please spare me! Please spare me.

333
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,080
Your Majesty, please spare me!

334
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,510
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

335
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,100
You're not allowed to touch it or remove it.

336
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,720
Reflect upon your actions.

337
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,580
Thank you, Your Majesty! Thank you, Your Majesty!

338
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,970
Thank you, Your Majesty!

339
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,680
I deserve to die!

340
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,580
Your Majesty, I failed to educate my son!

341
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,890
I've checked the accounts.

342
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,740
Fan Zheng wasn't as greedy as I thought.

343
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,030
Seems like you were too strict with him.

344
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,470
He's taking money from the treasury

345
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,400
since he doesn't have enough at home.

346
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,500
Your Majesty! It's all my fault! Please punish me!

347
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,300
Fan Zheng is Fan Zheng, you are you.

348
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,010
About the money embezzled by Fan Zheng,

349
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,600
I think it's enough to support Jie Zhuying and the people of Yebei

350
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,620
to migrate to Yuezhou.

351
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,220
How could that...

352
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,990
I'll get to it immediately.

353
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,930
Do you have enough?

354
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,140
The migration is beneficial to both the state and its people.

355
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,740
As the Great Steward, I should serve as an example.

356
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,510
I will mobilize all the officials and tell them to donate their wealth to support this campaign!

357
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,980
Excellent. Excellent!

358
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,930
Father! Father, how was it?

359
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,140
The Wind Bow has nothing to do with me!

360
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,350
It was fine initially.

361
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,080
I don't know what spell that Bai Lu cast.

362
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,950
That woman will be the death of me!

363
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,880
We have to get rid of her!

364
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,070
Father! This truly has nothing to do with me!

365
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,840
It's all him. It's Zuo Jintian's idea.

366
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
He was the one who made the bows! He dragged me down!

367
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,110
Father, please explain it to His Majesty!

368
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,720
This truly has nothing to do with me!

369
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,450
Useless fool!

370
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,720
You only know how to stir up trouble for me.

371
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,790
Why would Bai Lu go against you

372
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,150
if you didn't let her get the goods on you?

373
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,210
Zuo Jintian was the culprit?

374
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,150
I was the one who recommended Zuo Jintian to be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou!

375
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,490
Do you want me to lie to His Majesty?

376
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,350
What should I do then?

377
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,060
Father, what should I do then?

378
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,220
I'm still young! I haven't gotten married yet!

379
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,370
Scram!

380
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,750
His Majesty only removed you from office.

381
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,350
He didn't say he would execute you.

382
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,390
He only removed me from office?

383
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,640
That's right.

384
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,960
That's all?

385
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,330
Yes.

386
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,150
I knew it.

387
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,450
I knew His Majesty couldn't bear to execute his nephew, right?

388
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,770
He only has two nephews.

389
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,910
How could he bear to execute me?

390
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:15,380
Father, Uncle said I couldn't remove this.

391
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,020
Heaven! Please let me die!

392
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,040
Do you know how much I've spent to redeem your life?

393
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,000
Scram! Just scram!

394
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,270
Scram!

395
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,970
Why don't you kill me directly?

396
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,020
Your Majesty.

397
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

398
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,000
It's late.

399
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,770
What are you doing here?

400
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,970
Naturally, I have something urgent to tell you.

401
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,010
Your Majesty, I'm here to claim my reward.

402
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,650
What reward do you want?

403
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,460
Your Majesty, please grant me a palace pass.

404
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,420
[Ledger]

405
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,330
Palace pass?

406
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,150
I thought you frequent the palace?

407
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,620
You often chatted happily with Consort Yu and the rest, no?

408
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,440
That's right.

409
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,060
However, I'm doing this to finish the task you assigned to me.

410
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,110
Lately, I realized that there might be clues

411
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,920
hidden in the remains of the previous dynasty.

412
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,670
That's why I wish to check out all the palaces and chambers.

413
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,550
You see?

414
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,940
It's more than just the North Palace.

415
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,250
Such audacity!

416
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,940
You're getting ahead of yourself here just because you completed one task for me.

417
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,750
Don't tell me you're going to turn my chamber upside down as well?

418
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,240
I didn't say that.

419
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,020
But, Your Majesty, you only gave me three months.

420
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,080
I rack my brain every day. I can't sleep or eat well.

421
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,470
- I can only think about the task at hand.
- Scram.

422
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,890
I...

423
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,720
Is that a yes?

424
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,420
I told you to scram!

425
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,440
Fine! What a petty guy.

426
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,430
Here.

427
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,020
Princess, you're back.

428
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,850
It's the princess!

429
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,460
The princess is back!

430
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,470
- Princess!
- Princess!

431
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,420
I have good news for you all.

432
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,690
Princess.

433
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,390
What good news?

434
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,020
The imperial edict has arrived.

435
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,950
Commander-in-Chief, Zhu Ying and Yebei's Qihai Lian, accept the edict.

436
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,020
"As per the words of the Emperor of Chao,

437
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,530
although Qihai Lian of Yebei

438
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,600
was the descendant of a criminal,

439
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,950
she was enlightened after receiving my teaching.

440
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,060
She understands the principle of benevolence and loyalty.

441
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,080
She's eager to learn and understands the cardinal principles.

442
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,840
The title of Princess Qingheng is conferred upon her

443
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,510
to showcase the benevolence of Great Chao.

444
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,700
She is to serve as a role model of all rebellious figures.

445
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,270
Princess Qingheng is virtuous and tolerant.

446
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,490
She's fit to be the wife of a gentleman.

447
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,590
She is to marry the Commander-in-Chief, Zhu Ying.

448
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:10,130
She and Zhu Ying will help the remnants of Yebei to migrate to Yuezhou.

449
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,730
They shall spend their lives together in bliss."

450
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,010
That is all.

451
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

452
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:35,670
Princess Qingheng, His Majesty has another oral edict for you.

453
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:42,080
His Majesty hopes that you two will work together as this is a perilous trip.

454
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,360
Congratulations, Princess Qingheng.

455
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,590
Young Master, I come from a fallen kingdom.

456
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,100
I have no virtue or talent.

457
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,200
Commander-in-Chief is a core figure of the state.

458
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,590
Our status differs too much. We mustn't get married.

459
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,270
Young Master, please tell His Majesty to take back his order.

460
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,040
Princess Qingheng, that is impossible.

461
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,543
His Majesty never takes back his orders.

462
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:08,790
But...

463
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,990
His Majesty is a man of his word. No bargaining allowed.

464
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,980
Master Envoy, the long trip must've been tiring.

465
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,860
Please take a break in the tent.

466
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,910
I've prepared some wine for you.

467
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,250
Okay.

468
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,150
Grand Princess, was that what you meant by good news?

469
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,170
What good news?

470
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,820
How was that good news?

471
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,090
Princess Lian, was the envoy speaking the truth?

472
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,760
She's no longer the Princess of Yebei.

473
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,200
She's Princess Qingheng of Chao now.

474
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Didn't you guys hear that?

475
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,990
Princess Lian, are we going to leave Yebei, our home?

476
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,230
Is that true?

477
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,960
Grandma, Yebei can no longer sustain everyone here.

478
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,310
If you wish to survive, you have to leave.

479
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,620
No, I was born in Yebei!

480
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,420
So I will die in Yebei!

481
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:28,780
Both my son and my husband were buried here.

482
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,380
I'm going to stay with them!

483
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,500
Princess Qingheng, huh?

484
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,280
That man killed King Qihai!

485
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,960
How dare you surrender to the man who killed your father!

486
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,430
Nonsense! I won't allow you to defame Princess Lian like that.

487
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,700
Stop wronging Grand Princess.

488
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,060
She brought us to Tianqi to assassinate the emperor.

489
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,250
She did everything for Yebei's sake.

490
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,230
For Yebei's sake?

491
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,120
For Yebei's sake, she should kill the commander-in-chief who has been suppressing us

492
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,040
instead of sleeping with him!

493
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,380
Stop your nonsense! Unfilial child!

494
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,350
Unfilial child!

495
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,730
You betrayed your ancestors and your homeland.

496
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,850
Why did I give birth to animals like you?

497
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,320
I've let my ancestors down!

498
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,360
Father, you misunderstood Princess!

499
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,210
- Unfilial child!
- Uncle, stop that!

500
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,270
Qingzhan did nothing wrong. He's seriously injured.

501
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,500
I'm teaching my own son here.

502
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,830
Princess Qingheng of Chao, this is none of your business!

503
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,650
Princess!

504
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,210
Return to that filthy land of yours!

505
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,810
Brother, let's go.

506
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,610
Scram! Those who sell out their ancestors, scram!

507
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,440
My goodness.

508
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,100
Let's go.

509
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,360
It's getting late. You should rest.

510
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,270
I won't accept the marriage.

511
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,690
The current me cannot get married.

512
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,560
His Majesty has never taken back his order before.

513
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,270
Instead of being angry,

514
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,900
why don't you think about how to persuade them to migrate?

515
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,860
Young Master, the palace has tightened its security lately.

516
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,200
It's been a long time since Miss Ye wrote to us.

517
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,760
Got it.

518
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,380
Tonight's a full moon night.

519
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,900
Leng Tianxi's Lunar Erosion will make her suffer tonight.

520
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,320
She doesn't have the antidote. She most probably has to suffer.

521
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,810
Back then, you took pity on her.

522
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,030
You even sent her the antidote from time to time.

523
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,280
However, she betrayed you.

524
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,090
A Snow Crane who betrays her old master deserves to die.

525
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,760
Old master?

526
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,080
Could it be that he's truly the Fourth Prince of the Winged Clan?

527
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,940
Greetings, Young Master.

528
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,680
Happy birthday, Consort Tian.

529
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,710
May you stay young and blissful forever.

530
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,430
Thank you, everyone.

531
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,400
Please have a seat.

532
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,780
The Inner Palace has never been this lively and harmonious before.

533
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,140
I guess Bai Lu did contribute something.

534
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,520
If so, Your Majesty should reward her.

535
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,960
If not, she'll say that you're petty.

536
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,760
Tell me then. What should I reward her?

537
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,250
Well...

538
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,740
Eat up.

539
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,150
Your Highness.

540
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,830
Thank you for taking care of me. To you.

541
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,330
Sure.

542
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,900
- Your Highness?
- Your Highness, what's wrong?

543
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,660
Your Highness!

544
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,540
Hurry! Someone!

545
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,610
Bring Fengyin here.

546
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,950
- Tell him to act when the opportunity arises.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

547
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,780
Your Highness!

548
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,790
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness, what's wrong?

549
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,640
How's Her Highness doing?

550
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,230
No!

551
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,190
I won't betray His Majesty!

552
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,700
No!

553
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,350
I will never do it!

554
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,150
- Your Highness!
- No!

555
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,660
No!

556
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,080
I won't betray His Majesty!

557
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,520
No!

558
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,540
If Consort Tian goes berserk because of the Lunar Erosion, act immediately.

559
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,340
Report to His Majesty after that.

560
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,520
Don't force me!

561
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,690
No!

562
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,480
How long has it been since Her Highness became like this? What's going on?

563
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,220
Her Highness often spends her time in solitude during full moon nights.

564
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,290
- No!
- But this is the first time she's acting like this.

565
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,580
Your Majesty!

566
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,190
Your Highness!

567
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,530
Your Highness!

568
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,710
- Your Highness!
- Don't touch me!

569
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,030
- Your Highness, I'm Bai Lu.
- Don't touch me!

570
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,600
Your Highness!

571
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,960
Your Highness!

572
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,790
Let go of me!

573
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,670
Your Highness!

574
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,860
Let go of me!

575
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,910
Your Highness, hang in there!

576
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,770
Let go of me!

577
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,920
- Don't touch me!
- Your Highness!

578
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,560
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

579
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,890
Let go of me!

580
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,910
Xie, hold her down!

581
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,110
- Hurry. Help Her Highness to her bed.
- Okay.

582
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,660
Hurry!

583
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,180
Your Majesty, I didn't execute your order

584
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,340
as Her Highness's Lunar Erosion symptoms have subsided.

585
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm glad that everything's fine.

586
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,460
Go and investigate the Snow Cranes.

587
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,390
I'm sure we'll find a way to get rid of that spell.

588
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

589
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,740
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

590
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,046
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

591
00:42:56,046 --> 00:43:01,020

♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,872
♫ Void of someone ♫
