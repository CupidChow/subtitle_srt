[Episode 20]

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Yi Wuyou.

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
I really like you.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,300
How nice.

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
I can remain in Yebei forever now.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Stop there.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
A'Rui!

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
If Yezi dies, I will die too.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,700
A'Rui is really gone.

23
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Bai Lu, why are you hiding here crying on your own?

24
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,300
What's wrong?

25
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,800
Do I have to get your permission to cry, too?

26
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Your Majesty,

27
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,300
can you entrust someone else

28
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,100
with the Unified Calendar of Chao and the making of the astrological chart?

29
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,900
I'll take my leave now.

30
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Bai Lu.

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,300
You don't have to be so hard on yourself.

32
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
I can...

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,300
marry you.

34
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
If you say yes,

35
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,800
I will make you the empress.

36
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,900
You can move into the Qihua Palace...

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
and stay under my wings.

38
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,200
For me,

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,200
this is not a reward.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
Is there anyone in the harem

41
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
who isn't loved by Your Majesty?

42
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,800
None of them got my attention before.

43
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,200
Bai Lu,

44
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
you're not loved by your biological father.

45
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,400
And you got framed when you were in Yebei.

46
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,800
You even had a few brushes with death.

47
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,200
The people of Yebei call you the cursed one,

48
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,900
but I'm not like them.

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
I can protect you

50
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,200
and reward you with the greatest honor.

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,700
Do you know how much I wish to go back...

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
to the night A'Rui got married?

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
If you gave me your word

54
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,000
and asked me to marry you back then,

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
things might have turned out completely different now.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
But it's too late now.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,100
I...

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
I only managed to live until today

59
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,400
owing to A'Rui's support.

60
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,200
She was the only ray of light in my tragic life.

61
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I don't mind all the unfair treatment.

62
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
I was happy as long as she is.

63
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
I thought...

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
I would leave Yebei...

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
when A'Rui found the man she loved...

66
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
and secured a happy future.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,600
However, I never expected to run into you.

68
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,500
But I didn't want her to die.

69
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,300
I guess it'd still end the same way.

70
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
She's dead anyway.

71
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Before you came to Yebei,

72
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,800
A'Rui had someone she liked.

73
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,300
She was living the life she always wanted.

74
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,500
Everything was going well for her.

75
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Bai Lu,

76
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,000
these are all merely your obsessions.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
You've never owned any of these,

78
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,000
so you hoped that she could have them.

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
She was my obsession.

80
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
A'Rui will always be my obsession

81
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,200
because she is worth it.

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,500
She is the prettiest princess of Yebei.

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
She is A'Rui, the love of my life.

84
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,200
She deserves everything.

85
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,000
♫ Just a passerby in my memory ♫

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
♫ The lonely night is especially cold ♫

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,200
It's a pity that her destiny said otherwise.

88

♫ Only you can't recall anything ♫

89
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,200
But you're different.

♫ Enduring it alone without a look back ♫

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Your Majesty, I don't want the glory of being a concubine.

92
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,200
If you really want to make it up to me,

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,000
please allow me to resign from my position

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
after I'm done with the Unified Calendar of Chao.

97
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:15,200
♫ With a sigh of nostalgia, I wrap the memory into a cocoon ♫

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,600
♫ I've never forgotten the unchanging promise
we made together ♫

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:30,600
♫ Caught in between love and pain ♫

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
♫ I remain ♫

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm done drawing the Suizheng Array.

102
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
When can I go back in time?

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
It's been a very long time.

104
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,500
I can't remember too well now.

105
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,600
You haven't forgotten about it.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
You simply don't want to tell me the truth.

107
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
The truth won't be helpful.

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,900
Although you hold the array and the rune,

109
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
you need the purest core

110
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,600
of the Suizheng Celestial Power to activate the array of time.

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Your Ice Crystals are far from enough.

112
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
But you were the one who said

113
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,200
that it would work once I collected all the arrays.

114
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I was telling you the truth.

115
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,800
Of course, you had to collect all the arrays first. Right?

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
I can build the time-traveling passage for you,

117
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,000
but you need to figure out how to get the Ice Crystals.

118
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
I carried out an investigation into what happened in Minzhong Mountain.

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
It wasn't my men who tried to hurt you.

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,200
I've never been suspicious of you.

121
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Then, what brings you here?

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,000
Why didn't you tell me that A'Rui is gone?

123
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,000
Young Master Yi, never tell my daughter...

124
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,000
what happened to Princess Zhuyan.

125
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,400
She is very close to Her Highness.

126
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm afraid that she'll act recklessly

127
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,800
once she finds out that Her Highness is gone.

128
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,800
Yezi, it was Dayuangu's last wish.

129
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,900
I didn't want to make you sad, too.

130
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,000
Fine.

131
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Now, I have found a way to travel back in time to save A'Rui.

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,300
All I need are Ice Crystals with high purity.

133
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,000
Can you help me?

134
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
Yuan'er, pass me the cup.

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
What's wrong?

136
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,500
Don't you like this wine?

137
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Ping, I won't be able to drink wine in the coming days.

138
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
I...

139
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,900
I am pregnant.

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Yuan'er.

141
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,500
Really?

142
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
That's great. You're pregnant.

143
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
I'll share the news with Wuyou right away.

144
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,200
I will take you with me.

145
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Wait a minute.

146
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
We need to pack first, right?

147
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
We can't leave in such a hurry.

148
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,200
Sure. I didn't think it through.

149
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
So, Yuan'er, when do you plan to leave?

150
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,600
Let me get ready first.

151
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
You can pick me up in a few days.

152
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,200
Then, we can inform the master, too.

153
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Sure. We'll do as you say.

154
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Then let me do some preparation

155
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
so that you can stay there comfortably.

156
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Yuan'er, take a seat.

157
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
I'll pour you a cup of water.

158
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
Give me a minute.

159
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,700
Your Majesty.

160
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,000
I didn't know about Your Majesty's arrival and failed to receive you at the door.

161
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
You can leave us.

162
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Yes.

163
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I thought you were only leaving after you were done with the unified calendar.

164
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Why didn't I see you at the assembly just now?

165
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,000
I can work on the calendar in the Bureau of Astrology.

166
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,400
I have no intention to get involved in the businesses of the royal court.

167
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I'm here to inform you

168
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,000
that I won't approve your request.

169
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Your Majesty, how can...

170
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,900
What's wrong?

171
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,000
Bai Lu.

172
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,800
Bai Lu. Bai Lu.

173
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,200
Someone!

174
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,000
Send help now!

175
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,300
I beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness.

176
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
Get out.

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,000
Go.

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
Yes.

179
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Find me another one.

180
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Your Majesty, we have brought in all the best physicians in the imperial hospital.

181
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,000
Look elsewhere then.

182
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,300
I'll reward them. Go now!

183
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Yes.

184
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
How is Director Bai doing?

185
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,200
What do we do now?

186
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Maybe he knows what to do.

187
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Your Majesty.

188
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Chao Gao...

189
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Your Majesty.

190
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Please allow me to check on Director Bai.

191
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,500
Your Majesty, he might look young, but he's a very good astrologer.

192
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,000
He might even be better than Director Bai.

193
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,600
A good astrologer?

194
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
But can you cure her?

195
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There's a chance she's not sick.

196
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
Your Majesty, her life star has been affected by bad energy.

197
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
She might have been cursed.

198
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
You can see her life star?

199
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Please follow me to the Ice Platform, Your Majesty.

200
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Your Majesty.

201
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
I didn't expect to see another man

202
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,900
who can perform the Celestial-Hiding Spell after the passing of Jie Haitian.

203
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,500
Jie Haitian's array was very decent,

204
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,300
but the one I made is slightly better than his.

205
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Since you know what happened to Bai Lu,

206
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
can you save her?

207
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
This is a very risky spell.

208
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't save her yet.

209
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
But I can set up an array

210
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
to keep her alive for now.

211
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Your Majesty.

212
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,600
This array can keep her alive for 24 hours.

213
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
What will happen after 24 hours?

214
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,200
If the curse still presents after 24 hours,

215
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,600
she will definitely lose her life.

216
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,700
How do we find the person who placed the curse on her?

217
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,600
The man must have found an empty place

218
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,500
in Tianqi to draw the occult array.

219
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,800
Every two hours, a beam of light will appear and shoot into the sky.

220
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,900
You'll have 12 chances, starting now.

221
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,400
Your Majesty.

222
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
Have you found it?

223
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
We have deployed all the Winged Guards.

224
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,000
All the guards in Tianqi are working on this, too.

225
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,600
They're searching door by door.

226
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,100
So far, they've searched seven districts, which include more than 800 residences.

227
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,000
I asked if you'd found it.

228
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,900
We haven't.

229
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,300
Then, why are you here?

230
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,600
Keep looking!

231
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,400
We have searched Beiqing District,

232
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,000
Chunming District, and many other places.

233
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Most of the officials' residences and summerhouses were in these areas.

234
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,000
Some of the officials refused to let us carry out the search

235
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,900
unless they see the imperial decree issued by Your Majesty.

236
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,600
We're running out of time.

237
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,200
Those who stand in our way will be charged with treason!

238
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Yes.

239
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Listen.

240
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,300
Second Young Master told us to guard this yard.

241
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
No one shall enter the yard, including the emperor.

242
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,200
You'll get a handsome reward after tonight.

243
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes.

244
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,500
Your Majesty.

245
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Your Majesty. Any news?

246
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,600
Don't you have other ways to save her?

247
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Why did Director Bai fall sick all of a sudden?

248
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,900
Fall sick?

249
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Someone cast a curse on her.

250
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,100
Cur... Curse?

251
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Has Director Bai been lying here for 24 hours?

252
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,700
Weren't you on sick leave yesterday?

253
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,600
How did you know about this?

254
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,800
Do you know something we don't?

255
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Your... Your Majesty...

256
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,700
Talk to me only after you've thought it over!

257
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,400
I have no time to spare!

258
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
If Bai Lu dies, I'll bury you together with her body!

259
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
Your Majesty.

260
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,200
All I know is that there's a mystic from Yunzhou, and he's now in Tianqi.

261
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,600
Where is he now?

262
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,500
I don't know... I don't know the details.

263
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,300
I only know that he carries out most of his activities in the east of the city.

264
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,200
This... Please spare me, Your Majesty.

265
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,100
Please spare me.

266
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,400
Your Majesty.

267
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,200
If you leave now and fail to find him,

268
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
you may never see her again.

269
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,600
I won't let it happen.

270
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Look after Bai Lu on my behalf.

271
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,600
Idiot. Please don't die.

272
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Your Majesty. Sorry, I'm late.

273
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Clean up the mess. I'll return to the palace to check on Bai Lu.

274
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,100
Noted.

275
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,000
She's awake.

276
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,400
She's awake.

277
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Bai Lu, you're finally awake.

278
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,000
Slowly.

279
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,800
Are you feeling any discomfort?

280
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,000
What happened to me?

281
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,400
Someone cast a curse on your life star.

282
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,800
Fortunately, I found out before it was too late

283
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
and set up the protective array for you.

284
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,600
I bought you an extra 24 hours.

285
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,700
His Majesty and his men found the mystic.

286
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,700
They destroyed the array and managed to save your life.

287
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,700
I said I'm fine.

288
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,600
♫ If you didn't stop by at that time
If I turn around without saying a word ♫

289
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
I'll take my leave.

290

♫ If the night refused to fall ♫

291

♫ Maybe I should continue to squander my life away ♫

292
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,400
♫ Or maybe once you leave, there'll be no more news of you ♫

293
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,500
♫ I had witnessed the grand fireworks several times,
flashing in the air ♫

294
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,400
♫ I had witnessed several beautiful sunsets ♫

295

♫ Eyes filled with warmth when you passed by ♫

296
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,500
You're awake.

297
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,600
Do you like how I look now?

298
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,600
♫ I've not been able to cry for a very long time,
but I'm now shedding tears because for you ♫

299
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,400
Why are you sitting upright?

300

♫ Wandering and being lonely for most of my life,

304

♫ That dissipates with the night breeze ♫

306

309
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,400
♫ Pouring everything into your heart ♫

310
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,300
Who hurt you?

311
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
Some skillful men.

312
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
A group of skillful men.

313
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,000
They are just a few cunning little thieves.

314
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,600
If it weren't for my carelessness...

315
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,000
But previously, your wounds heal instantly.

316
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Why hasn't it healed yet?

Of course, I need to make sure you see it. Right?

♫ Eyes filled with warmth when you passed by ♫

322
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,600
Your Majesty has always been a righteous man who puts the people before everything.

323
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,200
For you, it's never about one man's well-being.

324
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
Why did you do that for me?

325
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,800
In fact,

326
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm not a good emperor.

327
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,800
I haven't done enough for the people of the country.

328
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,100
But somehow, I want to do everything for you.

329
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,400
Get it?

330
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,200
I don't.

331
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,400
Right. I knew you wouldn't get it.

332
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,900
I don't quite understand it myself either.

333
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,000
Why did I fall for a cold-hearted

334
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
and ungrateful woman like you?

335
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,800
You...

336
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,700
♫ It started as ripples and slowly turned into waves ♫

337
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,000
♫ I'll never forget the ups and downs I went through ♫

338
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:33,700
♫ I'm full of hope, waiting for you to drop by ♫

339
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Someone!

340
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,200
What's wrong?

341
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,800
What happened to her? She passed out.

342
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
Check on her.

343
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,100
What's wrong?

344
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,200
Your Majesty, Director Bai is fine.

345
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,600
But the curse has just been lifted.

346
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,000
She hasn't fully regained her energy yet.

347
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,900
What she needs now is some rest.

348
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
True.

349
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,500
Bai Lu needs a good rest.

350
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll return to my palace first.

351
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,100
Have a safe trip, Your Majesty.

352
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
What happened? Why did she pass out again?

353
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Yun Wen, do something.

354
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
It seems like we're only left with one option.

355
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,200
I'll have to use the ultimate trick I learned from an ancient book.

356
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,500
Stop talking and start working.

357
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,900
Do me a favor. Add water to a handful of soil.

358
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,600
Add water?

359
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
I need some guts, too.

360
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,600
We'll grind it to paste

361
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,500
and spread it on her face, then her lips.

362
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,000
Yun Wen!

363
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,400
Enough of the nonsense.

364
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,610
Such nonsense.

365
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,380
Are you all right?

366
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,600
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

367
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,900
This wouldn't have happened if you'd done that earlier.

368
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,500
You...

369
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,500
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

370
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
Your Majesty.

371
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,540
How did Your Majesty get hurt?

372
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,820
Bai Lu fell seriously ill.

373
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,940
Your Majesty, I only want to know how Your Majesty got hurt.

374
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,560
I'm fine. I just need to wait for it to heal.

375
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,090
Your Majesty, you should take better care of yourself.

376
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,670
Ling Yun.

377
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,640
This has nothing to do with Ling Yun.

378
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,130
I was being careless.

379
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,960
I understand that Your Majesty cares for Bai Lu,

380
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,280
but you should know your boundaries, too.

381
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,810
I know what the right thing to do is.

382
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,820
Go back and get some rest.

383
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,710
Your Majesty, we captured all 52 men, including the mystic, on the spot.

384
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,400
However, I'm sure Duanmu Yan from the Bureau of Astrology was involved in this.

385
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,680
I think we should start by questioning him.

386
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,300
There are quite a few ungrateful men in the Bureau of Astrology.

387
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,380
Ling Yun.

388
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,390
Tell the Bureau of Justice to carry out an investigation.

390
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,070
Yes.

391
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,190
Where is Director Bai?

392
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,150
Director Bai is resting. I can do it if there's anything that needs approval.

393
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,550
What should we do with Duanmu Yan's undone work?

394
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,590
We can just share the work, right?

395
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,700
But...

396
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,970
Just do as he said.

397
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,970
Yes.

398
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,740
You're awake.

399
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,450
I'm completely fine now.

400
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,260
It's time for you to help me build the time-traveling passage.

401
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,160
Do you still want to go back in time?

402
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,930
Then, you should hurry up and find the Ice Crystals.

403
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,060
I know what I should do with the Ice Crystals. Come here.

404
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,330
I have a question for you.

405
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,920
What is it?

406
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,120
What are you going to do after this?

407
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,210
I refuse to answer your question.

408
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,990
Refuse?

409
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,630
Duanmu Yan is now in prison.

410
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,480
He is certainly involved in this. What are you planning to do?

411
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,220
He...

412
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,120
I forgot about this.

413
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,350
He tried to hurt me?

414
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,730
It's not making any sense.

415
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,220
Director Bai, help!

416
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,800
I am innocent. I don't know anything about it.

417
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,230
Did you wrong him?

418
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,870
That's not true.

419
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,640
You were on leave that day.

420
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,170
How did you know about the curse and the fact that she would die in 24 hours?

421
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,990
I... I was... I was recruiting new members for the bureau.

422
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,450
Then... Then... After that...

423
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,200
Calm down. Take your time.

424
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,410
Tell us what happened.

425
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,550
I don't know that man.

426
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,030
I simply bumped into him.

427
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,490
I saw how good his secret art skills were

428
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,450
and thought he could work for the Bureau of Astrology.

429
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,630
I didn't know he would do this to you, Director Bai.

430
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,270
It was never my intention.

431
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,640
Duanmu Yan, I don't even know what to say about you.

432
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,690
You're always getting ahead of yourself and think everyone else is a fool.

433
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,690
You're always not around.

434
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,460
What actually were you doing when you were away?

435
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,420
Under the guise of submitting official documents,

436
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,450
you colluded with many other officials.

437
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:15,100
I guess you want more than being the director of the Bureau of Astrology.

438
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,440
I... It's not true.

439
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,260
It's not true.

440
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,530
Duanmu Yan, let me ask you.

441
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,310
Why didn't you tell us when you knew about it?

442
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,110
It wasn't my doing.

443
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,620
It really wasn't my doing.

444
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,180
I only gave him a few things of yours.

445
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,070
I... I...

446
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,840
Forget it.

447
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,000
I found the Ice Crystals for you.

448
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,490
But it is very expensive considering the large quantity.

449
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,850
It will also take a few days to get them delivered.

450
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,090
I didn't know the Ice Crystals needed for the construction of the time-traveling passage were so expensive.

451
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,500
Yi Wuyou.

452
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,910
Yezi, how can I help you?

453
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,810
I'm here to show you something.

454
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,870
What is it?

455
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,200
I've been carrying this amber pendant with me since I was a kid.

456
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,440
I suppose it's quite rare.

457
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,710
Can you help me sell it?

458
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,840
Is business the only thing we can talk about now?

459
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,910
Don't you have any feelings left for me?

460
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,720
We can only move forward, not backward.

461
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,660
We can activate the time-traveling passage once Sister Lian has her wedding.

462
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,590
You must help me set up the array at that time.

463
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,500
Let me ask you. Can the activation of the time-traveling passage

464
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,090
really change the past?

465
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,200
How many times have I told you this?

466
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,530
Yes, you can travel back in time. But if you want to change it,

467
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,940
it will depend on the decisions you make.

468
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,290
My decisions?

469
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,430
Does it mean I can change the past if I make the right decision?

470
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,130
In fact...

471
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,480
Theoretically, yes.

472
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,660
You only have to change your obsession.

473
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,800
For example, you want to go back in time to save Qihai Rui.

474
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,870
You will succeed

475
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,220
as long as she survives.

476
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,470
However, if the key figure makes a different decision,

477
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,980
everything else will change, too.

478
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,330
So you should think it over.

479
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,830
If I travel back in time,

480
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:23,020
maybe Yu Xiuming won't fall for me.

481
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,370
Why did you want to see me, Young Master?

482
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,870
How many gold beads do we have in Ningzhou?

483
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,990
Around... 80,000 to 90,000.

484
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,240
Great.

485
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,040
Take 30,000 gold beads

486
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,090
and pay off the money we owe from buying the Ice Crystals.

487
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,870
Yes.

488
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,330
Yezi, I'll keep the amber pendant for you.

489
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,970
His Majesty wants us to stay in the South Palace temporarily during our visit to Tianqi.

490
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,510
These are the fabric and utensils rewarded by His Majesty.

491
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,510
These fabrics are worth a lot.

492
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,580
Instead of making a wedding gown with it,

493
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,840
we should sell it in the west of the town.

494
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,830
This is worth quite some gold beads.

495
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:32,300
A'Lian, His Majesty has converted the dowries into gold beads.

496
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,290
If we are to sell the fabric when we're supposed to make our wedding gowns with it,

497
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,940
we'll make His Majesty look bad.

498
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,390
It's just like saying that His Majesty is stingy.

499
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,700
You're right. I wasn't being considerate.

500
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,850
Anyway, it's been a long time since you last made new gowns for yourself.

501
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,520
Let's use the fabric and make you a new gown.

502
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,740
Sure. I'll listen to you.

503
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,390
Sister Lian.

504
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,620
Sister Lian, look who's here.

505
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,620
Yezi. You're here.

506
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,400
Sister Lian.

507
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,150
You don't have to come so early since you are busy at work.

508
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,790
It's your wedding. Of course, I have to come early.

509
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,290
Also, A'Rui would be really happy

510
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,100
if she got to see this too.

511
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,280
Maybe one day, you'll find the right man too.

512
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,693
Then, you'll understand why I'm doing this.

513
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,360
I understand.

514
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:50,615
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

515
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:54,015
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

516
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:58,895
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

517
00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:03,695
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

518
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,115
♫ The stars as the inkstone ♫

519
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:12,195
♫ Writing with the light of the sea ♫

520
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:16,255
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

521
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:19,495
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

522
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:24,820
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

523
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:29,355
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

524
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:31,855
♫ Void of someone ♫

525
00:43:31,855 --> 00:43:37,228
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

526
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:40,235
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

527
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:43,435
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

528
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:50,075
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

529
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:56,255
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

530
00:43:56,255 --> 00:44:02,848
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

531
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:09,235
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

532
00:44:09,235 --> 00:44:15,415
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

533
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:18,675
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

534
00:44:18,675 --> 00:44:22,275
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

535
00:44:22,275 --> 00:44:28,535
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

536
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:34,795
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

537
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:41,495
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

538
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:47,815
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

539
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:54,155
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

540
00:44:56,275 --> 00:45:06,915
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
