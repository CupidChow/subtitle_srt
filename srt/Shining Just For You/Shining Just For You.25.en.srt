Any clues?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,300
I asked a few mystics to check Fengyin's body.

18
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,900
They said that they'd never seen...

a body like that.

It's a secret arts skill that has never appeared before.

there would've been no end to the constant wars and divergences among the Nine States.

The emperor who deserves this position more than I do is not you.

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
Are you...

167
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,200
still willing to be my empress?

168
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,800
♫ Pulling out, leaving it be ♫

169
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,200
♫ The gap between us is hard to close ♫

170
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
We can't change the past.

171
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
Yes.

172
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,600
I will be by your side from now on.

173
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,700
I don't regret it.

174
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,800
I don't regret it, either.

175
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,540
Your Majesty.

176
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,560
Bai Lu, despite what happened, you are still willing to be with me

177
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,690
and stay by my side forever. Right?

178
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,950
Yes.

179
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,850
I'm going to be your empress.

180
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
What happened?

181
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,860
- Why are they here?
- What's going on?

182
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,800
The Fan Family has committed treason.

183
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,290
What's happening now?

184
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,970
This is not the end yet.

185
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,170
Yao Song.

186
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,770
Sir.

187
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,760
Arrest the traitor!

188
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,020
What's going on?

189
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,470
Official Fan, Fan Ruhui,

190
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,340
His Majesty already knew about your treachery.

191
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,580
You are doomed now.

192
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,490
You!

193
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,690
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

194
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,500
Be at ease.

195
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,570
Leave us be.

197
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,820
Let me take off your clothes for you.

199
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,590
Your wound.

200
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,940
I'm fine.

201
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,220
You already knew about Fan Ruhui's plan?

202
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,450
Yes.

203
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,860
Is that why you didn't allow me

204
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,580
to enter Qianyuan Hall today?

205
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,300
But I was the one who made the plan for today.

206
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,730
We promised to live together and die together.

207
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,910
He hated me for a long time.

208
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,640
And he'd do anything to kill me.

209
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
I couldn't put you in danger.

210
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,370
But not everything...

211
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,510
that happened today was as you expected. Right?

212
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,540
Are you talking about Yi Wuyou?

213
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,970
Yes.

214
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,350
I never thought that he'd acquired an artifact.

215
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,840
But so what?

216
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,060
I... still won.

217
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,550
But you are seriously injured.

218
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,780
I have once promised you

219
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,190
that I would accompany you forever

220
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,560
and travel across the Nine States.

221
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,230
But I'm afraid that this time, I'll have to break my promise.

222
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,460
Your Majesty, it won't happen.

223
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,670
No one can kill you.

224
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,840
I... trusted a lot of people.

225
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,460
And I wanted to share the world with them.

226
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,910
But in the end,

227
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,260
they either wanted to kill me,

228
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,240
or I had no choice but to kill them.

229
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,560
I'm... not afraid of death.

230
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,570
But I feel a smidgen of regret.

231
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,090
The world is so big.

232
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,520
But there are so few who actually understand me.

233
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,240
Bai Lu,

234
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,060
I know that you are the person

235
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,950
who knows me best in this world.

236
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,810
♫ The mountains are my heart ♫

237
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,426
♫ The rivers are my eyes ♫

238
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:34,138
♫ And the flora is the peace of my heart ♫

239
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:37,330
♫ Separated from one another ♫

240
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,070
Look. It's a happy day today.

241
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,050
Why are you crying?

242
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,690
Let me dress your wound for you.

243
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,430
I'm fine.

244
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,670
I'll recover tomorrow.

245
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,330
Your Majesty, even if you will recover tomorrow,

246
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,890
your wound will still hurt today.

247
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,460
Let it hurt then.

248
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:12,660
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

249
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:18,220
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

250
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,860
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

251
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:31,200
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

252
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,448
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

253
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:40,615
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

254
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:43,835
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

255
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:50,475
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

256
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:56,590
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

257
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:03,338
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

258
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:09,730
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

259
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:16,086
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

260
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:30,000
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫

261
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,690
Your Majesty, Commander Ling has been waiting outside for a long time.

262
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,680
Your Majesty.

263
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,750
What is it that is so urgent?

264
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,760
Fan Ruhui committed suicide in prison.

265
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,010
Okay, I got it.

266
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,070
Ling Yun. Interrogate the guilty ones of the Fan Family.

267
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,360
Then, give me a list of their crimes.

268
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

269
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,050
The assets of the Fan Family have been confiscated.

270
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,290
All of the names of the relatives are on this list.

271
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:05,970
We've confiscated more than 340,000 gold beads and 2,400 pieces of jewelry.

272
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,200
Commander Ling.

273
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,350
First Young Master.

274
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,090
May I ask about my father and brother?

275
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,550
Your father and brother are already dead.

276
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,740
I've been ordered to confiscate the Fan Family's properties.

277
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,730
Please forgive me.

278
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,830
Long live Your Majesty!

279
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,100
You may rise.

280
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

281
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,330
I... have married my empress according to the will of God.

282
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,580
We are protected by the gods in the celestial world.

283
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,450
The empress's life star complements mine.

284
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:19,120
From today onward, we will build the world

285
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,530
and protect it together.

286
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:30,020
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,580
The winged man, Yi Wuyou, colluded with Fan Ruhui to commit treason.

288
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,390
Xie Yu'an.

289
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,990
What's the progress of the investigation?

290
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:53,490
Your Majesty, Xue Xuanjing and Xue Lanwei have already been killed.

291
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,580
Fan Ruhui committed suicide in prison.

292
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,580
And his second son, Fan Zheng, fell off a cliff to his death during a chase.

293
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:06,420
The eldest son of the Fan Family, Fan Ping, and the eldest grandson, Fan Tianshou, are not involved in this.

294
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,880
They've been demoted to commoners.

295
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,170
Okay. I got it.

296
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,270
What's the progress of the construction of the canal?

297
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,560
Official Gu, how long and how much money

298
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,430
do you think it'll take to work on the canal?

299
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,730
Your Majesty.

300
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,400
We can start in three months' time.

301
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,500
But it'll be winter in three months.

302
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,840
So, the construction will cost more time.

303
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,640
What do you think?

304
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,200
I've always supported the construction of the canal.

305
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,450
We've asked the people of Ningzhou, Wanzhou, and Lanzhou for their labor service before.

306
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,470
And now, Zhongzhou needs people to strengthen the embankment due to the flood.

307
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,680
We don't have enough people to work on this.

308
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,320
Your Majesty, we haven't asked Yuezhou for their labor service this year.

309
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,300
We can ask them to do that now.

310
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,610
What do you think?

311
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,170
The people of Yuezhou are quite supportive of the construction of this canal.

312
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,070
I think they are the best choice for this job.

313
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,370
Your Majesty, if the people of my clan can complete this project,

314
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,810
I have a favor to ask.

315
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,950
The construction of the canal can help with the flood issue in Zhongzhou.

316
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,660
It'll be an act of kindness.

317
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,860
I hope that you can pardon the people of Yuezhou

318
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,310
who have once gone against you.

319
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,140
Give them the freedom to travel around,

320
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,050
and let them be good citizens of Chao.

321
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,780
That's a great idea.

322
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,980
What you are proposing is the right thing to do.

323
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,930
Of course, I'll pardon them.

324
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,070
We'll do as Her Majesty suggested.

325
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,640
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,620
Please have a seat.

327
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,820
Were you looking at the path of the canal?

328
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,430
Yes.

329
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,700
Official Xie, I have something to ask.

330
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,180
Based on my design of the canal, how many people will be living near the canal?

331
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,990
More than 100,000 people I think.

332
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,680
That many?

333
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,790
What is it? Are you planning something?

334
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,920
I want to use the canal as a pathway for business.

335
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,800
So, I'm thinking, if it's possible, to ask the people near the canal to become merchants.

336
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,120
All of them?

337
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,610
It's really considerate of you to worry about the livelihood of the people.

338
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,280
But it won't be easier than building the canal itself.

339
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,010
I... I can't promise anything.

340
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,260
I understand. Please do your best then.

341
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,710
I will.

342
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,800
After the canal is built, I'll do my best to promote this idea.

343
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,860
You can plan for it beforehand when you get back to Zhongzhou.

344
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,410
I'll do as you say.

345
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,470
Please accept my thanks.

346
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:13,624
[One Year Later]

347
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

348
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,030
Brother Gu, I heard that the construction of the canal will be completed soon.

349
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,460
That's right. I've completed it on schedule.

350
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,470
After you and His Majesty stamp on the as-built drawing of the canal and name it,

351
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,260
the canal can be open to traffic.

May Yunwang Canal be useful to our future generations.

360
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,950
Long live the Emperor and Empress of Chao!

361
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,890
After Yunwang Canal was open to traffic,

362
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,860
the Emperor of Chao fell ill.

363
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,480
Fortunately, he managed to recover after receiving an effective prescription.

364
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,790
Sixteen years later, his son took over the throne.

365
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,460
He cut down the taxes for the people and won over his people with his virtue.

366
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,070
He ruled the nation with a kind hand.

367
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:06,000
Finally, the Nine States were united and in harmony.

368
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,430
Yuezhou that was once remote and isolated

369
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,430
can be reached easily through the canal now.

370
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:21,510
The once desolate and barren land is now blessed with a bountiful harvest.

371
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,940
Finally, the remaining people of Yebei

372
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,310
gain equality and liberty in Chao.

373
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,240
