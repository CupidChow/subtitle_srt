Why don't we forget...

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,020
Shut up.

We have no choice but to go along with it.

The time when the sundial shines with a blue hue is the best time for us to activate our magic array.

You must remember that.

Yezi?

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,920
What are you doing? Someone might find out, you know?

26
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,820
I saw His Majesty yesterday. He mentioned your name out of the blue.

27
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,790
Could it be that he has realized something?

28
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,330
Is it possible that Huo Lu has betrayed us?

29
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,760
I've read your letter.

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,620
And I understand Huo Lu might not be reliable.

31
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,220
However, I cannot withdraw now.

32
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,410
- But now...
- Listen to me.

33
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,020
You mustn't participate in the assassination.

34
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,920
You've already done enough for Yebei.

35
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm not trying to protect myself here.

36
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,110
It's just that you guys are here to seek revenge, not to seek death. You should think twice.

37
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,220
There is no going back now.

38
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,240
This is the only thing I can do for Yebei.

The left pool is directly connected to Yongning Canal.

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,420
If anything happens, do not stay here and fight.

Retreat immediately, understand?

47
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,220
Take this Ice Crystal.

48
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,170
Use it immediately and forge a path if you're in an emergency.

No, thanks.

Just listen to me. Take it.

Yezi, I've made up my mind.

Yi Wuyou? Why are you here in Tianqi?

147
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,790
Mr. Yi, thank you for saving us.

148
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,540
Without you, we would've died at the Ceremony of Stars.

149
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,960
However, Mr. Yi, how did you know

150
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,070
that we were going to assassinate the emperor?

151
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,410
It was Yezi. She sent me a distress signal.

152
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,080
It's Yezi?

153
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,860
I guess we owe Yezi a favor this time.

154
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,870
Now, the emperor has her.

155
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,330
How do you guys plan to save her?

156
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,480
Before we started this operation,

157
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,300
we knew that we would die if we were captured.

158
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,080
So,

159
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,290
do you guys not plan to save her?

160
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,800
Chu Ye...

161
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,190
You survived tough times together.

162
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,400
She was the one who saved you.

163
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Young Master Yi, we're seriously injured now.

164
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
Forget about Yezi.

165
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,000
It's difficult for us to even locate the Grand Princess.

166
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,920
Young Master, this is a huge case.

167
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,740
Those who are captured will surely be imprisoned.

168
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,830
You shouldn't take the risk.

169
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,420
Young Master!

170
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,550
I beg you guys! I know my fault now!

171
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,200
Please release me!

172
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,640
Tao Liang! Tao Liang!

173
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,540
Release me!

174
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,000
Did Sister Lian manage to escape?

175
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
Someone! Release me!

176
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,630
Tao Liang, shut up!

177
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,280
You're a disgrace to the warriors of Yebei!

178
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,460
I did nothing!

179
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,930
All of them escaped!

180
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,800
Why did you lock me up?

181
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,220
Release me!

182
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
Release me!

183
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,730
Release me!

184
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,570
Release me!

185
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,000
Release me!

186
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,540
All of you may leave.

187
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

188
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,150
The power of the Divine Mirror is dissipating.

189
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,380
My wound doesn't heal instantly now.

190
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,780
Your Majesty, Fengyin seeks an audience.

191
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,140
Your Majesty, we've slain and captured seven of the assassins.

192
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,650
What about Qihai Lian?

193
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,860
She's on the run.

194
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,170
They escaped through Yongning Canal.

195
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,160
That means they're still in Tianqi.

196
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,490
Tianqi isn't a huge place.

197
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,640
Can't you guys even locate her?

198
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,180
We chased her all the way to the south side of the city.

199
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,420
But suddenly, she disappeared.

200
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,880
Your Majesty, we encountered Commander-in-Chief as well.

201
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,870
He was stabbed by Qihai Lian.

202
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,180
Stabbed?

203
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,330
Tell him to come here immediately.

204
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,000
This tea has a strange taste.

206
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,140
What did you put in the tea?

207
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,260
I put nothing.

208
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,810
I think...

209
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,380
I sense your rebellious intent in it.

210
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,950
I...

211
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,870
Your master spent a lot of effort and made arrangements

212
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,950
so that you could serve me.

213
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,620
Is this all you've got?

214
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,580
Your Majesty! I didn't! Your Majesty! I didn't!

215
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,380
I've already said everything.

216
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,890
You have no excuses now.

217
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,290
Such audacity!

218
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,600
Zhuying, she was not trying to assassinate me.

219
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,230
She wants to commit suicide.

220
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,400
Qihai Lian is but a pawn in the Ceremony of Stars.

221
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,000
It's the same for her.

222
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,380
They're scheming indeed.

223
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,410
Ling Yun!

224
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,200
Your Majesty.

225
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,660
Take her away.

226
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

227
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,190
Your Majesty, please spare me!

228
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,040
Zhuying, after she's been taken away,

229
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,400
she'll definitely die due to the torture.

230
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,030
You did this to her.

231
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,590
I...

232
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,350
But you've protected yourself instead.

233
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,450
Your Majesty, I...

234
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,500
Zhuying.

235
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,240
You grew up in the imperial camp.

236
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,440
I was the one who taught you how to wield a sword.

237
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,560
I trusted you and groomed you

238
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,940
way more than Fan Zheng and Fan Ping, who are my nephews!

239
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,500
After I returned from Yebei,

240
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,590
I left you in charge of Yebei.

241
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,800
Just take a look at the entire imperial court.

242
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,450
How many youngsters like you do you think are able to have their own land?

243
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,590
Your Majesty, I'm hugely indebted to you.

244
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,000
I see you as my son.

245
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,310
However, do you see me as your father?

246
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,030
Tell me! The assassins today, where did they come from?

247
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,350
I know my fault.

248
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,100
You know your fault?

249
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,780
Was that why you brought Qihai Lian to Tianqi

250
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,550
so that she could assassinate me during the Ceremony of Stars?

251
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,180
So, would you stab me in the chest for her?

252
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,840
Of course not.

253
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,550
I truly didn't know she came to Tianqi to assassinate you, Your Majesty.

254
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,960
I will give you a chance to redeem yourself.

255
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,500
Bring me Qihai Lian.

256
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,320
I don't know where she is.

257
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,530
Let me remind you, then.

258
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,540
When I sent Fengyin after her,

259
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,250
if I'm not mistaken, she was hiding right behind you.

260
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,950
Your Majesty!

261
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,590
Even if you won't tell me,

262
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,370
I have my covert guards and my 8,000 imperial soldiers.

263
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,650
I can easily locate one person.

264
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,450
Your Majesty, you can find her, of course.

265
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,580
But I truly don't know where she is.

266
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,690
Even if I do,

267
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,860
I can't possibly betray my loved one.

268
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,540
You're just like your father.

269
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,030
So headstrong...

270
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,740
and obstinate.

271
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,900
Your shift is so late.

272
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,270
What can I say? Being a warden is a tough job.

273
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,670
All right. We'll head there then.

274
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,200
[Prison]

275
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,360
Take her down.

276
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,590
Your Majesty, my father issued a made-up edict to eliminate the entire Yebei.

277
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,940
Qihai Lian was misled

278
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,440
and thought you wanted to erase the entire Yebei.

279
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,290
That's why she took the risk to assassinate you.

280
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,140
I know...

281
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,530
I know her very well.

282
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,830
If you can spare her,

283
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,470
I can talk to her. I'll tell her to surrender.

284
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,470
Why are you so certain that I will not find her?

285
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,680
Tianqi City isn't boundless. You will find her eventually.

286
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,120
But the Ceremony of Stars is today.

287
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,040
If the imperial army seals the city for a manhunt,

288
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,710
the ceremony will be blemished.

289
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,280
A few months apart

290
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,520
and you learned how to negotiate with me.

291
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,540
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

292
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,420
Your Majesty, we have Qihai Lian now.

293
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,300
See?

294
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,140
You have much more to learn.

295
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,300
Incarcerate Qihai Lian.

296
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

297
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,279
[Prison]

298
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,360
- Princess Lian!
- A'Liang.

299
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,110
- Princess Lian!
- A'Liang.

300
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,590
Princess Lian!
- Princess Lian!

301
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,890
Sister Lian.

302
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,800
Why are you here? Didn't you escape? How can this be?

303
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,020
I wanted to rescue you because I can't face A'Rui otherwise.

304
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,870
However...

305
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,790
Kill the assassin now.

306
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,450
Noted.

307
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,800
What are you doing? I am the mastermind.

308
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,950
Move.

309
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,860
They merely followed my orders.

310
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,990
Just kill me.

311
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,400
- Kneel.
- No!

312
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,230
- Behead him.
- No!

313
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,000
- Remove the body.
- No!

314
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,490
I got them killed...

315
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,990
I got them killed...

316
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,170
I don't care about me.

317
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,570
I just want you guys to live.

318
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,280
Sister Lian, don't worry.

319
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll find a way to get us out of here.

320
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,160
We won't die here.

321
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm not afraid of dying.

322
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,690
I'm just afraid that after I die,

323
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,680
Yebei will collapse from the lack of leadership.

324
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,130
And then, our people will truly be gone.

325
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,980
Tell me. How should I deal with them?

326
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,900
Your Majesty, I implore you to spare Qihai Lian's life.

327
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,260
I'm willing to receive her punishment.

328
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,324
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

329
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:34,150
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

330
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,950
Just look at you.

331
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,300
Get up. I won't kill her.

332
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,980
Bring her to me.

333
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,470
But before that, seal her celestial power.

334
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,030
Your Majesty, you won't kill her?

335
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,800
Did I ever lie to you growing up?

336
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

337
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

338
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,500
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

339
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,200
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

340
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,500
♫ Void of someone ♫

341
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,000
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

342
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

343
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

344
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,300
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

345
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:38,300
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

346
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,500
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

347
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,200
His Majesty wishes to see Qihai Lian.

348
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,500
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

349
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,200
He wants to see me?

350
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,200
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

351
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,200
But after I leave, what will become of them?

352
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,000
When you led them to the coup,

353
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,100
did you ever think what would become of them?

354
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,000
Let's go.

355
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,600
Sister Lian.

356
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Stay safe.

357
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,100
There was an assassination attempt during the Ceremony of Stars.

358
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,500
Director Bai was involved in it.

359
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
His Majesty is now holding the Bureau of Astrology accountable.

360
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,000
Supervisor Di is now...

361
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,300
dismissed and being investigated.

362
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,000
What...?

363
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,200
Director Bai has always earned His Majesty's favors.

364
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,000
She couldn't be involved in a coup.

365
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,800
Indeed.

366
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,000
Those who kept licking Bai Lu's boots.

367
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,800
Shouldn't they be dismissed, too?

368
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
Well...

369
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,800
Without Supervisor Di, who can run the Bureau of Astrology?

370
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,700
His Majesty hasn't issued an edict, but he did deliver an oral message.

371
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,100
He said due to a series of seditious attempts from our bureau,

372
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,700
we will be strictly monitored now.

373
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,800
He wants us to elect a new supervisor before meeting him.

374
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
Elect? How?

375
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,500
So the elected supervisor

376
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,700
has to give His Majesty a satisfying answer.

377
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,100
I'm young. I can run an errand.

378
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,800
But a supervisor? That's too much for me.

379
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,100
I can't do it.

380
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm too old for this. Please let me retire in peace.

381
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,000
I have been very sick lately. I want to take leave.

382
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,100
I confess I lack knowledge.

383
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,700
Maybe you can do it?

384
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,300
Me? No.

385
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,800
I can't.

386
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Director Cheng, it seems like everyone here

387
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,000
believes you are the smartest among us.

388
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,800
Yes, it has to be you.

389
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,700
I can't do this. I'm not as smart as Official Bai.

390
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,200
I am verifying Bai Lu's latest calculations.

391
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't have time.

392
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
This is putting us on the spot.

393
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Exactly.

394
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,800
My fellow colleagues.

395
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,000
Although I do not have any spectacular skills,

396
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,500
since none of you wants the position,

397
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,700
can I try then?

398
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
This...

399
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,200
Mr. Duanmu, you are cautious and hardworking.

400
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Our colleagues laud your work ethic,

401
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,400
and of course, we're happy to have you

402
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
help get us out of this predicament.

403
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,600
Right.

404
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,500
Let's do it.

405
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Di Lanzhang is dismissed. Bai Lu is charged with sedition.

406
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,600
Once His Majesty calms down,

407
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,500
the supervisor position of the Bureau of Astrology will be mine.

408
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,500
Time to eat.

409
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,200
Sister Lian, it's time to eat.

410
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Eat something at least.

411
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm now a cripple.

412
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,700
If not having magical power makes you a cripple,

413
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,000
then I was born a cripple.

414
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,500
When I was young, Dayuangu and I

415
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,200
met two outsiders in white robes.

416
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,800
They didn't think that I was a harbinger.

417
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,000
They said everyone has their duty.

418
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,800
She has been blessed by a Truth Master.

419
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,400
Her future holds infinite possibilities.

420
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,200
All these inauspicious dreams of hers

421
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,400
are nothing but proof

422
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,800
that she's able to foresee changes.

423
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm afraid she won't be able to live long if this goes on.

424
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Master, please show me a solution to this.

425
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Think about it.

426
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,700
The emperor decided not to take your life.

427
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,200
Instead, he sealed your secret techniques.

428
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,600
There must be a reason behind it.

429
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,700
Therefore, you need to recuperate and have a speedy recovery.

430
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,000
That way, you will be able to act accordingly.

431
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,900
Yezi.

432
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm sorry.

433
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,400
Why are you apologizing to me?

434
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,000
I've always thought that you approached A'Rui

435
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,900
to seek protection from her

436
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,400
and to live a better life.

437
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,900
But after what happened lately, I came to know

438
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,400
about the reason why A'Rui likes you so much

439
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,900
and why you're her best friend.

440
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,400
Ever since you arrived in Tianqi,

441
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,500
you've been dancing with death all the time.

442
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,600
In fact, you're stronger

443
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,000
than anyone from Yebei.

444
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You're braver than us all.

445
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Your Majesty, Qihai Lian isn't acting suspiciously in prison.

446
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,200
It's just that Bai Lu mentioned

447
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,300
that she met two men in white robes when she was young.

448
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,800
I suspect she was talking about the Truth Masters.

449
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,000
His Majesty has arrived!

450
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,200
Long live the Emperor of Chao!

451
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,500
All of you may rise.

452
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,200
Thank you, Your Majesty!

453
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,400
The Ceremony of Stars is an important ceremony of our state.

454
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,500
Unexpectedly, there was an act of assassination.

455
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,200
It is truly unpardonable.

456
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,000
Bureau of Justice.

457
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,400
How is the investigation coming along?

458
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Your Majesty.

459
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,600
The culprits on the run are from the Qihai Tribe of Yebei,

460
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
namely Chu Ye, Qing Zhan, and three other men.

461
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,900
We have been looking into them.

462
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,800
As for the rest involved, they have been captured.

463
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
And they shall be punished accordingly.

464
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,200
How?

465
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,100
Huo Lu, the Assistant Commander of the Imperial Army,

466
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,600
colluded with the assassins and attempted an act of assassination.

467
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
His body shall be decimated, and his whole family shall be executed.

468
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,800
Director Bai Lu of the Bureau of Astrology

469
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,600
conspired with the assassins and kept everyone in the dark.

470
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,200
- She shall be beheaded.
- Beheaded?

471
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,600
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,000
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

497
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:10,500
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
