[Episode 16]

15
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,460
Summon Bai Lu. I want to know the auspicious date.

16
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,450
Your Majesty, Director Bai has given instructions for us not to disturb her. She needs to concentrate.

17
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,430
Three days will be up soon.

18
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,180
Why... Why isn't she finished yet?

19
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,480
I'll go see her myself.

20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,290
Your Majesty, it hasn't been three days yet.

21
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,560
Enough. I'm not going there to collect a debt.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,351
Constructing the Unified Calendar of Chao is a tremendous merit that will go down in history!

23
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,440
Everyone here is working tirelessly, yet you've made such a huge mistake!

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,250
If you don't want your post, then get out of here!

25
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,750
Duanmu Yan, where's Director Bai?

26
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,450
Director Bai needs to concentrate. She will not see anyone!

27
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,090
Now, go!

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,440
What are you saying?

29
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,720
Your Majesty! I was wrong!

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
Your Majesty...

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
I see you're making use of your authority.

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,170
I don't dare, Your Majesty...

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,310
Where is Bai Lu?

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,700
Director Bai has asked to be left alone.

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,780
I will take Your Majesty to her.

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,100
But she has said that she does not want anyone to disturb her.

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,420
Does that include me as well?

38
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,630
No, of course not.

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,830
This way, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,570
Your Majesty. Please mind your step.

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,100
This way, Your Majesty.
[Silence]

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,710
Your Majesty, this way, please.

43
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,930
Halt.

44
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,230
Director Bai requires peace and quiet to concentrate.

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,980
No one is to disturb her.

46
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,830
Cheng Wu, His Majesty is here. Shouldn't you be greeting him?

47
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,100
Director Cheng Wu of the Bureau of Astrology greets Your Majesty.

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,410
Director Bai requires peace and quiet to concentrate. She will not be accepting any visitors.

49
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,520
Please go back, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,690
Are you talking to me?

51
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,370
Yes.

52
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,530
Interesting.

53
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,240
I haven't come across such boldness in many years.

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,250
You know His Majesty is here, and you dare to stop him.

55
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,760
Do you have a death wish, Cheng Wu?

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,300
How is that asking for a death wish?

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,420
Your Majesty ordered Director Bai to calculate the auspicious date.

58
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,370
That's why Director Bai is isolating herself.

59
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,270
She is doing this to focus on calculating the date for Your Majesty.

60
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,930
She cannot be disturbed!

61
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,240
How can she complete the task, otherwise?

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,270
So as long as I am here, I will not allow anyone to enter!

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,670
You won't allow me to enter?

64
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,240
- Your Majesty! She needs peace and quiet!
- Shut up!

65
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,950
She needs peace and quiet!

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,860
Playing tricks with me?

67
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,250
Let's go.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,060
A'Rui, look.

69
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,450
That star is shining even brighter now.

70
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,730
Do you mean my star?

71
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,310
Yes.

72
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,140
That star represents nobility and beauty.

73
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,970
So the brighter it shines,

74
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,200
the more it is proven that our Princess Rui's beauty

75
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,800
has graced the entire continent.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,050
Yezi, you're teasing me again.

77
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,080
Where is your star, then?

78
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
I don't know.

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,350
It's probably beside yours.

80
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,910
That's right.

81
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,190
You're four years older than I, but we were born on the same day and month.

82
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,940
Our stars must be beside each other.

83
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,670
But why can't I see it?

84
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,890
That's normal.

85
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:27,450
Because mine is a tiny, tiny little star.

86
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,560
That's not right, Yezi.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,490
You're amazing.

88
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,930
Growing up, there was nothing you couldn't do.

89
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,410
Yezi, can you stay here with me?

90
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,770
I don't want to part with you.

91
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,700
Your seal has been broken! This is all an illusion! Wake up, Bai Lu!

92
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,120
Bai Lu!

93
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,780
A'Rui, I just want you to be safe and happy.

94
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:00,560
All I need is to be by your side and watch over you.

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,970
That's all I need to be happy.

96
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,270
Me too.

97
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,550
Promise we'll stay together forever.

98
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,080
It's all an illusion! Wake up, Bai Lu!

99
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,360
It'll be too late if you don't wake up!

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,560
Wake up, Bai Lu!

101
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,240
Why... Why are you in my private quarters?

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,050
Your private quarters?

103
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,640
Is the one in the wrong making an accusation first?

104
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,170
Not a bad dummy you made.

105
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,160
Now, what about the auspicious date for my trip?

106
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,820
It's ready.

107
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,070
- Who told you to go there?
- No! That's not it!

108
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,250
- What's wrong with you?
- Director Bai told me to!

109
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,730
- You...
- Do you not know who that was?

110
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,100
My apologies, Great Steward.

111
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,550
You two are officials of Chao! Conduct yourselves properly!

112
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Is His Majesty inside?

113
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,180
Out of my way!

114
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,680
Hurry!

115
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,870
Why didn't you present it to me sooner, since you'd already finished the calculations?

116
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,270
I wanted to try another method

117
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,790
and cross-check it with the Unified Calendar of Chao before presenting it to you.

118
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,930
You claimed to be constructing the Unified Calendar of Chao.

119
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,520
Yet you got a fool to guard your door, and instead of working on the calendar,

120
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,010
I found you drunk and sleeping when the sun is already high!

121
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,180
I would like to concentrate on my work as well.

122
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,880
But how am I supposed to be at ease when I don't know if Sister Lian is alive or dead?

123
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,250
That's not a bad excuse.

124
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,720
I also have a matter I would like Your Majesty to enlighten me about.

125
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,540
Go on.

126
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,180
You deliberately let word get out

127
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,480
and made Zuo Jintian think that he would definitely be made the Protectorate General of Yuezhou,

128
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,610
but then you turned around and gave the position to Zhu Ying instead. Why?

129
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,980
You knew that Zuo Jintian was headstrong and bloodthirsty, but you still did it.

130
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,190
The moment he received the edict,

131
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,090
it was for sure that he would take it out on Zhuying and the people of Yebei. But you still did it.

132
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,610
Did you plan for all of this to happen all along?

133
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,020
Your analysis was formed based on the perspectives of the court and me.

134
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,830
You've improved.

135
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,590
So you knew what would happen to Sister Lian all along?

136
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,590
Why didn't you tell me?

137
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,100
If she knew that the only path of survival she risked her life for

138
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,300
was a path leading to her death that you had planned all along...

139
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,960
I feel sorry for her!

140
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,810
Consort Tian even said that you were with Zhu Ying all the time and that you guys were close!

141
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,010
Well, your closeness only meant promoting him in front of others

142
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,650
and instigating someone to go after him behind closed doors and drive him to the brink of his death!

143
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,040
That's the kind of man you are, Yu Xiuming.

144
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,710
You're a hypocrite, and you disgust me!

145
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,150
Enough!

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,400
I have indulged you too much.

147
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,700
So much that you've forgotten how to choose your words

148
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,300
and what words may have you to lose your head.

149
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,800
We request an audience with Your Majesty.

150
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
What is it?

151
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Your Majesty,

152
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,600
Great Steward Fan and a few other officials are outside,

153
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,700
requesting to see you.

154
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,100
Let them in.

155
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,500
Yes.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

157
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,500
- We request an audience...
- Fan Ruhai,

158
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
what is so urgent that you must rush all the way here?

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Did you want to see how she defied me?

160
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Did you want to imitate her and test my patience?

161
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,000
We dare not, Your Majesty.

162
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,000
Your Majesty, Bai Lu insulted and offended you.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
She should be beheaded.

164
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Please punish her, Your Majesty.

165
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,400
Bai Lu lost her composure after getting drunk and offended me.

166
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Throw her into prison...

167
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,500
and have her clear her mind.

168
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes.

169
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Official Bai...

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
She was supposed to be concentrating.

171
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
How did they get into a fight?

172
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
My goodness.

173
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,400
What's the use thinking about that?

174
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Without Bai Lu, it'll be over for the Bureau of Astrology!

175
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,200
What am I supposed to do with this mess?

176
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
If there's anything you don't know,

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,600
just go to the prison and ask Director Bai.

178
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
She was thrown into prison,

179
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
but she wasn't stripped of her position.

180
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,500
No one gets thrown into prison without losing their jobs!

181
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Actually, you might have a point.

182
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
It might be the case for others,

183
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
but she could be an exception.

184
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
On duty today?

185
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
[Prison]
Hold on.

186
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,800
Official documents for her to peruse again?

187
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,900
The Bureau of Astrology is something indeed.

188
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,700
Coming all this way to the prison to have the director peruse some documents?

189
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,600
Director Bai is only being held here.

190
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,300
She was not stripped of her position.

191
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,400
Besides, these are tasks ordered by His Majesty himself.

192
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,800
They must be approved by Director Bai.

193
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
We don't have a say in this.

194
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,700
Well, you can't keep coming here.

195
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,100
You're even bringing her food and blankets.

196
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Is she here to be imprisoned or enjoy herself?

197
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,200
Director Bai works tirelessly for the bureau.

198
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
Would you take responsibility

199
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,600
if she collapses due to a lack of good food?

200
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,800
- Fine. Go in.
- Thanks.

201
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,100
- Don't stay in there too long.
- Got it.

202
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,800
His Majesty has arrived!

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

204
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,800
What brings Your Majesty here today?

205
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,000
It seems you're rather down, Your Majesty.

206
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Am I?

207
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,100
There is no one in the whole harem

208
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
capable of affecting Your Majesty's mood.

209
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
I suppose.

210
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,100
I've always wondered about this.

211
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,200
Is Bai Lu an official

212
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,600
or a member of the harem to Your Majesty?

213
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,800
What do you think?

214
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Your Majesty is the most powerful in the world.

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
She will be whatever you wish her to be.

216
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Shall I summon Bai Lu?

217
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,000
We'll say that I want to catch up with her.

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,300
No need.

219
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,600
You won't be able to summon her.

220
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,000
I've put her in prison.

221
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
All done.

222
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,500
Official Bai, come back soon.

223
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,600
I want that too,

224
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
but it's not up to me.

225
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Thank you for the food.

226
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
Well, I'll come again tomorrow.

227
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,000
All right.

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,500
- Rest well.
- Go on.

229
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,600
Your Majesty.

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

231
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,600
I see you're enjoying yourself here.

232
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,800
It is quiet and peaceful here.

233
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,600
I can have them send me whatever I want to eat, too.

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

235
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,200
Why did you allow them to bring her food?

236
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
Well, Official Bai is a woman.

237
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
It's dark and humid in here.

238
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,100
If she can't rest well or eat well,

239
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,900
her body might not be able to take it.

240
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,100
If she dies, she cannot answer to Your Majesty,

241
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,800
and I will have committed a grave mistake.

242
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,800
It is rather comfortable here.

243
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Why don't you just stay here?

244
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,200
I like it here, too.

246
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,600
I don't need to tend to anyone or attend court.

247
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
It's a wonderful life.

248
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,000
As if I would let you.

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,600
Get back to your place and work hard in the Bureau of Astrology.

250
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Yes.

251
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Long live Your Majesty!

252
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Rise.

253
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

254
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,900
How is Zuo Jintian's case coming along?

255
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Your Majesty.

256
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,300
The Bureau of Justice decided on his conviction last night.

257
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,400
He has committed 11 crimes,

258
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,900
with treason being the most unforgivable.

259
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,600
Zuo Jintian may have committed suicide,

260
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,200
but punishment should be imposed on his corpse, and his whole family line should be disposed of.

261
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Official Yong,

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,100
you were recommended by the Great Steward.

263
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,200
Do not continue the less favorable practices of the previous dynasty.

264
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,700
Those officials in charge of criminal cases

265
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,900
often convicted wrongdoers of severe punishments

266
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
for the rulers to reduce their sentences.

267
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,100
The rulers believed that reducing the sentences

268
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,000
would make them appear benevolent.

269
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,100
However, giving grace beyond the law is the worst of all crimes.

270
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,800
From now on, offenders will be punished accordingly.

271
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,000
Do not speculate my thoughts,

272
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,700
and do not give harsher punishments than what is due.

273
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
I made poor judgment.

274
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

275
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,300
I will not punish you,

276
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,700
but this will be a lesson for you.

277
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,400
The case of Zuo Jintian

278
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
will be handled as you said.

279
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Follow every single word of it.

280
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,000
If you do not wish to be criticized by all people,

281
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
just do it.

282
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,100
Your Majesty...

283
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,800
Dismissed.

284
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,400
A few months ago, the Directorate of Astrology informed me

285
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,800
after observing the stars that Zuo Jintian would commit treason.

286
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Directorate of Astrology.

287
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Your Majesty.

288
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,300
A few days ago, I observed the stars and noticed

289
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,600
that there were signs of abnormal sway among the stars in the Lanque area.

290
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,200
According to the Book of Yao,

291
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,400
this was a sign of military revolt.

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
Dismissed.

293
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,300
Yes.

294
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,200
Zuo Jintian had served me for many years.

295
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
He had his merits,

296
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,200
so I thought I would summon him back to the capital

297
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
and give him a chance.

298
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,200
But the treacherous Zuo Jintian did not change his ways.

299
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
On the contrary, he grew worse and blatantly went against my orders.

300
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,600
I cannot forgive that.

301
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
I have ordered the Winged Guards

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,500
to seize his remaining forces in Xiayang as well.

303
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,700
Do not learn from Zuo Jintian.

304
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,600
Learn from Great Steward Fan.

305
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,100
He and Zuo Jintian are in-laws.

306
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,300
But when he learned of Zuo Jintian's unlawfulness,

307
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,400
he placed righteousness before his kin.

308
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,800
As officials, only by doing so

309
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,200
can I leave the court in your hands without worry.

310
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,300
How are the preparations for the tour of inspection coming along?

311
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,100
The preparations and rituals for the reception in the states and counties have been decided.

312
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,700
Here is the report. Please have a look, Your Majesty.

313
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,500
Your Majesty.

314
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
During the court session today,

315
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,600
I claimed that it was you who discovered Zuo Jintian's intention to rebel.

316
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,400
What are your thoughts on that?

317
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,700
The Bureau of Astrology was established

318
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,100
to make it easier to present Your Majesty's intentions and motives

319
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
as heaven's will, wasn't it?

320
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,000
I have no thoughts on the matter.

321
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,000
I will be leaving to tour the kingdom.

322
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,200
Do you not wish to come with me?

323
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,300
No.

324
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,600
If there's nothing else,

325
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
I shall excuse myself now.

326
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,400
This is strange.

327
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
The light of Sister Lian's life star

328
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,800
has dimmed, but it hasn't gone out.

329
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,500
So why does everyone think she is dead?

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
Don't nudge me.

331
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm only responsible for constructing the Unified Calendar of Chao.

332
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Ask Official Bai about the stuff related to the tour of inspection.

333
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,100
Director Bai.

334
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes, Official Duanmu?

335
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,600
We just received the itinerary for His Majesty's tour of inspection.

336
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Please have a look.

337
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
I entrusted the matters about the tour to you.

338
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
No need to ask me about it anymore.

339
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's an order.

340
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,700
His Majesty gave the order himself.

341
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,200
Perhaps you should at least read it?

342
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
All right.

343
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,300
Read it out loud for everyone.

344
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,400
Yes.

345
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,400
"His Majesty shall depart from Tianqi

346
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
and proceed to Liaoyang, the capital of Zhongzhou.

347
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,100
After that, His Majesty specifically ordered a trip be made to Minzhong Mountain."

348
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,500
Minzhong Mountain?

349
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,600
I think I've heard of that place before.

350
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,500
"Addendum to Chao's Record of Crimes in the Righteous Pursuit of Justice"?

351
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,300
Go through this book. This might be the one.

352
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,400
"The Cai Family and the Wei Family

353
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,700
sent more than 100,000 troops to besiege the emperor at Minzhong Mountain.

354
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,000
The emperor was severely wounded but fought on with a thousand guards.

355
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,400
He fell into a dangerous situation, his life hung on the line.

356
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,700
Yet, nine days later, it was as if he had received a divine blessing.

357
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,400
He charged into the enemy's camp alone and slayed the commander of the Wei Army."

358
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Minzhong Mountain...

359
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,200
Even after being severely wounded in Minzhong Mountain,

360
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,300
he was still able to charge into the enemy's camp alone.

361
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,400
Could it be that a Truth Master

362
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,600
gave him divine powers in Minzhong Mountain?

363
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,200
If he met a Truth Master in Minzhong Mountain,

364
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,700
then the Truth Master's array must be there.

365
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,400
Well, that's bad news for you.

366
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
If you had agreed to go with him,

367
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,000
you could've easily gone there to find the array.

368
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
How are preparations for the tour coming along?

369
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,200
Your Majesty.

370
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
I've told you, haven't I?

371
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
You will be responsible for all the matters during the tour.

372
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm sure that with you in charge,

373
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,200
everyone will carry out their duties responsibly.

374
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,000
I will do my best not to disappoint Your Majesty.

375
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,600
Your Majesty...

376
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,800
What is it now?

377
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,600
At least hundreds or thousands of memorials are presented to me a year.

378
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,300
If I have to go through every single one of them,

379
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,600
then what use do I have for the officials in court?

380
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Yes, of course.

381
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
Your Majesty, there is one more.

382
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
More?

383
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
Well, I guess there's no need for Your Majesty

384
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,800
to go through the list of accompanying members, after all.

385
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,900
Wait.

386
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,700
Now, that's what you should have me peruse.

387
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,200
Give it to me.

388
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,400
There are quite a lot of people coming along.

389
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,200
Have you gone through all of this?

390
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,800
I believe they are all appropriate.

391
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
Fan Ruhui.

392
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,700
There will be no need for the Directorate of Astrology to come along.

393
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,200
How should I bring it up to him?

395
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,600
Stop.

396
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,800
His Majesty has given orders that no one is to go near him.

397
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
I have the Qilin Fang Token.

398
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,100
The order applies to the holders of the Qilin Fang Token, too.

399
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
No way...

400
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Could you...

401
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
What's with that attitude?

402
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,400
Without you, he can still go on the tour.

403
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,800
But without him, you can't go.

404
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
That's why he can act like that.

405
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
Well, he's high and mighty.

406
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,100
But I wouldn't bother playing nice if I didn't have to.

407
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,800
Your Majesty.

408
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It's not as if I don't have other clothes.

409
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Why go through all this trouble?

410
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,300
It's my first time sewing clothes.

411
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,500
Others might make fun of the clothes I make if you wear them inside the palace.

412
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,700
But it should be fine if you wear them on your tour.

413
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,900
Consider it granting my little wish, Your Majesty.

414
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,400
Perfect.

415
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,600
I heard Your Majesty decided not to bring Bai Lu along.

416
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
She needs to construct the Unified Calendar of Chao.

417
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
She can't be distracted.

418
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,500
I think it's more likely Your Majesty got into an argument with her.

419
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,800
Ling Yun certainly has a loose tongue now.

420
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,300
It's not him.

421
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,600
I could tell from how listless you look.

422
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,600
Preposterous.

423
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,200
She may appear to be sweet with her words,

424
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,300
but she has all sorts of tricks up her sleeves.

425
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,000
Even ten of you are no match for her.

426
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,600
Why would I compete against her?

427
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,000
Your Majesty bickers with her,

428
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,800
but you enjoy it.

429
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,000
I am happy for you.

430
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,600
Don't say that.

431
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,500
I want nothing to do with her.

432
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,100
All right.

433
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,600
Why are all of you here?

434
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

435
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,400
It is the princess!

436
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
- Grand Princess!
- Sister Lian!

437
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
- Your Highness.
- This is wonderful!

438
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Your Highness... Is it really you?

439
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,800
You're alive!

440
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
The gods of the stars have blessed us!

441
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Our leader has returned!

442
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,400
The gods of the stars have blessed us!

443
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,600
Our leader has returned!

444
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,100
Your Highness...

445
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Your Highness.

446
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,400
Her Highness has returned! Clear the offerings!

447
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
Yes.

448
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,100
Isn't that Zhu Ying's sword?

449
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,600
Yes.

450
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
If it weren't for General Zhu Ying,

451
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,200
most of us wouldn't have been here right now.

452
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,800
General Zhu Ying is a great benefactor of Yebei.

453
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
So we took it upon ourselves

454
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,900
to pray and give offerings to both him and you together.

455
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,200
I never thought that the people of Yebei

456
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
would pray and give offerings to me one day.

457
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,200
Thank you.

458
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
Where did this sword come from?

459
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,600
Madam Sang Dan, where did the sword come from?

460
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,880
What? Is there something I don't know?

461
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,600
General Cheng says he wants to be my father.

462
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,700
General!

463
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,520
You've actually returned!

464
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,800
- General!
- General!

465
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,280
Get up.

466
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,140
My good brother. We're safe, all thanks to you.

467
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,560
Great! The general is back!

468
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,240
Yes, this is great!

469
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,380
General! The general has returned!

470
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,620
This is great!

471
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,900
- General!
- General!

472
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,520
- General.
- Have you been well?

473
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,980
We've been well, General.

474
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,500
- This is great!
- That's right, General!

475
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,920
This is great, General! You're finally back!

476
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,980
The general is back!

477
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,820
Sister Lian...

478
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,060
Sister Lian is alive!

479
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,840
Official Bai.

480
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,560
Commander Ling.

481
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,360
His Majesty has summoned you.

482
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

483
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,300
[Ancient Book]

484
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,160
Rise.

485
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,640
Your Majesty, the Bureau of Astrology has calculated the dates of the unified calendar for next year.

486
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,080
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

487
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,220
No need.

488
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,280
Give it to Fan Ruhui.

489
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,820
It will be issued kingdom-wide in the tenth month of this year.

490
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,540
Yes.

491
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,180
Your Majesty, regarding the tour of inspection,

492
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,840
I...

493
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,700
I will be away to inspect the kingdom.

494
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,520
I'll leave you in charge of the Bureau of Astrology.

495
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,340
I thought, during this time, I...

496
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,380
During this time, you will construct the Unified Calendar of Chao.

497
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,460
For you and for Chao, you must complete this task well.

498
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,560
Your Majesty, I don't think the Unified Calendar of Chao needs to be completed so soon.

499
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,680
- I was hoping to—
- No need to rush.

500
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,800
Slow work does fine work.

501
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,160
A little progress a day will see great gains.

502
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,280
Thank you for your consideration, Your Majesty.

503
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,740
- But I still...
- You can.

504
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,500
If you need anything, go to Fan Ruhui.

505
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,360
I knew Your Majesty was generous and benevolent.

506
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,120
I knew you wouldn't stay hung up on it.

507
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,960
That's true. But that doesn't mean that everything will be as you want them to be.

508
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,400
I see that you're in good spirits today.

509
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,746
Did you learn the news about Qihai Lian?

510
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,760
Is that really something to be so happy about?

511
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
Of course!

512
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,940
Isn't Your Majesty happy to learn that General Zhu Ying is alive?

513
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,960
No.

514
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,280
That useless boy has disgraced me.

515
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,400
What? Is it disgraceful of him to die for Sister Lian?

516
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,920
There's nothing disgraceful about dying for a woman.

517
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,340
But when faced with a bold but foolhardy man such as Zuo Jintian,

518
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,940
he dared not duel him.

519
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,960
Instead, he surrendered himself and did nothing.

520
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,440
He wasted all the things I've taught him for over ten years.

521
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,660
That's more like you.

522
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,940
What?

523
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm only myself when I'm nice to you and not myself when I ignore you?

524
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,100
No. I was referring to what you said.

525
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,580
That everything can be handled with a sword in hand.

526
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,440
That sounds very much like you.

527
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,260
The worst thing that can happen is death.

528
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,660
If he had fought, he could've stood a chance to survive.

529
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,680
When I was his age,

530
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,860
I survived all sorts of obstacles and challenges by doing the same thing.

531
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,240
Would you have just surrendered yourself?

532
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,840
No. Even a rabbit would struggle against its predator.

533
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,500
Right?

534
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,520
Your Majesty, since you'll be going to Wanzhou

535
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,820
on your tour, why not go a little further and make a trip to Yuezhou to meet Zhu Ying?

536
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,120
Right? You should berate him in person.

537
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,600
Isn't that right?

538
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,360
I'm the one going on the tour of inspection.

539
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,140
What does that have to do with you?

540
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,860
You want to come along?

541
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,800
Well, you'll need to ask Great Steward Fan.

542
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,820
One more person means extra expenditure.

543
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,040
This is something that needs careful consideration.

544
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,600
You're the emperor! Why would you need the Great Steward Fan to make the decision?

545
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,560
Well, it all depends on my mood.

546
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,320
What will make Your Majesty happy, then?

547
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,280
I would be happy if you played a game of military chess with me.

548
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,720
Well, if Your Majesty wishes, then I shall.

549
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,940
Done. Your turn, Your Majesty.

550
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,300
Your Majesty, it will be a long journey,

551
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,180
and you have no one to predict the weather for you.

552
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,760
What if you encounter poor weather,

553
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,120
and you are unable to carry on?

554
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,420
What do I have to worry about?

555
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,180
Not a drop of rain will fall on me anyway.

556
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,920
But to predict the weather for you.

557
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,520
Right?

558
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,620
I'll instruct them to install iron roofs on all the carriages.

559
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,680
That way, we won't have to worry even if there is hail.

560
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,820
Bai Lu, why don't you make a guess...

561
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,900
on why Zhu Ying and Qihai Lian are still alive?

562
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,200
If you guess correctly, I'll let you come with me to Yuezhou.

563
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,360
Really? No taking it back!

564
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,500
I think Great Steward Fan and Zuo Jintian planned to become in-laws

565
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,520
and grab the position of the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

566
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,660
Your Majesty gave General Zhu Ying the position instead

567
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,120
to test Zuo Jintian's loyalty.

568
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,240
I was able to win due to less noble tactics.

569
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,300
You had already sent forces to protect General Zhu Ying in secret

570
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,700
and use the opportunity as a valid reason

571
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,360
to destroy the alliance between the Zuo Family and the Fan Family.

572
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,720
If I hadn't done that,

573
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,220
who knows how long it would've taken for them to turn on each other?

574
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,200
But General Zhu Ying is your strongest general!

575
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,080
Weren't you afraid that you would lose everything if you miscalculated?

576
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,340
Listen. If you seek great gains,

577
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,580
you must be prepared to make sacrifices.

578
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,940
All right. That's enough of this.

579
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,880
I enjoyed this game.

580
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,380
Your request has been granted.

581
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

582
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,140
Yun Wen!

583
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,020
Yun Wen, come out!

584
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,880
Stop shaking! Stop!

585
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,060
What's going on?

586
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,120
Did you get permission to join the tour, or did you get to go to Yuezhou?

587
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,840
Both.

588
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,560
Aren't I amazing?

589
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,200
Yes, yes.

590
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,280
You'll be here all alone by yourself.

591
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,020
I think I'm going to miss you.

592
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,700
Oh, don't be so sappy.

593
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,960
When you come back, I'll have regained my physical form.

594
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,600
You can see me anytime you want, then.

595
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,500
That means everyone can see you then.

596
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,500
In that case, you won't just be my Yun Wen anymore.

597
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,240
Don't say nonsense.

598
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,740
What do you mean by "your Yun Wen"?

599
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,820
Didn't you say you would entrust me to someone reliable?

600
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,360
Who is it?

601
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,840
Right.

602
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,100
Your Majesty previously said that the members of the Bureau of Astrology need not come along.

603
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,300
But you've changed your mind.

604
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,100
May I ask why?

605
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,940
What? Is one extra mouth too much to feed,

606
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,620
or is there no room for one more in the carriage

607
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,520
for the Great Steward to voice complaints?

608
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,800
That... That is not what I meant at all.

609
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,180
But there have been words going around court

610
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:53,360
saying that while Bai Lu is proficient in astrology and competent in her work,

611
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,700
Your Majesty's fondness for her has exceeded that of an emperor for a subject.

612
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,180
If Your Majesty favors her romantically,

613
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,180
perhaps you should make her part of your harem

614
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,500
to prevent the officials from speculating and risk damaging your wise reputation.

615
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Who is saying such things?

616
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,820
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

617
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,253
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫
