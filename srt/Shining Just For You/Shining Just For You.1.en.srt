00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,900
[Episode 1]

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
From the harmony of Heaven and Earth,

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,000
the dawn of chaos unfolds.

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,400
The Truth Masters descend upon the world.

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,400
They are powerful, yet elusive

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,600
and nowhere to be found.

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Since then, the lands have been ruled alternately by the Human Clan and the Winged Clan.

21
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
The flames of war raged on.

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,700
There was no end to the clash of arms.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
Even the Kuafu Clan

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,400
and the Heluo Clan were caught in the crossfire.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,100
It was not until the end of the late Xian Dynasty

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,800
that a young general emerged from nowhere

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
who united the five clans...

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
and built an unprecedented dynasty like no other,

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
the Great Chao.

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,900
All that the birds could reach belonged to Chao,

31
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,800
except for one place known as...

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,100
which had yet to be conquered.

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,000
Underneath the veil of such greatness, however,

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,600
was the never-ending war

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,000
among the seven tribes of Yebei.

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,900
I didn't know there were so many interesting places outside of Yebei!

37
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Let's sneak out again next time.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
All right!

- How is it?
- It smells wonderful!

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Yezi, don't worry.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
If Dayuangu is to punish you, I'll ask my father to help.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
It'll be all right.

[Ye Jingqing, Dayuangu of Yebei]
The audacity!

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,500
How dare you bring Princess Zhuyan out of Yebei without permission?

58
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,400
That is a crime punishable by death!

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
It wasn't her fault!

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,800
I wanted to leave Yebei for fun.

61
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Yezi came along because she was worried about me.

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Princess Zhuyan, you don't have to make excuses for her.

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,300
She was born inauspicious.

64
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,600
She must be admonished and kept in check

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
so that she does not bring calamity to our people.

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,700
When has she ever brought harm to our people?

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,200
Dayuangu, Yezi is not cursed!

68
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,700
She is your daughter.

69
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,900
It's one thing for others to say that, but you're her own father!

Father, I've missed you!

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,700
Rui, you mustn't be disrespectful to Dayuangu.

75
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
Understand?

76
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
I do respect him.

77
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,800
But elders must be reasonable, too.

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
It's not as if Yezi wanted to do it.

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
She was only worried about me.

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Princess Zhuyan, you're still young.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,400
You do not understand what is at stake.

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Enough.

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
You, back to your tent!

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You are not to take one step outside for a month!

Father! The autumn tournament is the day after tomorrow!

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,300
We hurried back just for that.

87
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,200
Let Yezi attend it with me.

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,900
Right, Jingqing.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,900
The autumn tournament is only held once a year.

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Let the girls attend it.

91
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,400
You are to stay in your tent after the event

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
and not to leave it again!

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,300
Yes.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,100
Your Majesty, we've received a message from Tianqi.

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,600
The Emperor of Chao sent an envoy

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
to seek an alliance of marriage with Yebei.

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
What do you think?

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,700
Should we accept it?

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,900
Your Majesty,

100
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,400
I've heard that while the Emperor of Chao came from humble beginnings,

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,200
he was able to conquer and unite the five clans.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,500
He is a formidable man.

103
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm afraid Yebei will suffer grave consequences

104
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,000
if we refuse.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
Yebei has over a hundred thousand brave men,

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,200
all skilled in horsemanship and archery!

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Why should we bow to Chao?

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,700
But… the seven tribes may obey Your Majesty on the surface,

109
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,200
but in reality,

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,200
they fight for their own selfish intentions.

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
We will be at a disadvantage

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
if we rush into war now, Your Majesty.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,100
Your Majesty, why not use the marriage alliance as a ploy to distract Chao

114
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,400
and seize the upper hand?

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
This marriage alliance must happen.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,100
But they say that the Emperor of Chao is ruthless and violent.

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,600
All princesses who've been sent to marry him have met unfortunate ends.

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,200
Her Highness's life will be at risk if she is to be wedded to him.

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,700
We do not have a choice in that matter.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,700
Dayuangu.

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,900
You're finally back.

122
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,200
I thought someone

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,000
would hide behind Princess Zhuyan forever.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
I wasn't hiding.

125
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Besides, there are things that you can't hide from.

126
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,000
At least you know that.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
Enough.

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
Since His Majesty has spoken,

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you'll attend the autumn tournament with Princess Zhuyan.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,800
But His Majesty and Queen Lan have given orders,

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
forbidding you from staying by the princess's side after that.

132
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll send you to the Black Water Tribe.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
You should bid farewell to the princess.

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
That won't do!

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
I can't leave Rui's side!

136
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Insolence!

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Since when do you get to make the calls around here?

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
You should've known this would happen

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,800
when you took the princess out of Yebei!

140
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Fine.

141
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,700
But you have to unseal me before I go.

142
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
What did you say?

143
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,100
I said unseal me.

144
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,800
You sealed my celestial powers when I was seven years old.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,100
I've lived in pain ever since.

146
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,800
You need to unseal me.

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,100
No.

148
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
You never compromise on things related to you.

149
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,900
Answer me! Did you foresee another disaster?

150
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,800
I'm not a child anymore!

151
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,700
I know I'm not the one that causes these disasters.

152
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,200
I can just see them coming before others do.

153
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,500
If that makes me a harbinger of calamity,

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,700
then so are those astrologers!

155
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,600
Besides, the Bureau of Astrology is regarded as the most important department of Chao!

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Their job is to predict auspicious and bad events. What about them?

157
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Lower your voice!

158
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm warning you.

159
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,600
You must never say such things to others.

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,700
If you dare to spout nonsense to mislead others,

161
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,600
I'll end you myself!

162
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,300
Begone with you!

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
Princess Rui!

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Chu Ye and the others are back.

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Princess Rui.

166
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,100
You guys made it back before the autumn tournament at last.

167
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
If you hadn't, the title of the bravest warrior

168
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,800
would go to someone else.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,900
Let's go, Rui.

170
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,400
- All right.
- Stop.

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,000
You cursed woman! I've got unfinished business with you.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Chu Ye! Don't bully Ye!

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Rui, she is inauspicious.

174
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Who gave you permission to call me that?

175
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,800
Princess Rui, you shouldn't be around her.

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,300
Chu Ye, that's enough.

177
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,300
She tricked you into leaving Yebei!

178
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,700
She should've been sentenced to death!

179
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,000
What proof do you have that she tricked me?

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
I was the one who wanted to leave Yebei.

181
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
Yezi is my best friend.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,300
Anyone who bullies her shouldn't follow me!

183
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,800
We'll never be separated.

184
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,400
That's right.

185
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,200
- I say...
- Stop!

186
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Don't say anything.

187
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,200
The bravest warrior of Yebei

188
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,600
is afraid of little ol' me talking?

189
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
You cursed woman.

190
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,700
What proof do you have that I am cursed?

191
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,900
You bring misfortune everywhere you go!

192
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,600
If that doesn't make you cursed, what does?

193
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,200
Well, I'll show you a real cursed one.

194
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Run! Get out of here!

195
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,000
Look at those cowards!

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
[Lan, Queen of Yebei]

197
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Your Majesty!

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
The seven tribes of Yebei have gathered here for the autumn tournament.

199
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
The champion of the tournament

200
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,400
will be named the bravest warrior of Yebei.

201
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Men of the seven tribes,

202
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,999
do not let the blood in your veins run cold.

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Do not forget that cowardly sheep

204
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
will be ripped apart by vicious wolves.

205
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,600
There shall be only battles in the autumn tournament of the seven tribes!

206
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,300
I hereby declare the autumn tournament begins now!

207
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,280
Here comes the wolf!

208
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,000
Here comes the wolf!

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,300
The Snow Wolf King is here!

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
Run!

211
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,600
A'Rui!

212
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Run! Hurry!

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
The Wolf God of Yebei!

214
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,400
It's our protector, the Wolf God of Yebei!

215
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,300
A'Rui, go!

216
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Yezi!

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
Princess Rui, you must leave!

218
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,600
- Don't stop me.
- Go!

219
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Yezi!

220
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
- Yezi!
- Watch out!

221
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,500
Miss, the wolf seems to have its eye on you.

222
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,800
What will you do?

223
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Then, I'll…

224
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
I'll kill it.

225
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,700
All right.

226
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,200
It is courageous of you to do the impossible.

227
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,600
Miss, stare into its eyes.

228
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,800
If you don't fear it, it'll fear you.

229
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
You don't know martial arts.

230
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't.

231
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,100
Why won't you run, then?

232
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
If I run, it'll come after you!

233
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,600
Crazy girl.

234
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Watch this.

235
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Our Wolf God!

236
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,100
They killed the Wolf God!

237
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,000
They did!

238
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,600
The Wolf God is dead!

239
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,800
Kneel!

240
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,300
Our Wolf God is dead!

241
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
Who are you?

242
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Someone who is here to help you.

243
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
Help me?

244
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Yezi!

245
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,400
Yezi! Are you all right, Yezi?

246
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
I'm fine.

247
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,800
You killed Yebei's Wolf God!

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I did.

249
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,700
Stop!

250
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Take Prince Miao Li to seek medical attention at once!

251
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,100
[Qihai Lian, Eldest Princess of Yebei]

252
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,470
[Jie Zhuying, Commander-in-Chief of Chao]

253
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,200
Who are you?

254
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Why did you draw your weapon in Yebei?

255
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't care who you are! How dare you hurt our prince!

256
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
General!

257
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Envoy of Chao, Commander of the Lanyi Army,

258
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,700
General Who Defeats Bandits, Xie Yu'an,

259
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,200
greets His Majesty, King Qihai.

260
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,600
The envoy of Chao?

261
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
King Qihai,

262
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I was sent to forge good relations with Yebei.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Is this any way to treat your guests?

264
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,200
General Xie drew blood upon your arrival.

265
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Is this how Great Chao treats their hosts?

266
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,600
Prince Miao came at me with unkind intent.

267
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,800
If I hadn't fought back,

268
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,600
I would've been a dead body by now.

269
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
We came to seek an alliance, yet you sought to harm an envoy.

270
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm afraid it would do you no good

271
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
if Chao learns of this, King Qihai.

272
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,200
General Xie is unlike what is rumored.

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,500
Very well. Please proceed to the royal tent.

274
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,100
Your Majesty!

275
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,400
He killed our Wolf God!

276
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,900
You cannot let this slide!

277
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,800
The heavens will punish us, Your Majesty!

278
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
It's the cursed one!

279
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,300
It was she who disturbed the Snow Wolf King!

280
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,000
That's slander! Yezi didn't do anything!

281
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
All these people saw it!

282
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,200
King Qihai, she cannot live.

283
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,000
We must sacrifice her

284
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,300
to appease the Wolf God!

285
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes! She must be sacrificed!

286
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Men!

287
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,100
Stop!

288
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,300
Father. Dayuangu. Say something!

289
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,700
Yezi is innocent!

290
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,800
Rui, don't waste your breath.

291
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
The heroes of Yebei are great indeed.

292
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You do not distinguish between right and wrong.

293
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Adults of decades-old bullying a little girl.

294
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,900
Well, you've certainly opened my eyes.

295
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Miss, you may be a woman,

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,400
but you're far braver than most that stand here.

297
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
This is a token of Chao.

298
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Accept this.

299
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,200
If anyone dares to slight you again,

300
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,400
they will make an enemy of Chao.

301
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Live or die.

302
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
It's your choice.

303
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,070
Yezi! What's the matter, Yezi?

304
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,200
- You're awake!
- A'Rui.

305
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,800
It gave me such a scare today.

306
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,300
I can still feel my heart pounding.

307
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,000
This is something easy on your stomach. Have some.

308
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
You must've been frightened, too, Yezi.

309
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,300
That Snow Wolf King was terrifying.

310
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
And that Luo Wuyi.

311
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,600
That old man is even worse than the Snow Wolf King.

312
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,800
Father and the chiefs of the other tribes held a bonfire feast

313
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
to welcome General Xie.

314
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Let's go and take a look, then.

315
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
But…

316
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,400
A'Rui, since when did you become such a worrywart?

317
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Look at me! I'm perfectly fine!

318
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,300
Don't worry.

319
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,900
All right.

320
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Princess Rui, dance with us!

321
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,400
Go on.

322
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,000
What was that for?

323
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
To rid you of all that bad luck.

324
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,800
Is that enough bad luck for you?

325
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,200
- You.
- Enough, Chu Ye!

326
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Let it go.

327
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Come on. Let's get a drink.

328
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Carry on!

329
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,300
Come on.

330
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Miss.

331
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,000
I can see that you're not welcome here.

332
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,900
Why don't you come back to Chao with me?

333
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,800
I can help you slay your enemies.

334
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,600
I don't need that.

335
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,000
I didn't do anything because none of them is worth my time and effort.

336
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,900
Besides, I hate people who think they can tell me what to do.

337
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,400
So you better not mess with me.

338
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,500
That's my liquor.

339
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,600
I drank it, so it's mine now.

340
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,800
Listen.

341
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,400
No one in Yebei dares to drink liquor that I drank.

342
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,800
Afraid? Now, go away.

343
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,600
So this is how Yebei treats their guests.

344
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,300
You have to snatch liquor from another's hands.

345
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Why don't you look happy at all?

346
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,000
Why should I be?

347
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,200
Good food, good wine, music, and dance.

348
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
What's not to be happy about?

349
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,600
All of these are enjoyed by others.

350
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Not me.

351
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Besides, such joy is only temporary.

352
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,000
Just like those flowers behind you.

353
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,200
They bloom by the warmth of the bonfire.

354
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,000
But their fate has long been decided.

355
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They will wilt and wither away...

356
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
in the midst of tomorrow's frost.

357
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
There.

358
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Its fate has been changed.

359
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,800
That doesn't count!

360
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,500
Why not?

361
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,600
A little girl like you shouldn't harp on things like fate and destiny.

362
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
They are but excuses for the weak.

363
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
You don't believe in fate and destiny?

364
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,300
Why should I?

365
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,700
But…

366
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,200
But what if someone was born cursed?

367
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,400
No one is born cursed.

368
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Remember this. Your fate is what you make of it.

369
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,700
You must grasp your destiny firmly

370
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,400
in your own hands.

371
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
I understand now.

372
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,000
Thanks!

373
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,800
I didn't expect to hear a "thanks" from you.

374
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You saved my life, after all. I should thank you.

375
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,600
You should treat me to a few more bottles of Yebei's liquor, then!

376
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Your Majesty.

377
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,400
Why are you standing there like a log?

378
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Take a look at this.

379
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,700
There are rumors in the army that you have a divine mirror

380
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,510
that allows you to see all the beauties in the world.

381
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,400
I can't believe it's true!

382
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,300
Is that girl the one who has caught Your Majesty's eye?

383
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,500
Who?

384
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,100
The girl you gave the Seal of Loyalty and Courage to.

385
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
Oh, her.

386
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
You call her a beauty?

387
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,600
Well, she is dressed plainly,

388
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
but I think she has nice eyebrows and eyes…

389
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,700
That's enough from you.

390
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,329
I've always thought you had questionable taste in women.

391
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:09,450
But you gave her the Seal of Loyalty and Courage.

392
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,499
There are only seven of those in existence,

393
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,259
and you gave her one just like that.

394
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,490
That's why I thought you might've felt differently about her.

395
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,390
Shallow-minded.

396
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,000
Not anyone can become the Empress of Chao.

397
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Only a noble princess of Yebei is worthy of this position.

398
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,340
Oh, right.

399
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,059
Aren't you going to meet the lady in your heart tonight?

400
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,969
You found out, Your Majesty?

401
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:44,420
The eldest princess of Yebeistudied for four years in Tianqi

402
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,420
under the alias of Qingheng.

403
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,810
If my covert guards weren't even able to learn that,

404
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,360
why should I keep them around?

405
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,090
Your Majesty, why didn't you say anything about it, then?

406
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,080
Even if I did,

407
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,439
would you be able to take back your heart that you'd given her?

408
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:34,845
[The Royal Tent of the Qihai Tribe of Yebei]

409
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,570
The imperial envoy has arrived.

410
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,160
Envoy of Chao, Xie Yu'an,

411
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,740
greets King Qihai.

412
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,440
We appreciate the Emperor of Chao's sincerity.

413
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,569
The seven tribes of Yebei accept the proposal of a marriage alliance with Chao.

414
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,910
Thank you, King Qihai, for your generosity.

415
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,930
May the Great Chao and Yebei be allied for all eternity.

416
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,230
I thank you on behalf of His Majesty.

417
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,930
Please be seated.

418
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,910
Please.

419
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,939
This is my eldest daughter, Qihai Lian.

420
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,790
I'm sure you've already seen her.

421
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,460
Chao has come a long way to Yebei in search of an empress.

422
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,620
It is fated by the heavens.

423
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,830
That is why we offer you a precious gift.

424
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,340
What is it?

425
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,070
The Great Chao would like to offer the Mirror of Youth

426
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,640
for the hand of Princess Qihai Rui of Yebei in marriage.

427
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,449
Dayuangu, please save A'Rui!

428
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:22,539
Make His Majesty change his mind!

429
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:25,040
She cannot marry the Emperor of Chao! She'll die!

430
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,920
Do you think

431
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,290
His Majesty will change his mind at this point?

432
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,790
He will. That's his beloved A'Rui!

433
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,470
But His Majesty is the king of the seven tribes of Yebei.

434
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,440
- But how can he…
- There is no "but"!

435
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,960
Why can't you understand your place?

436
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,659
It is a miracle that you were allowed to live as long as you have.

437
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:58,570
What right do you have to dictate the future of Yebei?

438
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,789
She must board the wedding carriage to Chao

439
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,640
and fulfill her duties.

440
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,820
That is not to be changed!

441
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,390
What duties?

442
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,579
It's only an excuse you guys came up with because you aren't willing to find a solution and take responsibility!

443
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,850
You want to use the marriage alliance to buy time.

444
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,730
But Chao will conquer Yebei.

445
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,480
It doesn't matter if we marry off a princess to Chao or not!

446
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,900
Why is Princess Rui the one to be wedded to Chao?

447
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,150
I heard it was the emperor who chose her.

448
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,449
But the emperor is said to be ruthless and merciless.

449
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,210
It's as good as a death sentence for Princess Rui!

450
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,200
Princess Rui.

451
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:58,010
Don't worry. I won't allow you to be sent to Chao.

452
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,710
Chu Ye, where are you going?

453
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,880
- Let go!
- Where are you going?

454
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,690
I'll go to Xie Yu'an and challenge him as per the customs of Yebei!

455
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,449
Even if Yebei were to marry a princess off in a political alliance,

456
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,659
it would be for the sake of peace between the two kingdoms.

457
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,480
Not because we fear them!

458
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,779
Have you gone mad? He is the imperial envoy of Chao!

459
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:14,919
- Don't try to stop me!
- No! Get back here!

460
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,690
Stop it!

461
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,610
Your Highness…

462
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,530
Greetings, General.

463
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,860
Who are you?

464
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,980
General, Queen Lan ordered me to prepare freshly brewed milk tea for you all.

465
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,479
You've had a long journey.

466
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:54,599
So we've prepared the finest and most authentic milk tea for you all.

467
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,910
Please drink it while it's hot.

468
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,830
Wait.

469
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,970
This pot of milk tea is for General Xie.

470
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,340
Leave it. I'll take it to him.

471
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,729
Actually, I wanted to express my gratitude to General Xie.

472
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:17,860
That's why I took this task.

473
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,900
Could you please tell him I'm here?

474
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,830
Please give me a chance?

475
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,250
All right. I'll inform His...

476
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,490
I mean him.

477
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,430
Thank you, General.

478
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,831
- General.
- General Xie wants to see you.

479
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:55,450
Yes.

480
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,830
General Xie.

481
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,380
Why are you here?

482
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,190
General Xie,

483
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,480
I wish to take A'Rui's place and become Empress of Chao.

484
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,190
How dare you!

485
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,249
Do you think anyone can become the Empress of Chao?

486
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,110
The Emperor of Chao has high regard for the art of astrology and divination.

487
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,300
And I've been studying this art with my father since I was a child. I'm well-versed in astrology.

488
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,480
Princess Zhuyan is beautiful,

489
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,009
but I would do a better job

490
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:54,629
at winning His Majesty's heart.

491
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:57,280
Besides, I'm a daughter of noble status too.

492
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,560
Why must you insist on taking her?

493
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,180
Noble…

494
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,230
Do you think I don't know anything?

495
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,460
You've spouted inauspicious omens since you were a child.

496
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,240
All of Yebei regard you as a harbinger of calamity.

497
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,629
If it weren't for Qihai Rui, you wouldn't have even been here today.

498
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:26,129
Someone like you is unfit to be the Empress of Chao.

499
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,520
General Xie, you are a man of knowledge.

500
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,410
I know you won't believe those baseless rumors.

501
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,650
Besides, the emperor is all the way back in Tianqi.

502
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,720
As long as you don't let them hear of this,

503
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,080
they won't know a thing.

504
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,190
I didn't expect to hear that from you.

505
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,780
It seems I've underestimated you.

506
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,599
Look, General Xie, I genuinely want to go to Tianqi.

507
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,980
There's nothing keeping me here in Yebei.

508
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,380
Wouldn't it be better to take me back

509
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,620
instead of Qihai Rui who is unwilling to go?

510
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,180
That's enough.

511
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,000
Let's get back to business.

512
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,620
Why don't you want Qihai Rui to marry into Chao?

513
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,630
I hear that the emperor is violent and ruthless,

514
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,359
and all of the princesses who were married to Chao have died.

515
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,520
I don't want Rui to go through that.

516
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,760
Preposterous.

517
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,719
The marriage alliance is to put an end to the war.

518
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:26,780
His Majesty is not a heartless emperor, as you claim.

519
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,250
Even if that is a false rumor,

520
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,910
it's a true fact that she'll have to abide by strict rules in the Chao Palace.

521
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,960
A'Rui is kind and innocent.

522
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,230
She shouldn't have to live like that, and neither should she go there.

523
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,590
She would go insane!

524
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,410
Are you saying that you want to live like that?

525
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,080
I only know that I can't have everything.

526
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,680
I just want A'Rui to live happily.

527
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,450
But the generals of Chao are all loyal.

528
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,290
What makes you think I would lie to my emperor?

529
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,420
So…

530
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,829
So you won't help me.

531
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,190
Enough... You may go.

532
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,830
I shall take my leave, then.

533
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,530
Oh, right.

534
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,950
You must drink the milk tea while it's hot.

535
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:40,930
General Xie, this is a token of Queen Lan's appreciation.

536
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,880
Please do not refuse.

537
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,730
To Queen Lan.

538
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,280
What…

539
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,870
What's in the milk tea?

540
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,670
Don't expect anyone to save you.

541
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,289
They wouldn't wake up even if I held a knife to their necks right now.

542
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:38,190
Everyone knows

543
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,870
that King Qihai's queen is kind and gentle.

544
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,760
I don't think she was the one who made the milk tea

545
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,720
that harms the envoy and threatens

546
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,899
to break the alliance between Chao and Yebei.

547
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
I don't care about Tianqi, Great Chao,

548
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,869
or a marriage alliance to end the war.

549
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:58,770
My A'Rui will not be married to Tianqi!

550
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,960
I've put deadly poison into this milk tea.

551
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,810
And only I have the antidote.

552
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,160
So think carefully.

553
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,150
Will you lose your life or work with me?

554
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,150
You're a clever man. You should know what to choose.

555
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,360
I, Xie Yu'an,

556
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,350
am not one to be coerced.

557
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,730
Fine.

558
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,360
Then…

559
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,300
Just wait until you lose all the senses of your body.

560
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,179
By then, the others will have woken up just in time to collect your corpse.

561
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,200
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

562
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,600
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

563
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,680
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

564
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,339
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

565

567
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,799
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

568
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:19,119
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

569
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,620
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

570
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,720
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

571
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,459
♫ Void of someone ♫

572
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:36,839
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

573
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,859
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

576
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,900
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

577
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,440
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

578
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,639
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

579
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:14,900
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows

580
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:18,279
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

581
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:21,500
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

582
