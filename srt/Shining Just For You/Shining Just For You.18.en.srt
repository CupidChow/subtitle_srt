[Episode 18]

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Our duty is to protect His Majesty.

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,100
- If he is gone, we can retreat, can't we?
- Indeed.

17
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,400
Why should we stay here?

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,800
This is just a meaningless battle.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
We can't leave.

20
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,600
If we do,

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
the seditious Cai will attack Tianqi right away.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
By then, the people of Tianqi will be caught in the crossfire.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
Your families are going to be implicated!

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Therefore,

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,700
we're not fighting for His Majesty.

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,100
We're fighting for ourselves.

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
We're fighting for our lives!

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,800
We're fighting for our families!

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,800
The longer we hold on,

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
the higher the chance for us to survive!

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
You guys knew Cai Can couldn't last long.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,400
Don't tell me you're going to surrender to him?

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Do you want your parents, wife, and children

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,200
to be banished as part of the rebel army's kin?

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,900
Official Bai!

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
I have a report to make.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Official Fengyin, please go ahead.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,200
There's no need to hide the news.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
About an hour ago, I received a letter accompanied by a Cloud Flame.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
At this moment, His Majesty is at most 100 li away from Zhenxia Mountain.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
100 li?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
His Majesty is back!

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
- That's great!
- There's hope!

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,100
His Majesty is back!

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,700
We shall hold on until dawn! Can you guys do it?

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Yes, we can!

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,800
Where are the two lads that had been following me around?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,300
That's enough.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
- Official Bai.
- Official Bai.

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,800
What's your names?

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,700
- I'm Han Sheng.
- I'm Yu Xiang.

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,000
Deliver a letter to Cai Can for me.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,900
Invite him to meet me at the opposite hilltop.

54
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,200
Use His Majesty's name to invite him. He'll definitely come.

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,600
However, we're at a disadvantage here.

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm afraid Cai Can will stage an ambush with his archers.

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
It doesn't matter.

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,100
I just received a sign from the heavens.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,400
Today, we shall win.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,400
Didn't you guys promise that you would obey my commands?

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
After delivering the letter,

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,100
I will assign another task to you two.

63
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,700
After that,

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,700
you guys can tell His Majesty that I've done my best.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Why don't we send you away first?

66
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I won't leave.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
♫ If I turn around without saying a word ♫

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,400
He told me this when we were in Tianqi.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Back then, when he was in Minzhong Mountain, he used himself as bait,

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,300
annihilating the coalition forces of Cao and Tang,

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,000
and rising through the ranks.

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
I knew this from the moment he kept me here.

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
He wants me to do the same thing.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,100
However, he's not the reason I'm staying here.

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm staying here...

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
because I don't like to admit defeat.

77
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,500
Listen closely to my instructions.

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,600
Execute them without fail.

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, Official Bai.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,600
♫ Just like a lost amber, waiting for you to pick it up ♫

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
♫ A cold and lonely moonlight that dissipates
with the night breeze ♫

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Move them away!

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,700
♫ I'm willing to lie in your arms ♫

84
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Majesty, if you exhaust your celestial power again,

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
your body won't be able to stand it.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
Your Majesty!

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your Majesty!

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Get out of the way!

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Bai Lu is still on the mountain!

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,300
I cannot leave her alone!

91
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,200
I will get to her...

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,000
even if it means I have to expend all of my power.

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Majesty.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
His Majesty is...

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
That person hasn't shown himself at all.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,800
But now, he's inviting you to meet him.

97
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm afraid there's more to it than meets the eye.

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,500
It doesn't matter.

99
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,800
If he doesn't show up today,

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,300
that means he's afraid of me.

101
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,200
Even if he does show up,

102
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,000
the terrain and wind direction are to my advantage.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,300
I will launch an all-out attack.

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,400
I will definitely slay him.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't feel like speaking to that woman.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,300
You go.

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
You guys invited My Lord to a meeting.

109
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
Why are you here instead?

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,000
This is an order from His Majesty.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Surrender immediately.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,800
If not, your dead bodies will be forsaken by the stars and the gods.

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,400
So, Yu Xiuming is too afraid to see me?

114
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,100
How dare you utter His Majesty's name.

115
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,400
You will be punished by the heavens.

116
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,900
What's going on? What's with that smoke?

117
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,400
That's right.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,600
Fire!

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,100
General! There's a thick dust cloud at the back! We don't know what's going on!

120
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,800
Could it be that person has brought his army here?

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Let's retreat!

122
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Retreat!

123
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Official Bai, are you okay?

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm fine. Let's retreat.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,100
- Let's go.
- Retreat.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,900
The rebel army has retreated to the foot of the mountain.

127
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,300
What spell did you cast just now? That was amazing.

128
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Did you forget who I am?

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
You're the director of the Bureau of Astrology.

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Did you predict that?

131
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Last night, I was observing the stars and the flow of the wind.

132
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,700
I found out that there would be a gust this afternoon.

133
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,200
Therefore, I invited Cai Can to meet me there.

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,300
I see. Your prediction is accurate indeed.

135
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,000
Your acting was convincing, too.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,100
Look. Even you fell for it.

137
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,800
I was thinking that the rebel army would fall for it, too.

138
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Official Bai, you're bold and intelligent.

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm sure His Majesty will favor you even more after this battle.

140
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,200
I wonder how they're doing right now.

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
How long will it take for them to arrive?

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't know.

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,900
His Majesty just told me to bring you away at all costs.

144
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm not going anywhere.

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll wait here for him.

146
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,100
We chased Cai Can to the foot of the mountain. We've earned half a day.

147
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,900
He said he would bring reinforcements in three days.

148
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,800
- However, Official Bai...
- The emperor I knew would never lose.

149
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
I believe that he won't lose this time, too.

150
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
Tell our brothers to prepare themselves.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,100
This is our last war.

152
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
This time,

153
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
we have no choice but to put up a struggle.

154
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Stop!

155
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,400
Darn it!

156
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,000
We fell for the little broad's trick!

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,100
We shouldn't have retreated!

158
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,000
We've lost all the territories we gained in the last two days.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Regroup and head back!

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,500
Now?

161
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,500
They're actually using cheap tricks like this.

162
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,400
It's obvious that Yu Xiuming has run out of troops.

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,800
If we don't fight them now,

164
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,700
we'll lose our best chance.

165
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,800
All right!

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,000
Brothers, let's head back!

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Attack!

168
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Attack!

169
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Fire!

170
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,150
Charge!

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,600
It's you?

172
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,300
Where's that kid?

173
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,600
I can deal with you alone.

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
You wretch!

175
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,300
Attack!

176
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,600
Useless wretch.

177
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,400
Come on. Get up!

178
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,000
Again.

179
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Get up!

180
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Your Majesty,

181
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,600
I've already done my best.

182
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,500
If he manages to reach here,

183
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,200
I will kill myself with this dagger.

184
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,800
If he's able to kill you,

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,100
he'll be able to kill me easily, am I right?

186
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Just kill me.

187
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,300
You don't deserve to die by my sword.

188
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,200
Bai Lu.

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm back.

190
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
This is great.

191
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,700
I will always keep my promise to you.

192
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,000
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,700
Let me do it. You guys may leave.

194
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,900
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,500
Your Majesty.

196
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,000
You've suffered this time.

197
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
How dare Cai Can do this to you?

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,700
I will execute him tomorrow and avenge you.

199
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,700
You were the one who infuriated me.

200
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,000
If so, why did you shed tears of joy when you saw me?

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,300
I...

202
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
I shed tears because I was too angry.

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
You told me to hold down the fort for you.

204
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,300
But you weren't even honest with me.

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How was I not honest with you?

206
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,300
I told you three days, right?

207
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,900
I knew you said three days.

208
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,400
But you only left 2,000 troops behind.

209
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
You have plenty of tricks up your sleeves.

210
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,100
Not only that, but you can also make divination and summon both rain and wind.

211
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,400
You alone can go up against 10,000 troops.

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,600
Keep flattering me, won't you?

213
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
Look. Didn't I leave Fengyin behind

214
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,800
so that he could help you escape?

215
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,800
But you might have kept him here to test me.

216
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,400
Besides, the Emperor of Chao has never lost in a war before.

217
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,200
So how could I ruin your legacy?

218
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,900
You do have a point.

219
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
But your performance

220
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
has far exceeded my expectations.

221
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,200
If you were born 15 years earlier,

222
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I would've made you my number one general.

223
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Just you wish.

224
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
If I was born 15 years earlier,

225
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
I would surely be your rival.

226
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,100
Enough.

227
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,800
Stop acting tough.

228
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
You're seriously injured.

229
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,700
You should rest now.

230
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,800
I never slept well in the past few days.

231
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Rest well.

232
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll be here.

233
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Your Majesty.

234
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,000
What's the matter?

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,400
Your Majesty, the rebel army of Cai Can has surrendered.

236
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,300
We await your instruction.

237
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Leave them to Xie Yu'an.

238
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,100
Tell him to report to me once he's done with them.

239
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

240
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,600
General Xie, why did you want to see me?

241
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,900
Official Bai, I will never seek you out...

242
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,900
if there's any other way.

243
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,300
Please speak your mind.

244
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Actually, His Majesty...

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
treats you differently.

246
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,600
He does?

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,500
He kept me on the mountain.

248
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,800
So how does he treat me differently than everyone else?

249
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,900
That's not it.

250
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,900
His Majesty is actually very concerned about your safety.

251
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,000
I've been serving His Majesty for over a decade.

252
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,100
We've been through many critical situations.

253
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,000
But I've never seen His Majesty panic before.

254
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
When did it happen?

255
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
His Majesty ordered me to change my path

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
and gather reinforcements from Wanzhou.

257
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Although I tried my best to cover our tracks.

258
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,800
For some reason, Cai Can

259
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
still closed off several paths to Zhenxia Mountain.

260
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,400
Our path was blocked by boulders.

261
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,800
I ordered my men to remove them.

262
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,600
But it'd at least take us three days to remove them.

263
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
Luckily, His Majesty arrived in time.

264
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,300
He actually cleared the mountain path by himself.

265
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,400
He ordered us to make it to Zhenxia Mountain in three days.

266
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
Why are you telling me all this?

267
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
Do you want me to persuade him?

268
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,500
I promise you.

269
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,300
I'll give it a try.

270
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,200
Your Majesty, this is the confiscated asset list we found in Cai Can's residence.

271
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,100
Do you wish to take a look?

272
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,700
That's unnecessary.

273
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,400
Give it to Bai Lu.

274
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,200
Reward her with anything she wants.

275
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
Wait.

277
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,900
Give her Cai Can's helmet.

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Understood.

279
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,800
Official Bai.

280
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,500
Come in.

281
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,900
Commander Ling.

282
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,000
Official Bai.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,100
Under His Majesty's order, I'm here to deliver the asset list of Cai Can's residence

284
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,800
and his helmet to you.

285
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,300
His Majesty said you could pick whatever you like.

286
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
You can leave it here.

287
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Thank you.

288
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Official Bai, you're most welcome. I shall take my leave.

289
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,300
Wait.

290
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,200
Is His Majesty still in his chamber?

291
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,400
That's right.

292
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,900
Official Bai, do you plan to see His Majesty?

293
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Since His Majesty has rewarded me,

294
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
naturally, I need to thank his grace.

295
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,500
You have a point.

296
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,900
Your Majesty.

297
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,600
Do you like the rewards I've given you?

298
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
I do.

299
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
However, I wish to trade them for a favor.

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Did Xie Yu'an tell you to persuade me

301
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,800
to spare the kin of the seditious Cai?

302
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,100
It wasn't General Xie.

303
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
I just can't bear to see them die.

304
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Your Majesty, I assume you know this too.

305
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Within the rebel army, some of them were actually coerced by Cai Can.

306
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,900
They didn't fight with all they had when they surrounded Zhenxia Mountain.

307
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,900
That's how I was able to defend the base for three days.

308
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,000
I never expected you to figure that out.

309
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,360
Your Majesty, please spare them.

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,480
Fine.

311
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,280
Since you've protected the divine hall successfully,

312
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,680
I shall make an exception and spare them.

313
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

314
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,640
Protectorate General, my young master isn't in Tianqi right now.

315
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,820
This is an emergency.

316
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,100
Please deliver this letter to His Highness and tell him to hurry back.

317
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,980
We have something important to discuss.

318
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,600
I will deliver it to him personally.

319
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,200
However, as to where Young Master is and when he'll return,

320
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,780
that's not what servants like us can decide.

321
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,720
Protectorate General, please be patient.

322
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,740
I'm sure His Highness also cares about the incident in Ningzhou.

323
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,480
If you drag this out,

324
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
it won't be beneficial to both of us.

325
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,740
Yes, Protectorate General. I understand.

326
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,540
Yu Linkong's subordinate said he isn't in Tianqi.

327
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,360
It's obvious that he's in the building.

328
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,000
He just didn't want to see you and discuss the marriage with you.

329
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,940
If so, what do you think we should do next?

330
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,480
Father, fret not.

331
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,620
Even if we cannot form a marriage alliance with Yu Linkong,

332
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,500
I still have other solutions.

333
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,760
But we have to get rid of Bai Lu no matter what.

334
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,900
The Winged Emperor must never marry a human.

335
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,160
During the tour, I'll instruct my men to get rid of her.

336
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,080
I shall take my leave.

337
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,220
Miss Yuan.

338
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,120
Did something happen just now?

339
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,060
It was an unreasonable guest.

340
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,680
Miss, you have exceptional musical talent.

341
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,620
However, you have to perform for vulgar people.

342
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,120
This world is unfair indeed.

343
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,060
A person like me...

344
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,100
wanders around endlessly.

345
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,520
The wind brings me along as it flows.

346
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,740
I have no other choice.

347
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,020
Miss, if you're willing,

348
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,820
you may put down some roots in Tianqi.

349
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,560
Although Jianyue Pavilion is a great place,

350
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,040
it's not a good place for you to settle down.

351
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,940
Staying together with your beloved

352
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,400
will give you someone to depend on.

353
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,580
It's easy for you to say.

354
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,700
In this world, our relationships are out of our control.

355
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,360
We have to obey our parents' wishes.

356
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,500
Even if we have someone we love,

357
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm afraid we can never be together with them.

358
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,680
Yuan, I love you.

359
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,520
You should leave Jianyue Pavilion and marry me.

360
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm sorry. It was abrupt of me to do so.

361
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,080
It's fine even if you say no.

362
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,980
I think I should take my leave.

363
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,820
Sir!

364
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,760
Sir, can you play a song

365
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,100
for me tonight?

366
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,020
Sure.

367
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,000
Your Majesty, you're stepping on my foot.

368
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,560
We'll reach the famous Minzhong Mountain soon.

369
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,320
Back then, I fought with them twice to gain control of this territory.

370
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,040
Bodies were everywhere.

371
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,900
The cries of the living shocked the wildlife into silence.

372
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,440
Do you mean the incident recorded in the books?

373
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,840
Everyone, get off your horse and carriage. Cross the bridge on foot.

374
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,420
The bridge is too narrow.

375
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,560
Everyone, get off your horse and carriage. Cross the bridge on foot.

376
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,620
Your Majesty, we'll reach Minzhong Mountain soon.

377
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,000
The front bridge is too narrow. The caravan cannot cross it.

378
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,320
We have to get off our carriage and horses and proceed on foot.

379
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,480
Got it. Notify the rest.

380
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,860
[Minzhong Mountain]

382
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,700
What a thick fog.

383
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,580
Indeed.

384
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,400
What's going on?

385
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,460
What's with the thick fog?

386
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,380
Yeah.

387
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,200
The fog is pretty thick.

388
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,800
I can use this chance to slip away and check out the magic array.

389
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,656
Go and check it out.

390
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:19,900
Go and check it out.

391
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,520
- Yes, Commander.
- Yes, Commander.

392
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,940
Commander Ling, this part is safe.

393
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,580
Your Majesty.

394
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,480
Go to hell!

395
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,320
- What's the matter?
- Your Majesty!

396
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,820
- Take her down!
- Yes, Commander!

397
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,920
Where are we?

398
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,680
What's the matter?

399
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,740
I broke my leg.

400
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,080
Stop pretending. You don't get hurt, do you?

401
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,620
Don't you have sympathy for me?

402
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,320
It's not that I don't get hurt.

403
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,220
It's just that I recover faster than others.

404
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,140
Are you truly hurt?

405
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,040
Just now, why did you jump down to save me?

406
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,800
Good question.

407
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,400
If you were that smart,

408
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,220
why did you let an assassin push you off the bridge?

409
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,920
I didn't know that she would push me.

410
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,000
Say, could she be an accomplice of Cai Can?

411
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,800
Can't she side with someone else?

412
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,120
I don't care who she sides with.

413
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,880
We have to call Commander Ling to pick us up.

414
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,900
Commander Ling!

415
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,600
Stop shouting.

416
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,760
You'll attract the assassins here

417
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,460
instead of the Winged Guards.

418
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,400
What should we do then?

419
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,380
Help me up.

420
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,120
So, what do we do now?

421
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,660
We have to locate a path.

422
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,580
How are we supposed to do that?

423
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,740
We're in the wilderness.

424
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,140
Slow down.

425
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,180
Why do I feel like

426
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,560
something is off about this place?

427
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,340
Why can't I feel any celestial powers here?

428
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,680
This place feels pretty good to me.

429
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,380
Hey, don't tell me those assassins were after you.

430
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,620
You're pinning the blame on me already?

431
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,760
You're burning the bridges before crossing them, you know?

432
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,900
If they were truly after me, they could've killed me with one stab.

433
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,700
They don't need to go through all the trouble.

434
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,720
If so, why did they push you off the bridge, instead of me?

435
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,540
Unless he expected me to save you after she pushed you off the bridge.

436
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,140
If so, that person must know me well.

437
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,640
He knows you well, too.

438
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,120
If there was someone that capable beside me,

439
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,740
he could've acted long ago.

440
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,780
He didn't need to wait until now.

441
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,300
Even so, there's no need to be afraid.

442
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,620
As long as I'm here, the opponent doesn't matter.

443
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,460
You will definitely survive.

444
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,460
If there's any danger,

445
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,780
you should just forget about me.

446
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,060
Just escape while you can.

447
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,740
No way.

448
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,600
What if they capture you and turn you into my nemesis?

449
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,400
Aren't I your nemesis right now?

450
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,260
How dare you?

451
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,700
You've been staring at it for some time.

452
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,760
What have you discovered?

453
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,940
This magic array is different from the abandoned magic array I saw before.

454
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,780
Its core celestial power is still intact.

455
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,080
That's why it's still functional.

456
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,540
I still have the Quad-Wondrous Purification Powder.

457
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,800
We should give it a try.

458
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,900
It's working.

459
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,940
I will tag along.

460
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,060
Where am I?

461
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:08,500
The spring wind comes and goes, carrying a sweet melody.

462
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,860
That's A'Rui's voice.

463
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,340
A'Rui!

464
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,380
A'Rui, where are you?

465
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,940
A'Rui!

466
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,440
A'Rui!

467
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,060
A...

468
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,140
A'Rui!

469
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,700
You're not A'Rui.

470
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,380
I'm not.

471
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,120
But I adopted this form

472
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,920
so that you wouldn't be afraid.

473
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,020
Welcome to the Stone Vault.

474
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,300
Are you a Truth Master?

475
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,520
We have many names.

476
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,820
Some call us the Star Seekers.

477
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,300
And some call us the Cloud Overlords.

478
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
The Truth Master you were referring to,

479
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,060
that is also one of our names.

480
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,220
So, you guys were the ones who granted

481
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,640
Yu Xiuming the divine power. Right?

482
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,680
500 years ago, we decided to let the Five Clans

483
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,180
take charge of this land.

484
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,860
We were supposed to stay out of all affairs related to this land

485
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,720
and be only responsible for observing and recording the changes.

486
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,580
However, right after we left,

487
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,420
the Five Clans waged war against each other.

488
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,100
Humans were involved in most of the wars.

489
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,640
The chaos lasted for over 300 years.

490
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,620
Even so, most of us

491
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,320
opted to stay out of their affairs.

492
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,820
Because I wanted to end the war earlier,

493
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,820
I handed the Mirror of Youth

494
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,020
to someone capable enough to end the chaos.

495
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,180
Since this was your choice,

496
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,740
why were you looking for me, then?

497
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,800
Aren't you curious?

498
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,860
Both of you entered the magic array together.

499
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,160
Why are you the only one here?

500
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,580
It's because you forbade him from coming.

501
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,380
That's right.

502
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,460
He has lost the blessing of the Truth Master.

503
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,940
He can never set foot in the Stone Vault again.

504
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,820
The power bestowed upon Yu Xiuming by the Divine Mirror

505
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,700
wasn't everlasting in the first place.

506
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,780
Now that the power of the Divine Mirror is dissipating,

507
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,400
Yu Xiuming will die if he receives a fatal blow.

508
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,160
But if he dies,

509
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,340
the entire world will be plunged into chaos again.

510
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,640
If so, you guys can give him your blessing again.

511
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,100
Truth Masters aren't supposed to intervene in the affairs of the world.

512
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,100
I was punished because of my mistake.

513
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,740
I will stay in the Stone Vault forever to atone for my sins.

514
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,440
I've already committed a huge mistake.

515
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,640
My master will never allow me to repeat my mistake.

516
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,060
However, someone suitable will aid Yu Xiuming.

517
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,680
I think...

518
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,100
you're that person.

519
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,700
Me?

520
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,200
Many years ago,

521
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,020
when I bestowed the Divine Mirror upon Yu Xiuming,

522
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,540
I realized the rotation of the Star Trails changed abnormally.

523
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,740
Your life star is actually connected to his.

524
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,940
Your influence on him will get bigger and bigger.

525
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,840
Both of your life stars will get closer and closer.

526
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,100
I don't care about the life star.

527
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,880
I only wish to know where A'Rui is.

528
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,020
Do you know where...

529
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,880
You won't want to find out.

530
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,660
If you insist on asking, you can only return to the past.

531
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,680
My leg!

532
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,000
What happened to you?

533
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,300
What did you see while you were inside?

534
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,380
I saw A'Rui.

535
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,600
Qihai Rui?

536
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,020
I don't know.

537
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,860
I just saw A'Rui in a red dress.

538
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,560
She kept running.

539
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,360
I kept chasing after her.

540
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,440
She was singing her favorite song while running.

541
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,060
What happened after that?

542
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,220
After that, I came out.

543
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,140
If so, did you receive anything?

544
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,380
What do you mean?

545
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,020
It was just a straw hut.

546
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,000
I saw nothing else.

547
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,500
Could it be that you've received something before?

548
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,440
Let's go.

549
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,900
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

550
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,080
Your Majesty!

551
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,100
Your Majesty!

552
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,360
It's His Majesty!

553
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,820
Have you arrested the assassin?

554
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,000
We arrested the assassin on the bridge. It was a maidservant.

555
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,020
She served Consort Tian before she was transferred to Guangyang Palace.

556
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,420
Consort Tian?

557
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,780
Does she belong to the Winged Clan?

558
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

559
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,760
Winged Clan?

560
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,660
Your Majesty, if you wish to build this canal, we need 10,000 laborers.
[Guiyang City, Guiyang, Zhongzhou]

561
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,120
It'll take five years to complete it.

562
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

563
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,140
I shall take my leave.

564
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,380
Look.

565
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,440
The Chao Canal will pass by this area in the future.

566
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,780
The canal will be connected to Ningzhou in the north

567
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,460
and Wanzhou and Yuezhou in the south.

568
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,420
How much manpower do you need to complete this?

569
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,200
Cai Chen has done the calculations for me.

570
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,780
It'll take 10,000 laborers and five years to complete.

571
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,660
After it's completed,

572
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,400
there will be a waterway that connects Tianqi to these two places.

573
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,860
From then onward, armies and merchants

574
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,940
can save up to several months of traveling

575
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,820
by using this canal.

576
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,720
That's the reason I want to build this canal.

577
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,880
I'm preparing for the ages to come.

578
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,460
Your Majesty, the culprit who tried to kill Director Bai is a member of the Winged Clan.

579
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,100
Who?

580
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,780
The Winged Clan?

581
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,140
Didn't I tell you before?

582
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,780
Do not report to me if there's no emergency.

583
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,500
How is this an emergency?

584
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,740
It was my negligence.

585
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,180
I...

586
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,580
I shall take my leave.

587
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,780
