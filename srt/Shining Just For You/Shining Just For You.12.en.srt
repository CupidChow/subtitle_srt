[Episode 12]

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,100
Official Bai, what is this?

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Soothing incense.

17
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,000
Although no one knows what disease plagues Her Highness,

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,800
I hope the incense can offer her solace.

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,200
Official Bai, Her Highness is awake.

20
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
Your Highness.

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,600
Your Highness.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How do you feel, Your Highness?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,500
Fortunately, you're here, Director Bai.

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
You helped to placate Her Highness's symptoms.

25
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,600
I did learn a trick or two,

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
and I'm glad I could put them to use.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I thought I was already over this stubborn disease.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
But here it came back again.

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,000
How long have you had this sickness?

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,400
- More than two decades.
- More than two decades?

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,200
So you have had it since young?

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Give us a moment, Xie.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,100
Your Highness, do you still feel ill?

35
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm all right.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
I once told you

37
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,800
that I am a Snow Crane given to His Majesty by the Winged Clan.

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,300
A Snow Crane cannot betray its owner.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,400
If one does,

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
he or she will be shunned by the whole clan.

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
And worse,

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,500
some owners will place a secret spell on the Snow Crane to control it.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
It's called Lunar Erosion.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,500
Lunar Erosion?

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
When I betrayed the Winged Clan,

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,300
I knew this day was coming.

47
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,600
But I regret nothing.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,100
I just hope that when the symptoms act up,

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,400
I can die peacefully.

50
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't want His Majesty to witness my mania.

51
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,800
Your Highness!

52
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
Bai Lu.

53
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Your...

54
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
This is your reward.

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,300
My reward?

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Thanks, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Keep it well.

59
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Your Majesty, what is this?

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
It's a qilin fang token,

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,000
made personally by His Majesty.

62
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,600
What does it do?

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Its owner can enter the palace freely.

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,900
Usually, only His Majesty's most trusted guards have on.

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,500
So that means...

66
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,900
I can enter the palace as I wish now?

67
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
His Majesty does not give one away easily.

68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Consort Tian served His Majesty for seven years

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,200
before she was given one.

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,600
I only got one after I became Commander.

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,100
I can tell how differently His Majesty treats you compared to others.

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
I can visit Mianshi Bridge at night then.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Young Master, I have retrieved what you wanted.

74
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
This is...?

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,500
Qionghua Spear?

76
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Indeed. This is it.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
It's an artifact to rule the Winged Clan

78
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,600
when our ancestors built our first city.

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Each city lord agreed

80
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,000
that whoever wields the Qionghua Spear can command the Winged Clan.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,700
Alas, the Starstone embedded in it

82
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,000
was destroyed during the War of the Winged Clan.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I have been trying to restore it,

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
but I haven't found the Starstone yet.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
What is your plan, Young Master?

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,500
I've been thinking.

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,800
If Qionghua Spear fails to be restored,

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,700
can I use other means to rally all other Winged Ones?

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,700
Do not tell this to anyone.

90
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,000
You are dismissed.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You are obedient.

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,400
You came after three days as told.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Come now.

96
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,600
These are the findings of my latest study.

98
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Please have a look.

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,200
That's a lot.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
I see you didn't slack at all.

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Your Majesty, if there's nothing else,

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
I would like to get back to my work.

103
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
You're already here.

104
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,300
Why do you want to leave this early?

105
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,000
Come. I have laid out the chessboard.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come play with me.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Your Majesty, I have other businesses to attend to.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,700
I can only play a round with you.

109
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,000
A round, it is.

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes?

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Regarding Consort Tian's relapse,

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,700
I have some questions for Director Bai.

114
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,600
Ask ahead.

115
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
All right.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Director Bai, are you close to the Winged Clan?

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,300
I don't understand your question.

118
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,400
Why do you know the way to alleviate Lunar Erosion?

119
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
That's called Lunar Erosion?

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,900
I have learned some medical tricks in Yebei.

121
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,200
I don't know what Lunar Erosion is that you are talking about.

122
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Your Majesty, I'm done with my questions.

123
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,900
You are?

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're dismissed then.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,300
Yes.

126
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,500
Your Majesty, who is he?

127
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Commander of the Dark Guards.

128
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
Feng Yin.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,100
Dark Guards?

130
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,200
I have never heard of them.

131
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
You're new here.

132
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,000
You don't know everyone here.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Come on.

134
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,100
The Winged Ones who took away Qihai Rui in Yebei,

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,800
is his surname Yu?

136
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,800
No idea.

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
A'Rui never told me his name.

138
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,000
Why did he take away Qihai Rui?

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
Because they are in love?

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,100
I think A'Rui was in love with a Winged One.

141
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,300
You're close to Qihai Rui.

142
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,700
Why didn't she introduce you to him?

143
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,800
A'Rui has her own secret

144
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
that she doesn't want anyone to find out.

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
When I invaded the Winged Clan,

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
the Fourth Prince of the Winged Clan, Yu Linkong, managed to escape.

147
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,700
Yebei is close to the Winged Clan's territory.

148
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,300
Maybe the person you mentioned is Yu Linkong.

149
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
Your Majesty.

150
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,000
I feel unwell all of a sudden.

151
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,200
I should go.

152
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,500
Don't touch it.

153
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
All right.

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,600
What is your opinion of her answer?

155
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,600
I believe she didn't tell the truth

156
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,900
to protect the Winged Clan.

157
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,300
You shouldn't care about what Bai Lu said.

158
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,600
Consort Tian's Lunar Erosion is likely related to him.

159
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
You know what?

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Ask those investigating the Snow Crane to head to Ningzhou.

161
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,200
Start investigating the border between Yebei and Ningzhou.

162
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,400
I'll see to it.

163
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,000
Wait.

164
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,800
Protect Bai Lu.

165
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't let any harm come her way.

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,100
I need to know what she is doing at any moment.

167
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,300
Please rest assured, Your Majesty. I will handle this personally.

168
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,000
You don't have to do it yourself.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,700
Just delegate it to some of your peers.

170
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,600
But keep a close watch.

171
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes.

172
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,300
Go now.

173
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,600
Bai Lu.

174
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Who's there?

175
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,900
Lunch at a quarter past the hour of Wu (between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.).

176
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,200
A bowl of corn congee.

177
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,700
One pine nut pastry.

178
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,000
A plate of Indian aster with beancurd strips.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
She eats a lot.

180
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,400
At the hour of Wu, she had tea and chatted with other officials like Cheng Wu.

181
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
I toil every day

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,100
while she lounges around.

183
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,000
Three quarter past the hour of Shen (between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.), she took a nap.

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
She's either sleeping or eating.

185
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,700
Three quarter past the hour of You (between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.)...
- All right.

186
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,600
I don't want to listen to that.

187
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Anything unusual?

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Your Majesty, nothing.

189
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Nothing?

190
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,400
She's been delivering a lot of Yin-Yang Calendars to the harem.

191
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,000
The center of the seal is underwater.

192
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,100
Wait. What is she doing?

193
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,800
Is she drowning herself?

194
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,200
I'll report to Commander. Go save her.

195
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,300
You...

196
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,600
Bai Lu.

197
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,500
Your Majesty.

198
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,400
Why are you here?

199
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Why are you all drenched?

200
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
I...

201
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
What are you doing here?

202
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Your Majesty, I'm looking for a kind of grass.

203
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,800
Right, mister?

204
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,400
What mister are you talking to?

205
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,800
A handsome mister.

206
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm old.

207
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,400
No need to call me handsome.

208
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
I wasn't talking about you.

209
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,100
I was talking about the mister stalking me.

210
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Imbecile.

211
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,800
Your Majesty,

212
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,400
why did you come here this late at night?

213
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,700
How rude of you.

214
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,200
I was asking you a question.

215
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
You shouldn't reply with another question.

216
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I already answered. I'm here for serious business.

217
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,600
You're lying.

218
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
I am not.

219
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm looking for a soothing herb for Consort Tian.

220
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Go back and get changed.

221
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Your Majesty, do I have to wash this robe

222
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,000
before returning it to Guangyang Palace?

223
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Master, please accept my bow.

224
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,400
Master, I have a question.

225
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,700
You're not my disciple.

226
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,400
I may not be your disciple,

227
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,100
but I'm just like your disciple.

228
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,400
Didn't you always say that my insolence

229
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,600
was disrespect towards your rules?

230
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,900
I didn't say that.

231
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,600
Anyway, let's talk about serious business.

232
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
I have a question.

233
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,800
Does the center of the seal

234
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,300
emit a blue light underwater?

235
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,900
Wait. Where did you find the blue light?

236
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,200
Mianshi Bridge.

237
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Don't worry about that.

238
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Just tell me yes or no.

239
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Stop taking wild guesses.

240
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,800
Sun Valley and Dark Age are in opposition.

241
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,400
No wonder it only appears during the nights of clear sky.

242
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,100
How can I break a complicated seal like this?

243
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,400
Master Yun Wen.

244
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Not here.

245
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
Fine.

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll figure it out myself.

247
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,700
We won't leave!

248
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,400
We will stay in Yebei.

249
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,500
We won't leave!

250
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,600
General Zhu Ying.

251
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
We won't leave!

252
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
General Zhu Ying,

253
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
why did you allow your subordinates

254
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
to chase the Yebei people away?

255
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,400
I merely told them to pack their stuff

256
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,300
as there are only four days left to the date ordained.

257
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,200
It's hard to leave one's hometown. Be patient.

258
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
Let me talk to them.

259
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Princess Qingheng,

260
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I asked the Commander-in-Chief to announce the date.

261
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
You have talked to them for many days

262
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,000
and I don't see any substantial results.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,100
Please withdraw your troops and let me talk to them.

264
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,000
Are you defying an edict, Princess?

265
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Mr. Envoy, if I fail this,

266
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
feel free to punish me.

267
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,400
No!

268
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,000
We won't leave!

269
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Please hear me out.

270
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,300
Silence!

271
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,200
Listen to the princess.

272
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
My elders,

273
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
I was born in Yebei.

274
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
I grew up in Yebei.

275
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,400
If there was an alternative,

276
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,000
I would never leave Yebei.

277
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,400
You are the Princess of Chao.

278
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,000
The wife of a Chao general.

279
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,800
You're not one of us.

280
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,900
Yes, you're married now.

281
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,800
You're not our princess anymore.

282
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,300
Hear, hear!

283
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,600
You're with Chao now, not Yebei.

284
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,200
My father is Qihai Zhenyu.

285
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,700
I am forever a Yebei native.

286
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,000
The Emperor of Chao gave me my title

287
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,500
and mandated my marriage.

288
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,600
I did not ask for them.

289
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,800
But I couldn't convince the Emperor of Chao to rescind his order.

290
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,200
But a Yebei child will always belong to Yebei.

291
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,400
I married Yebei first.

292
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,100
My elders,

293
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,400
is Yebei our home?

294
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Yes.

295
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
It is our home.

296
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,700
As soon as we can remember something,

297
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,400
we were told that our ancestors

298
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,300
lost their homes in a war.

299
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,400
We then moved eastward from Suohe Mountain.

300
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,600
Liaoyang used to be our home soil.

301
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,900
What is Yebei then?

302
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,000
It's not land.

303
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
It's you, me,

304
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
and those of us who are alive.

305
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,060
As long as we still live, Yebei will live.

306
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,400
She's right.

307
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,580
Our ancestors did come from Liaoyang.

308
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,190
Indeed.

309
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,260
Let's pack up now. We have a long journey ahead.

310
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,440
And we cannot afford any delay.

311
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,580
Go now.

312
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,930
Let's go.

313
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,380
Nice one, Princess Lian.

314
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,360
Let me help you, Granny.

315
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,580
Okay.

316
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,770
Right.

317
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,220
Three qian of Jincheng Powder. Three qian of Jincheng Powder.

318
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,510
Made from Crescent Conch of Mei Ocean.

319
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,930
That's it. Quad-Wondrous Purification Spell.

320
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,740
Yun Wen. Yun Wen?

321
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,340
Yun Wen! I found a way to break the seal.

322
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,390
I just need the necessary ingredients.

323
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,350
Yun Wen?

324
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,630
Why is he ignoring me?

325
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,730
- Director Bai.
- Who is it?

326
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,310
Director Bai.

327
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,050
Hold on.

328
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,090
I have something...

329
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,030
Speak now. What's the matter?

330
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,600
I have something to discuss with you.

331
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,950
If there's nothing of importance, the Bureau of Astrology should close for three days. The festive season is upon us.

332
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,200
Festive season? What festival is there?

333
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
The Emperor's Natal Day.

334
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,990
His Majesty's anniversary is in five days.

335
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,230
Since the establishment of our dynasty,

336
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,070
the Emperor's Natal Day and the following two days are public holidays.

337
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,380
Tianqi City will light its lanterns to celebrate, too.

338
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,980
This year is a peaceful year.

339
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,490
The celebration will only be bigger.

340
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,830
Sure.

341
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,750
We will close for three days then.

342
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,290
Okay.

343
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,980
Wait. What are you doing?

344
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm from the Bureau of Astrology. I'll be purchasing something for the Emperor's Natal Day.

345
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,900
Go ahead.

346
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,480
Thank you.

347
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,320
Stop.

348
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,120
What did she say?

349
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,420
Official Bai said she's purchasing something for the Natal Day.

350
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,650
Let's go.

351
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,880
This is not bad.

352
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,450
Excuse me.

353
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,010
Coming!

354
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,500
How can I help you, miss?

355
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,800
This, this, and this.

356
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,520
I don't want them. Pack the rest for me.

357
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,370
Wise choice, miss.

358
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,980
I'll pack them for you.

359
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,720
Sir.

360
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
What about the price?

361
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,870
What price?

362
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,930
Let me pack them for you first.

363
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,030
Thank you.

364
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,600
You're welcome.

365
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,750
Your fabric.

366
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,720
- 50 silver dimes.
- Come again.

367
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,480
Thank you.

368
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
Mister, what did the miss say?

369
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,030
Sir.

370
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,730
Miss.

371
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,020
Have you packed the herbs I ordered?

372
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,840
Yes. Give me a minute.

373
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,170
Miss, it's so hard to find the herbs you requested.

374
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,220
I had to visit many places. Here you go.

375
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,100
Thank you so much.

376
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,330
See you.

377
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,320
Come again next time.

378
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,600
Sir, what did she tell you?

379
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,770
Careful.

380
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,840
- Thanks, mister.
- Have a safe trip.

381
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,690
Have a safe trip.

382
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,350
Mister, what did she say?

383
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,880
She said...

384
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,220
What did she tell you?

385
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,150
She...

386
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:45,425
[Jianyue Pavilion]

387
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,020
This is more tiring than a war.

388
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,850
Is Director Bai buying the entire city out?

389
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,190
I can't do this anymore.

390
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,840
Don't underestimate a woman on a shopping spree.

391
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,880
Come in. Come. Please.

392
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,210
After you.

393
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,500
This way.

394
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,130
She can get tired, too?

395
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,520
It looks like a cozy place.

396
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,780
Should we go in and get a drink?

397
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,540
It's too bland for me.

398
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,920
We've been following her the entire day.

399
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,450
I'm starving.

400
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,740
What about we have some noodles?

401
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,830
- Sure. Let's go.
- Let's go.

402
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,390
Young Master, no news from the palace.

403
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,680
This isn't right.

404
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,320
She has never taken the antidote.

405
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,710
Even if she's alive, she should be gravely injured.

406
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,220
But the informant in the palace said Consort Tian is doing fine.

407
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,290
Young Master.

408
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,100
That girl is here.

409
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,030
- Hejin.
- Miss Ye.

410
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,410
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

411
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,980
Yezi.

412
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,830
We're being watched. Be careful.

413
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,220
Okay. Have a seat.

414
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,450
Young Master.

415
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,820
This is this year's latest tea.

416
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,090
Try it.

417
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,250
I've been trying to get news of you lately.

418
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,730
If I still failed to do so, I would have barged into the palace already.

419
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,920
You want to know about Consort Tian, don't you?

420
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,420
She wasn't feeling well a few days ago.

421
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,680
That's when I learned she is a Snow Crane given to Yu Xiuming by the Winged Clan.

422
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,500
She also suffers from Lunar Erosion.

423
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,610
Do you know about this?

424
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,270
This is dangerous information.

425
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,760
It's better that you not know.

426
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,890
Just tell me.

427
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,730
Fine.

428
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,250
Before Snow Cranes are trained,

429
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,370
they have to swear absolute loyalty to their owners.

430
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,500
They are willing to receive the mark of Lunar Erosion.

431
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,840
So you knew she would be unwell?

432
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,060
I just wanted to give her a warning.

433
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:12,070
Oh, right. Is Yi Wuyou your real name?

434
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,330
Why do you ask?

435
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,130
Two days ago, Yu Xiuming asked me if

436
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,340
the Winged One with A'Rui on Ruogan Peak has the surname of Yu.

437
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,600
That's why I asked.

438
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,220
It's in the past now.

439
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,390
Like you, I'm a wanderer.

440
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,780
Sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you.

441
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,810
It's okay.

442
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,480
Whatever your name is,

443
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,800
you will always be the person A'Rui and I befriended in Yebei.

444
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,080
Yu Xiuming might locate you soon.

445
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,330
Be careful.

446
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,800
Yezi.

447
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,770
I don't want to raise any suspicion.

448
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,580
I should go.

449
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,670
Hejin, who is that lady?

450
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,610
She is a musician here.

451
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,330
Her exceptional skill has attracted several rich customers.

452
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,880
Musician?

453
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,860
Is she one of your people as well?

454
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,750
She's just an ordinary person.

455
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,630
Come with me.

456
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,690
Come. Come in.

457
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,310
See you, miss.

458
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,710
Here she is.

459
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,940
Have a safe trip.

460
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,740
Come and have a look.

461
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,420
Have a look, mister.

462
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,240
Have a safe trip.

463
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,740
Gentlemen,

464
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,310
since you're following me already,

465
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,220
can you give me a hand?

466
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,040
Don't miss out while passing through!

467
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,140
Good rouge here!

468
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,390
Miss, I have good rouge here.

469
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,390
Have a look.

470
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,580
You're finally here, Your Highness. Anything?

471
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,470
I have important news.

472
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,280
Mr. Wangyou at Jianyue Pavilion is the one we're after.

473
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,260
In that case, you should return to Ningzhou now, Your Highness.

474
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,370
If I merely wanted to confirm his identity,

475
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,520
I wouldn't have to come here myself.

476
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,210
Right.

477
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,630
Master wrote to me again,

478
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,260
asking me to persuade you to return.

479
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,910
I still need to investigate further

480
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,530
if and how we should use that person.

481
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:04,620
Please write a letter so that I can reply to Master.

482
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,790
Letters can be intercepted. I shall not write one.

483
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,700
Deliver a message for me.

484
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,310
"Come to Tianqi if you can.

485
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,440
Forging an alliance is a serious matter. I can't close the deal alone."

486
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,160
I have memorized it.

487
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,250
I'll take this one.

488
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,380
Thanks, miss.

489
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,790
Please come again.

490
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,830
Rouge!

491
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,190
Don't miss out! Good rouge here!

492
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,450
Keep up!

493
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,870
Greetings, Your Majesty.

494
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,750
She alone can tire you out like this?

495
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,610
Silence.

496
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,700
So, she asked you for help

497
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,220
and you abided obediently?

498
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,480
What if she got too tired and decided to buy a house and rest there?

499
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,460
That'd be troublesome.

500
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,680
She said she was shopping for the Emperor's Natal Day.

501
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,560
She did tell that to the imperial patrols.

502
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,300
All right.

503
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,190
If she goes shopping again in a few days,

504
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,380
you will offer to help her carry her things.

505
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

506
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:14,360
Yun Wen, do we have enough golden pearls here?

507
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,430
Yun Wen.

508
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,140
Yun...

509
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,530
Why do you ignore me when I bring it up?

510
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,660
I go to Mianshi Bridge every day and it changes every day.

511
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,420
Tonight will have a clear sky.

512
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,380
I will break the Truth Master's seal.

513
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,870
Your Majesty.

514
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,800
Is she back?

515
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,690
Yes. Quite early today.

516
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,220
She bought many things?

517
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,910
Yes, she did.

518
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:58,000
Does she do anything else other than shopping?

519
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,450
She measured the Ningzhou fabric on her the night before last

520
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,730
as if she was making a new robe.

521
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,630
And every night, she takes a stroll around Mianshi Bridge.

522
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,760
She paints occasionally.

523
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,960
Mianshi Bridge again?

524
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,000
Bai Lu.

525
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,490
Your... Your Majesty.

526
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What brings you here?

527
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,950
What are you doing here alone? Being all stealthy.

528
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,620
I...

529
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,380
I...

530
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,290
I'm admiring the moon.

531
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,220
Admiring the moon?

532
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,870
Yes.

533
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,080
What were you holding in your hands?

534
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,450
Well... It's...

535
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,850
You won't tell me?

536
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,180
I shall throw it into the pool.

537
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,550
Don't!

538
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,750
I'll come clean. Don't throw it away.

539
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,240
It's very expensive.

540
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,950
It's a powder made from Crimson Silk Thread and Jincheng Pearls.

541
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:41,120
So you shopped around to buy them?

542
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,250
Why?

543
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,680
I thought you were...

544
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,060
What did you think I was doing?

545
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Tell me. What do you do with the powder?

546
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,560
The task you gave me.

547
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,380
Watch me.

548
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,140
What am I supposed to look at?

549
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,570
What...

550
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,590
That's not right.

551
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,530
I wasn't lying.

552
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,490
I saw it that day.

553
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,040
I truly saw it that day.

554
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,220
What's the matter?

555
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,920
What is that?

556
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,060
Shouldn't I ask you that question?

557
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,730
I thought it was a Truth Master?

558
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,490
Truth Master? What Truth Master, huh?

559
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,120
Don't just stand still!

560
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,240
Stab it!

561
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,520
It left?

562
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,340
It has left, right?

563
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,080
Are you crazy?

564
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,310
Do you know what you were doing?

565
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,650
I was looking for a Truth Master?

566
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,520
Truth Master?

567
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,940
If it promises you a gift, will you take it?

568
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,510
Risking your own life for a nonsensical matter like this,

569
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,320
are you an idiot?

570
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,860
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

571
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,620
Your Majesty.

572
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,540
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

573
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,940
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,820

00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,280
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

582
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,780
♫ Void of someone ♫

583
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:34,080
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

584

♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

594
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,520
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫
