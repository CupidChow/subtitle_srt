15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,800
Dayuangu, this is the medicinal herb I picked from the valley.

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Try it. It might help.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
Never mind.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,700
Nothing is going to work.

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,100
Young Master Yi, I'd like to ask you for a favor.

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,600
Please go to Tianqi after my passing

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
to look after my daughter.

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Ye is still alive?

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,900
How do you know that she's in Tianqi?

24
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,800
Of course, I know.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,600
She is favored by the Truth Master.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,400
I know you've been looking for the Starstone.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,200
As long as you stay by her side,

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,800
you'll definitely find the Starstone one day.

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
Don't worry, Dayuangu.

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,400
Even if it isn't for the Starstone,

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
I'd still protect Ye, too.

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,900
Thank you.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
You treat my daughter

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,100
with so much sincerity.

35
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,800
You genuinely care for her and love her.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,300
Too bad,

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,200
the only man who can stand by her side...

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,900
is the...

and return to Tianqi

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
to revive the glory of the Winged Clan.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Hurry up.

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,400

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Grandma.

58
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Grandma, are you all right?

59
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,800
Yebei no longer has a leader who can save us.

60
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm just an old woman and my life doesn't matter anymore.

Leader Bai went out

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,400
after she signed her attendance.

101
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,200
How dare she? Why didn't you stop her?

102
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,800
You never said that we weren't allowed to leave after we sign our attendance.

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,800
Where did she go?

104
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
I have no idea.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What is so funny?

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Get back to work. Do a good job.

Bai Lu is really daring.

Come and have a look.

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,400
- Give me one of these.
- Sure.

111
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
- This one.
- It's pretty good.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,400
Come to me again if you need anything.

113
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Come and have a look. Come and have a look.

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,500
The Heluo Clan's masks. What do you think?

115
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,400
Come and have a look.

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
The Heluo Clan's masks.

117
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Really? Let's go and take a look.

118
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,600
Why is this woman wearing an official gown?

119
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,100
Isn't she the female official that Old Master told you to investigate?

120
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,000
Did you forget about it, Young Master?

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Is she the one?

122
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,100
I heard His Majesty had entrusted her with

123
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,400
the task of finding an auspicious site for the Ceremony of Stars.

124
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,100
If I got assigned this task,

125
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,200
I would've been able to make a fortune out of it.

126
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,900
Young Master, how can you make a fortune by picking the auspicious site?

127
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,700
You would've been my master if you knew how.

128
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,740
Yes.

129
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,780
No matter how hard I try, I'd still be no match for you, Young Master.

130
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,250
Let me ask you a question.

131
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,600
Do you know what the best tool one can use to earn money is?

132
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,950
- Information.
- Information?

133
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,609
When they finalize the auspicious site,

134
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,980
the Bureau of Astrology will have to spend a huge sum demolishing and rebuilding it.

135
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,549
Then, they will get a good amount of demolition funds from the royal court.

136
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,899
It won't be that difficult to get some kickback from that.

137
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,130
But... why is she walking around instead of serving her duty

138
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,670
at the Bureau of Astrology?

139
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,020
Follow her... and find out where she's headed.

140
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,680
Yes.

141
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,469
This land on the other side of the river is sought-after.

142
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,780
But why is it still undeveloped?

143
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,079
That's because it was chosen as the auspicious site.

144
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,710
Yes.

145
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,050
His Majesty nominated it as the auspicious site,

146
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,320
so no one dared build anything on that land.

147
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,550
Precisely.

148
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,040
Look. It's a very nice place.

149
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,100
It's such a pity.

150
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,659
Yeah, it's such a nice piece of land, but it was left unused.

151
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,230
Sir.

152
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,699
I heard that most people refuse to turn their houses into auspicious sites.

153
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:30,839
Why is that so?

154
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,370
The government will take over our places aggressively. Besides, they offer so little.

155
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,789
Of course, no one wants to give up their houses.

156
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,339
Young girl, do you know any undeveloped land nearby?

157
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,350
I do. Let me take you there.

158
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,530
Sure. Let's go.

159
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,279
You're due to submit the list of auspicious sites to His Majesty tomorrow.

160
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,150
Aren't you nervous?

161
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,200
What's the hurry?

162
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,050
Can't you see I'm working on it?

163
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,960
What is this?

164
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,349
Your choices of auspicious sites are getting increasingly ridiculous.

165
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,839
The auspicious site needs to have the right scent, shape, sound, color, the four auspicious signs,

166
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,700
and against seven odds.

167
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,009
Look at your calculation.

168
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,880
It doesn't even meet the basic requirements.

169
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,899
These are all undeveloped lands in Tianqi.

170
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,229
I think Yu Xiuming, as the emperor,

171
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,570
will not want to spend money unnecessarily or see his people suffer.

172
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,309
As long as he likes my plan, I will be able to survive.

173
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,789
What if Yu Xiuming cares more about astrology than people's lives?

174
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,180
You have a point.

175
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll send someone to verify it tomorrow.

176
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,830
The auspicious site...

177
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,999
The Bureau of Astrology is going to deliver the Yin-Yang Calendar today.

178
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,879
I think the Yin-Yang Calendar is completely useless.

179
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,250
Nothing works if His Majesty doesn't show up.

180
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,250
We have nothing to do anyway.

181
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,680
At least we can have an extra person around to entertain us.

182
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,370
There are no fun people in this palace.

183
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,200
No interesting people can stand living here.

184
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,450
Bai Lu is here to greet Your Highnesses.

185
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,130
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

186
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,670
Come on in.

187
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,320
Yes.

188
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,759
I didn't manage to take a good look at her because of the pearl curtain.

189
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,970
It's true, she is a woman.

190
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,790
I heard that His Majesty personally appointed her to her current position.

191
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,419
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

192
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm here to deliver the Yin-Yang Calendar.

193
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,989
Leave it there. No one cares about it.

194
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,450
Yes.

195
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,510
We're tired of talking with each other.

196
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,530
Do you want to have a chat with us?

197
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,670
I don't know what Your Highnesses are interested in.

198
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,549
I'm worried that I might say something inappropriate.

199
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:34,979
You always have discussions with His Majesty.

200
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,669
Why do you fear talking to us?

201
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,049
That's right. Let's have a chat.

202
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:44,970
By the way, I'm sure Your Highnesses know His Majesty better than I do.

203
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,240
Can Your Highnesses advise me on something?

204
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,700
What is His Majesty like?

205
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,199
He doesn't like women at all.

206
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,860
Concubine Tian is the only one who has been following His Majesty for years

207
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,680
and volunteered to move into the palace to take care of His Majesty.

208
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,790
Too bad she's not here.

209
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,200
Consort Tian couldn't care less about the Yin-Yang Calendar.

210
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,030
It's no surprise that she's not here.

211
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,770
Your Highness. Greetings, Consort Tian.

212
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,010
You're here.

213
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,070
Yes.

214
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,740
Your Highness, I delivered the Yin-Yang Calendar to the palace today

215
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,000
and thought I should personally greet Your Highness.

216
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,410
I got it. You can leave now.

217
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,240
Your Highness, I'm here today

218
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,490
hoping to get some information from Your Highness.

219
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,179
According to Their Highnesses,

220
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,710
Your Highness has been following His Majesty for years.

221
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,440
I wonder what you think of His Majesty.

222
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,709
Why are you asking this out of nowhere?

223
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,489
His Majesty ordered me to find an auspicious site for the Ceremony of Stars.

224
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:14,320
Therefore, I'm hoping to find out more

225
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,369
about His Majesty's preference through Your Highness.

226
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:19,340
Only then can I pick the perfect auspicious site.

227
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,700
You do take your job very seriously.

228
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,540
It's my duty.

229
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,599
It's your duty to learn how to please His Majesty.

230
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,410
Your Highness, I'm very curious.

231
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,929
Is it true that His Majesty always picks an auspicious date to depart on an expedition?

232
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,460
To be honest,

233
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,530
His Majesty doesn't care much about astrology.

234
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,740
Really?

235
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,530
You've heard of the Imperial Seal, right?

236
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,750
I have. It's a seal from the previous dynasty.

237
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,079
It's said that whoever lays his hand on it

238
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,930
will be an emperor chosen by Heaven.

239
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,310
During the final year of the Xian Dynasty, His Majesty invaded Tianqi.

240
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,579
Everyone thought His Majesty would take the seal from the South Palace.

241
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,009
The palace was heavily guarded because of that.

242
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,930
If His Majesty had gone there, His Majesty would have taken the seal from the South Palace.

243
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,090
Did His Majesty foresee what was going to happen?

244
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,280
Was that why he didn't go there?

245
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,740
He didn't care about the Imperial Seal at all.

246
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,150
He sent his men to cast a Yufei Spell in that area.

247
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,900
The heavy infantry and the Imperial Seal

248
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,620
were set on fire and turned into ashes.

249
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,700
For His Majesty, victory means only one thing.

250
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,810
It gives him enough power.

251
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,810
Make sure our destiny

252
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,560
is always in our own hands.

253
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,020
Now I know why.

254
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,130
He destroyed the symbol of Heaven's will.

255
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,070
It's true he doesn't believe in astrology.

256
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,970
Is this the result of your calculation?

257
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,790
Yes, sir.

258
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,950
They are all wrong.

259
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Sir, the deadline is today.

260
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,060
We must submit something.

261
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,270
This is ridiculous.

262
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,939
I need to talk to His Majesty.

263
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,100
All right.

264
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,979
You need more training. Redo it.

265
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,270
But it makes a lot of sense.

266
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,159
Let me explain it to you.

267
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,879
- Let me explain it...
- Leader Bai.

268
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,690
You put a lot of effort into this nonetheless.

269
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,370
We need to try submitting it to find out if it works.

270
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,100
You're right.

271
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,150
If His Majesty likes your plan a lot, then

272
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,880
- Leader Bai would get some credits for it too.
- You're right.

273
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,560
- If it works, His Majesty won't make things difficult for the Bureau of Astrology again.

274
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,020
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

275
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,150
You're here.

276
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,989
Official Jie, have you decided on the auspicious site for the Ceremony of Stars?

277
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:22,239
Your Majesty, I have checked the map repeatedly,

278
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,410
but still failed to find the best-suited location.

279
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,670
Official Jie, are you going to give me another lecture now?

280
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,460
I never meant that, Your Majesty.

281
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,690
It's Heaven's will.

282
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,160
I didn't do it on purpose.

283
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,530
Heaven's will?

284
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,460
Are you saying that Heaven is not in favor of Chao?

285
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,960
That's why we can't even find the right place to hold a ceremony.

286
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,860
It's not true, Your Majesty.

287
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,140
Your Majesty brought peace to all the states and unified the five tribes.

288
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,680
Of course, Heaven is in favor of us.

289
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,390
If we fail to organize the Ceremony of Stars,

290
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,289
it'll give those with ulterior motives an opportunity to talk behind my back,

291
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,209
slander my reputation,

292
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,550
and watch me make a fool out of myself.

293
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,880
- Bai Lu.
- Here!

294
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,920
I assigned the task to you, too.

295
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,120
How did it go?

296
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,760
Your Majesty, she is just an inexperienced leader.

297
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,630
Are you really talking back now?

298
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,160
Your Majesty.

299
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,419
Your Majesty, I managed to pick four auspicious sites.

300
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,240
Please make your choice, Your Majesty.

301
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,430
Bai Lu.

302
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,170
Official Jie.

303
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,400
You can leave now.

304
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,140
Your Majesty.

305
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,430
I'll take my leave now.

306
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,530
These are just some ordinary locations.

307
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,420
The South Palace is one of them, too.

308
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,420
You're not trying to fool me, right?

309
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,359
Your Majesty, I'm not trying to fool you.

310
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,569
Look at these locations. They all have their shortcomings,

311
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:37,200
but an auspicious site has to be a bustling place

312
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,950
with abundant astrology power.

313
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,349
Only then can it grant Your Majesty's wishes

314
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:45,560
and bless the people of Chao.

315
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,360
A bustling place?

316
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,070
Do you think this is a bustling place?

317
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,739
Look at this, Your Majesty.

318
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,010
This place will bring wealth to the country.

319
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,550
Look at this. This place will bring tranquillity to our nation.

320
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,190
Don't forget this.

321
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,810
This will bring love to all things and all people in the country.

322
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,690
What about the South Palace?

323
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,830
What does it do?

324
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,899
Your Majesty, don't forget about what happened in the South Palace.

325
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:22,990
The Imperial Seal was destroyed in the South Palace.

326
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,870
Think about it.

327
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,190
The Imperial Seal must have contained a great deal of good luck.

328
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,090
Therefore, the place is no doubt an auspicious site.

329
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,710
It will bring peace to the world.

330
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,860
Are you sure?

331
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,810
I'm not.

332
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,120
How dare you finalize your work when you're not sure about it either?

333
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,700
Do you have a death wish?

334
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,280
Your Majesty, I only did that because I know

335
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,610
Your Majesty doesn't believe in astrology.

336
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,440
You don't care where the Ceremony of Stars will be held.

337
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,710
If that's the case, we should

338
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,090
pick a location that doesn't upset the people, require a huge fund to rebuild,

339
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,390
and is decent enough for the ceremony?

340
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,270
Of course. The location Your Majesty picks will always be the most auspicious site.

341
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,460
So I will leave the decision to Your Majesty.

342
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,940
Bring peace to the world.

343
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,310
That's a good choice.

344
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,360
We'll hold the ceremony there.

345
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,790
Your Majesty is so wise.

346
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,990
Supervisor, you're back.

347
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,730
Supervisor, you're back.

348
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,560
Where is Leader Bai?

349
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,240
Is she getting punished?

350
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,460
The decree has arrived!

351
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,360
A decree for all members of the Bureau of Astrology.

352
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,980
"Bai Lu, the leader of the Bureau of Astrology, found an auspicious site for the ceremony

353
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,609
and will be promoted to Director of the Bureau of Astrology."

354
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:11,430
That is all.

355
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,720
Thanks, Your Majesty.

356
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,400
Long live Your Majesty.

357
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,240
Supervisor Jie. Official Bai.

358
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,840
I'll be going.

359
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,101
All right. Get back to work.

360
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:36,950
Guan Yi.

361
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,379
You mentioned the supervision at the construction site.

362
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,810
Do you need more men?

363
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,810
We're going to continue with the construction of the altar.

364
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:50,040
The Astrology Department has to keep an eye on the farming season too and is quite occupied.

365
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,050
I see.

366
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,629
Bai Lu needs more training in the Bureau of Astrology, too.

367
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:59,530
Let us leave the supervision to Bai Lu.

368
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,669
Supervisor, I have always been in charge of supervising the construction.

369
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,159
Bai Lu is too inexperienced for that.

370
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:10,320
You should guide her if you think she doesn't have enough experience.

371
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,130
We can easily solve this.

372
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,400
It's not too difficult to supervise a construction site.

373
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,480
Director Guan, I'll apologize in advance if I don't do a good job.

374
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,939
Yes. I'll do as Supervisor said.

375
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,130
Did something good happen to Your Majesty today?

376
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,770
Does it look like it?

377
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,580
Yes.

378
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,240
Shut up.

379
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,740
Look at the ministers of the royal court.

380
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,760
The smart ones can't take on huge responsibilities,

381
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,030
while the loyal and brave ones are overscrupulous.

382
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,239
I rarely meet someone who knows how to read the situation

383
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:05,250
and is smart at the same time.

384
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,860
It's such a waste.

385
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,310
Really?

386
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,570
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

387
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,800
I wonder which official Your Majesty is talking about.

388
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,070
You should be very familiar with this name, too.

389
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,940
I'm talking about Bai Lu.

390
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,810
Bai Lu?

391
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,480
Has she found the auspicious site?

392
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,950
The result is exactly what I was hoping for.

393
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,610
Where is the auspicious site?

394
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,590
- The South Palace.
- The South Palace?

395
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,780
I never believed in Heaven's will.

396
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,379
Whether a location is auspicious or inauspicious,

397
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,829
I think it's all nonsense.

398
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,040
However, I must put on an act to reassure the people.

399
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,570
If we build the altar in the middle of a busy city,

400
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,240
we will have to demolish a few houses and disturb the people.

401
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,300
It requires a lot of unnecessary effort and money.

402
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,610
The ministers will also take this chance to line their pockets.

403
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,730
The South Palace is the perfect location.

404
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,099
She worked hard to come up with such an excuse.

405
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:27,110
Father, did you want to see me?

406
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,050
Regarding the task I assigned to you,

407
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,590
how did it go?

408
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,869
I have received many assignments from you, Father.

409
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:38,920
I don't know which one you're referring to.

410
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,410
About Bai Lu, the female official.

411
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,180
About that...

412
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,560
I have done all I could to investigate it.

413
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,349
However, Bai Lu had been idling the whole time.

414
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:58,390
I couldn't find anything.

415
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,210
You always blame me for not entrusting more tasks to you.

416
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,910
Now, I've entrusted a major task to you, but you weren't taking it seriously.

417
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,350
Do you think I'd dare give you any assignments in the future?

418
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,349
I consider myself a capable and smart man.

419
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,340
But why is my son so useless?

420
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,459
You didn't tell me exactly what you wanted.

421
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,429
How would I know that it was an urgent task?

422
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,640
Moreover, the assignment you gave me

423
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,040
didn't look like a major task at all.

424
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,690
You're right.

425
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,800
Sooner or later, I will have to explain it to my descendants.

426
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,600
Look. Our family runs a huge business.

427
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,849
Fan Ping might not take it seriously,

428
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,259
but I will definitely protect it as if it were our family's treasure.

429
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,960
I'm not talking about the Fan family.

430
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,980
I'm talking about the country.

431
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,169
What I'm leaving behind for my descendants isn't my official position,

432
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:02,160
but the entire Chao.

433
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,000
I wouldn't dare to think about that.

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,970
Are you trying to kill His Majesty?

435
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,989
What nonsense! What is wrong with you?

436
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:14,280
Everyone will die.

437
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,630
His Majesty is the only exception as he is blessed with extraordinary power.

438
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,670
That was how he conquered the world.

439
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,019
The power lasts until today.

440
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:25,220
Only a person with a death wish would try to harm His Majesty.

441
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,450
He was supposed to stay forever young,

442
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,589
but he started growing grey hair recently.

443
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:33,749
I guess he is running out of power.

444
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:36,419
Right now, I need to beat Jie Haitian

445
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,029
and instigate others to exhaust his power.

446
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,170
And then...

447
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,090
Young Master.

448
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,499
Did anything unusual happen when I wasn't at Moon Tower?

449
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,320
Nothing happened. However, Miss Ye was here to look for you.

450
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,340
I didn't tell her your whereabouts,

451
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,620
so it's up to you what to do next.

452
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,760
Young Master, I'm afraid the rain won't stop for a while.

453
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,260
Let's find shelter.

454
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Let's go take a look.

455
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,130
Yes.

456
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,860
Sorry. I shouldn't have disturbed you.

457
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't worry, Miss. We're not bad guys.

458
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,470
We're only here to take shelter from the rain.

459
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,100
Make yourself at home.

460
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,690
My father and brother have just gone out.

461
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,160
I'll go and look for them.

462
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,630
Miss.

463
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,109
You're going out to look for your father and brother,

464
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:39,330
but what if they come back and don't see you here?

465
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,559
You should stay here. We'll leave.

466
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,130
Young Master, eat something.

467
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,599
I'm fine. Offer it to the young lady. She might need it.

468
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,210
Yes.

469
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,470
Miss, I'm sure you're starving.

470
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,300
My young master told me to give this to you. You should have it.

471
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,470
Thank you. I have taken some food.

472
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,679
Thanks, Young Master.

473
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,750
I'm going to the market to look for my father and brother.

474
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,570
Miss, please wait.

475
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,279
It's raining out there. This is an umbrella for you.

476
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,220
Thanks, Young Master. I'm fine.

477
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,549
Don't you think she shares a resemblance with Aunt Jingyun

478
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:21,070
when she was playing the guqin?

479
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,390
General, is it true His Majesty won't allow you to return to Tianqi

480
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,560
if we can't find the Divine Mirror?

481
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,550
The Sea of Bitterness is huge.

482
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,270
I don't know if we can ever find the Mirror of Youth.

483
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,970
I can help you find the Mirror of Youth.

484
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,840
Are you willing to help me?

485
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I need something from you in return.

486
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,930
It comes with a condition.

487
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,880
I'll find the Mirror of Youth for you, and you'll allow us to work in shifts.

488
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,650
How does that sound?

489
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,230
I'm not going to do this.

490
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,769
Look what they did to us.

491
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,120
How can you help them?

492
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,080
Chu Ye, let Her Highness finish talking.

493
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,289
Don't you get it yet?

494
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:35,329
The Emperor of Chao never intended to let us go.

495
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,569
He sent his men to supervise us as we restored the canal.

496
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:40,810
It's clear that he wants to eliminate all the people of Yebei.

497
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,839
As long as the emperor is still alive,

498
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,579
we'll never make a comeback victory.

499
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:46,249
I'll confront them, then.

500
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,150
Calm down, Chu Ye.

501
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,519
If it was so easy to kill the Emperor of Chao, we would've done it much earlier.

502
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,370
We must kill the emperor before the members of our tribe die

503
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,639
from exhaustion, starvation, or extreme torture.

504
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,639
Your Highness, are you serious?

505
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,449
In order to leave Yebei, we need to help Jie Zhuying find the Mirror of Youth.

506
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,900
We will follow him to Tianqi and find a chance to assassinate the emperor.

507
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Sure. We'll kill him.

508
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:14,239
My biggest regret is that I didn't kill him when we were in Yebei.

509
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,820
I'm coming, too.

510
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,090
I'm coming, too.

511
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,880
- I'm coming, too.
- I'm coming, too.

512
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,570
Sure. Let's do it together.

513
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,200
Don't let anyone else find out about this,

514
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,710
including your parents and siblings.

515
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,090
If the news leaks, we'll all die.

516
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,620
Can you promise me?

517
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,850
Yes.

518
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,560
We need more men to build the altar.

519
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,969
If the members of our tribe find out

520
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,669
that we're helping the Chao Army find the mirror, I worry things may go wrong.

521
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,400
Still, you can't let them know about this.

522
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,980
I'll bear all the consequences.

523
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,250
I'm going to take a different path,

524
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,190
but I didn't forget what you told me, Father.

525
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,210
I'm doing this so that the people of Yebei can survive.

526
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,025
[Fan Residence]

527
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,620
Sir, here's a report Yu Shining sent in from the Sky Water Battalion in Yebei.

528
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,630
Commander-in-Chief, General Jie Zhuying hindered the process of the canal restoration

529
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,349
and deceived the emperor.

530
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,570
He took sides with the Qihai Tribe of Yebei

531
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,530
and refused to kill the men who couldn't contribute.

532
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,490
Sir, he is deceiving the emperor.

533
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,629
According to the military rules, he should be sentenced to death.

534
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,710
I was worried that I couldn't find his weakness.

535
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,730
Unexpectedly, his son came to the door by himself.

536
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,220
Then, should we...

537
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,990
I'm going to report this to His Majesty when I attend the morning assembly tomorrow.

538
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,090
Send a few men to come with me tomorrow.

539
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,740
Yes.

540
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,710
Your Majesty, the Dark Guards received a secret letter two days ago

541
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,590
from the Sky Water Battalion of Yebei.

542
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,399
Is it from Fan Ruhui's informant?

543
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,940
Yes.

544
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,460
Go on.

545
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,270
According to the secret letter, Commander-in-Chief, General Jie Zhuying, deceived Your Majesty.

546
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,920
He took sides with the Qihai Tribe of Yebei and refused to kill the men who couldn't contribute.

547
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,530
General Jie has always been a soft-hearted man,

548
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,570
but he shouldn't have disobeyed Your Majesty so blatantly.

549
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,230
I never ordered him to kill anyone.

550
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,990
Bring Jie Haitian here.

551
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,339
I have no objection to Your Majesty's will to establish a protectorate.

552
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:22,250
However, it's really unwise to appoint the Protectorate General

553
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,780
as the leader of the troop.

554
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,370
Official Jie, we'll discuss this some other day.

555
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,910
I received news from Yebei,

556
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,879
saying that I ordered them to kill the old and weak people.

557
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:34,040
I've never issued a decree like this.

558
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,910
Your Majesty, this...

559
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,569
Your Majesty, I might've made a unilateral decision.

560
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,770
We have a lot of people in Chao to look after.

561
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,010
We won't have enough resources to take care of the people of Yebei.

562
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,800
I beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness.

563
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,539
Do you think we can solve this just by asking for my forgiveness?

564
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,700
Your Majesty!

565
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,370
- Your Majesty.
- Do you know

566
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,810
that Zhuying didn't obey the military order while he was in Yebei,

567
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,730
and someone has already written to me about this?

568
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,220
Your Majesty.

569
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,720
It's Jie Zhuying's fault for not obeying the military order

570
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,680
and the imperial decree.

571
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,000
However, this only happened because I tampered with the decree.

572
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,370
Zhuying has always been loyal to Your Majesty.

573
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,130
I know Zhuying very well.

574
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,560
I know what's on his mind.

575
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,290
If I guessed it correctly,

576
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,869
Fan Ruhui will definitely impeach him publicly tomorrow.

577
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:10,920
If that happens, even I won't be able to help him.

578
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,870
Your Majesty, I tampered with the imperial decree.

579
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,300
It is unforgivable.

580
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,040
Your Majesty.

581
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,830
I'm willing to sacrifice myself so that Your Majesty can spare my son.

582
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:53,700
[Jie Residence]

583
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,290
My Lord, your headwear.

584
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,260
My Lord.

585
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,590
My Lord, will you be back for lunch later?

586
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,090
I won't.

587
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,840
There were many ministers serving the previous dynasty,

588
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,690
putting the government in mayhem and causing the monarchy to lose its power.

589
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:03,680
Conflicts happened between the ministers and brought suffering to the people.

590
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,009
When I established the army back then,

591
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:08,400
I wanted to give people a better life

592
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,250
and bring peace to the country.

593
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,970
Now that our country has achieved peace,

594
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,460
Great Chao shall not adopt the feudal system but be divided into nine states.

595
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,690
We'll establish a protectorate in each state

596
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,260
with a Protectorate General managing the military and political affairs of the state.

597
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,960
Regarding the border of the states,

598
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,449
the candidates for the Protectorate General,

599
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:33,010
and which offices to set up,

600
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,050
Fan Ruhui, I want you to submit a proposal after you draw it up.

601
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

602
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,600
