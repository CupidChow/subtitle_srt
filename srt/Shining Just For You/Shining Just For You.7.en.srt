[Shining Just for You]

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,940
[Episode 7]

15
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,060
Cursed woman, you're everywhere.

16
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,320
Many people of Yebei have died.

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,720
But now, you still want to kill each other?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,960
- Ye Lingshuang.
- You're still alive?

19
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,940
Princess Lian. Princess Lian.

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,580
Yezi.

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,220
That's what happened.

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,419
After that, I was sent to Tianqi together with the female captives of Yebei.

23
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,080
What about now?

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,019
I wish to find out about the whereabouts of A'Rui in Tianqi.

25
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,800
That's why I joined the Bureau of Astrology.

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,219
Now, I'm the director.

27
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,440
Well, well.

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,619
So, you've started serving that emperor?

29
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,760
Your Highness, kill her.

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
The cursed woman has betrayed Yebei.

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,280
Chu Ye, calm down.

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,859
She's an official of Chao. She serves the emperor.

33
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,379
If we kill her, our location might be exposed.

34
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,400
We will suffer less if she stays away from us.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,880
I was nowhere near during the Battle of Yebei.

36
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,840
Didn't you guys suffer, too?

37
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,980
You'll bring calamity to us as long as you're alive.

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,140
Chu Ye, back off.

39
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,480
Yezi, I don't wish to deceive you.

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,939
We came to Tianqi to end Yebei's suffering.

41
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,220
We plan to assassinate the Emperor of Chao.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,700
Assassinate the emperor?

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,880
But that's too risky.

44
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,259
Of course, I know it's risky.

45
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,740
I would never have believed this if I hadn't seen it for myself.

46
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,740
The Emperor of Chao is inhumane.

47
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,580
What did you say?

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,540
That day...

49
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,720
To hell with you!

50
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,020
Dayuangu cast the Hengchen Skyfire Spell.

51
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,040
But even the Skyfire didn't hurt Yu Xiuming at all.

52
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
Yu Xiuming was struck by the Skyfire...

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,160
but was unharmed?

54
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,000
At least we couldn't tell that he was harmed.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,019
If that's the case, normal methods won't work on him.

56
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,739
Maybe it's because his armor contains extraordinary power.

57
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,380
That's a possibility.

58
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,830
Consort Tian told me that his armor

59
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,840
was crafted by a master blacksmith from the Heluo Clan

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
using the Glacier Metal gifted by the Kuafu Clan.

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,219
He never lets anyone touch it.

62
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,000
He polishes it himself every time.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,039
If it's due to the armor, then we'll stand a chance with this plan.

64
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,200
I plan to sneak into the Ceremony of Stars and assassinate him.

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,039
According to the customs, he needs to wear the imperial robe and crown during the ceremony.

66
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,140
He won't be able to wear the armor in that case.

67
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,839
Without the armor's protection, with the princess's celestial power,

68
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm sure she can kill him if she uses all her powers.

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,020
Princess Lian, please think twice.

70
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,259
Yu Xiuming has always been arrogant.

71
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,419
Even so, he's undefeated.

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,700
He probably has something that other people don't.

73
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,920
Anyway, I'll investigate the case for you first.

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,900
I'll leave it to you, then.

75
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,860
Yezi,

76
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,899
all this while, Chu Ye and the rest have experienced many misfortunes.

77
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,780
That's why they were harsh with their words.

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't take their words to heart.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,880
It's fine. I'm already used to it.

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,060
The people of Yebei have always treated me like this.

81
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,620
It has never changed, from the past to the present.

82
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,300
It won't happen in the future. I will stop them.

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,900
Yezi, to me,

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,520
you're just as important as A'Rui.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,760
A'Rui once said that you were her best sister.

86
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,000
She always wanted to be like you.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,420
Now, A'Rui is no longer around.

88
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,500
Can you call me Sister on her behalf?

89
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,120
But Princess Lian...

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,900
Call me Sister.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,660
Sister Lian.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,819
Dayuangu's Hengchen Skyfire Spell didn't hurt Yu Xiuming at all?

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,380
Could it be...

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,600
that he's not a human?

95
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,540
Yun Wen.

96
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,960
Yun Wen?

97
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,980
Master Yun Wen!

98
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,680
Do not interrupt my meditation.

99
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,020
Master, you're wise and knowledgeable.

100
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,190
I have something to ask you.

101
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,880
Say someone was hit by Hengchen Skyfire Spell

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,490
but stayed unharmed,

103
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,760
what do you think would be the reason?

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,840
I won't tell you even if I knew.

105
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,639
I think you have no idea. You're just trying to confuse me.

106
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,620
Wise and knowledgeable?

107
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,800
You're just boasting. I'm sure you're a fraud.

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,920
It's useless.

109
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,360
I won't fall for your trick.

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,780
This is the largest secret of the current era.

111
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,910
If anyone can find out why,

112
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,970
it must be you, not me or other people.

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,660
I'm not that great.

114
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,440
Master, thank you for the high praise.

115
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,480
You know what?

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,959
I've spent the entire night thinking about it. But I have no idea at all.

117
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,140
It's useless for you to just think about it.

118
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,139
But you also know that Yunji Building is tightly guarded.

119
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,259
Even Di Lanzhang said only those with Yu Xiuming's order can go inside.

120
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,440
As for the Bureau of Astrology, only the officials of the Directorate of Astronomy can get inside.

121
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,720
I can only stay here and think.

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,819
I knew your cleverness was temporary.

123
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,540
You're still as dumb as a brick.

124
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,740
Yes, Master Yun Wen. I'm dumb.

125
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,180
How can I enter Yunji Building?

126
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,020
Your Majesty, Great Steward, Fan Ruhui, seeks an audience.

127
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,240
Let him in.

128
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,219
My loyal subject, what do you need of me?

131
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,140
Your Majesty, the Ceremony of Stars is the first ceremony of the State of Chao after its establishment.

132
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,040
After a discussion with Wei Qi, the supervisor of the Bureau of Situ,

133
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,680
we think that this ceremony represents the authority of the state.

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,640
We should make it as grand as we can.

135
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Therefore, we have tried to gather more funds from all around the state.

136
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,160
We might be able to get another 120,000 taels of gold and 10 million taels of silver within one month.

137
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,119
We'll spend them all on the Ceremony of Stars so that it can be perfect.

138
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,780
Do we need to spend that much money?

139
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,619
How should we deal with the aftermath if a calamity strikes all of a sudden?

140
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:58,320
We've kept enough for situations as such. Your Majesty, we dare not make you worry.

141
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,500
Great.

142
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
I don't want to make my ministers fret

143
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,700
because of the Ceremony of Stars.

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,000
Think about it. We've seen all kinds of matters

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
in the past two decades.

146
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,200
Money is the least of our concerns, am I right?

147
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Your Majesty is wise!

148
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Take a look at what's inside.

149
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
The Quell Fire Cup?

150
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,600
This is an item from my hometown, Weidi.

151
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,700
That's right.

152
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,200
I miss Weidi, too.

153
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,400
I went to your house when I was 12.

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,000
That's how I became who I am today.

155
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
You can have this.

156
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

157
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,700
By the way, there's one more thing.

158
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Regarding the construction for the Ceremony of Stars,

159
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,000
the Bureaus of Astrology and Public Works

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,100
actually replaced obsidian with dark jade

161
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,200
in order to take a cut.

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Is that true? I will investigate it immediately.

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
No need for that. I've already done my investigation.

164
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Guan Yi is the mastermind.

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,800
However, I need to punish him to serve as a warning to others.

166
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,700
If not, the entire world wouldn't take it seriously.

167
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,500
Your Majesty is wise.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, you can handle the execution.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

170
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,100
Wait!

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You forgot your box.

172
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,900
[Treasury]
What if... we change the number sequence?

173
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,600
Hurry!

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,400
What...

175
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Official Bai, what's going on?

176
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,800
What are you doing?

177
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Let go of me!

178
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
You wretch! How dare you frame me!

179
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Guan Yi, what goes around comes around.

180
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,300
You!

181
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,000
Official Bai, this is just a misunderstanding.

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Do me a favor. Plead for me in front of His Majesty, will you?

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,300
Save me!

184
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,200
Official Bai, save me!

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Save me!

186
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
Official Bai!

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Regarding the bribery case related to the Ceremony of Stars,

188
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Guan Yi embezzled the fund entrusted to him.

189
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,400
After His Majesty's investigation,

190
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
he has ordered to imprison Guan Yi and interrogate him.

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
The Bureau of Astrology is the most important department of Chao.

192
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,000
But the series of incidents has incurred His Majesty's wrath.

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,800
We should be deeply vigilant and feel guilty.

194
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
I hope you all can take this as a lesson.

195
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
Serve the state dutifully

196
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,400
and never commit such mistakes.

197
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,500
All right. Dismissed.

199
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,700
Sir, I have something to ask you.

200
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,100
It was Guan Yi who was in charge of building the altar for the Ceremony of Stars.

201
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,400
What should we do from now on?

202
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,200
His Majesty once ordered you to supervise the construction of the altar.

203
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,400
You shall take over his position.

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Sir, thank you for that.

205
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,600
However, I'm too inexperienced.

206
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,300
Can I recommend someone else?

207
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,800
There's a director in the Bureau of Public Works called Gu Wangran.

208
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
He's an upright and meticulous person.

209
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,100
Can I leave this to him instead?

210
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,200
You can do as you see fit.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Thank you, Sir.

212
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
[Fan's Residence]
Old Master, we received news from the palace.

213
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
They've ordered the Bureau of Justice

214
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,000
to investigate the corruption case related to the Ceremony of Stars.

215
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,500
- What did you say?
- I heard that Guan Yi of the Bureau of Astrology has been sent to prison.

216
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,000
They're also arresting people from the Bureau of Public Works.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Say no more.

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
I understand.

219
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,600
His Majesty is wise.

220
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,000
He found out that the culprit was Guan Yi.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've already contacted the Bureau of Justice.

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
This case will end. No one else will be implicated.

223
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,100
Father!

224
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,200
Scram!

225
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Bring Fan Chang here.

226
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,400
Yes, Old Master.

227
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,800
Time to eat.

228
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Thank you.

229
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,100
Let's go.

230
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,300
Tell him to leave.

231
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Tell him to see me in the afternoon.

232
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do I need to repeat myself?

233
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,000
I, Jie Zhuying, the son of the traitorous subject,

235
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,900
greet Your Majesty.

236
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Did you have enough of Yebei?

237
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,300
Your Majesty, I deserve to die for disappointing you.

238
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,000
However, my father and I never intended to betray you.

239
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
I watched you grow up.

240
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,200
I know how bold you are.

241
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
You should return to the imperial army.

242
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
Your Majesty.

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,100
Is there anything else?

244
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,900
Your Majesty, thank you for sparing my life.

245
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,300
On account of the service of you and your father,

246
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,000
I shall allow you to hold a mourning ceremony at home.

247
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248

My child, you must've suffered.

Uncle Fan, thank you for visiting me.

259
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm grateful that the Jie Family is still able to stand.

260
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,800
I just never thought...

261
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,800
that I couldn't see my parents for the last time before their deaths.

262

[The Late Father, Jie Haitian]
[The Late Mother, of Xiao Clan]

263
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,600
His Majesty's feud against your father wasn't formed overnight.

264
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Both of them had their own ideas.

265
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
When they were fighting together,

266
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,400
it's okay to express their thoughts.

267
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,000
But once the ruler and the subject have been determined,

268
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,400
by no means should the emperor be the one to compromise with others.

269
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,200
As time passed, His Majesty's loath of him gradually increased.

270
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
When that happened, His Majesty no longer cared about

271
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,800
the validity of your father's words.

272
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,200
He'd only think that your father was disrespecting the emperor.

273
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,900
- So, His Majesty was unsatisfied with Father long ago.
- That's right.

274
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,800
You were monitoring the army in Yebei.

275
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,800
It's a tough job. You've contributed to the state.

276
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,000
My child, take care.

277
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,200
You can find me if you need anything in the future.

278
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Thank you, Uncle.

279
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Father, I would like to speak with Zhuying.

280
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Here.

281
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
What is this?

282
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,200
I rushed here immediately after hearing about the news.

283
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,000
But your mother already took the poison.

284
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,800
She entrusted me with this letter for you.

285
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,400
She said your father left it to you.

286
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Fan, thank you so much.

287
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,500
I wanted to meet you at the courier hostel.

288
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,000
However, my father said it would do you no good

289
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
if His Majesty found out.

290
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm sure Uncle Fan had his reasons.

291
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,700
I can't thank you enough for being there

292
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,800
with my mother during her last breath.

293
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,900
Please accept my condolences.

294
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Zhuying, my child,

295
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
if you're reading this letter,

296
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,600
that means I've already departed from this world.

297
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,900
I never regretted my decisions.

298
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,100
And I already expected this ending.

299
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,500
I only pray that you live a healthy life,

300
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
have a virtuous wife and a filial child.

301
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,700
You must take good care of yourself.

302
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Father! Mother! I've let you down!

303
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,400
I've let you down!

304
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Father told me not to blame His Majesty for this.

305
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,900
Then whom shall I direct my hate to?

306
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,000
If you don't know whom to hate,

307
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,600
you should stop hating.

308
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,900
Remember the warm and joyful moments.

309
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Warm?

310
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,800
Joyful?

311
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,000
For example, the moments when your parents expressed their love for you.

312
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Or the moments...

313
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,200
we spent together.

314
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,000
I no longer dare...

315
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
to remember those moments.

316
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,900
You must promise me that you'll never forget them.

317
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
You must take good care of yourself.

318

319
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,100
Who are you?

320
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,200
Do not panic. I'm just like you.

321
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,000
I have a feud with the Emperor of Chao, too.

322
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
I don't know you.

323
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
And I don't know what you're talking about.

324
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,300
I'm Huo Lu.

325
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,200
I was Director Jie's subordinate when we fought in Zhongzhou.

326
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,000
You're a general of Chao?

327
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Why would you have a feud with the emperor?

328
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,900
Back then, I was just a child who was captured to serve as a slave.

329
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,400
However, they thought I was a rebel and wanted to execute me.

330
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,700
I was only able to survive because of Official Jie.

331
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,000
Were you referring to Jie Haitian?

332
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
That's right.

333
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
What do you plan to do?

334
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,800
The Ceremony of Stars is nearing.

335
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
I've already bribed the officials.

336
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,900
I plan to uphold justice for Director Jie during the ceremony.

337
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,000
Your Majesty.

338
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
How was it?

339
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,200
Qihai Lian wasn't suspicious of me.

340
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,500
She agreed to cooperate with us.

341
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,700
Good.

342
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I never expected Jie Zhuying to be a coward.

343
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,200
But now, the princess of Yebei is on our side.

344
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,900
The people of Yebei hate Yu Xiuming to the core.

345
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,700
They'll surely assassinate him somehow.

346
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,700
Back then, I underestimated that lowly boy, Yu Xiuming.

347
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,000
I let him grow in power.

348
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I never expected myself to abandon my state...

349
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and call myself his subject after so many years of war.

350
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Fan Ruhui will give you an opportunity to strike during the Ceremony of Stars.

351
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
Now, my army is stationed in Liaoyang.

352
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,300
Once Yu Xiuming dies,

353
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,000
my army can arrive in Tianqi within a day.

354
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,300
The Cai Family shall reign supreme again!

355
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,100
I shall sacrifice my life to fulfill your goal.

356
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,200
You did great this time.

357
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,800
You can request anything you like.

358
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,900
Your Majesty, you were the one who saved me.

359
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,000
It's my honor to share your concern with you.

360
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I have nothing to request for.

361
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,500
I will surely take good care of your family.

362
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Mr. Duanmu, what are they doing?

363
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,900
The Directorate of Astronomy is checking the inventory of the ritual tools

364
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,000
they need for the Ceremony of Stars.

365
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,500
36 pieces of green jade ramparts for worshipping the sky.

366
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,600
36 pieces of yellow octagonal jade badges for offering sacrifices to the earth.

367
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,300
Cauldron...

368
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,900
Come.

369
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,800
Don't leave yet.

370
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,600
I wish to see what the cauldron looks like.

371
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
- Bagui.
- Bagui?

372
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
Since the Ceremony of Stars is nearing,

373
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Tianqi will tighten its security soon.

374
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,700
All of you must be thorough.

375
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,800
Sister Lian is still waiting for my news.

376
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
I have to find a chance.

377
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,600
9 stands for sacrificial food, 26 sacrificial vessels.

378
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:21,775
[Yunji Building]

379
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,700
You scared me.

380
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,100
I thought you had an idea in mind.

381
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,300
What?

382
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,900
I also wanted to go in instead of sneaking.

383
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,700
I observed this place for two days.

384
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,200
This place has been forbidden since long ago.

385
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,700
No one comes here usually.

386
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,100
However, Di Lanzhang doesn't come here

387
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,400
because he's afraid of His Majesty.

388
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,200
His Majesty doesn't study. That's why he doesn't come here.

389
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,600
It means although the main gate is tightly guarded,

390
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,200
the surrounding has low security.

391
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,500
So, you're just a sneaky thief.

392
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
Who are you calling a thief?

393
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You.

394
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,200
You're the thief here.

395
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,900
This is so narrow.

396
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,300
Secrets of Star Trail?

397
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,400
The Diagram of the 48 Phases of Star?

398
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Yun Wen, the diagram does exist.

399
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,200
It's a pity that you can't learn them yet.

400
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,000
This place is huge.

401
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,200
A Dream of Guzhen?

402
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Tianqi used to be Guzhen City, right?

403
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Manual of the Emperor Star?

404
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,200
Yun Wen, I found the complete Manual of the Emperor Star.

405
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,600
This should be useful.

406
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,000
Who dares to come here without permission?

407
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
Who's there?

408
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,600
Who are you?

409
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Yunji Building is a forbidden ground within the Bureau of Astrology.

410
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
How did you get in?

411
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,300
I got in by using the same method as you.

412
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,500
Are you here to steal the books, too?

413
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Steal the books?

414
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,600
Are you here to steal the books?

415
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm not here to steal the books.

416
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm here to catch the book thief!

417
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,000
Your Majesty, what are you doing here?

418
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,500
Who were you talking to just now?

419
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,800
No one.

420
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Who is Yun Wen?

421
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,400
Yun Wen?

422
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

423
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,000
You better tell me the truth.

424
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,200
Don't be scared. He can't hear me anyway.

425
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,500
Your Majesty,

426
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,600
I'll be honest with you, then.

427
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,600
You see, I have a weird habit.

428
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,300
Whenever I find a good book,

429
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
I'll talk to myself.

430
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,600
Sorry about that.

431
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll see for myself.

432
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Good book, huh?

433
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,600
You're smart, eager to learn, and knowledgeable in many fields.

434
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Are you that interested in me?

435
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,900
Hurry and make up an excuse. Your life depends on it.

436
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,400
That's right.

437
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,100
If so, tell me why you're here.

438
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,400
Think twice before answering.

439
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,200
If you say something wrong, you shall be expelled from the Bureau of Astrology.

440
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,400
Hurry!

441
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Your Majesty, I just wanted to know more about your noble deeds.

442
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,700
I admire you.

443
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,600
You're pretty adept at licking my boots, huh?

444
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,200
Tell me then. What do you admire about me?

445
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,200
At 17, you fought the Kuafu Clan at Jushi.

446
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,700
You rode into the valley alone and slew over 60 of them.

447
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:15,800
After that, you conquered Xi, Tang, Cao, and Luan.

448
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,100
If we include the Battle of Yebei,

449
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,000
Your Majesty, it took you 17 years to establish your state.

450
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,400
You must be more than 30 years old now.

451
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,800
You're good at calculating.

452
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
In the battle of Jushi that you mentioned,

453
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,800
our army was surrounded.

454
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,000
The Kuafu people were three times taller than normal men.

455
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,200
And more than 10 times stronger.

456
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,200
They also fought with no fear of death.

457
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,500
When they rushed toward us,

458
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,800
our army was massacred, except for me.

459
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,700
Bai Lu, what you're reading right now

460
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,200
is the result written down by historians.

461
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,900
However, no one cares about the process.

462
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,200
You must be out of your mind.

463
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,500
How dare you come here again.

464
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,400
How can I know his secret if I don't come here?

465
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,900
"Mianshi Bridge, built in Hanzhendi.

466
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,800
An ancient temple lies beside it.

467
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,800
This is an ancient ground.

468
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Rumor has it that it's blessed by the powers of the primordial truth masters.

469
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,500
According to nosy people,

470
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,400
mysterious events happen there all the time."

471
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,600
Yun Wen.

472
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Look.

473
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,700
Does this Mianshi Bridge have something to do with the Truth Masters?

474
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
You know about the Truth Masters?

475
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,300
I don't. That's why I'm asking you.

476
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,500
You should know something, right?

477
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,600
The Truth Masters are an ancient clan in myths.

478
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,700
They do not die or get hurt. They're everlasting.

479
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,400
Their appearances can remain the same even after hundreds of years.

480
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Are they that powerful?

481
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,100
Of course.

482
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,600
Not just that,

483
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,100
but the Truth Masters are capable of anything and everything.

484
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,000
They know all the secrets in the world.

485
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
They're amazing, right?

486
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,600
Could it be that the Truth Masters

487
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,400
imparted some of their powers to Yu Xiuming

488
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,600
so he was able to avoid the Hengchen Skyfire Spell?

489
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
That's only your random guess.

490
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,400
That's not a random guess.

491
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,500
According to the records, Yu Xiuming only conquered the world after more than a decade of war.

492
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,100
But don't you think he looks a bit young for that?

493
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,300
Who knows?

494
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm sure he won't tell anyone about a secret like that.

495
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't care.

496
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,800
I'll find out his secret somehow.

497
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Your Majesty.

498
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,700
Your Majesty, Bai Lu, Director of the Bureau of Astrology,

499
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,000
has presented you with a box.

500
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,700
What box?

501
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,600
Director Bai said she prepared it for you.

502
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
I didn't sneak a peek.

503
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,000
What if it's a contraption used to harm me?

504
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,700
And you brought it to me just like that?

505
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,200
I will check it immediately.

506
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,100
Wait.

507
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,970
Just a little trick.

508
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,400
It's not like I'm afraid of her.

509
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,600
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

510
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,000

00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,300

00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,000

520
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,400
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫
