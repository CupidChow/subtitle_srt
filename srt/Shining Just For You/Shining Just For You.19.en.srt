00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,000
[Episode 19]

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,200
Your Highness, there will be a full moon tonight.

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900
Your condition might act up again.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is made from the herbal tea recipe given by Director Bai.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Drink it to soothe your mind.

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,900
You're dismissed.

20
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,400
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,400
I began to fear the full moon when I was eight.

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Look away then.

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,700
You don't understand.

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,800
I was born with the ability to sense the power of the moon.

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,400
It's a blessing that's in my bones...

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
as well as a curse in my bones.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,200
I cannot easily escape...

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,300
from the lethality of the moon.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,000
Regardless of past history,

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
you are His Majesty's soul mate.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm sure he can protect you.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,600
I once thought that I could

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
keep His Majesty company if I was in the palace.

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
Another day with him

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
is another day worth living.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
But now,

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm within the comfort of the palace,

38
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,600
while he is so far away.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
He is in danger,

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,100
but I cannot do anything.

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,600
Your Highness, if you make the request,

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm sure His Majesty will let you join him.

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Enough.

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,400
Any news from His Majesty?

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Where is he now?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
He got into danger and canceled the trip to Wanzhou and Yuezhou.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
He is now in Guiyang.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,300
He should be back in Tianqi soon.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Your Highness! Your Highness!

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Chu Ye is back.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
- Chu Ye is back.
- Chu Ye is back?

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Come down already.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
- Chu Ye.
- Princess Lian.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
How is everything?

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Don't worry.

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,500
I have never let you down, have I?

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,800
Stop being cocky. Tell us everything.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
How much food did you get?

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Enough for the winter.

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
We won't starve!

61
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,400
Hooray!

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
Wonderful.

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Thank you for your hard work, Chu Ye.

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,700
Let's unload the food.

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,900
Sure.

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,300
All the men, come carry the food with me.

67
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,800
- Let's go.
- Let's carry the food.

68
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
Amazing news.

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,700
Let's go.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
A'Lian.

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Chu Ye is back?

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
He came back with food.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,600
We can survive this winter.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Cheng Yuantao, help them out.

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Come.

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
A'Lian, it has rained a lot lately

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
and the path connecting Zhongzhou has collapsed.

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,100
You're running low on food, too.

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,500
- Will you have enough?
- Carry it properly.

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,200
Hopefully, yes.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't worry.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
The Yuezhou Army has been helping us.

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,000
We will share our food with you this time.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,100
- Your Highness, come pick the pearls.
- Okay.

86
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
- Okay.
- More men, please.

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
- We need more men.
- Come on.

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
I think this one is good.

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Come.

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,900
Qingheng, have some soup to warm you up.

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Is it delicious?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
It is.

93
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,900
Qingheng, let's get married.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,300
That way, we'll have a reason to see His Majesty in Tianqi.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,000
He will give us dowry and bride price.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,100
We'll have enough money to last until next year's autumn harvest.

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,600
- But...
- I understand your concern.

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
But you said yourself that trading with the Heluo Clan for food could only be a temporary relief.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
We might not have anything

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,000
to trade with them next spring.

101
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,800
Qingheng,

102
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
your clan knows that His Majesty has mandated your marriage.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,900
You also see how well

104
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,200
the Yebei citizens get along with the Yuezhou Army.

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
They won't oppose this.

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Besides, you're doing this for them.

107
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
I don't want to marry someone for them.

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
On behalf of my clan elders,

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,600
my uncle has already told me to marry you

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,800
to unite the Yebei people and the Yuezhou Army.

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,600
If it's for my clan, I would have...

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Then?

113
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,600
I could give up my life for my clan...

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,000
but I don't want to marry you because of this.

115
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,600
Tell me.

116
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you willing to marry me?

117
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,300
Even if I will die...

118
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,900
for my clan at any moment?

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
I am.

120
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Of course I am.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,200
I knew you wouldn't say no.

122
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,700
I don't want to hear a no either.

123
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,400
His Majesty said that there would be no assembly today.

124
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,800
Great Steward Fan shall handle all affairs in his stead.

125
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,100
What... How many days has it been?

126
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,000
His Majesty hasn't attended any court assembly since his return.

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
His Majesty works hand in hand with Official Fan.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm sure the Great Steward

129
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,200
has taken a lot of burden off His Majesty.

130
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
I heard His Majesty ran into assassins

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
while he was on Minzhong Mountain.

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,000
That assassin pushed Director Bai into a bottomless abyss,

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
but His Majesty rescued her.

134
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
A bottomless abyss, you hear?

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,100
But His Majesty came out unscathed.

136
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,000
Heaven must have blessed him.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Indeed. Indeed.

138
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,300
Official Duanmu.

139
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,400
Yes, Great Steward?

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Director Bai has been absent, too.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Did His Majesty give her a special assignment?

142
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
I have no idea. Since her return from the tour,

143
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,300
she hasn't signed the attendance.

144
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,200
But Director Bai has earned His Majesty's favor,

145
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,000
so it is no surprise that she was given a special order.

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Tabai?

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
Tabai is a kind of bird.

148
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Once trained, it will lure its kin for its master.

149
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Therefore, secret spies in other clans

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,200
trained by the Winged People are called Tabai.

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
I did not know of this story.

152
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,500
Your task is to lure out the remainder of the Winged Clan,

153
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
especially Yu Linkong.

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Although you are Winged Ones,

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,700
you are nonetheless Chao citizens.

156
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,200
The peace of Ningzhou depends on you.

157
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,600
Duly noted, Your Majesty.

158
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,750
Thank you for your help, Brother Gu.

159
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,840
It's been a while. Have you missed me?

160
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,650
What do you look like now?

161
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,780
Show me. Hurry up.

162
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,480
Bai Lu, stop hitting me.

163
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,790
As annoying as always.

164
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,660
I hope he didn't give you too much trouble.

165
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,430
All is well.

166
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,140
Yun Wen and I talked a lot.

167
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,040
Once he obtains a form, I would like to visit him.

168
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,470
What did you talk about?

169
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,600
None of your business.

170
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,150
It's only for Official Gu here.

171
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,790
For example, how I came to this universe.

172
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,610
Really?

173
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,480
Of course not.

174
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,930
I can't believe you are that gullible, stupid Bai Lu.

175
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,410
You... I...

176
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,620
He's rude.

177
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,610
Very rude.

178
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,360
Your Highness, His Majesty sent you this gold hairpin.

179
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,330
After the previous inspection tour, His Majesty has not visited me.

180
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,000
I thought he forgot about me.

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,540
Is this exclusively for us or does every palace have one?

182
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,950
They said it was a souvenir for all concubines from the inspection tour.

183
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,460
So it is just a formality.

184
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,050
Everyone has one.

185
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,440
I shall put it away.

186
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,440
Wait.

187
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,100
Put it on for me.

188
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,780
Yes, Your Highness.

189
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,820
Your Majesty, Tabai from Ningzhou finds out that there are Winged Ones hiding in Tianqi.

190
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,810
Has Xue Xuanjing gone home?

191
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,320
No.

192
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,510
What is he doing in Tianqi?

193
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,930
He loiters in a restaurant and goes home drunk.

194
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,540
Which restaurant?

195
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,080
Jianyue Pavilion.

196
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,490
Find me the remainder of the Winged Clan.

197
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,850
[Jianyue Pavilion]

199
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,050
Take her down.

200
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,340
The six of you can't catch one person?

201
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,040
What are you good for?

202
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,360
She can't run away.

203
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm sure I can find her in a few days.

204
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,780
Are you sure?

205
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,740
Sir, she was hit by my arrow.

206
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,670
The arrow was laced with the poison, Green Water.

207
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,210
Wherever she goes, her cohorts will have to treat her condition.

208
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,810
Check all the pharmacies in the city and we will have a lead.

209
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,470
You still have a brain at least.

210
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,240
Go serve your punishment before you continue the investigation.

211
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,220
Yes, sir.

212
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,590
Go now.

213
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,140
Green Water? This is...

214
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:23,130
The antidote will require several herbs that are hard to find.

215
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,710
Young Master. No.

216
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,790
They almost got me.

217
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,030
They must be watching those herbs now.

218
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,270
I know. Don't worry.

219
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,100
We already bought those herbs when purchasing herbs for Taoyuan Valley.

220
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,500
All you need to do now is rest.

221
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,010
Hejin.

222
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,350
Please get rid of those things later.

223
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,760
Do not let anyone see you.

224
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,390
Noted.

225
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,090
They still managed to track us in the end.

226
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
I see you're still awake, so I came with some tea.

227
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,010
You may return. No need to serve me now.

228
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,610
Noted.

229
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,950
If you return to Ningzhou and get yourself reinstated as Prince,

230
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,720
you can rally all clan leaders to revolt against the Emperor of Chao.

231
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,110
If we're doing this, we do this the legal way.

232
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,870
The Emperor of Chao is planning to build a canal in Ningzhou.

233
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,240
Once that is built, it will be detrimental to our forces.

234
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,040
Besides, Tianying has been discovered by the Dark Guard.

235
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,360
I think there is another spy from the ancient families of Ningzhou.

236
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,490
I am suspecting Tianyao of Qingcaobin.

237
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,840
He is the only one with a mysterious background here.

238
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,580
Young Master, you refuse to leave Tianqi.

239
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,280
Is it because of Miss Ye?

240
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,620
It has nothing to do with her.

241
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,380
At the moment, she's close to the Emperor of Chao.

242
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,410
We need her for our revenge.

243
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,100
Tianying is seriously injured.

244
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,340
We cannot dally in Tianqi.

245
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,520
If you need someone close to the Emperor to be your informant,

246
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,380
why don't you ask Xue Xuanjing? Maybe he has the connection.

247
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,200
I know what to do.

248
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,090
You're dismissed.

249
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,710
Yes, Young Master.

250
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,810
Why hasn't the Emperor of Chao come to bother you?

251
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,850
No idea. He's busy, I guess.

252
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,590
12 Chapters of Dimension.

253
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,120
Are you still studying the array of time?

254
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,560
Yes.

255
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,830
I already told you.

256
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,320
Without the complete Suizheng Array Runes,

257
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,540
it cannot be activated.

258
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,790
Maybe I already have them.

259
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,840
Stop daydreaming.

260
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,950
You know, I have met the Truth Master.

261
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,990
I could enter the array in the Stone Vault.

262
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,450
That's the Suizheng Array, right?

263
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,940
Wait. Where did you find that array?

264
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,520
On Minzhong Mountain.

265
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,830
Minzhong Mountain?

266
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,390
There's an entrance to the Stone Vault there, too?

267
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,710
Tell me. How I can return to the past with the array?

268
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,810
The Suizheng Array can create a time-traveling passage.

269
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,240
A time-traveling passage?

270
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,280
Time flows forward like a river.

271
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,710
If you want to travel to the past, you need to open a special spatial rift to backtrack.

272
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,230
That's a time-traveling passage.

273
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,970
However, after you activate it, you need a lot of Ice Crystals to provide the necessary celestial power.

274
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,630
That's how you maintain it.

275
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,940
I have a lot of Ice Crystals.

276
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,540
When we were defeating Cai Can, Yu Xiuming gave me a lot.

277
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,780
You have to help me build the time-traveling passage.

278
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,260
But I...

279
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,430
If you say yes now,

280
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,460
I'll get you Jinzhan Incense and Juluo Plate right away.

281
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,540
Right away?

282
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,780
So you already have them?

283
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,900
Yes.

284
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,860
When we were on the inspection tour,

285
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,020
Cheng Wu found Juluo Plate and Gu Wangran has Jinzhan Incense.

286
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,190
So you lied to me.

287
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,620
What an honor to be able to witness a soul taking a form.

288
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,230
Indeed.

289
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,260
I wonder what she did.

290
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,830
- I know, right?
- Is this warranted?

291
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,670
Exactly. Look.

292
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,460
Whose maid is that?

293
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,970
No idea.

294
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,740
Stop!

295
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,450
Second Young Master Fan.

296
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,760
Oh, you.

297
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,370
Miss.

298
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,310
No!

299
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,140
Let go of me!

300
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,230
What's the matter?

301
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,670
I'm disciplining my maid.

302
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Do I need to consult the Bureau of Astrology for that, too?

303
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,860
Come.

304
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,590
Come here.

305
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,700
Sister Yezi, don't cross him.

306
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,970
This is my fate.

307
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,970
Is she your maid?

308
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,590
Can you come to Guangyang Palace with me to tell His Majesty that?

309
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,700
You think you can threaten me with His Majesty?

310
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,890
The person I have seen the most in my life is His Majesty.

311
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,420
- Let's go?
- Patience.

312
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,860
All of you, please be my witness.

313
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,380
His Majesty issued an edict that all women from Yebei

314
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,480
would be registered with the Imperial Office of Music

315
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,460
before being assigned to each household.

316
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,330
- Does her name appear on the Fan Family's administration record?
- Is that so?

317
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,640
- I see.
- It's none of your business.

318
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,420
It's none of my business, but it sure is His Majesty's.

319
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,390
I guess I can tell His Majesty

320
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,100
that before each bureau, household, and even His Majesty can select the maids they want,

321
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,700
someone already went to the Imperial Office of Music, altered the record in secret, and took more than ten people away.

322
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,240
Nonsense. Not more than ten people.

323
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,310
Not more than ten people?

324
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,810
How dare he. He should be punished.

325
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,720
Indeed.

326
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,710
I agree.

327
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,050
Second Young Master Fan,

328
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,690
His Majesty hates liars the most.

329
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,500
Do you know?

330
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,510
Fine. You win this time.

331
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,880
We'll see in the future.

332
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,460
Let's go.

333
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,520
Have a safe trip.

334
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,070
All right. Move on now.

335
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,930
Are you all right?

336
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,870
Thank you, Sister Yezi.

337
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,740
Don't worry.I won't let him bully you.

338
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,950
Just work for me now.

339
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,250
Director Bai, there's a problem. There's a huge problem.

340
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,740
Director Bai.

341
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,830
I...

342
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,040
Director Bai, there's a problem.

343
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,350
Director Bai, the Astrology Chart to be delivered to His Majesty is not ready yet.

344
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,460
Director Bai, what should we do?

345
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,870
Don't worry. I will hand it in today.

346
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,470
Your Majesty, I am happy that General Zhu Ying and Princess Qingheng are getting married.

347
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,170
But they are in Yuezhou, so they can get married there.

348
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,890
I promise to hold their wedding ceremony here,

349
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,540
so we shall proceed that way.

350
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,630
In the entirety of Great Chao's history,

351
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,360
no royal princess has married into another family.

352
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,080
Great Steward Fan, we follow the rules of the previous dynasty

353
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,790
when we hand out titles to ministers.

354
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,040
Why can't we do the same to Her Highness?

355
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,210
In the previous dynasty, when a princess got married,

356
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,430
a princess's residence would be built in the capital.

357
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,360
But Her Highness will have to return to Yuezhou.

358
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,230
It doesn't make sense to build the princess's residence in Tianqi.

359
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,510
That's easy.

360
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,540
The Bureau of Situ will give them some money

361
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,430
for the construction of their abode in Yuezhou.

362
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,510
That is inadequate!

363
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,670
How is that inadequate?

364
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,170
His Majesty is trying to build the canal here.

365
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,900
Our budget is tight and we cannot afford

366
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,780
another expense to construct the princess's residence.

367
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,240
Great Steward Fan, don't use that excuse again.

368
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,110
You took a huge chunk of the military budget

369
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,680
to build the canal, too.

370
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,710
You cannot say that, Director Bai.

371
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,970
Although His Majesty has allocated a budget for the construction,

372
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,040
there are many other projects that will require the treasury's aid.

373
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Your Majesty.

374
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,690
In Ningzhou, there is a town called Qingcaobin.

375
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,690
Last month, they requested to use horses

376
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,630
more than 100 times for their commerce.

377
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,840
It's a small town with hardly any business activity.

378
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,060
Who knows why they needed that many horses last month?

379
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,000
And there is a Winged One called Tianyao.

380
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,040
His background is mysterious and why is he the magistrate?

381
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,310
I can't help but wonder what the Bureau of Situ is doing.

382
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,390
I gave him the post.

383
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,040
Don't mind him.

384
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,910
Your Majesty, he alone drained the entire town's food provision.

385
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,580
It's serious embezzlement. I heard there was even a riot.

386
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,130
You know what? Reduce the tax on Qingcaobin.

387
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,520
We were talking about Princess Qingheng's marriage.

388
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,180
Don't bring up other problems.

389
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,980
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

390
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,650
And so, we will follow the standard procedure.

391
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,840
Calculate Princess Qingheng's dowry and bride price

392
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,840
before delivering the money to them.

393
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,230
Then, find a place in the South Palace and tidy it up so that they can have their wedding there.

394
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,050
As for the construction of their abode...

395
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,200
I believe we can postpone it.

396
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,910
Let's see once the canal is built.

397
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,490
I thank you on behalf of Princess Qingheng.

398
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,730
Qingzhan. Qingsu. You're here in Tianqi to prepare for Sister Lian's wedding.

399
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,230
Take it seriously.

400
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,030
Make sure she marries like a princess.

401
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,830
She'll need a beautiful veil and gown.

402
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,230
A beautiful veil and gown?

403
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,790
We don't have them.

404
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,290
We will.

405
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,760
We will have them soon.

406
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,310
Say it quickly.

407
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,660
Sister Yezi, I have a question.

408
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,600
Is there a seal on my body?

409
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,060
A seal?

410
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,300
Yezi, as you know,

411
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,390
Qingsu is the only person from my family who can't learn secret arts.

412
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,790
So we want to ask you if the seal of the secret art technique on your body has been broken.

413
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,220
It is. How did you know?

414
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,350
If the seal wasn't broken, you wouldn't be in the Bureau of Astrology.

415
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,050
Since Su cannot use any secret art skills, he has been sidelined by his family.

416
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,970
He wants to prove to everyone that he can protect the people around him.

417
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,170
I see. You know I broke the seal,

418
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,460
so you want to know if I can help Su break his seal.

419
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,190
A'Su, try this. This is Danhua tea from Yunzhou.

420
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,530
- Did you see anything?
- Isn't it delicious?

421
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,320
His body contains Guxuan Celestial Power,

422
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,540
so he can't learn any secret art skills from this era.

423
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,970
Guxuan is a star of death.

424
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,060
No one can see it.

425
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,120
He doesn't need any training at all.

426
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,230
He was born with the power of Guxuan.

427
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,700
If he learns any secret art skills from this era,

428
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,710
their celestial power will be absorbed and negated by the Guxuan within him.

429
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,070
You mean he is destined to be unable to learn any secret art skills?

430
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,890
He can learn Guxuan secret art skills.

431
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,720
Guxuan secret art skills?

432
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,000
Forget what I said.

433
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,010
Once you learn them, you cannot walk under the sun anymore.

434
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,780
They are a dangerous art and can drive you crazy.

435
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,930
If that happens, he will be hunted down by all mystics.

436
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,930
Ye said learning Guxuan secret art skills is dangerous.

437
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,820
If I give up, will you be disappointed?

438
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,770
We grew up together, but you have to make this decision yourself.

439
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,580
Qingzhan, I don't want to be useless.

440
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,630
A Yebei person shouldn't bow down to Chao.

441
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:34,430
A Yebei person without courage and pride is not a Yebei person.

442
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,110
What do you want to do? I'll help you.

443
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,240
Your Majesty, Wanzhou sent us some daffodils.

444
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,030
They smell refreshing.

445
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,660
Do you want to take two stems with you so that you can put them in your vase?

446
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,360
Whatever.

447
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,780
Your Majesty, you have returned for more than a month.

448
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,170
Speaking of which,

449
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,800
Bai Lu hasn't come here to deliver the Yin-Yang Calendar this month.

450
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,570
Someone else from the Bureau of Astrology can do the task.

451
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,340
I heard she accomplished a feat on Zhenxia Mountain.

452
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,890
Did you award her?

453
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,120
He did.

454
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,300
His Majesty asked me to send Cai Can's helmet to Director Bai.

455
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,410
However, it was returned.

456
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,080
Enough.

457
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,630
I think your gift might not be to her liking.

458
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,100
Why?

459
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,940
Although Bai Lu is an official, she is also a woman.

460
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,990
Your Majesty, it's normal that you don't know what women want.

461
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,130
What do women want?

462
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,060
You have many things in this palace, except for sincerity.

463
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,450
Why don't you tell Director Bai what is on your mind?

464
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,180
Ling Yun.

465
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,430
Ling Yun.

466
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,100
Your Majesty?

467
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,770
Go to the Bureau of Astrology...

468
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,750
and tell them to send me tonight's Star Map tomorrow.

469
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,020
Noted.

470
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,250
Make sure they send their best officer to do it.

471
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,610
Otherwise, I will hold her accountable.

472
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,620
Noted.

473
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,800
The Ice Platform offers a vast view.

474
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,910
They are authorized to use it tonight for their work purposes.

475
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,110
Noted.

476
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,920
Stop saying noted.

477
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,650
Okay.

478
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,250
Then go now.

479
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,290
Come back.

480
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,820
Go to the storeroom and bring the Bureau of Astrology something good.

481
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,430
Tell them they have been working hard,

482
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,130
so it's their reward.

483
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,680
Okay.

484
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,810
Pick the best ones.

485
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,330
Okay.

486
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,020
Do you get my instructions or not?

487
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,360
Go now.

488
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,220
What's the matter?

489
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,720
His Majesty said a lot of things and it confused me.

490
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,640
It's not that confusing.

491
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,130
His Majesty wants you to deliver them the best astrological tools we have

492
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,140
so that Director Bai can go to the Ice Platform tonight.

493
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,540
He will then confess to her.

494
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,230
Commander Ling.

495
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,740
Where is Director Bai?

496
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,800
She has been researching the new calendar and the new divination.

497
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,690
She doesn't have time for this.

498
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,970
The Bureau of Astrology is very grateful for His Majesty's gifts.

499
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,970
We will register them and keep them properly. And then, we'll inform Director Bai.

500
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,400
She will thank His Majesty in person once she is available.

501
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,390
I shall go.

502
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:53,800
Father, that witch does not respect us at all.

503
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,040
Father.

504
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,670
Father, she is disrespecting you.

505
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,310
She isn't disrespecting me.

506
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,200
She is just disrespecting your sorry face.

507
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,820
Father, I didn't provoke her.

508
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,390
It's all her fault.

509
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,030
Did I provoke her? Did I provoke her then?

510
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,890
Voice the unfairness to His Majesty then.

511
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,530
Go back to your room now and don't come out.

512
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,360
Leave! Leave now!

513
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,250
- Old Master.
- Bugger off!

514
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,070
Yes, sir.

515
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,250
[Fan Residence]

516
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,890
Second Young Master.

517
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,260
Sister-in-law?

518
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,040
Where are you going?

519
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,360
My brother did a good job hiding you.

520
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,540
No one could get hold of you.

521
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,330
I'm here for you.

522
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,630
For me?

523
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,630
It's inappropriate for a wife to meet her husband's brother.

524
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,730
I heard the Great Steward has had a lot of trouble lately.

525
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,600
Official Bai of the Bureau of Astrology has given him quite a headache.

526
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,830
You mean Bai Lu?

527
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,920
There are some problems.

528
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,120
Why do you care?

529
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,920
I might have a way to eliminate her.

530
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,400
Really?

531
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,590
Tell me.

532
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,880
For real?

533
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,200
This curse is dangerous and fatal.

534
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,780
You'll know once you give it a try.

535
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,490
This is amazing, Sister-in-law.

536
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,600
Why did you tell me all of a sudden?

537
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,430
I'm telling you. The Crown Prince position

538
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,760
and the Fan family business belongs to me.

539
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,740
Don't think you can have them.

540
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,660
I am your brother's wife.

541
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,600
If the Fan Family prospers, so will I.

542
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,390
What you said seems right.

543
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:05,040
If this plan works, I will put in a good word for you in front of my old man.

544
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,700
Thanks, Second Young Master.

545
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,010
Now stop loitering around.

546
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,870
[Fan Residence]

547
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,700
Sister Yezi.

548
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,590
Ignore him. He's Yun Wen.

549
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,320
Leave it here.

550
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,020
All right.

551
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,660
Yun Wen.

552
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,490
Where do you want to go?

553
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,940
I still have one thing to do.

554
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,740
But that thing cannot be done now.

555
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,780
I have to get ready first, so I need to stay here for some days.

556
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,070
It's okay if you stay longer.

557
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,410
But you have taken a form now.

558
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,820
People will see you when you come and go.

559
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,670
I need to find a way to give you a job here.

560
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,980
Before that, you might need to go back to the mirror.

561
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,070
The Bureau of Astrology has too many slackers.

562
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:39,770
It is tiring to have to hide my genius from everyone else.

563
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,400
Not this again.

564
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,090
Are you drawing the Star Map?

565
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,580
What Star Map?

566
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,520
The one His Majesty asked you to do.

567
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,840
That one?

568
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,790
Any Star Map will do. It's not like he truly wants to see it anyway.

569
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,460
All right.

570
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,230
Yun Wen, it's time for you to help me.

571
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,140
You want to activate the time-traveling passage now?

572
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,640
Yes.

573
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,400
Look.

574
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,530
I have everything.

575
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,770
The Ice Crystals are not pure enough.

576
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,490
You will have insufficient crystals.

577
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,880
They are not enough?

578
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,980
How many do I need?

579
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,400
Traveling to the past is going against nature.

580
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,970
It will consume a lot of energy.

581
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,840
What should we do then?

582
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,300
Perhaps I can set up a smaller array.

583
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,670
It doesn't require any Ice Crystals, but you can only view the past.

584
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,570
You can't interact with it.

585
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,300
Okay.

586
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,080
Tell me how far back you want to travel.

587
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,930
I want to go back to when A'Rui was on Ruogan Peak.

588
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,070
- A'Rui.
- Quiet.

589
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:40,540
We now see and hear the images conjured by the array.

590
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,930
Don't make any noise or do anything.

591
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,940
Otherwise, we'll be expelled from the array.

592
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,080
Brother Wuyou, you're injured.

593
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,910
You can't escape with me.

594
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,160
- Princess Rui.
- Let go of me.

595
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,300
I won't let go of you.

596
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,290
Yi Wuyou.

597
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,460
I really like you.

598
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,800
Please don't forget me.

599
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,310
How nice.

600
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,920
I can remain in Yebei forever now.
