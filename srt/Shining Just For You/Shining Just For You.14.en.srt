00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,900
[Episode 14]

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Zuo Jintian has sealed off Xiayang.

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,100
He won't allow a single one of us through.

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,700
The minute we get in range, he will fire at us.

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,400
And he also has 30,000 elite soldiers lying in ambush here.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
If we charge in rashly,

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
we'll be as good as committing suicide.

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Only Yezhao is without Zuo Jintian's army.

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,700
That's our only way out.

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Even so, we cannot pass through Yezhao.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
That place is dark and surrounded by fog and mud.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,200
There are beasts and poisonous insects everywhere.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,600
No one has ever made it through Yezhao alive.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,200
I will not send my people to their deaths!

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,300
It will be a death sentence if you go to Xiayang!

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,800
His Majesty promised to spare us.

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,300
He gave us the order to move.

31
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,400
Zuo Jintian is going against his order.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,900
Would His Majesty let Zuo Jintian go?

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,200
Even if His Majesty does kill him,

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
we cannot afford to wait any longer.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
With Zuo Jintian cutting off our rations,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
we won't last days even if we don't enter Yezhao.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Zuo Jintian will act tomorrow.

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
We will not survive his attack.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,600
You must make a decision tonight.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,100
And if I choose to stay?

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Then we'll die together.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
To Yezhao?

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
You might as well just kill us now!

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
Uncle Luo, please hear me out.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
Say no more.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
I will not enter Yezhao even if I die.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
There is a chance for us to survive!

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Why must you be so pessimistic?

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,300
Look around you.

50
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,000
We have children who have yet to see the outside world among us.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,100
They haven't even started their lives yet,

52
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
and you would end their lives already?

53
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,200
Qihai Zhenyu did not consult us

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
when he waged war against the Chao Army.

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,000
He decided our fates for us, too, didn't he?

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You and your father destroyed Yebei!

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,900
Do you think you are the chief of us?

58
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,600
You keep harping on about death.

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,300
Do you have any better ideas then?

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,400
If you don't have any, then listen to those who do.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Zuo Jintian is ruthless.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,500
All of the Hulan Tribe and the Sujin Tribe know this.

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,600
We cannot go head-to-head against him.

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,600
But I don't want us to enter Yezhao thoughtlessly either.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,500
So I ask that all of you

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,400
please try to comfort and make arrangements for your family in three days.

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,000
I will bring Chu Ye, A'Su, and the others with me to find the Tubo.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,100
What?

69
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400
Tubo…

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
What's Tubo?

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,600
The Tubo is a primordial branch of the Heluo Clan.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
They are adept at traveling through mountains and steep terrains.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Everywhere they go becomes a straight, even path for them.

74
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,600
They were once spotted around the borders of Yezhao.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
If we can secure their help,

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,700
we may be able to pass through Yezhao safely.

77
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,900
Grand Princess, this is a highly dangerous matter.

78
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,400
- Should we inform General Zhu Ying and ask him to send more…
- Of course not!

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Without Zhu Ying, more of us will die!

80
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,800
But we cannot let him know this.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,600
After all, it is better to keep Tubo to ourselves.

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
They are the army of Chao.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,200
With Zhu Ying around, Zuo Jintian won't dare to do anything to us for now.

84
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
So please control your fellow clan members.

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,300
Do not clash with Zhu Ying's Yuezhou Army.

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,800
Otherwise, we risk the safety of our young and old.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
That's right.

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
We will do as Her Highness says.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
She is right.

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,000
Young Master, we-we've received news from Ningzhou.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
Why are you stammering?

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,300
The leaders of the families want you to return to Ningzhou and marry a noble daughter

93
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,000
of the Winged Clan as soon as possible to put the people's minds at ease.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Elaborate.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
The message mentioned that the Xue Family

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
had publicized the news of the marriage between the Xue Family and the Yu Family.

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
The other families appear exceptionally interested

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
in the matter after learning this.

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,200
Marry a noble daughter of the Winged Clan?

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,200
They are worried that they will lose out

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
if I marry the daughter of the Xue Family

102
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
and form an alliance with them.

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Ignore them.

104
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
If I let them have everything their way,

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
they will only demand more.

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,100
Leave me.

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Why did you ask to see me so urgently, Uncle Xue?

109
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,900
I may not be the most capable,

110
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,800
but I still am a member of the Winged Clan.

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,400
I've spent years working tirelessly

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,600
to unite the Winged Clan.

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,800
I drew a lot of criticism for that.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
I will endure everything

115
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,400
just to revive the Winged Clan.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I wish to form an alliance with you,

117
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,000
cease our submission to the Emperor of Chao,

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and recapture Ningzhou!

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
When we succeed,

120
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,800
I will support you in ascending the throne as the Winged Emperor.

121
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,200
Our priority right now is to recapture Ningzhou.

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,000
It does not matter who takes that title.

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,700
You have my admiration.

124
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,700
I have an idea for us to have it both ways.

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,600
The Yu Family and the Xue Family had a marriage arrangement.

126
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Why don't we…

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,200
Your daughter was betrothed to my brother.

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
It would've been a blessed union

129
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
if not for the fact that times have changed drastically.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
My brother has passed away,

131
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
and I have changed my name.

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
What do you suggest, then?

133
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Why don't you send someone into the palace?

134
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,000
It would be easier to gather information in the harem.

135
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,400
You want me to send my daughter into the harem?

136
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,700
But I heard that His Majesty

137
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,000
rarely visits the harem.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
There is only one concubine that he favors,

139
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
and she is a Winged One, too.

140
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm afraid it would be difficult

141
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
for my daughter to earn His Majesty's favor.

142
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,100
Do you know who Consort Tian is, Uncle Xue?

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,800
She is a servant of my clan, Leng Tianxi.

144
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Back then, we had her join the Winged Guards

145
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,000
to spy on the Emperor of Chao.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
But we did not expect that she would betray us

147
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
and turn to his side instead.

148
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,300
Give my suggestion some thought, Uncle Xue.

149
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,000
If you agree,

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,900
I will take care of Leng Tianxi for you.

151
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,900
Absolutely not!

152
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,100
I will never join the harem!

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,100
Lan'er, when you think about it, he does have a point.

154
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,800
We do need eyes in the palace.

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,400
Have you lost your mind, Father?

156
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
He is killing two birds with one stone!

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,700
With this, he can use us to eliminate his clan's traitor

158
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
and avoid forming a marriage alliance with us.

159
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,200
What good will it do for us if I join the harem?

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,400
The Emperor of Chao barely steps foot into the harem.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,100
What useful information could I possibly gather?

162
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,400
All right, all right. Calm down.

163
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I did not think this through.

164
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I'll turn him down at once. All right?

165
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,100
How dare Yi Wuyou insult me so!

166
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,400
As if I want to marry him!

167
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,000
He must've been bewitched by that human girl.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,500
We must find an opportunity and get rid of that Bai Lu from the Bureau of Astrology.

169
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,400
That's the only way to make him come to his senses.

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
Hold him off for now.

171
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I'll think of something.

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
I'll take my leave now, then.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,800
Why are you still reading that flawed Truth Master's magic array?

174
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
What are you trying to do?

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
How is that any of your business?

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,100
I'm just curious.

177
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,300
Isn't this the seal under Mianshi Bridge?

178
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,500
Are you blind?

179
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
The runes don't look a thing alike!

180
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
What made you think they're the same?

181
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Be quiet. No one asked you.

182
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,800
Don't always try to play the teacher.

183
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Those are the runes of the Suizheng Array.

184
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
It's meant to control time, and it's very complex.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,200
It's completely different from the array used to seal your powers, all right?

186
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
Control time?

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,900
If I can manipulate time,

188
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,600
does that mean I can use it to travel back in time?

189
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Why do you want to go back in time?

190
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
I want to go back to the night A'Rui went missing.

191
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,100
That way, I'll know where A'Rui is.

192
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,800
Is that how it works, Yun Wen?

193
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Don't be silly.

194
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
It's not possible.

195
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
The runes are incomplete.

196
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Besides, your celestial powers have long been sealed.

197
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't even draw the runes right now.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
Says who?

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Give it a try if you don't believe me.

200
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Fine. I will.

201
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
I need to find a way to break the seal.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,600
How can I break the seal?

203
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Break the seal…

204
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,800
I've got it!

205
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
This is it!

206
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Yes. Maybe this will work.

207
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Bai Lu! What are you doing now?

208
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,400
It's too dangerous to forcibly break the seal!

209
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Stop!

210
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,500
I haven't even tried it yet. How can you be sure that I can't?

211
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
If you break the seal by force,

212
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,500
you might get caught up in your painful memories!

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,600
You'll get stuck in your past and never wake up again!

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
I told you I'm not giving up until I succeed.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
I don't think that's what you want.

216
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,600
I think you just won't give up trying to get yourself killed.

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I feel so dizzy…

218
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,100
Yi Wuyou?

219
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,600
It is you!

220
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,900
How did you get yourself into this mess?

221
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Oh, no…I can't be found at a time like this!

222
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,600
- If they find out…
- Don't worry.

223
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
No one knows.

224
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,100
So why are you here?

225
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,800
If I hadn't come,

226
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,000
were you planning to die here?

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,100
Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
There's no way I would die here.

229
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,100
You're so prideful.

230
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,200
You won't ask for help even when you need it.

231
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,400
Yezi, I can help you.

232
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,000
You can't.

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,100
I want to break the seal that has been put on me for over ten years.

234
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,800
Even Yun…

235
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,200
Even the masters can't help me.

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Besides, I risked my life trying to do it today,

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
yet I still failed.

238
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,000
I can help you.

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,300
Only my father can break my seal.

240
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,800
But he is no longer alive.

241
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,200
I don't think anyone else in this world knows how to do it,

242
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
so…

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Are you hiding something from me?

244
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Your father left you a scroll that can help you break your seal.

245
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,300
My father?

246
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
If my father did leave me something like that,

247
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,800
why didn't he let me know?

248
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,000
He entrusted it to me before he died.

249
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,400
So you had the scroll all along,

250
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,000
and you just never told me.

251
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
The seal is extremely complex.

252
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,600
I've had someone look into it.

253
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
I didn't want you to act rashly

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and hurt yourself again.

255
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
Give it to me.

256
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
I can't.

257
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,900
Why?

258
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,000
The breaking of the seal must be carried out

259
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,100
on a day when the celestial power is at its peak.

260
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,800
But we don't know

261
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,200
when that day is yet.

262
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,600
Give me some time.

263
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,800
I'll calculate the time to break the seal.

264
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,700
Give it to me first.

265
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,900
Yezi.

266
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,300
You need to learn to trust me.

267
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,800
Don't push me away.

268
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,900
I don't trust anyone but myself right now.

269
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,600
Will you give it to me or not?

270
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,400
When the time is right, I'll notify you immediately.

271
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,500
Notify? What do you mean?

272
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,200
Yi Wuyou!

273
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,100
[Fan Residence]

274
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,900
Bai Lu has been hanging around a Winged One?

275
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Where did you learn this from?

276
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
I put a spy in Jianyue Pavilion.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
They saw it with their own eyes.

278
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,600
You put a spy in Jianyue Pavilion?

279
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,900
Yes.

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
What has gotten into you? Tell me what's going on!

281
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,500
As if you and your empty brain can come up with such a clever idea!

282
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,000
There's a musician in Jianyue Pavilion that's a Winged One.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
She is Fan Ping's lover.

284
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
She wanted to be in our good graces,

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
so she told me.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Your brother's lover?

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Are you sure she isn't a trap planted by Bai Lu?

288
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,300
Father, trust me.

289
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,900
What she said must be true.

290
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,800
Good. Very good.

291
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Better to believe something is real

292
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
than to believe it is not.

293
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,200
We must make good use of this and plan well

294
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,000
to take this witch down in one fell swoop.

295
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,600
General.

296
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,900
Go on.

297
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,600
How's the situation in Yebei?

298
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,800
It's fine.

299
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
General, do you really think it's safe to enter Yezhao?

300
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Let alone the people of Yebei, even I think…

301
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,400
Are we supposed to lead them and fight Zuo Jintian head-on

302
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
and lose tens of thousands more, then?

303
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,900
Pass on my orders. Rest in place.

304
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,600
Have those on duty increase patrols

305
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
to prevent ambushes from the Xiayang Army.

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Yes.

307
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,100
Cheng Yuantao, all we can do now

308
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,700
is to protect them for as long as we can.

309
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,400
Understood.

310
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
Wait!

311
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
What's wrong?

312
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,500
Lian, this is the mark I made.

313
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,700
I think we've been going in circles.

314
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,000
You're right.

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,700
We've been circling the same area.

316
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,600
What should we do then?

317
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,100
Let's try doing the opposite.

318
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,800
All right. Let's go.

319
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,300
- Backtrack.
- Be careful.

320
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Quick! Run!

321
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Run! Hurry!

322
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,200
Move! Hurry!

323
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,500
Hurry!

324
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,000
A'Su!

325
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,400
It is said that the Tubo

326
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,800
inherited the ability to split Heaven and Earth apart.

327
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Let's go.

328
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's see what lies ahead.

329
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,400
- Princess!
- Chu Ye!

330
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,700
Chu Ye!

331
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,100
Hold onto me!

332
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,500
Princess!

333
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Chu Ye!

334
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,680
Come on.

335
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,470
Princess! Are you all right?

336
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,110
Sister Lian!

337
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,970
Princess! Are you all right?

338
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm fine. What about you guys?

339
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,190
We're all fine.

340
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,970
What is this?

341
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,420
I think it's Tubo.

342
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,900
What's Tubo?

343
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,600
The Tubo claim to be gods that create mountains and rivers.

344
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,570
They are extremely territorial.

345
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,270
If you're lucky, all they do is chase away trespassers.

346
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,340
If you're less lucky, however, you might lose your way in the fog and die.

347
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,130
It doesn't look like they're willing to see us.

348
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,953
I don't know if you can hear me,

349
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:56,600
but I know you can sense

350
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,330
that we have no ill intentions.

351
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,200
Please protect my people and allow them safe passage.

352
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,970
I will give you 70% of our salt in exchange.

353
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,020
How did you know that salt would appease them?

354
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,740
Yezi told me everything I know about Tubo.

355
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,060
Yezi?

356
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,630
Let's hurry back.

357
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,840
With Tubo's help, we can travel through Yezhao safely.

358
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,340
All right.

359
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,530
What happened here?

360
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,350
Right.

361
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,980
Something bad happened.

362
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,670
How could this be? How could this have happened?

363
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,590
General!

364
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,680
General!

365
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
What on earth happened here?

366
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,860
I have failed you!

367
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,810
Speak!

368
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,870
The minute you guys left, Luo Wuyi from the Black Water Tribe caused a stir

369
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,300
and insisted on returning to Yebei.

370
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,500
That traitorous man sent someone to alert Zuo Jintian.

371
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,490
Now, the people of Yebei and half of our soldiers

372
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,640
have been taken to Xiayang.

373
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,770
I managed to gather around 2,000 of them

374
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,120
and retreated to the Rongxue Slope for now.

375
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,250
Luo Wuyi…

376
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,040
We must retreat to Rongxue Slope at once.

377
00:26:06,025 --> 00:26:07,750
[Fan Residence]

378
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,030
Old Master, news from the Bureau of Astrology.

379
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,940
We've finally caught Bai Lu meeting with a Winged One in secret.

380
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,130
Oh, Bai Lu.

381
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,980
Let's see if His Majesty

382
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,350
will protect you again this time.

383
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,770
There's no time to lose.

384
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,480
I'll expose her to His Majesty right now!

385
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,180
No, no, no.

386
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,340
His Majesty has always been lenient with this girl.

387
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,170
Even if His Majesty catches her

388
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,090
meeting with a Winged One himself,

389
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,370
he might still spare her.

390
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,200
If we want to get rid of her once and for all,

391
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,610
we must have someone

392
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,860
who has absolutely zero tolerance for this to catch her in the act.

393
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,510
Is there someone who would hate to see her

394
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,740
meeting with a Winged One even more than His Majesty?

395
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,380
Why are you here?

396
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,750
I have something to tell you, Yezi.

397
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,730
Go on.

398
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,120
I've learned that this seal is extremely dangerous.

399
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,840
Yezi, if you insist on removing the seal,

400
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,620
you might never wake up again.

401
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,550
In any case, it's too dangerous.

402
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,560
Don't do it.

403
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,130
But I have no choice.

404
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,050
Yezi…

405
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,970
- Why is she here?
- I don't know.

406
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,680
Forget about me. Get out of here!

407
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,380
Hurry!

408
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,570
After him!

409
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,290
Don't bother.

410
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,290
Your Highness.

411
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,670
Arrest her.

412
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,280
Yes.

413
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,660
You will answer in front of His Majesty.

414
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,180
What is your relationship with that Winged One?

415
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,480
He is just an old acquaintance.

416
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,730
Really?

417
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,540
Yes.

418
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,830
How many times have you met with him in private?

419
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,400
Your Highness, all I did was catch up with an old acquaintance.

420
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,650
You don't have to be so aggressive.

421
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,970
You…

422
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,680
Consort Tian.

423
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,150
Return to your palace.

424
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,150
But Your Majesty…

425
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,720
Do you think you can fool me with that?

426
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,570
Your Majesty, that is all I know.

427
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,570
If Your Majesty does not believe me, you may investigate the matter yourself.

428
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,793
I'll ask you this.

429
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,200
Where did the Cloud Flame come from?

430
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,550
How did you know how to cure the Lunar Erosion

431
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,320
that Consort Tian was afflicted with?

432
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,930
How much more are you hiding from me?

433
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,080
Your Majesty, I was not aware that you were bothered by such matters.

434
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,980
But Your Majesty should know that I am not Consort Tian.

435
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,360
I will not be completely subservient to you.

436
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,950
I'm afraid I cannot answer these questions.

437
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,940
You're spouting such treacherous words.

438
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,110
Do you want me to throw you into prison?

439
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,580
As you wish.

440
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,900
Ling Yun.

441
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,060
Throw her into prison.

442
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,100
No one is to release her without my order.

443
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,800
Yes.

444
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,350
Official Bai, please.

445
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,370
I'm going to take them on!

446
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,290
I don't fear that emperor, much less a despicable man!

447
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,020
Chu Ye, we mustn't act recklessly right now.

448
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,880
Are we supposed to do nothing, then?

449
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,600
Chu Ye!

450
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,580
Don't act impulsively. They call him the Ruthless Zuo.

451
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,560
He kills even those that have surrendered.

452
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,020
Our people are sitting ducks in his hand.

453
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,450
Of course, we must save them.

454
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,518
But it is hard for us to penetrate Xiayang.

455
00:33:00,518 --> 00:33:02,570
How are we going to rescue them with only so few of us?

456
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,710
Shut up! If it weren't because of you,

457
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,750
our people would not have fallen into his hands!

458
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,760
You…

459
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,770
Chu Ye, stop it!

460
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,700
I'll come up with a solution.

461
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,790
Commander-in-Chief, you mustn't!

462
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,460
There is no other way.

463
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,523
Zuo Jintian's target is me.

464
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:36,580
If I weren't the one appointed as the Protectorate General of Yuezhou,

465
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,030
the people of Yebei wouldn't be suffering now.

466
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,800
There are ways to save them.

467
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,120
But it is too risky for you to go alone.

468
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,270
Just listen to me, Cheng Yuantao.

469
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,590
The moment I show up, Zuo Jintian will lower his guard.

470
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,470
When that happens, you'll rescue the people of Yebei with your men.

471
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,040
Come and get me after they're safe.

472
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,780
General…

473
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,600
We've fought countless wars.

474
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,030
We can take on Zuo Jintian, too.

475
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:11,770
Don't worry. I'll do my best to hold on for you to come and rescue me.

476
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,010
Qingzhan, do you know where Qingheng is?

477
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,180
Princess was still here just now.

478
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,620
She said it was cold and told us to get some firewood.

479
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,350
Oh, no!

480
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,620
General!

481
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,080
You're a brave one.

482
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,780
You dare come to see me alone.

483
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,090
General Zuo, we are heading to Yuezhou on His Majesty's order.

484
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:09,830
Why are you detaining us for no reason?

485
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,210
All right.

486
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,250
Wait for His Majesty to come and save you.

487
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,470
What will it take for you to let my people go, General Zuo?

488
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,370
I seek to claim one life.

489
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,950
I can let your people go once I achieve that.

490
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,720
If I can't,

491
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,190
then I can't promise what I will do.

492
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,020
You can have my life as long as you let my people go.

493
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,610
Who do you think you are?

494
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,080
I can kill as many of Yebei as I want.

495
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,560
Even 10,000 of you cannot make up for his life.

496
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,860
I am their leader

497
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,830
and the princess named by the Emperor of Chao himself.

498
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,580
Princess?

499
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,690
Unfortunately, you, Princess Qingheng,

500
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,640
are still not enough.

501
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,180
I can spare your people.

502
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,210
Kill Jie Zhuying in exchange for the lives of your people.

503
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,880
The people of Yebei will not sacrifice the innocent just to save themselves.

504
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,790
Then this conversation is over.

505
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:19,150
Men! Kill ten Yebei people for Princess Qingheng.

506
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,760
- Yes.
- No!

507
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,330
Stop!

508
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,180
Let him through.

Deal with me instead.

517
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,690
What are you saying, Protectorate General?

518
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,000
You are a first-rank official of the court.

519
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,920
I wouldn't dare to kill you unless I have a death wish.

No.

How did you know I wasn't in the camp that day and came to find me?

545
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,780
You promised me you would consider taking the route through Yezhao.

546
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,990
You are meticulous and thorough.

547

Your Majesty!

564
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,590
Return to my chamber.

565

Your Majesty.

What is the matter, Your Majesty?

567
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,700
Why did you faint all of a sudden?

- I'm afraid we still need Official Bai…
- Silence!

570
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,570
Your Majesty, you've been greatly affected by the power of the Divine Mirror.

571

We must find the Truth Master

What were you going to say earlier?

576
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,100
The imperial physicians have tried everything,

577
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,950
but they still couldn't ease His Majesty's pain.

578
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,150
Official Bai was able to cure Your Highness previously.

579
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,280
Perhaps she would be able to help His Majesty as well.

580
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,920
But His Majesty refuses to summon her no matter what.

581
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,290
This is an order from Consort Tian.

582
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,210
I am to escort Official Bai to Guangyang Palace to treat His Majesty at once.

583
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,640
- No one is allowed to interfere.
- Understood.

584
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,330
His Majesty.

585
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,300
