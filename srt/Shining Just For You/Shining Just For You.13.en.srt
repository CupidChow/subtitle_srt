It's not the Truth Master.

Your Highness, you might have misunderstood something.

78
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,500
Back then, your father wasn't willing to form an alliance with Yu Xiuming.

79
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
As for me,

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,700
I was hesitating about the alliance, too.

81
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,400
However, Yu Xiuming was renowned for winning 100 battles.

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,600
The Winged Clan wasn't willing to stand against him until the end.

83
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Although your father was revered by his people,

84
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,800
he couldn't convince the people to join him.

85

In the end, all the city lords decided to yield to the humans.

But the traitors were the most detestable.

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,900
They ratted your father out by reporting him to Yu Xiuming, saying that he would be a nuisance to him.

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,100
I have no intention of clarifying the rumors back then.

It's just that...

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,400
Your Highness, to be honest,

96
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,300
I would like to invite you to return to Ningzhou.

97
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,700
I will aid you in rebuilding the Winged Clan

99

You might not know, but I get sentimental

whenever I am reminded of your father.

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,800
I was thinking that I shoulddo something for your sake.

102

Protectorate General, please return.

103
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,300
I won't return to Ningzhou.

104
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,600
Your Highness, you don't need to reject me immediately.

105
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,200
I shall excuse myself now.

106

107
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,800
Father.

108
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
You knew that he wouldn't work together with us.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,900
Why did you make me come here personally?

110
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,700
If he's someone who can be easily manipulated by others,

111
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,000
I would never suggest you recruit him, Father.

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
What do you mean?

113
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,900
Since he's the homeless fourth prince of the Winged Clan, he surely has the pride of the nobles.

114
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,400
If he yields to you easily,

115
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
that means he'll yield to others easily, too.

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,900
The homeless fourth prince?

117
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,000
I've spent a lot of effort

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,800
in making myself the Protectorate General of Ningzhou.

119
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
However, even so, most of the Winged Ones

120
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,000
still take the Yu Family as their leader.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
That's why I came here to verify Yi Wuyou's identity.

122
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,000
I've confirmed that he's the Fourth Prince, Yu Linkong.

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Father, in your opinion, should we recruit him

124
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
to convince the Winged Ones to join us?

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Or should we use him as our king to stage a rebellion?

126
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
Use him as our king?

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
He's not influential enough right now.

128
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,600
With his current influence,

129
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,100
even if he does become our king,

130
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,200
he'll only be your puppet.

131
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,500
You do have a point.

132
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,000
However, the Emperor of Chao is powerful.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,700
We shouldn't go against him head-to-head.

134
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,400
We should try to persuade the Fourth Prince to join us first.

135
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
Since that's the case,

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Father, you may use the engagement

137
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,000
between the Xue Family and Yu Family as your excuse next time.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
As long as I get married to Yu Linkong,

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,800
the Winged Ones will stop putting you on the spot.

140
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,200
If only your brothers were half as smart as you.

141
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,700
If so, I wouldn't need to endure

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
that young man's arrogant demeanor at such an old age.

143
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,380
By the way, how are you doing in Tianqi?

144
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,300
Are you doing well?

145
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,000
Father, only now you're caring about me?

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
It seems like I'm doing well then.

147
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,100
Father, don't worry.

148
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,000
I will do everything I can to assist you.

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,300
I shouldn't stay here for too long.

150
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,800
I'll head back now.

151
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,300
Okay.

152
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Why does the palace look so lifeless during the Emperor's Natal Day?

I heard that His Majesty forbade us from holding a birthday banquet.

154
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,200
Is that so?

155
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,400
Stop right there.

Why is he pulling a long face?

You're already here.

Why are you still sneaking around?

Greetings, Your Majesty.

161
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
How did you know I was here?

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,200
I knew you were here since you entered the palace.

163
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,800
If not, do you think Ling Yun dares to let you enter the palace?

164
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Speak.

165
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
What are you doing here?

166
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm here to make a report about my progress.

167
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,800
Since you came to Guangyang Palace,

168
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I thought you had something important to report to me.

169
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,700
In the end, these are all just trivial matters.

170
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,600
Your Majesty, it's lively outside the palace.

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,500
But why does Guangyang Palace look so lifeless?

172
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,000
What has that got to do with me?

173
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,600
All these celebrations belong to other people.

174
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,700
They have nothing to do with me.

175
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,400
These are just temporary moments.

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,600
I thought today was your birthday?

177
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,000
I understand now.

178
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,100
No one told you since Jie Haitian is no longer around.

179
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,000
In order not to let people predict my destiny,

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,200
Jie Haitian hid my star on purpose.

181
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,200
The people outside don't know my true birthday.

182
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,900
They can enjoy the occasion.

183
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,800
But there's no need for me to hold a fake celebration.

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Your Majesty, I have a suggestion.

185
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You should keep your mind free of any thoughts today.

186
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,400
Forget about the official affairs.

187
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Don't treat yourself as the emperor today.

188
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,400
You should join me on the streets, admire the lanterns, and have fun.

189
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Lanterns?

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,600
Excellent!

191
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,300
Again!

192
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Excellent!

193
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Look!

194
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,800
Excellent!

195
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Two guests, please.

196
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm sure it's rare for you to witness such scenes.

197
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,200
Before this, I was a young general that was born in the city.

198
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
I'm not like the nobles

199
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,200
who are out of touch with reality.

200
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Were you born here?

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,600
Seems like you don't know me well enough.

202
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
I wasn't born here.

203
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,000
I was born in Weidi.

204
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Have you ever heard of the saying

205
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,000
"The Fan Family of Weidi is as noble as the Imperial Family"?

206
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,300
That means the Fan Family is favored by the emperor.

207
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
If so, aren't you curious

208
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,400
as to why I'm so lenient toward the Fan Family?

209
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Without Official Fan, you wouldn't be able to be absent from court

210
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
and enjoy your own sweet time.

211
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,780
Why did it sound like you were criticizing me just now?

212
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
Was I wrong?

213
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,100
You're both right and wrong.

214
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,400
The Fan Family is the only blood relative I have left.

215
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
The old madam raised me.

216
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,000
Naturally, I wouldn't be too strict with them.

217
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,800
However, greed has gotten the better of them.

218
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,700
They are now...

219
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,600
- Why am I telling you this?
- They're setting fireworks in front!

220
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Let's check it out!

221
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Okay. Let's go!

222
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,400
Look!

223
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
Look!

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,100
♫ I had witnessed the bright fireworks several
times flashing in the air ♫

225
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:45,200
♫ I had witnessed several beautiful sunsets ♫

226

♫ Eyes filled with warmth when you passed by ♫

227
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,200
♫ Just like a lost amber, waiting for you to pick it up ♫

228
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,300
♫ I was once the lonely moonlight that led a reclusive life ♫

229
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,400
♫ I've not been able to cry for a very long time,
but I'm now shedding tears because of you ♫

230
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,400
♫ Wandering and being lonely for most of my life,

231

♫ You're my ups and downs ♫

232
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
♫ A cold and lonely moonlight that dissipates

♫ I'm willing to lie in your arms ♫

234
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,800
♫ So, I was gazing at the nearest distance all along ♫

235
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
What do you think about the matter just now?

236
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

237
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,500
I shall take my leave.

238
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900
You...

239
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
You...

240
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
You should rest early.

241
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,000
That's the wrong way.

242
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
[Dingde Gate]

243
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,100

♫ Pouring everything into your heart ♫

254
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,300
Your Majesty, all protectorate generals

255
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,900
have assumed their positions except for the one in Yuezhou.

256
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Please take a look.

257
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,000
So, do you have any candidates in mind for the Protectorate General of Yuezhou?

258
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,600
I do have a suggestion.

259
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,000
Speak.

260
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,100
Although Yuezhou is a remote area,

261
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,400
if we attack from there, we can conquer Zhongzhou, Wanzhou, and Lanzhou.

262
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,800
If we retreat from there, we can protect ourselves by using the mountain terrains.

263
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Your Majesty, you've already chosen

264
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,700
Ji Fengyan, a member of Mount Beimang's Heluo Clan,

265
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,600
to be the Protectorate General of Wanzhou.

266
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,500
Therefore, we mustn't choose another Heluo to be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

267
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,400
As for the suitable candidate,

268
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I think he should be your trusted aide who has served you for many years.

269
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,700
Are you saying that you're recommending yourself

270
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,500
to be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou?

271
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,200
I was just joking around.

272
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Tianqi has plenty of affairs to deal with.

273
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I cannot manage them without you.

274
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Continue.

275
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,900
I have two candidates in mind for the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

276
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Yu Shining and Zuo Jintian.

277
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,800
Your Majesty, you've already selected

278
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,500
Yu Shining to be the Protectorate General of Lanzhou.

279
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,600
Therefore, I think Zuo Jintian is the most suitable candidate

280
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,200
to be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

281
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,300
Now, I guess only Zuo Jintian is the only person

282
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,200
who has the necessary experience and abilities?

283
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

284
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Father.

285
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,700
Ping'er, I've arranged a date for you and Shengnan today.

286
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,200
Do not forget your manners.

287
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes, Father.

288
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,180
Brother Fan!

289
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,090
My brother!

290
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,920
Great Steward!

291
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,900
My brother, you're still calling me that?

292
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,400
Aren't you being too courteous here?

293
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,177
[Zuo Jintian, Xiayang's military commissioner]
I'm a brute.

294
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:05,705
[Zuo Shengnan, daughter of Zuo Jintian]
Please pardon my manners.

295
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,810
Shengnan.

296
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,720
Greetings, Great Steward.

297
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,420
It's been a few years since we met. You're all grown up.

298
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,130
Ping'er, come here. Greet Uncle Zuo and Shengnan.

299
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,440
Greetings, Official Zuo. Miss Zuo.

300
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,220
Young Master Fan.

301
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,720
What should you call him?

302
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,650
Uncle Zuo.

303
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,200
Excellent!

304
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,250
My brother, I've prepared liquor for you in the courtyard.

305
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,340
Let's head to the courtyard.

306
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,860
Sure.

307
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,660
Please.

308
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,050
My brother, let's catch up with each other.

309
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,310
We shall drink until we drop. Please.

310
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,560
Young Master Fan, there's no need to be this formal.

311
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,080
Brother Jintian, let us drink.

312
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,450
Okay.

313
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,960
From now on, we're a family.

314
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,900
No matter if it's matters inside or outside the court, it'll be no problem.

315
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,720
Come on.

316
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,010
Brother Fan, the position of Yuezhou's protectorate general is still vacant.

317
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,030
Does His Majesty have another candidate in mind?

318
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,470
Before this, His Majesty

319
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,780
wanted to announce the candidate during the Ceremony of Stars.

320
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,400
However, an assassination occurred. That's why he didn't announce it.

321
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,420
Brother Fan, I got to where I am today

322
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,240
by participating in wars and battles.

323
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,000
If Yu Xiuming doesn't show any respect to me,

324
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,550
I have my own army.

325
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,480
I can create my own kingdom.

326
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,040
Brother Jintian, you shouldn't say this in front of outsiders.

327
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,850
Brother Fan, you and I are in-laws.

328
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,640
You're not an outsider.

329
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,240
That's precisely it.

330
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,910
If so, today, I shall tell you a secret.

331
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,100
His Majesty said he would elect you

332
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,900
as the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

333
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,380
That's why I'm willing to give you this guarantee.

334
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,840
When the wedding is over,

335
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,770
my brother, you can wait in Xiayang for His Majesty's edict.

336
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,320
I hope so. Come on.

337
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,070
Sure.

338
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,800
Excellent!

339
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,350
Congratulations, Commander-in-Chief.

340
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,220
No, I should address you as Marquis Zuo now.

341
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,310
Everyone, to Marquis Zuo!

342
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,350
Here.

343
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,700
- To Marquis Zuo.
- Congratulations, Marquis Zuo.

344
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,780
Congratulations, Marquis Zuo.

345
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,730
Have a seat.

346
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,410
Actually, the title of marquis is insignificant.

347
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,770
Xie Yu'an also received the title of marquis. Right?

348
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,030
However, being the Protectorate General of the nine states

349
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,290
and commanding the army of the state,

350
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:56,240
that's how you know His Majesty acknowledges you.

351
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Yuezhou is just in the south of Xiayang.

352
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,620
You were already chosen as Yuezhou's protectorate general long ago.

353
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,720
That's right. Marquis, he's right.

354
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,120
Uncle Zuo, my father had told you time and time again

355
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,680
that you shouldn't reveal this news to outsiders before the edict is out.

356
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,590
There are no outsiders here.

357
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,850
We're a family.

358
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,260
That's right. We're a family.

359
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,990
Now, the eldest son of the Fan Family will be marrying your daughter.

360
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,980
Marquis, you will lead a carefree and easy life under Great Steward's care.

361
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,030
Here. To our marquis.

362
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,980
To his son-in-law.

363
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,920
Come on.

364
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,370
To our marquis.

365
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,350
I overheard the conversation between you all just now.

366
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,700
Congratulations, Young Master.

367
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,130
Here.

368
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,200
Guys, we'll reach Xiayang soon.

369
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,870
Once we reach Xiayang, we will rest for a couple of days and have our fill!

370
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,430
Come on! Let's give it one last push!

371
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,530
- Come on!
- Come on.

372
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,110
One, two, three, push!

373
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,560
Seems like His Majesty is going to elect the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

374
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,030
Official Zuo will definitely get the position.

375
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,130
Precisely.

376
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,970
Yuezhou? Isn't that the place Sister Lian is migrating to?

377
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,410
Official Bai. You may enter.

378
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,200
Yes.

379
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

380
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,230
These are the records from observing the stars.

381
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,490
Leave it here.

382
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,230
Your Majesty is in a bad mood.

383
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,020
How did you know?

384
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,040
Your Majesty, you will carve things whenever you're in a good or bad mood.

385
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,510
But the difference is,

386
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,870
your carvings look terrible when you're in a bad mood.

387
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,700
Do you know what this is?

388
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,840
What is it?

389
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,510
It's called a wolf in sheep's clothing.

390
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:45,550
There are plenty of people like this in the imperial court.

391
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,960
Sounds deep to me.

392
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,620
You can learn how to disguise yourself, too.

393
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,450
Just pretend to be weak.

394
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,870
Sometimes it's pretty useful.

395
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,700
I won't learn that.

396
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,530
Your Majesty, I think you've seen through Great Steward Fan's plot long ago.

397
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,030
You're pretty clear about the situation.

398
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,150
Your Majesty, since you have doubts,

399
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:23,620
why are you still electing Zuo Jintian as the Protectorate General of Yuezhou?

400
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,130
Zuo Jintian is not my cause of concern.

401
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,150
However, the marriage alliance between them is pretty tricky.

402
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,270
So, in your opinion, what should I do?

403
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,100
Since they're partners in crime, they depend on each other.

404
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,460
If one of them loses its edge, the other won't be able to achieve anything.

405
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,080
I suddenly have a great idea.

406
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,430
Seems like another official is going to be sacrificed.

407
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,670
Not bad at all.

408
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,830
You can become my bosom friend.

409
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,880
Please don't say that. Your bosom friends usually end up miserable.

410
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,700
If there's nothing else, I shall take my leave.

411
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
Wait.

412
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,000
From today onward, you shall be the supervisor of the Bureau of Astrology.

413
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,450
It's your reward.

414
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

415
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,900
She doesn't have any propriety at all.

416
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,930
Since they're partners in crime, they depend on each other.

417
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,550
If one of them loses their edge,

418
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,810
the other won't be able to achieve anything.

419
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,420
The Great Steward is in charge of official affairs.

420
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,970
And now, he wants an in-law who's in charge of the military?

421
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,100
Zuo Jintian, you can forget about being

422
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,450
the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

423
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,310
Ling Yun.

424
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,580
Send this to Xiayang immediately.

425
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,800
[Fan Residence]

427
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,710
Sir, His Majesty has selected Zhu Ying as the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

428
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,810
How is that possible?

429
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,260
What is His Majesty thinking?

430
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,980
He said he would elect Zuo Jintian last time.

431
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,340
How could he trick me like this?

432
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,450
Where's the edict? Give it to me! I'll seek an audience with him!

433
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,580
It's too late.

434
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,510
Commander Ling has ordered his man to deliver it to Xiayang in haste.

435
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,690
He wants Zuo Jintian, the Military Commissioner of Xiayang,

436
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,960
to impart the edict to Zhu Ying.

437
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,840
Sir, please think of something.

438
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,660
What exactly is he up to?

439
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,020
We can figure out His Majesty's intention later.

440
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,090
We should try to calm Zuo Jintian down.

441
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,070
This is the key to winning Zuo Jintian to our side.

442
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,740
I mustn't let him vent his anger on me.

443
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,170
Sir, you mean...

444
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,970
His Majesty recalled Bai Lu from the ceremony.

445
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,160
And he spared Qihai Lian and the others because of her.

446
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,760
Who knows if he has changed his mind because of her?

447
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,880
His Majesty knew that Zhu Ying was infatuated with Qihai Lian.

448
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,310
He has been lenient toward Qihai Lian since the beginning.

449
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,900
Even so, he sends Zhu Ying to escort the people of Yebei during their migration as punishment.

450
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,720
And now, he's electing him as the Protectorate General of Yuezhou?

451
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,690
It's obvious that he wants the people of Yebei to migrate to Yuezhou smoothly.

452
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,850
Seems like Bai Lu has contributed much to this plan.

453
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:22,110
Send a letter to Zuo Jintian and tell him to calm down

454
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,300
and that everything is negotiable

455
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,330
as long as Bai Lu is gone.

456
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,110
Yes, sir.

457
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,140
My Lady, these are the gifts meant for the Cai Family.

458
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,510
Father-in-law always treated the Cai Family with leniency.

459
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,370
We should prepare more gifts for the Cai Family.

460
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,890
Yes.

461
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,880
Young Master.

462
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,250
You guys may leave.

463
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,800
Yes, Madam.

464
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Dear, you're back.

465
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,280
I've prepared tea for you. Here.

466
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,140
That's unnecessary.

467
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,130
Dear, you came back early today.

468
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,060
Are you having dinner at home?

469
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,960
Do you feel like having anything?

470
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,430
I'll tell the kitchen to prepare them.

471
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,070
Last time, you said the sea cucumber soup was nice.

472
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,790
I will make arrangements for it.

473
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,710
Father wants you to write a letter to Zuo...

474
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,760
He wants you to write to Father-in-law.

475
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,560
Is there something Father-in-law cannot tell him personally?

476
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,980
Father said His Majesty have selected

477
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,560
Zhu Ying as the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

478
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,470
My father thought that he would be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou for sure.

479
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,420
Since that's not the case, he will surely be enraged.

480
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,960
Is Father-in-law worried that my father might do something unthinkable out of anger?

481
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,190
I will write to him immediately.

482
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,280
Father wants him to calm down and to not speak too much.

483
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,290
He will find other opportunities.

484
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,310
He wants Father-in-law to calm down.

485
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,430
There are still plenty of chances.

486
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,720
Chances?

487
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,730
So, is Father-in-law saying that this isn't His Majesty's intention?

488
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,830
You and Father are alike indeed.

489
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,980
Dear, please explain what Father-in-law meant.

490
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,090
My father is a straight man.

491
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,060
He might not be convinced by such blurry reasons.

492
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,630
My father said His Majesty has been showing favoritism toward Director Bai of the Bureau of Astrology.

493
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,960
This should be related to her.

494
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,740
Father is thinking of a way to get rid of her.

495
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,820
Everything is negotiable as long as she's not by His Majesty's side.

496
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,010
All right, I got it.

497
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,240
Fang Hen.

498
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,390
- My Lady.
- Deliver 500 silver dimes to Lieutenant Tan.

499
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,780
Tell him that Mother is suffering a relapse and that she needs these herbs urgently.

500
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,930
Tell him that he must deliver them by tonight at all costs.

501
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,620
Yes.

502
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,020
The tea is cold. Let me change it for you.

503
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,420
It's your favorite Tianyaxue.

504
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,420
Tianyaxue is a tea we consume during summer.

505
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,640
You don't need to entertain me. I'm busy.

506
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,630
All right. I understand.

507
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,180
Dear, take care.

508
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,900
There's no need to figure out my preferences.

509
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,150
There's no need to keep all these trinkets here in the house either.

510
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,020
These things are not for pleasing people.

511
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,280
You don't need to force yourself.

512
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,580
[Xiayang City]

513
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,390
Where are Jie Zhuying and his men?

514
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,570
Marquis, according to our scouts, they're around 30 li away.

515
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,680
They were 50 li away yesterday.

516
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,110
But now, they're still 20 li away?

517
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,870
Are they crawling here?

518
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,770
That brat is still wet behind the ears.

519
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,320
How dare he get ahead of himself.

520
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,550
He was still sucking on his mother's breast

521
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,420
when I was fighting in wars!

522
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,860
You want to steal my position from me?

523
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,010
Relay my order! Gather 30,000 elite troops at once!

524
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,630
Yes, Marquis.

525
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,350
Do you know this?

526
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,610
Back then, when His Majesty traveled to Yuezhou,

527
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,770
he traveled along the coast of Lixiang and Zhixi.

528
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,010
It was at that moment that His Majesty said

529
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,630
he would build a canal that would provide easy access

530
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,130
from all directions when the world is at peace.

531
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,190
Commander-in-Chief!

532
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,020
Commander-in-Chief!

533
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,400
Marquis Zuo killed all our brothers!

534
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,010
I'm the only one who managed to escape!

535
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,490
Get up first.

536
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,430
Calm down. Take your time.

537
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,750
Tell me what's going on.

538
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,420
I don't know!

539
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,120
Marquis Zuo said he would kill all of your men!

540
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,230
Head there personally and inquire about the situation.

541
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,820
Yes, Commander-in-Chief.

542
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,380
Someone!

543
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,580
- General.
- Help him to the tent.

544
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,000
- Yes, General.
- Yes, General.

545
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,770
Thank you, General.

546
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,880
Why do you want to see me?

547
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,430
His Majesty selected me to be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

548
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,570
Should I congratulate you then?

549
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,290
I'm here to notify you that we need to change our route.

550
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,080
We'll go through Yezhao.

551
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,420
Yezhao?

552
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,670
Why are we going through Yezhao?

553
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,500
Zuo Jintian is the Military Commissioner of Xiayang.

554
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,010
Before this, His Majesty issued an edict,

555
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,510
saying that Xiayang and the area below it would be governed by him.

556
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,430
Therefore, Zuo Jintian thinks that he will be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou.

557
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,290
But His Majesty elected me to be the Protectorate General of Yuezhou instead.

558
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,420
I don't see a connection between this incident

559
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,040
and why we need to go through Yezhao.

560
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,130
Zuo Jintian has sealed off Xiayang.

561
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,270
He won't allow a single one of us through.

562
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,860
The minute we get in range, he will fire at us.

563
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,690
And he also has 30,000 elite soldiers lying in ambush here.

564
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,880
If we charge in rashly, we'll be as good as committing suicide.

565
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,860
Only Yezhao is without Zuo Jintian's army.

566
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,250
That's our only way out.
