[Episode 2]

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,389
You're okay?

16
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,720
A mere glass of Soulless Grass that knocks a person out for four hours

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,210
has no effect on me.

18
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:58,740
Much less trying to deceive Chao's emperor.

19
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,710
Just prepare the dowry for Qihai Rui.

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,330
Are you disappointed?

21
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,930
If you're so keen on going to Great Chao,

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,410
then you can go together with Qihai Rui.

23
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,760
From my understanding of His Majesty,

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,100
he should be more interested in you.

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,910
Whether I get promoted or not will be up to you.

26
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,820
Yezi.

27
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,450
A'Rui.

28
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,639
Since you don't want to get married, I have an idea.

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,149
What is it?

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,069
I'll take you away from Yebei.

31
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,490
I've picked the route.

32
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,999
We just have to cross the snowy mountain and go into the jungle.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,199
Not even the Great Chao's emperor will be able to find us so easily.

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,580
Kind-hearted Yezi. You're the only one who looks out for me.

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,580
But, Yezi, if I leave, what will happen to Father and Yebei?

36
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,240
A'Rui, I know you're worried about Yebei.

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,399
But think about it.

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,069
Everyone in Yebei now wants to sacrifice you to get the upper hand in the war.

39
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,510
Leaving is your only option.

40
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,050
Okay, we'll leave.

41
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,100
Listen. We don't have time to get more money.

42
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,279
I have some in my tent. I'll go get it.

43
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,479
You leave first. Head towards the snow mountain.

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,639
Be brave. I will come right after you.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,669
Okay. You be careful.

46
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,309
Don't worry. We'll act separately.

47
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,910
Okay.

48
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,340
Ye Lingshuang.

49
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,000
Cursed woman, where do you think you're going?

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,669
This cursed woman.

51
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,080
She's only ever brought disasters to Yebei.

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,869
Now, she's even killed the Snow Wolf King.

53
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,590
Only by offering her to the spirit of the Wolf God, can we appease the wrath of the gods.

54
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,130
Kill her! Kill her!

55
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,950
It's been a while. Why hasn't Yezi caught up yet?

56
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,519
Kill her! Kill her!

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,100
What? You are too scared to take revenge on Xie Yu'an,

58
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,310
so you're going to kill me instead to show you're not afraid of Chao?

59
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,160
Xie Yu'an sure brought out the coward in you!

60
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,939
The cursed woman's body is smeared with the Wolf God's blood.

61
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,820
She's going to bring calamity upon us.

62
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:16,800
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

63
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,009
Burn her! We can't let her harm more people!

64
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,660
Yezi!

65
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,959
Yezi!

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,800
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

67
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,239
What are you people doing? Let Yezi go!

68
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,329
- Princess Rui.
- A'Rui.

69
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:39,960
Yezi, setting her aflame has been approved by King Qihai.

70
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,080
She did not kill the Snow Wolf King.

71
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,570
Are you people blind? Where is your conscience?

72
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,820
If it was your sister or daughter that the Wolf King was chasing,

73
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,350
would you stand by and do nothing?

74
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,630
Princess Rui!

75
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,519
Stop!

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,750
A'Rui, what are you doing? A'Rui!

77
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,780
You want me to marry the Emperor of Chao?

78
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,190
Yezi must go with me.

79
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,429
If Yezi dies, so will I.

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,199
How dare you!

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,869
Who is Princess Zhuyan?

82
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,679
She is the chosen future Empress of Chao.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,460
No harm can befall her!

84
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,759
- The king is here.
- He's here.

85
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,679
Your Majesty.

86
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,480
- A'Rui.
- A'Rui.

87
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,740
A'Rui.

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,010
I thought there was nothing in the world that I couldn't have.

89
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,369
Because whatever I wanted, Father would get it for me.

90
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:40,310
I know, in the past, I could be the free and light-hearted Qihai Rui

91
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,780
because of Father's and Mother's protection.

92
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,740
But now,

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,480
I have to become Yebei's Princess Zhuyan.

94
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,540
Just like Sister Lian.

95
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,190
A'Rui!

96
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,010
Father,

97
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,150
I'm begging you.

98
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,830
I promise I will be a good girl from now on.

99
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,480
So say you'll let Yezi go.

100
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Please, Father. Please, Father!

101
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,070
A'Rui, you need to get out of here.

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,589
Father...

103
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,670
Your Majesty...

104
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,710
Father!

105
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,840
Let her go.

106
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,290
Yezi.

107
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,520
Why did you come back?

108
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,510
We agreed never to be apart.

109
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,639
Yezi, I hope this letter finds you well.

110
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,110
I've returned to Yebei and am living in my old abode.

111
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,960
If our past encounter means something to you, I hope we can meet tomorrow.

112
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,600
[Yi Wuyou]

113
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,270
Young Master Yi, what brings you to Yebei this time?

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:54,080
Dayuangu, the reason I came is the same as three years ago.

115
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,439
You're still looking for the Starstone?

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,590
Three years ago, you did not tell me where the Starstone was

117
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,179
because you didn't want Yebei to be embroiled in the war between the Winged Ones and the Emperor of Chao.

118
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,290
Now, the world is under Chao's rule.

119
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,850
Yebei is a separate regime.

120
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,650
Is it not going to take action?

121
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,580
Don't mind me being straight, Young Master Yi.

122
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,589
So what if you manage to find the Starstone?

123
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,970
You Winged Ones are factionalized.

124
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,069
Each leader has their own ideas.

125
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,290
Now you're in a state of disunity.

126
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,400
How do you plan to stand up against Great Chao?

127
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,490
Don't the seven tribes of Yebei also have their own ideas?

128
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,520
If I find the Starstone and fix the Qionghua Spear,

129
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,410
the Winged Ones will elect me as their lord and stage a revolt.

130
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,270
That won't be disadvantageous to the current Yebei, will it.

131
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,700
The Starstone.

132
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,570
It's a divine relic left behind by the Truth Master before they went into seclusion.

133
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,099
Young Master Yi, I've never stepped outside of Yebei my entire life.

134
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:10,239
And I've never found any trace of the Starstone in Yebei.

135
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:14,190
Please be on your way, Young Master Yi.

136
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,319
You are the eldest daughter of King Qihai Zhenyu of Yebei,

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,750
Yebei's crown princess.

138
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,780
Weren't you going to tell me that yourself?

139
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,560
I was going to tell you the truth before I left Tianqi.

140
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,260
I never thought the conversation would happen here.

141
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,500
Just like I never thought that in front of you...

142
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,210
there was another Jie.
(His father)

143
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,270
This is the Sea of Bitterness.

144
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,940
It's where my mother was buried.

145
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,970
I'm Father's eldest daughter.

146
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,080
I'm destined to safeguard the seven tribes alliance.

147
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,100
I was supposed to be the one married off for diplomacy.

148
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,490
Why did he choose A'Rui?

149
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,949
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

150
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,330
This is His Majesty's decision.

151
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,730
He learned about our past.

152
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,119
So A'Rui has to be married off because of our relationship.

153
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,839
- Now that it's come to this...
- Qingheng.

154
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,410
Just think of it as if we've never met.

155
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,550
"Think of it as if we've never met"?

156
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,920
Can you forget it?

157
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,310
I can't.

158
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,950
Even if I'm not married off to Chao,

159
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,740
I'll have to marry a prince of the seven tribes.

160
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,850
We can't be together no matter what.

161
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,880
But that's not what you want, right?

162
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,119
- It doesn't matter.
- Qingheng, we can run away.

163
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,199
We can escape to a place far away from Chao and Yebei.

164
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,479
As long as we are together...

165
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,950
Far away from Chao and Yebei? Where?

166
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:57,420
Zhuying, I know you're willing to give up everything for me.

167
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,040
And I would do the same.

168
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,950
But we can't.

169
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,680
I cannot go against my parents.

170
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,920
And you have family you can't abandon.

171
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,140
We don't live in a bubble.

172
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,580
We...

173
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,820
Is this... Is this it?

174
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,920
Yes, it is.

175
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,380
From this moment on, you and I...

176
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,420
will never meet again.

177
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,750
Dayuangu.

178
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,320
Tomorrow, I'm going to accompany A'Rui to be married.

179
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,730
This is farewell.

180
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,970
Surely you know that once you enter the Chao Palace,

181
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,039
you will never be able to return.

182
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,820
I know.

183
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,710
The Chao Palace is a dangerous place.

184
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,480
But I'm indebted to A'Rui.

185
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,630
She's been the only light in my many years of gloom.

186
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,110
I can't let her go there by herself.

187
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,279
I couldn't stop you from sending her to the Emperor of Chao.

188
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,390
So I can only go with her.

189
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,290
Lingshuang, that amber pendant...

190
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,450
has been with you since the day you were born.

191
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,780
It has the power to protect you from evil and keep you safe.

192
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,140
Promise me. Never take it off.

193
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,340
I'm off.

194
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,570
Lingshuang!

195
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:18,310
I've failed you as a father.

196
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,310
Yezi, sorry I came late.

197
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,280
Leave with me.

198
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,930
I can't leave.

199
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,270
I'm going to enter the palace with A'Rui.

200
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,180
She's being married off for diplomacy. Why are you going?

201
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,210
I'll keep her company.

202
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,020
When she can't take it anymore,

203
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,030
I'll take her away from there.

204
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,829
Even if she dies, I will die alongside her.

205
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,940
You shouldn't live for somebody else.

206
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,980
Why not?

207
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,159
A'Rui is the only person who treats me with sincerity.

208
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,440
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life with her.

209
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,670
You still don't get it.

210
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,430
She's marrying the Emperor of Chao.

211
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,900
The one who will be with her forever is her husband.

212
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,270
Leave with me now.

213
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,620
I'll take care of you forever.

214
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,320
Yi Wuyou, to me,

215
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,730
A'Rui is the most important person in the world.

216
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,670
If possible, I'd only want you to take A'Rui away.

217
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,000
As long as she's happy, I'll have no regrets even if I die.

218
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:58,891
♫ Lingering thoughts ♫

219
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:02,331
♫ The tears have dried up ♫

220
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:08,400
♫ The warm embrace that I can't have ♫

221
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:17,100
♫ The warmth of the flame that remains in my memory ♫

222
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:25,900
♫ Sentiments are lost in the wind but I still remember ♫

223
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:33,200
♫ Staying behind with you,
enduring it alone without a look back ♫

224
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:41,100
♫ Waiting quietly with you just so we could be together ♫

225
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,500
♫ I'd rather give up everything and drown alone in sorrow ♫

226
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:57,775
♫ Caught between love and pain, I remain ♫

227
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
General Xie, A'Rui is still a child.

228
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
She's willful.

229
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,600
On this journey and in the future,

230
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,200
please look after her.

231
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,800
I am at the behest of my king.

232
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
I will ensure that Princess Zhuyan...

233
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,200
and everyone else are escorted safely to Tianqi.

234
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,300
A'Rui.

235
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
I shouldn't have made you angry.

236
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,700
I understand. I don't blame you.

237
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,400
I will always remember your love for me, Father and Mother.

238
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
And how happy I was in Yebei.

239
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Mother.

240
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:31,000
- Please be on your way, Princess Zhuyan.
- Please be on your way, Princess Zhuyan.

241
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,800
Mother. Father.

242
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,200
Take care of yourselves.

243
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,200
I'll be off.

244
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,400
♫ Staying behind with you,
enduring it alone without a look back ♫

245
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:06,600
♫ Waiting quietly with you just so we could be together ♫

246
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,800
♫ I'd rather give up everything and drown alone in sorrow ♫

247
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,800
♫ Caught between love and pain... ♫

248
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:28,000
♫ Through the wisp of smoke, memories of the past flicker ♫

249
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,800
♫ With a sigh of nostalgia, I wrap the memory into a cocoon ♫

250
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:43,200
♫ I've never forgotten the unchanging promise
we made together ♫

251
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,000
♫ Caught in between love and pain ♫

252
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,600
♫ I remain ♫

253
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,500
Who knows if Yi Wuyou will come?

254
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,800
Yezi, find an opportunity to slip away.

255
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,400
Once we reach Chao, there will be no way out.

256
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,200
No more silly words from you.

257
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,500
We made a promise, never to be apart.

258
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
Shall I get you some water?

259
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,000
I thought... with your personality,

260
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,800
you'd come to find me.

261
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,800
What for?

262
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,600
To find out the Emperor of Chao's preferences.

263
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,500
That way, Princess Zhuyan would be able

264
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,200
to gain His Majesty's favor.

265
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,800
Gain His Majesty's favor?

266
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,600
You mean, so he'd have a good look at her

267
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,400
and bestow gifts upon her that his storerooms are overflowing with?

268
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,400
That's not all that comes from being his favorite.

269
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
Xie Yu'an,

270
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
what are women supposed to be in your eyes?

271
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,400
A wooden figurine without emotions?

272
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,600
You people want war.

273
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,800
So does Qihai Zhenyu. So go ahead and fight.

274
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
What does A'Rui have to do with it?

275
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,450
That's not true.

276
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,400
The Great Chao is sincere in establishing ties.

277
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,100
Are you saying Qihai Zhenyu still wants war after marrying off his daughter?

278
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,300
There's an ancient saying in Yebei.

279
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,600
Cowardly sheep will be ripped apart by vicious wolves.

280
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,300
Every Yebei person remembers.

281
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,900
Your Majesty, that woman is speaking nonsense.

282
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,200
I wouldn't say she was completely absurd.

283
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Beautiful.

284
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,299
Brother Wuyou, you play the guqin so well.

285
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,000
I'd love to be able to play the guqin like you.

286
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,500
If you like the guqin so much,

287
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,800
you can have it.

288
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
You're giving it to me?

289
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,400
Think of it as a parting gift from me to you.

290
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,000
Thank you for your hospitality,

291
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,900
Princess Rui and Miss Ye.

292
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,500
I'll be leaving for Tianqi tomorrow.

293
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,800
Am I just stupid?

294
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,000
I still make mistakes after two years of practicing.

295
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,600
The songs played on this guqin always sound so melancholic.

296
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I'm done with it.

297
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Here.

298
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600
Don't be sad.

299
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,040
I've thought about it. My diplomatic marriage is not all bad.

300
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,380
This way, Sister Lian will be able to marry the person she loves.

301
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,500
I won't be able to marry the person I love anyway.

302
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,100
So it doesn't matter whom I marry.

303
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,000
That's not true. Don't say that.

304
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,200
Yi Wuyou said I was like a kid.

305
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,400
I guess I am one.

306
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
It's just too bad

307
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,600
that he won't see me become a grown-up.

308
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,400
- What is it?
- General, look.

309
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,500
Guard up!

310
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,100
A'Rui, it's Yi Wuyou!

311
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,180
He's here to save us, Yezi.

312
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,809
He likes me. Right, Yezi?

313
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,250
Shoot!

314
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,320
Brother Wuyou!

315
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,400
Yezi, run!

316
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,980
Take A'Rui.

317
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,580
- No.
- Quickly!

318
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,420
You're going to get A'Rui killed.

319
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,280
That was a rogue Snow Crane.

320
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,580
Taking Qihai Rui with him, he won't get far.

321
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,349
He's going to land on the peak of Ruogan.

322
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,510
Zhuying, track him down.

323
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,650
Yes, Sir.

324
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,870
Xie Yu'an, don't you dare!

325
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,110
Get back here!

326
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,619
No, I'm begging you.

327
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,220
You must not harm A'Rui.

328
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,340
If Qihai Rui is harmed or killed today,

329
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,320
it's because of your own folly.

330
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,299
If you dare harm A'Rui, I won't let you off.

331
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,771
- Take her away.
- Yes, Sir.

332
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:00,680
Let me go.

333
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,540
Xie Yu'an! Xie Yu'an!

334
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,350
Let me go! Xie Yu'an!

335
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,220
[Imperial City]

336
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,360
His Majesty must have left Tianqi

337
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,240
for the Qihai Zhenyu's tribe.

338
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,220
Yu's temperament hasn't changed at all.

339
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,050
[Fan Ruhui, Grand Chancellor]
Be careful of what you say, Brother Jie.

340
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,629
Calling His Majesty by his name is lacking regard for hierarchy.

341
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,190
You must not do it again.

342
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,890
The constellations in Yebei are showing ominous signs.

343
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,339
I'm afraid this is going to be

344
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,180
the only fierce battle since Great Chao's founding.

345
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,890
[Jie Haitian, Chief of the Bureau of Astrology]

346
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,699
His Majesty has decreed to marry a woman of Yebei.

347
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,749
Is the diplomatic marriage not going to work?

348
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,860
His Majesty went to Yebei personally, proving the marriage was not a ruse.

349
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,080
But the people of Yebei are belligerent by nature.

350
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,509
The seven tribes are forever fighting amongst themselves.

351
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,869
Marrying off a princess won't bring about peace.

352
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,980
His Majesty might not want to go to war,

353
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,770
but it's bound to happen.

354
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,410
It's not up to him.

355
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,020
Pass the order.

356
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,620
The Lanyi Army will set up a defense by the Qiulan Sea.

357
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,340
Cut off Qihai Tribe's food passage when necessary

358
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,820
to unload some burden off of the front line.

359
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:16,160
Brother Jie, the Lanyi Army is now under the central military.

360
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,370
If you wish to mobilize troops,

361
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,510
it's best to get His Majesty's permission first.

362
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,030
Guard!

363
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,130
- Yes, Chief.
- Summon the Lanyi Army.

364
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,580
Yes, Sir.

365
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,370
We've received a military order to set up a defense by the Qiulan Sea.

366
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,860
General, Qiulan Sea

367
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,860
is where the Quyan Garrison of the Qihai Tribe is based.

368
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,950
They want us to set up a defense there. Is there going to be war?

369
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,440
I find it odd, too.

370
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,600
His Majesty has sent men to propose to Yebei's princess.

371
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,979
Why was such an order given?

372
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,590
[Xie Yu'an, Commander of the Lanyi Army]
Could there be something wrong with the order?

373
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,330
[Yan Shejian, Vice Commander of the Lanyi Army]
The military order is set. We must obey.

374
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,190
Relay the order.

375
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,720
Yes, Sir.

376
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,100
General.

377
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,010
Mo, how old are you?

378
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,430
I'll be 18 next month.

379
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,190
You said that I could go to battle when I turned 18.

380
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,330
The Lanyi Army was established 10 years ago.

381
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,190
We've fought at least 140 battles.

382
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,869
And we've won every one of them, am I right?

383
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,190
Yes, Sir.

384
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,510
Kneel.

385
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,530
Greetings, Your Majesty.

386
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,780
You may rise.

387
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

388
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,920
This is a token of Chao.

389
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,430
Accept this.

390
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,160
If anyone dares to slight you again,

391
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,140
they will make an enemy of Chao.

392
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,160
But the generals of Chao are all loyal.

393
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,190
What makes you think I would lie to my emperor?

394
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,480
You're not Xie Yu'an! You're Yu Xiuming!

395
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,860
You liar!

396
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,410
You murderous devil! Shame on you!

397
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,490
You'll get what's coming to you!

398
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,229
Put her away in a far away tent.

399
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,750
I don't want to be disturbed.

400
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,530
Yu Xiuming! Come back here!

402
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,430
You said you'd protect A'Rui!

403
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,670
Princess Zhuyan was abducted.

404
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,109
I ordered Zhuying to track her down.

405
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,570
This isn't a trivial matter.

406
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,750
It's better for Your Majesty to be prepared.

407
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,810
[Leng Tianxi, Commander of the Winged Guards]
There's no rush. So long as we find her.

408
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,380
Anyway, while on the way back,

409
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,710
I came across a Winged One.

410
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,370
He is a Snow Crane like you.

411
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,950
He is quite skilled.

412
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,670
I reckon he's a Winged Elite. Do you know him?

413
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,720
I have no clue.

414
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,770
- Search carefully.
- Yes, Sir.

415
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,130
You go that way.

416
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,820
You guys, come with me.

417
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,949
This way.

418
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,130
Brother Wuyou, they've caught up.

419
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,010
Nothing here!

420
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,370
Search ahead!

421
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,850
Let's go.

422
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,370
Quick! After them!

423
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,279
- Shoot him down!
- Yes, Sir.

424
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,370
Don't shoot! Watch out for Princess Zhuyan.

425
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,690
Your Majesty.

426
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,979
I've got word from Qiulan Sea.

427
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,229
They discovered traces of the Chao Army.

428
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,970
Good.

429
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,060
Your Majesty, what is our next move?

430
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,680
Gather the seven tribes.

431
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,189
March straight for Qiulan Sea.

432
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,060
Will do.

433
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,300
But I have my qualms about whether or not

434
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,540
the seven tribes will fight as one.

435
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,570
Tell them.

436
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,910
Once we get past this ordeal,

437
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,739
Yebei will no longer have to suffer in this place of bitter cold.

438
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,059
I had to sacrifice my daughter for this chance to fight back.

439
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,499
No one is allowed to back off.

440
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,880
Understood.

441
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,340
[Fan Residence]
Sir, an urgent message from the front line.

442
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,710
The Lanyi Army was ordered to secure the Qiulan Sea.

443
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,070
They were ambushed by the Qihai Tribe and suffered great casualties.

444
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,710
One more thing. Princess Zhuyan was abducted.

445
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,780
She hasn't been found.

446
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,750
Abducted?

447
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,620
Does that mean His Majesty will attack Yebei?

448
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,370
You're jesting, Sir. The Lanyi Army has been annihilated in Yebei.

449
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't think there's room for reconciliation.

450
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,510
What if His Majesty still doesn't want to fight?

451
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,910
Go and find out.

452
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,420
Yes, Sir.

453
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,569
No man or horse will be allowed to step on Chao soil.

454
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,050
Your Majesty.

456
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,299
On the way to set up a defense by Qiulan Sea,

457
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,480
Xie Yu'an was ambushed by the Qihai Tribe.

458
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,280
The number of Lanyi soldiers who survived the battle at Qiulan Sea...

459
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,830
is 31.

460
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,800
I've taken note.

461
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,650
Cai Can, lead your vanguard

462
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,579
to secure Qiulan Sea immediately.

463
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

464
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,470
Don't just stand there.

465
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,240
Dispatch the troops.

466
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,710
Don't drag your feet and ruin any chance of winning.

467
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,610
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

469
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,240
I wasn't able to get Princess Zhuyan back.

470
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,900
You failed to find the princess.

471
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,850
What about the Mirror of Youth?

472
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,340
Your Majesty, the Mirror of Youth is gone together with the princess.

473
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,440
Please mete out the punishment.

474
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,050
Compared to punishing you,

475
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,920
I'd rather you get the Mirror of Youth back.

476
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,280
This is a task I'm giving you.

477
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,610
If you can't accomplish it,

478
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:50,540
then I will have to punish you.

479
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,090
I've lost Qihai Rui.

481
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,430
What about the other one I brought back?

482
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,300
She's in the back tent.

483
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,710
The lady's fever won't subside.

484
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,810
The army physician is doing his best.

485
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,310
But there's been no improvement.

486
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,470
Physician! Physician, please save our general!

487
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,630
Come this way. Sit down.

488
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,100
General Xie, how did you get wounded so badly?

489
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,620
Envoy of Chao for a marriage alliance, Commander of the Lanyi Army,

490
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,990
General Who Defeats Bandits, Xie Yu'an.

491
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,580
Greets His Majesty, King Qihai.

492
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,960
I'm out of wound medicine. Please hold on, Sir.

493
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,189
I'll go get more.

494
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,440
Go and get it quickly.

495
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,440
Did you manage to recover the bodies of our men?

496
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,739
The Winged Guards have retrieved more than 1,000 bodies.

497
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,429
Some are incomplete.

498
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,990
They're impossible to identify.

499
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,170
What about Vice Commander Yan?

500
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,580
I've asked.

501
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,270
His body hasn't been found.

502
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,580
The Lanyi Army has been utterly defeated,

503
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,310
and I can't even retrieve the bodies of my men.

504
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,575
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

505
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:52,995
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

506
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:57,895
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

507
00:43:59,435 --> 00:44:02,655
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

508
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:05,115

509
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:11,295

510
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:15,215
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

511
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:18,535
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

512
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:23,935
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

513
00:44:25,035 --> 00:44:28,435
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

514
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,875
♫ Void of someone ♫

515
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:36,255
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

516
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:39,275
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

517
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:42,435
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

518
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:48,975
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

519
00:44:48,975 --> 00:44:55,335
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

520
00:44:55,335 --> 00:45:01,895
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

521
00:45:01,895 --> 00:45:08,254
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

522
00:45:08,254 --> 00:45:14,375
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

523
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:17,695
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

524
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,895
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

525
00:45:20,895 --> 00:45:27,375
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

526
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:33,814
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

527
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:40,295
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

528
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:46,715
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

529
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:53,014
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

530
00:45:55,175 --> 00:46:05,615
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
