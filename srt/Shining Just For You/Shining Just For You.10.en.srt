[Episode 10]

15
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,800
The culprits on the run are from the Qihai Tribe of Yebei,

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,600
namely Chu Ye, Qing Zhan, and three other men.

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,000
We have been looking into them.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
As for the rest involved, they have been captured.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
And they shall be punished accordingly.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
How?

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Huo Lu, the Assistant Commander of the Imperial Army,

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,000
colluded with the assassins and attempted an act of assassination.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
His body shall be decimated, and his whole family shall be executed.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Director Bai Lu of the Bureau of Astrology

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
conspired with the assassins and kept everyone in the dark.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,200
- She shall be beheaded.
- Beheaded?

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,100
Qihai Lian from the Qihai Tribe of Yebei. As the mastermind of the assassination,

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,400
to be executed with her accomplices.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,200
Qihai Lian is the daughter of Qihai Zhenyu.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
I am the emperor of this nation

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
and loved by heaven and the people.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
How can I leave a weak woman in protest?

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300
Guards! Bring her in.

34
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,400
I will give her a chance to explain herself.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,900
You impudent rebel!

36
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,800
Why are you not kneeling before the emperor?

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Why should a dying person bother to grovel at all?

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Remain standing, then.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,900
Let me ask you.

40
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,100
Why did you want to assassinate me?

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,300
You killed my father and harmed my people.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,600
A man like you deserves to be killed!

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
- You...
- How dare you!

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
She has the intention of treason. She should be executed immediately.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,300
Your Majesty, the criminal is obstinate and ineducable.

46
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,000
She should be executed as soon as possible.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,100
Yes. That's right!

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,800
Such rebellious people should be killed.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
She should be executed.

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,100
I did not expect you to hate me so much, Grand Princess.

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
We were sincere to propose a marriage alliance.

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,700
You're the problem.

53
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,000
Sincere to propose a marriage alliance?

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Qihai Zhenyu was marrying his daughter off

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,200
for the sole reason to earn himself more time to prepare for war.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
So that he and I could battle it out.

57
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,400
We surrendered to you.

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,000
You were the one who did not allow us to live.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,900
You call this surrendering?

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,300
Qihai Zhenyu killed 3,000 of my best men in the Lanyi Army.

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,800
I was forced to send troops to conquer him.

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,200
He himself struck the stone with a pebble, and was then defeated.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,900
You cannot blame me for all of this.

64
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,200
The seven tribes of Yebei

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
have had years of civil war.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Taking each other's lives.

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,400
Your casualties were greater than the war.

68
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
If you care about your people,

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,800
you should be here to beg for pardon,

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,300
not for death.

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,400
I, Qihai Lian of Yebei,

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,200
am aware of my sins and inevitable death.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
However, there are many old people and young children in Yebei.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
Please spare them from slavery.

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Please spare my people.

76
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,300
Heaven is compassionate.

77
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,000
I can tell that you are sincerely repenting.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are pardoned.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
You do not have to be subject to slavery, either.

80
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,800
Also, those accomplices of yours will be forgiven as well.

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
What about Yezi?

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,400
Pardoning you is already great grace.

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,000
The others should not be of your concern.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,500
I see you are unable to construct the canal any longer.

85
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,400
Then go, bring your people and migrate to Yuezhou.

86
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Do not leave that land without my orders.

87
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Your Majesty.

88
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
I beg Your Majesty to allow us to remain in our homeland.

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,400
I have given you a chance to live.

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,700
Between migrating to Yuezhou and guarding a barren land,

91
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,000
choose for yourself.

92
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,000
You may leave.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,100
I, Jie Zhuying, have come to meet you, Your Majesty.

95
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,500
I appoint you as the Grand Marshal of Yuezhou

96
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,600
and grant you authority as commander-in-chief.

97
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Gather your troops and assist me

98
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,200
to escort the survivors of Yebei to Yuezhou.

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,500
After arriving at Yuezhou, you shall supervise them.

100
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,400
Your Majesty!

101
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,800
I wish to remain by your side, Your Majesty.

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,500
I dare not accept such a decree.

103
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Why? Are you afraid of Qihai Lian's bewitchment?

104
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,400
That you'd betray me?

105
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,900
Your Majesty,

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,400
the both of us can no longer be together.

107
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,600
I do not wish to be associated with her anymore.

108
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,200
This is an order.

109
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Your Majesty!

110
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,500
From now on, you will no longer hold the family name of Jie.

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,700
You will be named Zhu Ying.

112
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,800
All of your past will be written off.

113
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,500
Your father's achievements and sins

114
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,400
will no longer be your problems as well.

115
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,000
Your Majesty.

116
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Do a good job as a grand marshal in Yuezhou.

117
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Work hard.

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,800
Don't give me the chance to behead you.

119
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,100
I...

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
Zhu Ying...

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,900
shall obey the decree.

122
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,200
He did not wear armor

123
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,000
yet he was unharmed.

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,200
Did he really meet the Truth Master before?

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Yun Wen mentioned that the Truth Masters are all-knowing.

126
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,200
If we find them, we will know where A'Rui is.

127
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Brother, you must get better soon.

128
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,600
The Emperor of Chao has spared us.

129
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Brother.

130
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,000
Princess.

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
The emperor just let us off like that?

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
That's right.

133
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,500
When Qing Zhan gets better, we shall return to Yebei.

134
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,000
He can't possibly let us off so easily.

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
You...

136
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,600
Did you make a deal with him?

137
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I promised to migrate to Yuezhou.

138
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Then, he would let us off.

139
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,200
Yuezhou?

140
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Where is Yuezhou?

141
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,600
It's a place that is very, very far from Yebei.

142
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Princess, we are all from Yebei.

143
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Why must we leave Yebei and go to Yuezhou?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
In order for us to live!

145
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Let's fight them, then!

146
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,500
If you fight them, you can only kill a few people.

147
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,600
Can you ensure that the people's fathers, mothers,

148
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,700
little sisters, or sisters-in-law will live?

149
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,800
Or are you going to lead them to their death?

150
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
The migration is done for the sake of family.

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,400
For the clan.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Those who refuse to go...

153
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,800
should not follow me any longer.

154
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,800
[Tianqi City]

155
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Turns out there were traitors

156
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,300
who made a scene at the Ceremony of Stars.

157
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,200
Apparently, many people died,

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,500
but they were all assassins.

159
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,800
His Majesty is mighty.

160
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Those petty thieves can't possibly hurt him.

161
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,000
The Director of the Bureau of Astrology will be beheaded, too.

162
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Come in.

163
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Young Master.

164
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
How is it?

165
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,400
The Chao Emperor has ordered Bai Lu, Director of the Bureau of Astrology, to be executed.

166
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
However, her collusion with assassins was not mentioned.

167
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,900
How can that be?

168
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,300
They released the mastermind, Qihai Lian.

169
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,200
Why would they capture Yezi?

170
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,300
Perhaps the Emperor of Chao is suspicious of the Cloud Flame.

171
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,000
No, I must ask Qihai Lian about this.

172
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,200
Yi Wuyou? What business do you have here?

173
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
I knew you'd be here, Qihai Lian.

174
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Yezi is still in prison...

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
waiting for her execution tomorrow.

176
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,800
His Majesty only agreed to let off the clan members who were not captured.

177
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,500
I cannot rescue everybody.

178
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,200
His Majesty?

179
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,900
I understand now.

180
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,000
You begged the Emperor of Chao for mercy and swore allegiance.

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,900
That's why he allowed you to come back. Am I right?

182
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,500
Nonsense!

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,500
I still have tens of thousands of clan members. They do not deserve death.

184
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,200
Does Yezi deserve to die, then?

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,500
You were the ones who got her involved.

186
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,000
Nobody wanted to get her involved.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,200
She wanted to be a part of it herself.

188
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
I feel so sad for Yezi.

189
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,000
The people that she wanted to protect

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,500
never meant to protect her.

191
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,400
Yi Wuyou, I admit.

192
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,200
I am not the right person to lead the Yebei people

193
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,600
to win a battle.

194
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
I cannot win the Emperor of Chao.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,200
I can only do my best to protect my people.

196
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,400
To allow them to live.

197
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,600
My father entrusted the people to me.

198
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,800
I do not have the right to take their lives away

199
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,000
in exchange for Yezi's.

200
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,800
His Majesty agreed to exempt the Yebei people from slavery.

201
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,700
I cannot provoke him and cause him to have a change of heart.

202
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,200
I could not save A'Rui before,

204
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,900
yet now, I cannot save Yezi either.

205
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,600
Enough.

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,600
If you're not going to rescue her, then it's fine.

207
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Sister Lian, is this how we must live?

208
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,600
Without courage and honor, is Yebei still the same Yebei?

209
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,500
If the people of Yebei are alive,

210
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,100
then Yebei will exist.

211
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,400
If the people of Yebei have gone extinct,

212
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,800
then Yebei will cease to exist for good.

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,300
Nothing is more important than survival.

214
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Let's keep our courage

215
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,600
and honor in our hearts.

216
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,500
Leave that to our descendants to pursue.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Ling Yun.

218
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, did Bai Lu really meet the Truth Master?

219
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,400
How would I know?

220
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,700
Summon Bai Lu.

221
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,200
I must ask her myself.

222
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Bai Lu?

223
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,400
Your Majesty, didn't you sentence Bai Lu?

224
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,700
She's probably at the execution ground by now.

225
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Bai Lu.

226
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,700
Do you not have anything else to say to me?

227
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
All that I want to say to you, Your Majesty,

228
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,100
I have told Consort Tian.

229
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,800
If you wish to know, feel free to ask her.

230
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,200
Help! Let me go! Don't kill me!

231
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,500
Please let me go!

232
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,500
[Executed]
Don't kill me!

233
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,100
[Order]

234
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,700
Execute him.

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,700
Let me go. Don't kill me!

236
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,300
Please let me go. Don't kill me!

237
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,400
Please don't kill me! Please let me go!

238
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Don't kill me.

239
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't kill me!

240
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Your Majesty.

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
Your Majesty.

242
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Your Majesty, how did you find time to come here?

243
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Are you really okay?

244
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,200
Look at me, I'm fine.

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,600
I really regret it.

246
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
I shouldn't have gone to the palace.

247
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
I should have guarded you instead.

248
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Don't make me seem so weak.

249
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,800
I'm here to ask you something.

250
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
I heard that Bai Lu has been spending time with you lately.

251
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Bai Lu?

252
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,700
I have not slept for two days,

253
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,300
hating myself for allowing her to serve Your Majesty.

254
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
If anything happens to you,

255
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
I would kill myself.

256
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
Don't say that.

257
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,200
I appointed her to work at the Bureau of Astrology.

258
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,900
It's not your fault.

259
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,100
I want to know if Bai Lu mentioned anything to you

260
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,300
or gave you anything lately.

261
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
Yes.

262
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,800
What is this?

263
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,500
A pouch.

264
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,300
Bai Lu once said that she met a Truth Master by chance as a child.

265
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,900
The motif on this pouch is embroidered according to the one she received from the Truth Master.

266
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,300
Was she chosen by the Truth Master as well?

267
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,400
Bring Bai Lu here.

268
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Execute her.

269
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Stop the execution!

270
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,100
According to the royal decree, Bai Lu is being summoned for questioning.

271
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,200
You gave this to Consort Tian.

272
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Yes.

273
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,200
You met the Truth Master?

274
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Yes, I've met the Truth Master.

275
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
And then?

276
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,900
Then... I would always have weird dreams.

277
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,800
But these dreams would turn into reality.

278
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
My father once told me

279
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,100
that the Truth Master will wait until I turn 25 years old

280
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,500
before he meets me again.

281
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, Bai Lu.

282
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,200
What tricks are you trying to pull?

283
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,100
With just a few words and no proof,

284
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
do you think you can escape punishment for treason

285
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,500
and make me keep you alive for a few more years?

286
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,700
Bai Lu, I treated you well.

287
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,300
Why did you commit treason?

288
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,500
Princess Lian is A'Rui's elder sister.

289
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,400
I couldn't abandon her.

290
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,100
To save her life, this was my only way.

291
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,200
You were spurned by the people of Yebei.

292
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,800
You think Qihai Rui treated you best.

293
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
After she was rescued by the Winged People,

294
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,300
she never came back for you.

295
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,800
As for Qihai Lian,

296
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,700
you were willing to risk your life for her to assassinate me.

297
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,600
Yet, not even once did she

298
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
plead for you in the Qianyuan Hall.

299
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
Bai Lu.

300
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,600
Is this really worth it?

301
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
You are an immortal monster.

302
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
You will never understand.

303
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,500
How old are you to talk about life and death with me?

304
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
Fine. I will let you live.

305
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,800
I will spare you for today.

306
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,800
But don't get too excited.

307
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,300
I have no patience to waste more time.

308
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,400
In three months, you must locate the Truth Master.

309
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,500
Or else, you will stand on this execution ground

310
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,000
and no one will save you again.

311
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,600
But the Truth Master is elusive and hard to find.

312
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,000
You must allow me to use the books and tools at the Bureau of Astrology.

313
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,800
I will reinstate you.

314
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,500
Okay. You may leave.

315
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
I have one more question.

316
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,200
What is it?

317
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Where is Princess Lian?

318
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,800
I have spared her life

319
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,400
and ordered her to lead her people and migrate to Yuezhou.

320
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,300
Yuezhou?

321
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,600
What? Still not satisfied?

322
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
I shall take my leave.

323
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,400
When she first came to the Bureau of Astrology, I told you it was a joke.

324
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,600
She's a woman, she had no teacher, and had no abilities.

325
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Who is she to join the Bureau of Astrology?

326
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Who said Director Bai is incapable?

327
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,200
Her involvement in treason does not coincide with her astrological abilities.

328
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Director Bai's astrological abilities are above yours and mine.

329
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,300
Why can't she join the Bureau of Astrology?

330
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,400
You're defending a dead person?

331
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,100
- Aren't you afraid of being implicated?
- You...

332
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,100
This shows that having great astrological abilities does not mean you can predict your own fate.

333
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,000
At this point, Director Bai is probably...

334
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Sorry to let you down.

335
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,100
What...

336
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,300
- Director Bai.
- I'm back.

337
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,800
Director Bai?

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,200
- Director Bai!
- Director Bai.

339
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Director Bai.

340
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,500
You're okay?

341
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,400
You scared me!

342
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
Look at me, I'm fine.

343
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You... You...

344
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,400
Well, isn't this Official Duanmu...

345
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,600
Supervisor Duanmu.

346
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
You're not dead?

347
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,200
His Majesty reinstated me.

348
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
I knew it!

349
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,700
Director Bai made it back alive from the execution ground.

350
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,400
You must be blessed by heaven!

351
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,700
We at the Bureau of Astrology need protection from auspicious energy like this.

352
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,000
What the Bureau of Astrology needs is you.

353
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,600
I heard that you were managing all sorts of tasks

354
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,800
within the Bureau of Astrology.

355
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,400
Who am I to do that?

356
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,600
The outsiders may not know, but you should know clearly, Director Bai.

357
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Over the past few days, I barely ate or slept.

358
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
I've been so overworked.

359
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm glad you're back, Director Bai.

360
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
We need you to take charge of the Bureau of Astrology.

361
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm so pissed.

362
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,700
Leave it!

363
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,100
I said, leave it!

364
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,400
Are you going to disobey me, too?

365
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,900
You Yebei women are all trash.

366
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,100
She's a witch. How powerful!

367
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,200
Treason should be punishable by death.

368
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,400
What witchcraft did she use for His Majesty to reinstate her?

369
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,300
I'm so pissed. Did I say you can get up?

370
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,700
Kneel.

371
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,800
You, kneel.

372
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,200
I'm so mad. I'm so mad.

373
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,800
Witch!

374
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
Father!

375
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,400
Father!

376
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,700
Why is he so angry?

377
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,200
Apparently, a woman called Bai Lu

378
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,400
somehow ruined his plans.

379
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
A few days ago, she was sentenced to death.

380
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Today, not only was she not killed,

381
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,400
but she was also reinstated.

382
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
Bai Lu?

383
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,700
Don't let him hear you.

384
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,000
Otherwise, you'll get punished again.

385
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,100
- Father.
- Why are you in a hurry?

386
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,200
Bai Lu is a remnant of the Yebei people.

387
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,400
She committed treason at the Ceremony of Stars.

388
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,700
Everyone saw it.

389
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,200
Why was she not killed?

390
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,400
Is Uncle out of his mind?

391
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,800
You brat!

392
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,400
How dare you complain about His Majesty!

393
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,500
You're so out of control!

394
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,300
You only raise your voice at your son.

395
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,500
When Bai Lu bullies me, is she not also bullying you?

396
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,800
She should at least show you some respect.

397
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,100
Get out! Get out!

398
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,500
What an embarrassment. I'm so sorry.

399
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
Your son is very outspoken.

400
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,700
To be honest, it's adorable of him.

401
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,700
This brat can't even speak logically.

402
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,800
But he's right about one thing.

403
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,000
Bai Lu was in collusion with assassins.

404
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
There were many witnesses.

405
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,800
There's cold hard evidence.

406
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,300
Why was it overlooked, and why was she reinstated?

407
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,600
His Majesty sent Ling Yun to bring her from the execution ground.

408
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Nobody knows why.

409
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,800
Investigate it.

410
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
Even if it's His Majesty's order,

411
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,800
the royal court deserves an explanation.

412
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,100
If such a crime is disregarded,

413
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,200
then the laws of the Great Chao are basically useless.

414
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,400
You are right. I shall investigate it now.

415
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,570
Bai Lu. You're too bold.

416
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,600
With just one decorative design, you dare think he wouldn't hesitate to kill you?

417
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
[Manual of the Emperor Star]
Yu Xiuming has always been interested in the Truth Masters.

418
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
Didn't you say it, too?

419
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
That the design was related to the Truth Masters.

420
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,500
Of course, I'd take advantage of that.

421
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,800
In my opinion, you just got lucky.

422
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,900
If Yu Xiuming didn't verify with Consort Tian about what you said,

423
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,500
you'd be dead by now.

424
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,800
Hey. If you have time to nag me,

425
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,300
why don't you help me out?

426
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
With what?

427
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Locating the Truth Masters!

428
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,600
Didn't you say that the Truth Masters are all-knowing?

429
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,400
What if they know where A'Rui is?

430
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,900
The Truth Masters have retired. They are nowhere to be found.

431
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,000
You won't find them.

432
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,800
Even though I know that I may fail,

433
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I must still seek them.

434
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
Furthermore, they're not completely untraceable.

435
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,200
Isn't the Mianshi Bridge linked to the Truth Masters?

436
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,900
Director Bai.

437
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Who's there?

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Director Bai, someone from the palace

439
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
reports that Consort Tian has asked to see you tomorrow.

440
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,400
Got it.

441
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,200
Your Highness, Bai Lu is here.

442
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,900
Your Highness.

443
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Do you repent?

444
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,000
I repent.

445
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,100
- But I...
- You are so reckless!

446
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,300
His Majesty sent you to be among the assassins to gain information

447
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,000
because he trusted and valued you.

448
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
Yet in the end,

449
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,700
you let the assassins escape because of your friendship.

450
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,000
Did you think of His Majesty?

451
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,400
You are right, Your Highness.

452
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,600
This time, your merits wrote off your sins.

453
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,200
But there will be no next time.

454
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,700
Yes.

455
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Go to the back garden. Someone is waiting for you.

456
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,600
For me?

457
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
It wasn't me.

458
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
His Majesty arranged for it.

459
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,200
Yes, Your Highness.

460
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,100
Sister Lian!

461
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
Yezi.

462
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,500
- Yezi.
- Lian!

463
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,100
It's really you.

464
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
It's really you.

465
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,800
At the execution ground, I really thought...

466
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,700
Thankfully, His Majesty...

467
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,600
His Majesty's men came in time.

468
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
I heard from him

469
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,700
that he ordered you to migrate to Yuezhou.

470
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,200
That's right.

471
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,600
I agreed.

472
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,400
We will be departing soon.

473
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,300
I suddenly remembered that I once calculated the fortune of various cities.

474
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,000
Yuezhou has signs of prosperity.

475
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,600
Perhaps this journey

476
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,200
may be a blessing and bring peace instead.

477
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,100
However,

478
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,600
it's best you depart soon.

479
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,200
Prepare more carriages and food supplies.

480
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
His Majesty ordered me to depart today.

481
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,100
Yezi, come with me.

482
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,800
We'll go to Yuezhou together.

483
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,000
Sister Lian, Yu Xiuming will not let me leave.

484
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,100
But it's okay, Tianqi is the capital of the Chao Empire.

485
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,400
Here, it would be easier for me to get information about A'Rui.

486
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,800
Okay, stay in Tianqi, then.

487
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
Continue to look for A'Rui.

488
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,800
But you must be careful.

489
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,600
Take care, Sister Lian.

490
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
You, too.

491
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,400
Though Yuezhou is far away,

492
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
it's suitable for cultivation.

493
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
Migrating there with the people of Yebei

494
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,000
may not be a bad thing after all.

495
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,400
His Majesty entrusted you with great responsibility.

496
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,900
You can do what you want over there.

497
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,100
I'm sure you will find success one day.

498
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,200
Over the past month or so,

499
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
there have been a lot of ups and downs.

500
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Now, we continue to move on.

501
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,600
In fact, I envy you.

502
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
Though you are heading into the wilderness,

503
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,800
you can share joy and sorrow with your loved one.

504
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,800
On the other hand, I have to obey my parents' decisions in marriage.

505
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,800
Every farewell always ends with a goodbye.

506
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,400
I, Zhu Ying, will bid you farewell for now.

507
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,000
Have a safe journey.

508
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Take care.

509
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,200
This journey is filled with dangers and toils.

510
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,300
I wonder if we can ever meet again.

511
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,600
Yeah.

512
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,600
So, please be careful.

513
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,400
General Jie is responsible for the migration.

514
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes.

515
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,500
His Majesty erased his family name as Jie

516
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
and appointed him as the Grand Marshal of Yuezhou.

517
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,200
He will be known as Zhu Ying from now on.

518
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,800
I don't know how far we can go,

519
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,600
but I can only take it one step at a time.

520
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,900
You can try searching for Tubo.

521
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,800
Tubo?

522
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,400
I saw it in an ancient book.

523
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,800
It is said that the Heluo Clan has an ancient branch called the Tubo people.

524
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,200
The Tubo live in Yezhao and are very territorial.

525
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,700
However, they can turn mud into stone and stone into soil.

526
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,300
Which is why places they pass all have smooth paths.

527
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,900
Before, someone saw them at the borders of Yezhao.

528
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,300
So, you can try seeking them too.

529
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,800
Such peculiar people exist?

530
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,400
Before, people did not believe the Snow Wolf King existed either.

531
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
Yet we actually saw him.

532
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,500
All right.

533
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,600
Don't worry.

534
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,800
I hope for the best for you in everything

535
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,200
and that you'll be safe.

536
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,900
Okay, go back now.

537

540

Qingheng, I have to go to Yuezhou.

541
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah.

542
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,800
I have to as well.

543
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,500
It's not your decision to make, General.

544
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,200
From now on, the Yebei Clan

545
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,300
shall be in your care, General.

546

♫ ...is this life worthwhile ♫

552
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,700
Young Master, Miss Ye has returned to the Bureau of Astrology.

553
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,500
She has been reinstated.

554
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,100
How are things at the Bureau of Astrology?

555
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,300
The people of the bureau had no objections either.

556
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,200
Tell the Tabai Army to pass this on.

557
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Moving forward, provide even more detailed reports of what happens inside the Bureau of Astrology.

558
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Yes, sir.

559
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,900
It's time to make use of our spy in the palace as well.

560
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Young Master, are you doing this for Miss Ye?

561
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,300
Sending spies to be by the Emperor of Chao is for the restoration of our nation.

562
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,400
Send someone and ask her this. Is the night with a full moon safe?

563
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
Yes, sir.

564
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,100
Your Highness, Nanny Cuiping who went out not long ago

565
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,800
says to have acquired flower tea from Ningzhou

566
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,200
and would like to dedicate some to Your Highness.

567
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,600
Flower tea from Ningzhou?

568
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,200
Let her in.

569
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes, Your Highness.

570
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,900
All blessings and peace to Your Highness.

571
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,400
Your Highness, it's been a while

572
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,400
and you look all the more elegant.

573
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
I brought some flower tea from Ningzhou.

574
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,800
Please enjoy them.

575
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,600
Xie, excuse yourselves for now.

576
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,400
Yes, Your Highness.

577
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,400
Indeed, this smells like it's from Ningzhou.

578
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
You work for the Winged Clan?

579
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,100
Your Highness is sensible indeed.

580
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,600
Thinking of your old master at the mention of Ningzhou.

581
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,600
I once saw you in Ningzhou too, Your Highness.

582
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Tianqi has not been peaceful lately.

583
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,400
The Winged Clan would like to take advantage of this to gain a foothold in Tianqi.

584
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
We ask for Your Highness for some protection.

585
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,800
How dare you!

586
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Please do not be angry, Your Highness.

587
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,800
- Your Highness, I am speaking on behalf of...
- I don't care who you work for.

588
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Guards!

589
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
This slave is showing impudence.

590
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,900
Take her away and teach her a good lesson.

591
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,400
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Your Highness!

592
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Your Highness, I... Your Highness!

593
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
Your Highness!

594
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
Your Highness!

595
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,600
Your Highness!

596
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,500
Young Master, the informant was taken by the Winged Guards at Zhuhuan Palace.

597
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,200
You lost contact?

598
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,600
This is due to my incompetence.

599
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,300
I've always been suspicious that she has given up on her duties as a Snow Crane. As expected.

600
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,100
She was but a lowly peasant.

601
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,700
If not for you,

602
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,900
how could she have learned the techniques of Snow Crane?

603
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,400
Let's leave her with her suffering from the side effects of the lunar eclipse, then.

604
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Qihai Lian has already returned to Yebei.

605
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,400
Why are you still so troubled?

606
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,500
This may be a difficult journey for Sister Lian.

607
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,400
At least Zhu Ying is with her.

608
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,000
He can help her out.

609
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Things aren't looking great for you,

610
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,200
yet you're worried about others?

611
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,600
You should worry about yourself.

612
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,700
Yu Xiuming told you to locate the Truth Master.

613
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,000
You can't just fool him.

614
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
We will look for the Truth Master.

615
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,400
Otherwise, how would we find A'Rui?

616
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,600
I must visit the Mianshi Bridge tomorrow

617
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
and get a good look.
