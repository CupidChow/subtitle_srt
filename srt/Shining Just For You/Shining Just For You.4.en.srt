[Episode 4]

15
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,829
The king told us to fight to the death.

16
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,320
Why should we surrender?

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,229
This is what happens when we surrender.

18
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,559
Chu Ye, don't forget. There are also the elderly and children.

19
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:55,100
Then we'll go to our graves together!

20

21
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,359
A'Su, take A'Liang to look for Uncle.

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,719
Lead the tribe into the mountain to hide.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,879
Do not make a sound, in case the Chao Army notices.

24
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,410
Okay.

25
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,060
General.

26
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,530
What is it?

27
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,009
Sir, the people who came to oversee the war in Yebei are nearing the battalion.

28
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,450
Are we not going to do anything?

29
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,080
You may leave first.

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,530
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,999
Leave the things here.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,549
I'll decide after I take a closer look.

33
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,110
Okay.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,250
What is this?

35
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,519
This is the most important daily task of the Horoscope Department.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,320
We're supposed to report to the harem regularly.

37
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,439
It is to help the palace consorts determine the best time for getting pregnant.

38
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,469
That is calculated, too?

39
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,829
Is the emperor having a hard time getting a prince?

40
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,780
Official Ye, please quiet down.

41
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,640
His Majesty doesn't have an heir yet.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,389
This is the biggest worry of everyone in the imperial court.

Yu Xiuming's harem?

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,819
The Bureau of Astronomy's Horoscope Department head astrologer is here to report to Your Highnesses.

45
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,230
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

46
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,020
Your visit here must mean the calculations are ready.

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,290
Bring it here.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,670
Northwest...

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,990
I have nothing to ask, so I'll excuse myself first.

50
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,060
How come she's one of the concorts?

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,019
I didn't think you'd be able to answer the tricky questions put forth by the consorts.

53
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,980
So long as they're happy.

54
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,979
If they're unsure about anything, they can ask me anytime.

55
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,759
I don't think they'll have many questions.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,400
His Majesty doesn't really visit them.

57
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,039
But I heard, Consort Tian is not like the rest.

58
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,570
What have you heard?

59
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,170
I heard that Consort Tian used to fight alongside His Majesty on the battlefields.

60
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,939
That's right. Hence, that is why His Majesty favors Consort Tian the most out of everyone.

61
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,720
So it is her.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,100
Hopefully, she didn't recognize me.

63
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,460
Greetings, Your Highness.

64
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,750
Go to the Imperial Office of Music and look into this person.

65
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,020
The official just now seemed a little familiar.

66
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,800
There must not be any loopholes around His Majesty.

67
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,440
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,120
Walk forward. Bow.

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,760
Miss Xie.

70
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,340
This is the name list you asked for. Sorry to keep you waiting.

71
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,010
Greetings, Your Highness.

72
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,930
Have you finished your task at the Imperial Office of Music?

73
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,250
Yes, Your Highness.

74
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,810
If I'm not mistaken, there was a captured female servant who accompanied the princess to be married.

75
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,910
Do you know where she is right now?

76
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,599
But you need not worry about it too much.

77
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,760
If anyone asks,

78
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,560
just tell them I decided to keep her.

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,619
Are you going to tell me that on the way she died of an illness?

80
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,670
I wouldn't dare lie to Your Highness.

81
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,509
After the female prisoner from Yebei arrived,

82
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,319
each department went to the Imperial Office of Music to make their picks.

83
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,040
So did the Jie Residence.

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,309
Of course, it wasn't in my position to turn Supervisor Jie down.

85
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,570
I was wondering who was bold enough to do it.

86
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,130
So it was Supervisor Jie.

87
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,950
Look, soldiers!

88
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,489
Search the place!

89
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,290
Find the escapee!

90
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,180
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,101
There's nothing here.

92
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,350
What are you doing here?

93
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,789
- Leave now!
- We don't have anyone you want.

94
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,349
There's no wanted person here.

95
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,330
- Yeah.
- There's no wanted person here.

96
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,740
There's no wanted person here.

97
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,789
We'll decide once we've searched the place.

98
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,069
The girl in the tent has the plague.

99
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,340
This place is densely populated.

100
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,669
And there are a lot of sick and wounded.

101
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,690
The disease has infected hundreds of people within a few days.

102
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,829
The ones that were carried out and burned in the past few days were all from this tent.

103
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:53,639
If you insist on going inside, you might not be able to leave.

104
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,540
Do you think I'm dumb?

105
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,290
If there really is a plague, why would you stop me?

106
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,220
I'm sure you'd have me infected and die.

107
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,059
- Scram!
- Halt!

108
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,640
There's no one here that needs to be punished.

109
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,109
General Jie, this place is clearly...

110
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,469
His Majesty has entrusted me with the task of securing the Yebei prisoners of war.

111
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,460
I'm telling you there's no wanted person here.

112
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,000
What?

113
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,970
Do I have to repeat myself?

114
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,190
Let's go.

115
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,450
I'll always back you up.

116
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,780
General, that was a big risk you took.

117
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,669
The infantry already knows.

118
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,100
You're deceiving the emperor.

119
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,420
Every person has their own bottom line.

120
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,010
A Chao soldier will not take pride in killing prisoners of war.

121
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,410
Besides, Yebei has paid for it.

122
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,280
We shouldn't push it too far.

123
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,040
But... if His Majesty finds out...

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,930
I suppose he won't cut my head off, right?

125
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,759
It's been some time since you entered the palace.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,199
Are you settling down all right?

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,830
I've been too busy to visit.

128
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,909
I hope you don't take it to heart.

129
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,469
Your Majesty has to take care of state affairs.

130
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,590
I won't take it to heart.

131
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,270
But there's something I wish to tell you.

132
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,570
What is it?

133
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,930
It's about Supervisor Jie.

134
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,150
Do you still remember Ye Lingshuang?

135
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,420
It's the female prisoner you brought back from Yebei.

136
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,490
That woman?

137
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,960
How is she related to Jie Haitian?

138
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,700
It was Xie Yu'an

139
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,700
who brought the Yebei female prisoner back to Tianqi.

140
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
But I recently noticed

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,400
that an official at the Bureau of Astrology looked a lot like her.

142
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
So I asked Xie to find out more.

143
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,800
We found that she was taken in by the Bureau of Astrology.

144
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,800
You mean Jie Haitian hired a prisoner to be an official?

145
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,300
That's right.

146
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
The idea Ye Lingshuang suggested is very good.

147
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Make sure you learn from it.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,200
As expected from someone who got approval from Supervisor Jie.

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Such concise thinking Official Ye has.

150
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Different from the norm.

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,700
I heard the Bureau of Astrology recently received a skilled astrologer.

152
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,200
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Your Majesty's sudden visit to the bureau caught me by surprise.

154
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Apologies for not greeting you at the door.

155
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,500
If I didn't come on the spur of the moment,

156
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,600
I doubt I would've been able

157
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,400
to meet this Yebei prisoner you hired, Official Jie.

158
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Your Majesty, I was just about to report the matter.

159
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
Supervisor Jie,

160
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
you secretly took in a female prisoner.

161
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,800
Am I, or the law, nothing in your eyes?

162
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,900
You're a prisoner.

163
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,000
What makes you think you can wear the robe of a head official?

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Guard!

165
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Remove the robe.

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

167
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
There's no need.

168
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
I'll do it myself.

169
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Your Majesty, this was solely my idea.

170
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Please punish me.

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,200
So you realize your mistake, Supervisor Jie.

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,500
I was wrong.

173
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,100
Please punish only me.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Jie Haitian.

175
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,800
You better give me a good reason.

176
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Your Majesty, Zhuying sent a letter back recently.

177
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,300
He said although they have combed through Yebei,

178
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,800
they were unable to find the Mirror of Youth.

179
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,000
So I thought I should get the calculation done as soon as possible

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to help Zhuying locate the mirror.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,400
What does Ye Lingshuang have anything to do with that?

182
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,800
The art of astrology and divination Ye Lingshuang possesses

183
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,100
is nothing I've ever seen.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
Nothing you've ever seen?

185
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,400
Jie Haitian, oh, Jie Haitian.

186
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,500
You are the head of the most important department of Chao,

187
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,300
as well as the world's top astrologer.

188
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,600
How were you deceived by a little girl?

189
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Previously, when I was in Yebei,

190
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
she came to my tent

191
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,400
to tell me that she wanted to be the Empress of Chao.

192
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,000
She can't fool me with such lousy tricks.

193
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Your Majesty, I studied the constellations.

194
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,300
I noticed that she possesses great celestial power.

195
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
But her celestial power is sealed, so she cannot unleash her full potential.

196
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
If she can break the seal and be of servitude to Your Majesty,

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,200
it will do Chao good.

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Say no more.

199
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,000
She's too brazen.

200
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,600
And so she will pay for her brazenness.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,700
[Imperial Office of Music]

202
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,200
His Majesty is here.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

204
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,500
Leave us.

205
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

206
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,700
"My Princess Zhuyan".

207
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,000
It's been a long time.

208
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,800
Ye Lingshuang,

209
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,400
why did you go to the Bureau of Astrology?

210
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
If you don't tell me the truth,

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,300
I will make you a slave.

212
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,800
No way!

213
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,200
I mean,

214
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,000
Your Majesty is a good judge of character.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,200
You wouldn't make me go back to being a slave.

216
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,700
Then tell me.

217
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,400
How good of a judge of character am I?

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Well, the gist of the matter is that I should thank you.

219
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,400
See, without you,

220
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,800
I wouldn't have come to Tianqi.

221
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,300
If I hadn't come to Tianqi,

222
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,400
I wouldn't have had the chance to be mentored by Supervisor Jie.

223
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Am I right?

224
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,800
So you're saying that thanks to me taking you away from Yebei,

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,000
you were able to get tutelage.

226
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
That's right.

227
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
You know my reputation as the cursed one in Yebei.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Everyone wants a piece of me.

229
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
So even if I was interested in astrology,

230
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
I could only study in secret.

231
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,000
Now that I left Yebei,

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm able to formally and justifiably study it.

233
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,000
So, of course, I have to thank you.

234
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,700
But in Chao, there's already Jie Haitian

235
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,000
helping me manage the country.

236
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,400
What's the use of you in the Bureau of Astrology?

237
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
That's just the present.

238
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,400
If... If you let me stay in the bureau and progress in my studies,

239
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,700
who knows if I'd become better than Supervisor Jie?

240
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,700
You sure are confident.

241
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,000
All right.

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,200
I'll give you a chance to show me your potential.

243
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

244
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
I've asked the Bureau of Astrology to determine

245
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
an auspicious site for the next Ceremony of Stars.

246
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,500
It's been 10 days and they still haven't gotten an answer.

247
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
You can entrust me with this task then.

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,200
I promise I'll give you an answer soon enough

249
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,400
so the ceremony can take place.

250
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,600
It's something even Jie Haitian has trouble getting an answer,

251
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,400
and yet you agreed without a second thought.

252
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,900
Do you know how serious of a crime it is to deceive the emperor?

253
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,000
But if I'm able to complete the task on time,

254
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,900
I hope Your Majesty will be gracious in your reward.

255
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,100
Of course you will be rewarded.

256
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,200
But if you can't give me an answer within 10 days,

257
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,900
I will have you beheaded

258
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,600
for deceiving the emperor.

259
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,600
A royal decree for the Bureau of Astrology.

260
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,600
This is an edict from the Emperor of Chao.

261
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
"Great Chao hasn't been established for long.

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
There is still much to do

263
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
and the country is in need of talent.

264
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,800
Thanks to the Bureau of Astrology's Supervisor Jie Haitian

265
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,600
discovering a rare female talent,

266
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,200
who is knowledgeable, wise, and an all-rounder.

267
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,100
Without gender or geographical discrimination

268
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,000
and with unity as the only goal,

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
may the country prosper for eternity.

270
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,200
So His Majesty has granted her the name, Bai Lu,

271
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,800
and the title of Leader of the Bureau of Astrology."

272
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
The end.

273
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

274
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,000
Long live Your Majesty!

275
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
Sir.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,700
Official Bai Lu, you really made it back.

277
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Good that you're back. There's a lot of work for you.

278
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,300
You are officially the head of the Horoscope Department.

279
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,400
Go and compile the calendar with the others.

280
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,800
Sir, the reason I was able to come back is...

281
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,900
that I accepted the task of determining the auspicious location for the Ceremony of Stars.

282
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Nonsense!

283
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,500
What made you think you could do the job?

284
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,300
Divining an auspicious site has always been tricky.

285
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,600
If even the slightest mishap happened during the ceremony,

286
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,300
not only the astrologer who divined the details would be held responsible,

287
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,000
the whole Bureau of Astrology would be implicated too.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Even if you accepted it, the bureau

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
wouldn't simply entrust the task to you.

290
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
Director Guan,

291
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
the fact is that His Majesty gave her the task.

292
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,900
Not letting her do it is going against the royal decree.

293
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not that I'm not letting her. This is clearly over her head.

294
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
She's only dragging the whole bureau down with her.

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,400
I haven't even tried. What makes you think I'm incapable?

296
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,800
Besides, if you guys had done a better job divining,

297
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,900
His Majesty wouldn't need to give the job to me.

298
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,200
Leader Bai, please mind your words.

299
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
This task has always been handled by Supervisor Jie.

300
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,800
You're disrespecting your superior.

301
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,600
Don't take it wrongly, sir. I didn't mean it like that.

302
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,400
It's not like I wanted to do it.

303
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,100
But if I didn't accept, I wouldn't be able to return.

304
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,800
How many days did His Majesty give you?

305
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Ten days.

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,100
That won't do.

307
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,300
I'm going to talk to His Majesty and turn down the task.

308
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,800
If you're arrested for deceiving the emperor,

309
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,600
it will be game over.

310
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,200
Sir!

311
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
Just let me divine it.

312
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,200
If I manage to find the answer,

313
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,800
I'll be able to formally stay here.

314
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Supervisor Jie, divining the auspicious site for the Ceremony of Stars

315
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,000
is the order Leader Bai received from His Majesty himself.

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It won't be easy to say no.

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
If she can't come up with the answer,

318
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,600
she will be punished by law.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,800
If that's the case, I suppose it's up to your luck

320
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,600
whether or not you succeed.

321
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
Got it. Thank you, sir.

322
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,500
I heard that Your Majesty made Ye Lingshuang an official in the Bureau of Astrology.

323
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,800
I can tell she is talented.

324
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,600
So I'm letting her work at the Bureau of Astrology.

325
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,300
I know you are not prejudiced against women taking on official roles.

326
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,400
It's just that I'm appalled by Jie Haitian's recklessness.

327
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Supervisor Jie has angered you again and again.

328
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,700
But you're still showing him leniency.

329
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,300
I only hope that he'll realize

330
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,400
the graciousness you're showing him.

331
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Bai Lu.

332
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,700
- Director Di.
- Where are you going?

333
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,400
Aren't you supposed to divine the auspicious site for the Ceremony of Stars?

334
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
Other matters should not be a priority.

335
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,700
Not a priority?

336
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,200
If I don't make her come with me now,

337
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,500
who knows when she'd be taken by His Majesty again? What should I do then?

338
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,600
Director Cheng.

339
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,300
I just thought of a magic array.

340
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,600
It can help you save resources

341
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,200
as well as raise the wind.

342
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,800
Do you want to see it?

343
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
- Let's go.
- We'll be off.

344
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Director Cheng! Cheng Wu!

345
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Director Di, why do you think His Majesty suddenly entrusted Bai Lu

346
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,600
with the task of determining the auspicious site?

347
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I don't think she'll be able to find the answer.

348
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
Supervisor Jie himself wasn't confident.

349
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,000
How could she be capable of such an important task?

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
I didn't mean that.

351
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I...

352
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,400
I mean, could His Majesty be unhappy

353
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,800
because Supervisor Jie took his time to give him an answer?

354
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
Director Guan.

355
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
If you have any questions,

356
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
you could write a memorial and ask His Majesty.

357
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
It's a lack of decorum to talk behind his back.

358
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,000
Your advice is sound, Director Di.

359
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Why are you running about aimlessly out there?

360
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,600
Aren't you supposed to be divining the auspicious site?

361
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,400
You... You have no conscience.

362
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,600
If I wasn't busy looking for artifacts for you,

363
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,900
I wouldn't be running about like this.

364
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,800
Don't you know you only have 10 days to live?

365
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,300
Today is almost over. You only have nine days, you hear me?

366
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Are you worried about me?

367
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,600
No, I'm not.

368
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,400
I need quite some time to coalesce my body.

369
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,500
If you die, what's the use of an artifact?

370
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,400
Still, show me what you've got.

371
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,800
Here.

372
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,800
A Wave-Cutting Cup.

373
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,200
This is a Sky Ruler.

374
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Just two items?

375
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,000
I really doubt you'd be able

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
to collect everything before you die.

377
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,400
I've got it.

378
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,500
Are you trying to get me to divine the auspicious site?

379
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,800
Come on. Beg me.

380
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Beg me and I might be willing to help.

381
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Are you crazy?

382
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,600
Why would I rely on you?

383
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,800
Listen up. You better not regret it.

384
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,600
You'll never be able to divine it without my help.

385
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm not going to beg you.

386
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,600
Think about it.

387
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,200
If Supervisor Jie could do it, he would've.

388
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,800
The job wouldn't end up in my hands.

389
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,600
I didn't expect you to be scheming.

390
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
Perhaps there's something else I don't know.

391
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,600
I need to feel His Majesty out.

392
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,000
Mr. Fan.

393
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Sit.

394
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,799
Sir, here's the thing.

395
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,400
You told me to report to you if I discover

396
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,600
something out of the ordinary at the Bureau of Astrology.

397
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
[Fan Yu, Steward of the Fan Residence]

398
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,100
But I haven't seen you for some time.

399
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,400
Are you blaming me?

400
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,600
No, not at all. I wouldn't dare.

401
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,300
I came today to inform you

402
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,100
that the Bureau of Astrology just hired a female official.

403
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,000
She's well-liked by Jie Haitian.

404
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,200
Even the task of divining the auspicious site was given to her.

405
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,000
My position in the bureau is in jeopardy.

406
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
Unexpectedly, there is still this matter?

407
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I will report it to Official Fan.

408
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,800
Yes, I understand, sir.

409
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Your Majesty.

410
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,500
Grand Chancellor Fan Ruhui seeks your audience.

411
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,000
What is it?

412
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,500
The imperial edict to nominate the protectorate governor for the ceremony has been drafted.

413
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Please take a look.

414
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,200
Such a menial task.

415
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,500
Did an important official like you have to do it yourself?

416
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,400
I do have other things to take care of

417
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,100
that I'd like Your Majesty's opinion on.

418
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,400
Go on.

419
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,800
The venue for the ceremony has yet to be decided.

420
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,400
Was Your Majesty informed about it?

421
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,000
So what if I know or not?

422
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,800
Supervisor Jie is temperamental.

423
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,800
He openly argued with Your Majesty in court.

424
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,600
And yet you did not punish him.

425
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,400
I worry that he's trying

426
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,800
to use the auspicious site selection to exhort Your Majesty.

427
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,600
If the Ceremony of Stars cannot take place on time,

428
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,800
it will look bad on Your Majesty's prestige.

429
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
In your opinion, how should I deal with him?

430
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,800
Why not have a private talk with Supervisor Jie?

431
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,200
Ask him to provide the auspicious site as soon as possible.

432
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,600
How thoughtful of you.

433
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
What about this?

434
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,800
You can ask him for me.

435
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

436
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
Your Majesty,

437
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,800
I've heard some rumors lately.

438
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,800
It's also related to him.

439
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,400
What rumors?

440
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,000
I heard the Bureau of Astrology hired a female official.

441
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,700
I was the one who sent her to work there.

442
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,300
Anything the matter?

443
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,000
Your giving her a job is your benevolence.

444
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,200
But I heard that Supervisor Jie

445
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
asked her to divine the auspicious site for the ceremony.

446
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,800
I gave her the order.

447
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,400
If she can't do it, she'll be beheaded.

448
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Then, are you hoping she'll find the answer or not?

449
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
Whether she can or not

450
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,900
doesn't concern me, does it?

451
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,700
That's true.

452
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,800
Good or bad, it is all by the emperor's grace.

453
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll take my leave.

454
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
Supervisor, these options for the site

455
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
are all great spots filled with spiritual aura.

456
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,800
Even if there are flaws,

457
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,200
they can be fixed by changing up the terrain.

458
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,000
So why did you refuse to submit the list to His Majesty?

459
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
You're right.

460
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,600
But the Ceremony of Stars

461
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,200
is the inaugural grand ceremony marking our nation's birth.

462
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
It has to be perfect.

463
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,939
Supervisor Jie, Chancellor Fan seeks an audience.

464
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Show him in.

465
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
Yes, sir.

466
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Go wait outside.

467
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,300
All right.

468
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,700
Brother Jie.

469
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm surprised a busy man like you has time to visit.

470
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
I was passing by

471
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,600
and remembered I needed to discuss something with you.

472
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
I see. Come this way.

473
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,400
How is the selection of the ceremony venue going?

474
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Demolishing and leveling are tricky work.

475
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,600
His Majesty is breathing down our necks.

476
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,000
Once you decide on the site,

477
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I can then start preparations.

478
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,500
The area around Tianqi isn't suitable.

479
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,600
So we have to leave Tianqi?

480
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,400
That won't do.

481
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,800
His Majesty and the entourage visiting the provinces.

482
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,500
The expenses required for food and accommodation will be staggering.

483
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,300
Not to mention, it's a security nightmare.

484
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,500
I've already divined a few locations that are suitable for the ceremony.

485
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,800
But looking at them more closely,

486
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,000
they are not in line with the constellations.

487
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Brother Jie, you're being too pedantic.

488
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,000
You can just submit a site that ticks most of the boxes.

489
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,700
His Majesty is anxious to hold the ceremony.

490
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,000
And you're putting him in a tough spot.

491
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,500
Perhaps my skills are inadequate.

492
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,200
The galaxy's messages are complicated.

493
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm unable to decipher them.

494
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,000
I knew it.

495
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,800
His Majesty's plan to nominate the protectorate governor wouldn't slip past you.

496
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,400
But this time, His Majesty is determined to take back military power.

497
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,500
The last time you openly crossed His Majesty, he was already annoyed.

498
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,800
How many more times do you think His Majesty will let it slide?

499
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Brother Jie, I'm reminding you out of goodwill.

500
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Whether you take it or not is up to you.

501
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,400
See you around, Brother Jie.

502
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,500
So Supervisor Jie didn't submit the auspicious site

503
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,900
because he doesn't want to give up military power.

504
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,800
Long live Your Majesty.

505
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,700
What is it?

506
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Your Majesty,

507
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,600
when I was delivering the Yin-Yang Calendar to the harem last month,

508
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
I happened to overhear the consorts complaining

509
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,800
about your reluctance to visit the harem.

510
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Hence I decided to give you a copy, too.

511
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,400
This way, you'd know when the best time is

512
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,300
to pay a visit to the harem.

513
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
You sure seem very free.

514
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,000
Have you finished the job I gave you?

515
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,200
Your Majesty, I've picked out several auspicious sites.

516
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,600
But Supervisor Jie hasn't approved it.

517
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,900
Meaning it hasn't been determined.

518
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,500
Rest assured, Your Majesty. I will work overtime if I have to and pour all my energy

519
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,100
into giving Your Majesty a satisfactory answer.

520
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Judging by how you had the time to come here,

521
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,800
I doubt you've been working tirelessly.

522
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,000
Do you still want this head of yours?

523
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,600
I understand that my head

524
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,100
is only temporarily kept attached.

525
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,600
Supervisor Jie is worried that you might take back military power.

526
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,800
Asking me to pick the auspicious site was an impossible task, to begin with.

527
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,400
When you wish to behead me is nothing more than an order.

528
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Taking back military power?

529
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
How did you know about it?

530
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Chancellor Fan came to see Supervisor Jie the other day.

531
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,100
I overheard their conversation.

532
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,200
What else did they say?

533
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,000
You haven't worked for Jie Haitian for long.

534
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,600
But you're quite loyal to him.

535
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,500
Whether you actually said it or not, you're basically implying

536
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,300
that Fan Ruhui instigated Jie Haitian

537
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,600
to stand up against me.

538
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,700
I wouldn't dare.

539
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,300
Who is Jie Haitian?

540
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,300
While I was still a defeated commander,

541
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,900
he had tens of thousands of men under him.

542
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,000
Could it be that he stood up to me

543
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
after hearing what Fan Ruhui had to say?

544
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,400
It's not the first time

545
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,500
he's tried to plug the holes for me.

546
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,800
You think I don't know it?

547
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Don't try to be smart.

548
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,600
It's better to keep that head on your shoulders first.

549
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,000
Understood.

550
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Now get lost.

551
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

552
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Supervisor Jie is unwilling to give up his military power.

553
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,100
Naturally, he won't accept the auspicious site I pick out.

554
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,600
Looks like I can't rely only on calculations.

555
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,300
I have to think of some other way.

556
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:28,400
Father, why did you want to see me?

557
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,600
I want you to do something for me. Make sure you do a good job.

558
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Tell me, Father.

559
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,400
I will do my best.

560
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Go and find out more about the new official at the Bureau of Astrology called Bai Lu.

561
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,600
[Fan Zheng, second son of the Fan family]

562
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Find out what exactly His Majesty wants her to do.

563
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,100
I thought it was something important. This is just troublesome work.

564
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,800
What could a woman from the Imperial Office of Music do?

565
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,700
Yes, Father. I will get it done.

566
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,600
Hold on.

567
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,500
Anything else, Father?

568
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,900
Keep it quiet.

569
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,900
You can count on me.

570
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,900
Beautiful.

571
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,100
Thank you for the hospitality,

572
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,000
Princess Rui and Miss Ye. If you ever visit Tianqi,

573
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,400
come look for me at the Moon Tower.

574
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,900
Yi Wuyou, if possible,

575
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,800
I'd like you to take A'Rui away.

576
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Take A'Rui.

577
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,400
No.

578
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,100
Now!

579
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,000
I finally divined the location of the Mirror of Youth.

580
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You can answer to Supervisor Jie now.

581
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,300
So why are you still so down and out?

582
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,100
Why is the Mirror of Youth in the Sea of Bitterness?

583
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,800
Could something have happened to A'Rui?

584
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,000
I don't know.

585
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,600
Perhaps it was lost when they were on the run.

586
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Who knows?

587
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,800
You should worry about your own life first.

588
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Forget the auspicious site for now.

589
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,800
I have to go outside the palace tomorrow.

590
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,350
[Moon Tower]

591
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
[Moon Tower]
Please step inside, sir.

592
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,700
This way.

593
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,800
This is the Moon Tower that Yi Wuyou mentioned before.

594
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,100
Miss.

595
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,000
Is Young Master Yi here?

596
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Young Master Yi is no longer in Tianqi.

597
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,900
He sold the business to our current boss.

598
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,000
Then, do you know where he is now?

599
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,900
I don't know.

600
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,000
- This way, please.
- Okay.

601
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,075
[Out to procure goods]

602
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,600
Duanmu Yan.

603
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,400
Here.

604
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,000
Where is Bai Lu?

605
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Director Di, Bai Lu said she would be out to deal with something important.

606
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Don't worry, Director Di.

607
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,700
She's given me instructions on the tasks of the Horoscope Department today.

608
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,900
- I will get it done.
- Something important?

609
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,000
Nothing is more important than picking the auspicious site.

610
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,400
She should be going over the maps,

611
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,800
not running about outside.

612
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,200
Get her to come back immediately.

613
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes, sir. I will pass on the message.

614
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But I don't think she'll be back today.

615
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,400
Unbelievable.

616
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,700
Supervisor Jie, Bai Lu is totally irresponsible.

617
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,300
His Majesty has ordered her to pick the auspicious site.

618
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
It's a big deal and she's given a great responsibility.

619
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,400
But look at her. She went out as she pleased, leaving the work hanging.

620
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,600
Please rectify the matter, Supervisor.

621
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,400
How do you propose it be rectified?

622
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,000
If she doesn't return before we get off work today,

623
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
she must be put in her place sternly.

624
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,100
I'll let you handle it then.

625
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,700
Yes, Supervisor.

626
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
Why exactly did you come outside?

627
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,600
It's not to have fun, right?

628
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
What do you know?

629
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,300
The Moon Tower is very popular among officials and nobles.

630
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,600
Hence there's a lot you can find out in this place.

631
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,800
So you're here to get intel.

632
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,900
Did you guys hear about the Ceremony of Stars needing an auspicious site?

633
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,200
Of course. Once the auspicious site is picked,

634
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
there will be a demolition, won't there?

635
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
What a bother.

636
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,000
But this matter is unrelated to us.

637
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They won't be demolishing anything of ours.

638
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,700
- That's right.
- Yeah.

639
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,400
But someone is going to suffer, that's for sure.

640
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,800
Suffer?

641
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,400
So this is how the people of Tianqi perceive the auspicious site.

642
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,400
Miss Hejin, someone is here for Young Master.

643
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,600
Who is it?

644
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
A young woman.

645
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,100
Is there something wrong?

646
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,600
Young Master got exposed in Yebei.

647
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,400
It might have alerted the one in the palace.

648
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,200
Before Young Master returns, we have to keep our identities hidden.

649
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,000
The woman ordered food and she is watching the musical performance now.

650
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
Should I send her away?

651
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,900
No. I'll go take a look.

652
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,600
That's her.

653
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,200
Miss Ye?

654
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,300
Official Di.

655
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,500
I'll get to work then.

656
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
Dayuangu,

657
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
this is the medicinal herb I picked from the valley.

658
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,600
Try it. It might help.

659
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,200
Never mind.

660
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,700
Nothing is going to work.

661
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,200
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

662
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,600
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

663
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,400
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

664
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,200
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

665
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,600
♫ The stars as the inkstone ♫

666
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,600
♫ Writing with the light of the sea ♫

667
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,700
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

668
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,200
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

669
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,400
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

670
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,000
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

671
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,600
♫ Void of someone ♫

672
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,800
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

673
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,800
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

674
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,000
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

675
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,600
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

676
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,900
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

677
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,400
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

678
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,780
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

679
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:20,000
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

680
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

681
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,400
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

682
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,000
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

683
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

684
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,600
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

685
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,000
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

686
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,600
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

687
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:11,400
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
