[Episode 15]

15
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,720
Your Highness, Official Bai has arrived.

16
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,170
Your Highness.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,730
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,650
Bai Lu.

19
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,360
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,020
How's His Majesty? Is he doing better now?

21
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,420
His Majesty is much calmer now.

22
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,110
But he still needs to recuperate.

23
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,910
Your Highness, please keep an eye on His Majesty.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,830
Bai Lu.

25
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,570
Do you admit your crime?

26
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,280
Your Highness, I've told you before.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,320
There's nothing between us.

28
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,700
Your Highness, think about this.

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,770
If I truly colluded with the Winged Clan,

30
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,110
I could've ignored you when you were suffering from Lunar Erosion.

31
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,120
However, I do have a question.

32
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,930
Your Highness, do you know that person?

33
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,020
What do you mean by that?

34
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,350
If there's nothing else,

35
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,520
I will return to my cell first.

36
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,720
His Majesty's condition is getting worse.

37
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,990
You don't need to return to your cell.

38
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,390
You shall be detained in the palace.

39
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,560
Guard, escort Bai Lu to the side palace.

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,710
Yes, Your Highness.

41
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,990
Official Bai, please.

42
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,360
Your Majesty, do you feel better now?

43
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,340
About the incident with Bai Lu,

44
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,200
tell me in detail again.

45
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,080
That day, I was idling around in Zhuhuan Palace.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,270
Great Steward Fan suddenly came to me and said that his informant sent him a report.

47
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,850
At that moment,

48
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,350
someone was secretly meeting Bai Lu in the Bureau of Astrology.

49
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,910
I didn't believe him at first.

50
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,020
However, he guaranteed it with his life.

51
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,780
Thus, I went to check it out.

52
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,290
In the end, I saw someone leaving Bai Lu's room.

53
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,410
It was Fan Ruhui indeed.

54
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,740
Your Majesty, do you think that Great Steward Fan was behind this?

55
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,090
However, no matter what he did,

56
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,950
it was true that Bai Lu was meeting the Winged Ones in secret.

57
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,600
She cannot put the blame on others.

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,420
I just wish to know the truth.

59
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,510
I don't want to be deceived.

60
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,500
Your Majesty,

61
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,600
I think you just can't accept the fact that Bai Lu fell for someone else.

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,070
Are you saying that I'm jealous?

63
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,480
Your Majesty, I dare not predict what's on your mind.

64
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,050
However, I'm a woman.

65
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,160
I can tell.

66
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,820
Tell what?

67
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,600
Your Majesty, I can tell...

68
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,290
that you like Bai Lu.

69
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,840
Enough.

70
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,220
You've crossed the line.

71
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,150
I dare not do so.

72
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,870
Your Majesty, please rest well.

73
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,920
I shall take my leave.

74
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,440
Your Majesty.

75
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,730
What's the matter?

76
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,300
I overheard Fan Zheng's conversation.

77
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,680
Great Steward Fan was definitely the culprit behind the incident with Supervisor Bai.

78
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,200
Your Majesty, slow down.

79
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,520
What?

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,050
Do you think I'm useless now?

81
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,410
I dare not do so. But...

82
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,390
But what?

83
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,340
Your Majesty, this is the wrong path.

84
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,170
Supervisor Bai is over to that side.

85
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,570
You should've told me earlier.

86
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,400
Your Majesty? What are you doing here?

87
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,340
Do you feel better now?

88
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,170
Have you made up your mind or not?

89
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,690
What do you mean?

90
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,820
You should return to your chamber first.

91
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,850
You still haven't recovered from your cold yet.

92
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,000
So, you still care about me?

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,410
You were upright infuriating, did you know that?

94
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,680
I'll still have to infuriate you if you force me to admit that I had an affair with him.

95
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,010
I will drop this matter.

96
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
To be honest,

97
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,690
I know what you had done and what you had not.

98
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,780
I just don't want to be deceived.

99
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,090
I'm glad that you know who was deceiving you.

100
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,260
However, your position as the supervisor is too flashy for some. You should return to being the director.

101
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,213
I'll gladly do so.

102
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,790
On the 23rd of July, Zuo Jintian ordered 30,000 elite troops

103
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,280
to kill the 3,000 vanguard troops of Yuezhou's military camp.

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,120
He didn't allow a single one of them to pass through Xiayang.

105
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,380
23rd of July?

106
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,760
It's the day Your Majesty issued the edict.

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,630
When they just arrived at Xiayang,

108
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,960
in order to survive, Luo Wuyi of the Black Water Tribe

109
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,310
colluded with the Xiayang Army and abducted the people of Yebei

110
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,960
and over half of the Yuezhou Army to Xiayang.

111
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,500
Princess Qingheng and General Jie were captured by Zuo Jintian

112
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,010
when they tried to rescue their clan members in Xiayang.

113
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,780
I didn't expect the fish to fall for the bait so soon.

114
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,660
Is our arrangement ready?

115
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

Marquis Zuo, kneeling when receiving an edict

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Your Majesty.

166
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
Zuo Jintian has sealed off Xiayang.

167
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Zhu Ying and the people of Yebei aren't allowed to pass.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,600
This is a memorial from the General of Vehement Might.

169
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,100
He said Zuo Jintian had killed Zhu Ying and Qihai Lian!

170
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,700
Do you know anything about this?

171
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,800
Your Majesty, I have no idea why Zuo Jintian did that!

172
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
Are you questioning me now?

173
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Zhu Ying is the protectorate general that I had just selected.

174
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,100
Zuo Jintian actually killed him!

175
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,600
Does he even have respect for me?

176
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Is he staging a rebellion?

177
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
The state of Chao was formed less than five years ago.

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And now, my imperial edict is just a piece of empty paper!

179
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
This must never continue.

180
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,000
This case shall be investigated with the utmost seriousness!

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,500
I shall send my men to investigate this case immediately!

182
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,800
When Jie Haitian was beheaded,

183
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,400
I didn't behead Zhu Ying even though he was his son.

184
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,100
Now that Zuo Jintian has committed a serious crime,

185
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,600
I won't implicate you either.

186
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
You better do a good job.

187
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,600
Thank you, Your Majesty!

188
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Scram!

189
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, Your Majesty!

190
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,000
[Fan Residence]

191
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Father-in-law, were you looking for me?

192
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Didn't I instruct you to tell your father

193
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
to stay put and not act recklessly?

194
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Father-in-law, I've written to Father as per your instruction.

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,700
He killed Jie Zhuying.

196
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
What?

197
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
That's impossible.

198
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,300
Not only that,

199
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,100
but Marquis Zuo also cut off the food and water supply of the Yebei tribe.

200
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,000
He's forcing them to consume each other.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm afraid Great Steward can't do anything to plead for him.

202
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,400
It doesn't matter how many people of Yebei die.

203
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,200
However, Jie Zhuying grew up under His Majesty's watch.

204
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,900
According to His Majesty's personality,

205
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,600
even if the people beside him are heinous sinners,

206
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
he's the only one who can execute them.

207
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
No one else is to touch them.

208
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,300
Moreover, His Majesty didn't intend to execute Jie Zhuying.

209
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,600
Zuo Jintian has truly gotten ahead of himself

210
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,200
for the sake of a Yuezhou governor!

211
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,400
Father is definitely not in his right mind.

212
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,100
I shall write to Father again

213
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,000
and tell him to stop this madness.

214
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Father-in-law, please think of a way to save my father!

215
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Please save my father!

216
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,900
Father-in-law!

217
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,300
Tell your father that I can no longer do anything for him.

218
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,900
Tell him to pray for the best.

219
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,100
Fan Yu! Bring me a fire pit!

220
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
You don't need to do it.

221
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
You have more important things to get rid of.

222
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,000
Go now.

223
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,900
Yes, Old Master.

224
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Young Madam, please.

225
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,600
How's the situation with the Fan Family?

226
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
According to the Dark Guards,

227
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
Great Steward Fan has ordered the Bureau of Justice to treat this case seriously.

228
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,100
Judging by the harsh conviction, it's obvious that he's trying

229
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,900
to dissociate his family from them.

230
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,200
Relay my orders to Yu Shining.

231
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Tell them to head to Mount Pixian from Qiuye

232
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,400
and cut off Xiayang's path toward the West and North.

233
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
The marriage alliance between the Zuo and Fan Families has shattered.

234
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,000
Since Zuo Jintian likes Xiayang that much,

235
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
he can stay in Xiayang.

236
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,400
He will never be able to come back.

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
[Jianyue Pavilion]

238
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Second Young Master, please take care.

239
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,700
Okay.

240
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
Brother?

241
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,000
Brother Ping, I haven't congratulated you yet.

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
Why should you congratulate me?

243
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,300
The wife you never fancied is finally dead.

244
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
Now, you can marry another woman.

245
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Isn't it worth celebrating?

246
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,100
What did you say? What happened to Shengnan?

247
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,400
Stop pretending. Everyone in Tianqi knows

248
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,300
that Zuo Jintian rejected the imperial decree and killed an envoy.

249
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,600
As the son-in-law of the Zuo Family, how could you have no idea?

250
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Zuo Shengnan has committed suicide.

251
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,200
Young Master!

252
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
How did that happen?

253
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
She's still so young.

254
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
First Young Master.

255
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,400
- First Young Master, you shouldn't go in!
- Let go of me!

256
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
First Young Master! You mustn't go in!

257
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,900
Old Master said that she's no longer part of the Fan Family.

258
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,600
She has nothing to do with you now, First Young Master.

259
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,100
What?

260
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,800
First Young Master, this is a letter from Madam.

261
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
To my husband.

262
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,400
It is as if we just met yesterday.

263
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
To you, our marriage

264
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,800
is just an order you need to comply with

265
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,500
for the sake of your family.

266
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,300
However, that isn't the case with me.

267
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm lucky that I can get married to the person I love.

268
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,200
Dear, please take care.

269
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Do not miss me.

270
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
I have no regrets.

271
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Farewell.

272
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
First Young Master!

273
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
First Young Master!

274
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,100
First Young Master! You...

275
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,300
Do you need anything?

276
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,400
Shengnan is dead.

277
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,700
Does that mean nothing to you?

278
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,800
It was my fault for arranging this marriage for you.

279
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,300
Now that she has committed suicide,

280
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,800
I will find you a better wife.

281
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,400
Committed suicide?

282
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,700
I don't even need to ask! You guys killed her!

283
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,200
You're overthinking it.

284
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
Zuo Jintian implicated his family by attempting a rebellion.

285
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,400
As the daughter of the Zuo Family, it's natural for her to commit suicide to escape from her crime.

286
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
I knew you two weren't close to each other.

287
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Zuo Shengnan was an arrogant broad who didn't fulfill her duty as your wife.

288
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,200
I know you've suffered.

289
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
That's enough!

290
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
I admit I didn't have any feelings for Shengnan.

291
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,900
However, she's filial to Grandmother and you.

292
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,000
She has been taking good care of the family ever since I married her.

293
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
I saw that for myself!

294
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
I let her down.

295
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,500
But she didn't let the Fan Family down!

296
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,200
Father, not only did you force her to commit suicide,

297
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,100
but you're also putting the blame on her!

298
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,300
You also watched over her as she grew up!

299
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,400
How could you do this?

300
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,500
I know she's the daughter of Zuo Jintian.

301
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
But she's also a living human!

302
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,200
Shut up!

303
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
He's a rebel.

304
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
His Majesty will doubt us

305
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,100
if we keep the daughter of a rebel around!

306
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,200
This concerns the survival of the Fan Family.

307
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,100
How could we disregard the bigger picture for a mere broad like her?

308
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,900
You're hopeless.

309
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,400
I hate that I was born into this family.

310
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Ping'er? Ping...

311
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,100
Brother Gu, have some tea.

312
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,500
Thank you.

313
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,400
Miss Ye, here's a letter for you.

314
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,800
Is this from Jianyue Pavilion?

315
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
You could tell?

316
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,300
Only Yi Wuyou would use a flower as his wax seal.

317
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,600
"Regarding the seal,

318
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,800
Zhuohua is your best bet.

319
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,300
You only have three days.

320
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Do not make others worried about you."

321
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,000
What does he mean by that?

322
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,000
There was a legendary date at Zhuohua Creek

323
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,600
that was stated in an ancient poem.

324
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,800
It's from the 4th to the 6th of May.

325
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,700
"Zhuohua is your best bet" might refer to the fact

326
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,600
that between the 4th and 6th of May, the place might be brimming with celestial power.

327
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
4th of May?

328
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,700
Brother Gu, please tell him

329
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,300
that I'll think of a way to crack the seal

330
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,000
on the 4th of May at all costs.

331
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Also, tell him that the Dark Guards are still searching for him.

332
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,800
Tell him to be careful.

333
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,600
Dark Guards?

334
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,400
It's nothing. Just tell him that.

335
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,700
Understood. Farewell.

336
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,600
Thank you, Brother Gu.

337
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
4th of May?

338
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,000
Why are you burning it?

339
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,300
I have to burn it now that I've read it and memorized it.

340
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,900
I have to find a way

341
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,600
to keep myself hidden for three days.

342
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,700
You can say that you're sick to avoid the morning court.

343
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,300
But no one can stop Yu Xiuming if he wants to see you.

344
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,400
[Tianqi City]

345
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I realize that you're getting ahead of yourself here.

346
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,700
You skip court whenever you like.

347
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,400
Are you up to something again?

348
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Your Majesty,

349
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I asked for a sick leave as I was too busy with work.

350
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,300
Anyway, Director Duanwu attends every court session.

351
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,800
Your Majesty, you can ask him if you have any questions.

352
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,100
That's too bad.

353
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,200
Duanmu Yan has been imprisoned and will be executed soon.

354
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,000
What did he do?

355
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
He dared talk back to me in public when I instructed him

356
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
to pick an auspicious date for my tour of inspection.

357
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,000
He's too much!

358
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,300
Am I right?

359
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,400
I'll tell him off when I get back.

360
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

361
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
I beg you to forgive Duanmu Yan.

362
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,900
Can you spare him from execution

363
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,000
so that he can return to the Bureau of Astrology and atone for his crime?

364
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,700
So, you want me to forgive Duanmu Yan?

365
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,400
That's right.

366
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,000
But without him,

367
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,600
you'll be in charge of the Bureau of Astrology.

368
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,500
I'm still in charge even when he's around.

369
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,700
But think about it.

370
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,400
The Bureau of Astrology has plenty of affairs to handle.

371
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
I can't handle all of them myself.

372
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,800
And now, Duanmu Yan's life is on the line here.

373
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,900
If you spare him right now, he'll definitely be grateful to you.

374
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,400
If you let him take care of the bureau,

375
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,000
he'll definitely do everything he can to repay your kindness.

376
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,600
Enough.

377
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
You should stop your shenanigans.

378
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,600
I know you want to slack off.

379
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,900
I'll agree to your request.

380
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Ling Yun, release Duanmu Yan.

381
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

383
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,600
However, you have to promise me one thing.

384
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
Please tell me.

385
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,400
My tour of inspection mustn't be delayed any longer.

386
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Hurry and find an auspicious date for me to go on my tour of inspection.

387
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Your Majesty, your might surpasses the heavens.

388
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,600
Every day is an auspicious date for you.

389
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,100
If you insist on picking a date, please give me three days.

390
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,700
I'll make sure to pick an exceptionally auspicious date

391
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,000
for you in the next three days, Your Majesty.

392
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,500
Okay.

393
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll allow you to meditate in seclusion for three days.

394
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
Director Bai.

395
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,900
- What are you doing?
- Director Bai, you're my savior.

396
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,800
I can never repay your kindness.

397
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,900
Director Duanmu, please get up.

398
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,800
You should thank His Majesty for his grace.

399
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
In the future, you should do your best to serve him.

400
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
That's right.

401
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,300
Director Bai, I'll obey your every command.

402
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,800
This isn't a command. You've been reinstated.

403
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
You're still in charge of the bureau.

404
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,800
No. You're in charge of the bureau.

405
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,400
No. You should stop declining.

406
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,700
His Majesty has ordered me to pick an auspicious date for his trip.

407
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,800
I have to focus on the task at hand.

408
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,000
Director Bai, since you trust me so much,

409
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,500
- I shall do my best to manage the bureau for you.
- You're too courteous.

410
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,700
By the way, the beginning is always the hardest.

411
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,200
Tomorrow's the 4th of May.

412
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,400
I've decided to meditate in seclusion for three days.

413
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,800
Director Duanmu, do not let anyone disturb me during my meditation. Okay?

414
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,200
Don't worry, Official Bai. I will definitely not let anyone disturb you during your meditation.

415
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,900
Thank you.

416
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,400
Cheng Wu, guard the door for me.

417
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
All right!

418
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
- You can resume your work.
- Okay.

419
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,200
[Silence]

420
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,300
You are about to crack the seal now.

421
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,300
Don't you think it's strange that Yu Xiuming is allowing you to go on a retreat now?

422
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,000
What if he looks for you suddenly and finds out that you're trying to crack the seal?

423
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,100
That's unlikely.

424
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,600
He already saw me yesterday.

425
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,900
It's hard to say.

426
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,400
You jinx, can't you say something nice for once?

427
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
- I'm perplexed.
- Goodness.

428
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
You left Duanmu Yan to be in charge of the bureau.

429
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,300
He's as dumb as a brick. Can he really handle it?

430
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,400
Everyone is as dumb as a brick in your eyes.

431
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,600
However, I've saved his life after all.

432
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,500
He needs to do his best

433
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,600
to fulfill the first task I assigned to him even at the cost of his life. Right?

434
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,100
You see,

435
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,600
he might not fulfill it even at the cost of his life.

436
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
I don't care.

437
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Anyway, recovering my celestial power is my number one priority.

438
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
I have to go no matter the risk.

439
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,900
Moreover, I'll only stand a chance to locate A'Rui

440
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,700
after I crack the seal.

441
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,400
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

442
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
You may rise.

443
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,600
Under the mandate of the heavens,

444
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
I was tasked to conquer the nine states.

445
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,200
The vastness of the land of Chao is unprecedented.

446
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,800
However, due to the vastness of the land, some people think

447
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,000
that they can do whatever they want

448
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,400
as they're out of my reach.

449
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Therefore, I've decided to go on a tour of inspection

450
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,600
and observe the life of the people.

451
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,400
I will keep this trip simple.

452
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,800
My loyal subjects, you all may start preparing for it.

453
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
Great Steward.

454
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,400
Your Majesty, your words are justice itself.

455
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
We dare not object to it.

456
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,700
However, leaving the throne is a huge deal.

457
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,800
Your Majesty, you must think twice.

458
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Usually, you guys think

459
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,400
that I'm extravagant in my spending.

460
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,100
But now, when I plan to keep things simple,

461
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,800
you guys think that I'm being sloppy.

462
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,800
I've already instructed the Bureau of Astrology to pick an auspicious date for me.

463
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,400
I will depart once I'm done

464
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,100
worshiping the great mountains and vast sea.

465
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,990
As the Grand Councilor, you should focus on the bigger picture.

466
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,660
You should stop thinking that my trip will cause you trouble.

467
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,600
Think about it.

468
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,550
Zuo Jintian was just a lowly military commissioner.

469
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,550
Moreover, he has served me for so many years.

470
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,530
Even so, his audacity knows no bounds, let alone the others.

471
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,710
Your Majesty, I wasn't thinking straight.

472
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,550
I failed to see the bigger picture.

473
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,350
I shall do my best to prepare for your trip.

474
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,030
However, Your Majesty isn't going on a trip incognito.

475
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,470
We shouldn't be too casual with the ceremonies.

476
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,810
It takes at least three months to prepare everything.

477
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,790
You only have two months.

478
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,520
I will depart once Bai Lu picks an auspicious date for me.

479
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,620
You may leave.

480
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

481
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,634
[Taoyuan Valley, Wanzhou]

482
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,620
Is anyone there?

483
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,180
Who are you?

484
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,660
Hello, Miss.

485
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,310
Taoyuan Valley doesn't welcome outsiders.

486
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,700
Outsider, you should leave.

487
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,040
Miss, I'm Yi Wuyou.

488
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,390
I come here in peace.

489
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,600
Rumor has it that the Heluo people of Taoyuan Valley are excellent weaponsmiths.

490
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,940
However, herbs are rare in this part of the world as it's a remote place.

491
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,560
Therefore, the Heluo people here

492
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,770
often die of common illnesses.

493
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,860
I'm willing to gather herbs for you all.

494
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,900
In exchange, I want you guys to keep an eye out for Starstone.

495
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,950
Has Bai Lu done anything in the past few days?

496
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,190
She has done nothing special.

497
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,560
But she inquired about Zuo Jintian from the officials of Great Steward's Residence yesterday

498
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,610
She might have found out about Qihai Lian's demise.

499
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,090
Your Majesty, should I tell Director Bai

500
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,910
that you've arranged for someone to save them?

501
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,350
That's unnecessary.

502
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:04,180
Bai Lu will find out the truth when I'm done with Zuo Jintian.

503
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

504
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,900
If only time could stay still.

505
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,000
If only this moment could last forever.

506
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,970
I hope so, too.

507
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,860
- However...
- I know.

508
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,670
We can't just live for ourselves.

509
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,330
Qingheng,

510
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,660
have you truly made up your mind this time?

511
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,250
The Yebei Clan would've been eradicated

512
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,460
if His Majesty wasn't prepared to save us this time.

513
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,560
I endured many hardships to bring them here

514
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,730
so that they could live to see a brighter day.

515
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,500
Let's head to Yuezhou once the incident with Zuo Jintian is over.

516
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,180
Your Majesty, we're almost ready for the tour of inspection.

517
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,320
We just need an auspicious date now.

518
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,450
You should stop worrying.

519
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,810
Your Majesty, you seem done with this game.

520
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,500
Why don't I tell the servants to put them away?

521
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,660
You shouldn't be nosy when it's none of your business.

522
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,470
Why hasn't Bai Lu come to report for duty yet?

523
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,520
You mustn't be bewitched by those illusions.

524
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,970
If not, you'll never wake up.

525
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,910
Miss.

526
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:54,290
Most humans would rather live in fantasies

527
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,100
than face reality.

528
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,670
Ye, there's someone over there!

529
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,400
♫ The top of the mountains where the snow never melts ♫

530
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,750
♫ The plains where the wind blows ♫

531
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:07,650
♫ What finds me in my sleep are the nightmares about you ♫

532
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,317
♫ The beacons that light up the entire night sky ♫

533
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:14,967
♫ Are nothing compared to you who is ever so glorious ♫

534
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,900
♫ Behind the cold stars is the passion I never imagined ♫

535
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,100
♫ Who risked his life for mine? ♫
[Jianyue Pavilion]

536
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:33,380
♫ I had braced myself for the end, but my heart frets for you ♫

537
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,020
Wuyou!

538
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:45,000
♫ It turns out there is an end to my waiting for you ♫

539
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:47,660
♫ At the hills where the grasslands end where ♫

540
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,167
Sister?

541
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:53,177
♫ ...where it will always be spring ♫

542
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,400
♫ I find the boundless river of stars in your eyes ♫

543
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,800
♫ Only with your hand in mine is this life worthwhile ♫

544
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,290
Bai Lu!

545
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,100
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

546
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,520
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

547
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,420
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

548
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:01,280
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

549
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,640
♫ The stars as the inkstone ♫

550
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,720
♫ Writing with the light of the sea ♫

551
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,640
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

552
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,060
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

553
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,460
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

554
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,960
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

555
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,400
♫ Void of someone ♫

556
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,680
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

557
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,800
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

558
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,960
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

559
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,520
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

560
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,900
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

561
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:00,480
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

562
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,791
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

563
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:13,071
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

564
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:16,300
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

565
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,307
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

566
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:26,120
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

567
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,200
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

568
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,820
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

569
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,240
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

570
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,680
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

571
00:44:53,700 --> 00:45:02,940
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
