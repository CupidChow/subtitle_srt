[Episode 3]

15
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,410
Father, a report from the scouts!

16
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,510
Our troops reached the Qiulan Sea before the Chao Army.

17
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,979
Once they arrive, we will strike and take them by surprise

18
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,960
and wipe them out in one fell swoop.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,080
- Chu Ye.
- Here.

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,710
Relay this to the Qihai Tribe.

21
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,510
Everyone over the age of 16 is to set out at once.

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,540
Live or die. It all comes down to this.

23
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,300
- Yes!
- Yes!

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,630
The men of Yebei should wield the fastest swords and drink the strongest liquor!

25
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,610
We've wiped out Chao's Lanyi Army.

26
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,029
Now is the time to follow up our triumphant pursuit and seize Chao once and for all!

27
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:35,140
The seven tribes of Yebei shall fight until the end!

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,260
- Fight until the end!
- Fight until the end!

29
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,510
- May heaven bless Yebei!
- May heaven bless Yebei!

30
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,860
That is the man we will slay today!

31
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,450
Warriors of Yebei, charge!

32
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,730
Kill!

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,680
Advance, vanguards, and support the left and right wings.

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,100
Vanguards, advance!

35
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,730
Kill!

36
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,330
The momentum and morale of the Yebei Army are high.

37
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,839
If we cannot take Qihai Zhenyu's life at the start of the battle, we will suffer greater casualties.

38
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,720
Ling Yun, bring me my horse.

39
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,910
So it is you.

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,510

Dayuangu!

The Duanyue Blade is one of the most powerful weapons in the world.

45
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,190
But Yu Xiuming is unscathed.

46
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,830
No… Something is strange.

47
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,280
All right. I will cast the Hengchen Skyfire Spell.

48
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,330

49
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,470

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,810
Go!

51
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,950
No one in this world can escape the Hengchen Skyfire Spell.

52
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,980
Chao will fall!

53

- Zhuying.
- Your Majesty.

54
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,440
The war is over. I shall be returning to Tianqi.

55
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,930
Put more effort into the search for the Mirror of Youth.

56
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,330
I'll leave Qihai Lian and the tens of thousands of people of Yebei to you.

57
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

58
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,340
But, Your Majesty, what should I do with all these people?

59
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,570
You'll know when the time comes.

60
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,650
Yes.

61
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,470
Prepare the troops. We will depart tomorrow.

62
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,050
Yes.

63
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,560
Your Majesty, there is another matter you need to decide.

64
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,890
How should we deal with the girl in the tent in the back?

65
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,410
Oh, her. Bring her back to Tianqi along with the other female captives.

66
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,660
Why are you so concerned about her?

67
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,910
I overstepped my bounds.

68
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,370
Your Majesty, I think you have one gray hair at your temple…

69
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,440
Bring me a mirror.

70
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,190
Your Majesty has never had a single gray hair before.

71
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,520
Could the power of the Divine Mirror have declined?

72
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,680
Go.

73
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,140
General.

74
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,380
Still no sign of Vice Commander Yan's body?

75
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,090
General, we went back to the battlefield and searched thoroughly.

76
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,350
But we still couldn't find his body.

77
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,610
Xie Yu'an is a loyal and grateful man…

78
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,680
I've been taken captive as a female prisoner.

79
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,360
I need to get myself a new identity

80
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,400
to get out of here and find A'Rui and Yi Wuyou.

81
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,279
I heard that the princess His Majesty chose, Princess Zhuyan, wore a red dress.

82
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,120
A red dress?

83
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,110
Let's see.

84
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,120
This one looks nice. Open it.

85
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,410
- Drag her out.
- Yes.

86
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,010
No! Let me go!

87
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,220
You don't get a say in this.

88
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,690
Let me tell you something.

89
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,700
When we get back to Tianqi,

90
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,680
all of you will be sent to the Imperial Office of Music.

91
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,150
You'll end up as slaves for the rich and noble sooner or later.

92
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,690
Isn't that right, men?

93
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,519
- Yes.
- Don't touch me!

94
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,420
She's shy.

95
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,450
Let me go!

96
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,970
Come here. Give me a kiss.

97
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,639
Get off of her! Get inside.

98
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,300
Another one.

99
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,160
This one isn't bad either.

100
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,050
I'll make do with you first.

101
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,910
I like feisty ones!

102
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,410
Men! Kill her!

103
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,570
Kill this wretched slave!

104
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,590
I hold the bronze seal of Chao! Who dares to lay a hand on me?

105
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,470
Stop! What's all the ruckus here?

106
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,020
What happened?

107
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,879
This wretched slave… She attacked one of our men with the sword when he was distracted!

108
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,140
General, your men tried to force themselves on us under the guise of escorting us.

109
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,280
Is this your army's military discipline?

110
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,860
Is what she said true?

111
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,980
We-We just wanted to have some fun.

112
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,340
Thirty military strikes each.

113
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,890
- Behead him and let this be a warning to all!
- Yes.

114
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,790
General Xie!

115
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,229
We fought courageously in war…

116
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,450
And you would go so far just for these lowly Yebei slaves?

117
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,230
If all of Chao's soldiers were like you lot, there would be no Chao to speak of!

118
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,630
- Make it 40!
- Yes!

119
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,839
I showed the bronze seal to solve what is troubling your mind, General.

120
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,600
Troubling my mind?

121
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,130
I didn't know my mind was troubled.

122
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,030
Vice Commander Yan.

123
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,330
You…

124
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,680
In the final battle against the Lanyi Army,

125
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Vice Commander Yan sacrificed himself to save you.

126
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,779
But until now, you haven't even been able to find his corpse and remains.

127
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,350
Doesn't that bother you, General?

128
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,890
I know where his remains are.

129
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,079
I was born with the gift of prophecy. All of Yebei know that.

130
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,490
That means if even I don't know where he is,

131
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,350
it would be impossible for you to find him.

132
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,020
What do you want?

133
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,140
You are principled indeed, General.

134
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,429
Don't worry. What I want won't be difficult for you.

135
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:13,480
Name it.

136
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
We will reach Tianqi soon.

137
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,829
I heard that the female captives would be sent to the Imperial Office of Music.

138
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,980
So I want you to get me into the Bureau of Astrology.

139
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,830
You know Supervisor Jie?

140
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,010
That's none of your business.

141
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,240
If you don't tell me the truth,

142
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,930
I won't help you.

143
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,040
The Bureau of Astrology is regarded as the most important department of Chao.

144
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,139
And I am gifted in astrology.

145
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,279
So I refuse to be a slave for the rest of my life.

Stop!

148
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,240
What is your name?

149
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,090
Xiao Yu.

150
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,940
Go on.

151
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,840
Next.

152
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,540
How can I help you, General?

153
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,750
The palace wants one of the girls. Make the arrangements accordingly.

154
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,010
Clean her up. I'll bring her to the palace.

155
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,660
May I know who she is for?

156
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,730
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

157
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,510
I apologize.

158
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,790
Which girl do you have in mind, General?

159
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,300
The fourth one from the right.

160
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,650
Her.

161
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,330
Right away.

162
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,150
The fourth girl from the right.

163
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,100
Get her cleaned up as soon as possible. She is to enter the palace with the general.

164
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,810
Understood.

165
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,990
Come out.

166
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,210
Now, I'll have to find a way to join the Bureau of Astrology.

167
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,630
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

168
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,400
Rise.

169
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,600
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

170
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Do you have anything to report?

171
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Well, I have an announcement.

172
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
Seventeen years ago,

173
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,600
I had ambitions to end the war and bring peace to the world.

174
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,000
Now, the world has been unified.

175
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,800
I have achieved what I set out to do.

176
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Great Chao is the largest kingdom to exist.

177
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,800
All five clans have been unified. Such a feat is unprecedented.

178
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,800
The Ceremony of Stars shall be held to reward the meritorious

179
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,000
and proclaim to the world that peace will reign under the rule of Great Chao.

180
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Your Majesty is most right.

181
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,500
A grand ceremony should be held and let this great event that lives on in history.

182
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,000
Your Majesty, the war has just ended.

183
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,100
I believe it would be unwise to hold the ceremony now.

184
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
Why so?

185
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
Your Majesty, according to ancient traditions and customs,

186
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,200
the Ceremony of Stars means the land will be divided and given to ministers.

187
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,600
But if such rites are followed,

188
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,300
concerns and troubles might arise.

189
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,000
It would not be beneficial to Your Majesty.

190
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,600
The Ceremony of Stars shall be held according to new rites and practices.

191
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,400
Your Majesty,

192
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,900
what are the new rites and practices?

193
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,600
They will be what I say they are.

194
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
It is a new era for Great Chao.

195
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,100
There will be no dividing and giving of land in the Ceremony of Stars.

196
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,300
That is the new rite.

197
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,800
Or are you worried about the loss of military power, Official Jie?

198
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
This ceremony will be held,

199
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,500
and it will be grand!

200
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,800
It shall be a monumental event that will be remembered as such in history.

201
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,000
- As Your Majesty wishes.
- As Your Majesty wishes.

202
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Greetings, Your Majesty. This is Fan Ruhui.

203
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
Rise.

204
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
All is well.

205
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,400
I only want to have a few words with you.

206
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

207
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
How were things here while I was in Yebei?

208
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,200
How did Jie Haitian oversee the court and affairs?

209
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Supervisor Jie was diligent

210
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,200
and fair in his judgments.

211
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,600
He handled the affairs of the court well and in an orderly manner.

212
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,200
But… while he means well, he has had this habit for years now.

213
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
He can be rather arbitrary.

214
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,600
He mobilized the Lanyi Army without my orders.

215
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Were you aware of this?

216
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,300
I tried to dissuade him,

217
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,900
but Supervisor Jie argued

218
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,600
that it was to support Your Majesty in where you might not have foreseen.

219
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,800
Your Majesty did say that he could act

220
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,600
ad libitum as necessary.

221
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I could not argue with him.

222
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,600
Why not?

223
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
Why didn't you ask him

224
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,600
if I would be careless?

225
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
Your Majesty is right. I failed to stop Supervisor Jie.

226
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,700
It is my fault.

227
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,500
That is all. You're dismissed.

228
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

229
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
It appeared in Bingchen, (Chronology of heavenly stems & earthly branches)

230
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
and disappeared in the interfluve of Lan.

231
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,900
Lie, 18 degrees. Bingchen, 3 degrees.

232
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
The next time it appears should be…

233
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,300
Northeast, Gu, 13 degrees.

234
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,800
The sun, 25 degrees.

235
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,000
My astrometer can't be wrong!

236
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
You must've miscalculated.

237
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
It can't be a mistake on my end.

238
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
You must've made a mistake.

239
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,600
- But my calculations are correct too.
- It must've been an error on your end.

240
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
- Oh, stop it.
- Look.

241
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,000
How about this? Let's recalculate.

242
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,400
General Xie.

243
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,300
Supervisor, General Xie is here.

244
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,400
Should we put a hold on things?

245
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Thirty-five degrees…

246
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,700
Twenty-six degrees…

247
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Yu'an greets Supervisor Jie.

248
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,800
How could the Lanyi Army have failed so terribly?

249
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
You miscalculated by ten degrees here.

250
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
Calculate it again.

251
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
It's true.

252
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,900
You know astrology?

253
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,200
You can actually understand such a complex equation!

254
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,400
It is such a waste of talent for you to be a mere soldier!

255
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Why don't you join the Bureau of Astrology?

256
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,600
The canteen here serves great food. Especially the braised pork…

257
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
What are you talking about? She's just a soldier.

258
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
What would she know?

259
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
Supervisor Jie.

260
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,700
I am here today at the request of this person.

261
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,600
She is gifted in astrology and wishes to see you.

262
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,600
Tell me. Why did you have Yu'an bring you to me?

263
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,100
Ye Lingshuang of Yebei greets Supervisor Jie.

264
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,400
You're from Yebei?

265
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,800
She is one of the captives that were brought to Tianqi.

266
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
You're a captive?

267
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,500
Why do you want to join the Bureau of Astrology?

268
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,200
Since you're a female captive,

269
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
you should be sent to the Imperial Office of Music!

270
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,100
I will break the law if I take you in!

271
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,200
Official!

272
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,500
I do not wish to be a slave or a servant for the rest of my life.

273
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,700
I don't want to waste my life away, being caught in the constant strife in the harems or households.

274
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,300
So I implore you, Official,

275
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,000
to allow me to stay here and study astrology with you.

276
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,800
I don't know what you said or did to convince Yu'an,

277
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,300
but you won't convince me.

278
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
You are a scheming one.

279
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
That is all the more reason I cannot let you stay.

280
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,600
You are a hazard.

281
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,100
Take her away!

282
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,800
Official!

283
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
You were calculating the location of the Divine Mirror, weren't you?

284
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Only I can find out where it is.

285
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,600
You won't find it even if you spend a hundred years.

286
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,700
You are a clever girl.

287
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Are you trying to use this to deceive me?

288
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,000
I've heard that General Jie was ordered to stay in Yebei

289
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
to search for the Divine Mirror that was offered as a betrothal gift.

290
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Now, Princess Zhuyan is missing,

291
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
and the Divine Mirror is nowhere to be found.

292
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,900
You must be anxious to locate the mirror's whereabouts

293
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,400
because you want General Jie to return home soon.

294
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,200
You were able to get that from the star tracker.

295
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,100
You are talented.

296
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,600
But even I can't locate the mirror.

297
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,300
How will I know if your calculations are correct?

298
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,900
When I identify the location of the mirror,

299
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,400
you can send General Jie to find it,

300
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,500
and you'll know if I am right.

301
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,200
Official, if I fail,

302
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,300
you can punish me according to the laws of Chao.

303
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,200
I will accept my punishment without objections.

304
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,400
Will you make a bet with me?

305
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
Don't get ahead of yourself.

306
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,500
Even if I let you stay here,

307
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,200
you will not be a member of the Bureau of Astrology.

308
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,400
You will have neither title nor salary. None of that!

309
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,300
If you stay and perform well, I might be able to protect you.

310
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,600
If not, it's your call.

311
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,500
Thank you, Official!

312
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Get up.

313
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
Rest assured, Sir.

314
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,700
I will calculate the whereabouts of the mirror for you quickly and accurately!

315
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
- Xie Yu'an.
- Yes.

316
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Will you still be in charge of her?

317
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Yes. But I don't think that's appropriate.

318
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
Appropriate?

319
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,900
Did you consider whether it was appropriate when you brought her here?

320
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,000
I…

321
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I didn't think she would be able to convince you.

322
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
She was able to convince you.

323
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,800
Why wouldn't she be able to convince me?

324
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
But don't worry too much.

325
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
If anyone asks,

326
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
just tell them I made her stay.

327
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,100
I will remember your kindness, Official.

328
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,600
General Xie.

329
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,600
Thank you for today, General Xie.

330
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,400
Can you tell me where are my vice commander's remains now?

331
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,500
During the war at the Qiulan Sea, Vice Commander Yan fought admirably.

332
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,300
The Qihai Tribe respects heroes.

333
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,000
Why don't you search for that in Ziping Mountain?

334
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,100
Thank you.

335
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,400
An imperial decree from His Majesty.

336
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,600
Your Majesty, I wish to join your harem as your consort.

337
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,300
Do you understand what that means?

338
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,400
My celestial powers will be sealed.

339
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,500
I will no longer be able to spread my wings and fly.

340
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Receive the imperial decree, Leng Tianxi.

341
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,100
"Leng Tianxi is prudent and diligent.

342
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,100
She is virtuous, respectful, and carries herself with propriety.

343
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,800
She is dignified, benevolent, and obedient.

344
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,200
She is hereby presented with the gold seal and gold script,

345
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,400
granted the title of Consort Tian,

346
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
and given residence in the Zhuhuan Palace."

347
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
That is all.

348
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,900
I thank His Majesty.

349
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Congratulations, Consort Tian.

350
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,600
Our respects to Consort Tian.

351
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,600
The responsibility of protecting His Majesty rests on your shoulders now.

352
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,700
I will not disappoint you.

353
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
I shall take my leave now.

354
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,200
For the past ten years,

355
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
I was His Majesty's closest guard,

356
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,800
but also the eyes of the Winged Clan.

357
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,600
Now, even if it means betraying my own clan,

358
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,000
I will be forever loyal to His Majesty.

359
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,200
His Majesty will not be coming today.

360
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,400
Please tell Her Highness not to wait up.

361
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,900
Your Highness.

362
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,000
Where is His Majesty?

363
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,500
His Majesty-His Majesty is busy and won't be coming today.

364
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,100
Supervisor.

365
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,700
I didn't let you stay to do these things.

366
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,400
Did you do what you promised me?

367
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,000
Supervisor, I…

368
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,100
I-I want to make good on my promise.

369
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,600
But you know my powers are still sealed.

370
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,100
So I can't do astrological calculations.

371
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,600
I can only rely on prophecies and omens.

372
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,800
But these things don't always come when you want them to.

373
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,700
- Sometimes, the more you want it, the more…
- If you can't find it, then go back to the Imperial Office of Music.

374
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,200
I can find it!

375
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
But…

376
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,300
But Supervisor… I can't do it all by myself.

377
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,600
Please give me some star charts,

378
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,100
historical books, calendars, and magic instruments to support me.

379
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,000
You make a good point.

380
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,600
Tomorrow, you'll follow me to the duty room.

381
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,800
Thank you, Official.

382
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,500
- Adjust that uniform for the leader to fit you.
- Yes.

383
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,000
The Bureau of Astrology is a place of many people with their gossip.

384
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,700
If you make a mistake, you'll attract attention.

385
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,600
If your real identity is exposed,

386
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm afraid even I won't be able to protect you.

387
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,700
That won't happen. Please rest assured.

388
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,400
I'll keep that in mind.

389
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,300
It's you! You actually came to the Bureau of Astrology!

390
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Oh, right. We haven't finished the calculations for the star trail last time.

391
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,800
Let's…

392
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,500
- Sit there.
- Yes.

393
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,600
Supervisor, who is she?

394
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200
Ye Lingshuang.

395
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,400
Starting today, she will be working with me in the Bureau of Astrology.

396
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,500
Supervisor, are you putting her in charge of the newly established Horoscope Department?

397
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,200
Can't I?

398
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,500
There are many things waiting to be done in Chao right now.

399
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,600
Constructing the calendar is a tremendous merit that will go down in history!

400
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,250
But…

401
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,200
What makes her worthy of that position?

402
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,400
The Horoscope Department holds important responsibilities.

403
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,900
I haven't been able to find someone suitable to lead it.

404
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,800
She has some talent for calculations.

405
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll have her start with the preliminary work.

406
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes. Director Guan mentioned

407
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,400
the calculations she did last time.

408
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,600
Her methods are unique indeed.

409
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
But she did not go through the official examination.

410
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,500
How can she join the Bureau of Astrology?

411
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,100
She is only here to work. She is not an official.

412
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm afraid that still won't do.

413
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,900
To join the Bureau of Astrology, she must be taught by a master,

414
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,000
pass the official examination, and be nominated.

415
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,300
All of that won't be a problem. Just fill in my name.

416
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,300
Thank you, Master.

417
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,700
Her methods of calculations are brilliant.

418
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,500
They're different from ours.

419
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,300
Are you worried that she'll overshadow you?

420
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,200
Is that why you're rambling?

421
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,600
You're young, but you act like an old man.

422
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,100
- Nonsense. I did no such thing.
- You did.

423
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,800
So Official Ye is an unofficial disciple of Supervisor Jie.

424
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,200
She must possess great capabilities to have Supervisor Jie accept her as a disciple.

425
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,000
- The Horoscope Department will surely produce a phenomenal calendar!
- Why are you saying that, too?

426
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,300
- Earlier, you were the one who…
- Enough.

427
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,000
This matter has been decided.

428
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,400
She will be in charge of constructing the calendar.

429
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,900
All of you will give your full cooperation. No exceptions.

430
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,400
- Understood.
- Understood.

431
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,800
I will be under your care.

432
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,300
Thank you in advance.

433
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,400
- Same here.
- Sure.

434
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,000
Duanmu Yan.

435
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,200
Present.

436
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,800
She is not yet familiar with the affairs of the Bureau of Astrology.

437
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
After the routine meeting, show her around and get her acquainted with everything.

438
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes.

439
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,000
You're actually here!

440
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
I'm so happy to see you!

441
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,300
Please have a seat.

442
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,000
Thank you.

443
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,800
Your Majesty, Supervisor Jie requests to see you.

444
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,600
Let him in.

445
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,900
Yes.

446
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,600
I seek Your Majesty's approval on one matter.

447
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Do tell.

448
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,300
Your Majesty led the army and conquered Yebei.

449
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,200
Yebei is no longer capable of resisting.

450
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,800
I believe it is time to withdraw our troops.

451
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,400
The remnants of Yebei are untamed and unruly.

452
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,900
They may have surrendered now, but if given a chance, they will rebel.

453
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,400
And we are in need of manpower to construct our waterways.

454
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,000
Those who are still capable should be put to work,

455
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,800
and the rest should be killed immediately.

456
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,600
You're thoughtful indeed, Supervisor Jie.

457
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,800
But I plan to have them moved to Yuezhou soon.

458
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
Prepare the decree and send it to Yebei.

459
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,200
Your Majesty, keeping those remnants alive consumes our resources.

460
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Not to mention how costly it would be

461
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,800
to make the long journey to Yuezhou.

462
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,700
I fear the treasury will be exhausted if we do so.

463
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,000
And Zhuying is young.

464
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,200
To have him deal with all those captives

465
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,800
might be too much for him to handle...

466
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,400
You just need to do as I say.

467
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,600
You need not worry.

468
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,000
What are you doing, you silly girl?

469
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,800
That hurts!

470
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,400
Ouch…

471
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,800
It really hurts…

472
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,300
How can you talk?

473
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,400
Insolent girl!

474
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,700
I am the astrologer, Yun Wen!

475
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,400
An astrologer? In this thing?

476
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,000
It's a long story.

477
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,800
Something went wrong when I was researching an array,

478
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
and I lost my physical body.

479
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,200
Coincidentally, during the chaos in battle in Yebei,

480
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,100
the power of the stars was in disarray, and I was sent into your amber pendant.

481
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,100
Go on. Keep lying.

482
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,000
Why would I lie to you?

483
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,800
If you don't believe me, find me a mirror.

484
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,500
Why should I do what you say?

485
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,200
What gives?

486
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
Why won't you?

487
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,200
You must be scared of me!

488
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Scared? Of you?

489
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,000
Wait here!

490
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,500
Fine. Here's your mirror.

491
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,800
What…

492
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,000
How are you inside the mirror?

493
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
How ignorant.

494
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
One's mental body can only appear

495
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,200
on smooth surfaces before it coalesces.

496
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll repeat myself.

497
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,800
I am the great astrologer Yun Wen!

498
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,300
Why did you make me have those nightmares, then? Answer me!

499
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,800
It was not my doing.

500
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,000
It is you who can sense the changes in the orbit of the stars.

501
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,800
It's a pity. You would've been an astrological prodigy,

502
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,400
but your powers were sealed, and you know nothing now.

503
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,300
Oh, stop it!

504
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,000
What did I do this time?

505
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,400
You've got an awfully short temper.

506
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,900
I wouldn't have to do this

507
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,300
if I weren't trapped in this amber pendant.

508
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,800
That reminded me.

509
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,600
You're in my hands now.

510
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,200
I'm just a frail spiritual entity right now.

511
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,800
I'm fragile!

512
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,200
You have to protect me

513
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,000
and help me construct a new body.

514
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,200
But I don't want to.

515
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,400
See you.

516
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
What are you doing, Ye Lingshuang?

517
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Ye Lingshuang! Ye Lingshuang!

518
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,600
Ye Lingshuang! I can tell you where the Mirror of Youth is!

519
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,000
You know where it is?

520
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,700
Help me find the magical instrument to construct my body,

521
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,500
or I won't tell you.

522
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,000
All right. It's a deal.

523
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,800
Tell me where I can find the Mirror of Youth,

524
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,700
and I'll help you regain your body.

525
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,500
Deal.

526
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
An imperial decree from His Majesty.

527
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,200
- Long live His Majesty!
- Long live His Majesty!

528
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,200
We don't have enough men and horses in the camp.

529
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,300
Get another thousand soldiers from the vanguard.

530
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,500
The decree says the Yebei remnants are to be sent to construct the waterways.

531
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,400
And to kill those who cannot work.

532
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,000
It's a massacre, General!

533
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,600
I didn't expect His Majesty to give such orders.

534
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,000
Is this why His Majesty...

535
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,600
had me stay in Yebei?

536
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,400
Who's there?

537
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
Stop!

538
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,200
Let him go.

539
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,100
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

540
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,400
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

541
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,300
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

542
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,400
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

543
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,600
♫ The stars as the inkstone ♫

544
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,600
♫ Writing with the light of the sea ♫

545
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,800
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

546
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,000
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

547
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,200
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

548
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,900
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

549
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,400
♫ Void of someone ♫

550
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,800
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

551
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,800
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

552
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

553
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:07,100
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

554
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,800
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

555
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,800
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

556
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,600
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

557
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:32,200
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

558
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,000
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

559
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,400
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

560
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,000
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

561
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

562
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,200
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

563
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,100
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

564
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:10,800
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

565
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:23,100
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
