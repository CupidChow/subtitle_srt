[Episode 8]

15
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,990
Wait.

16
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,910
It's just a petty trick.

17
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm not afraid of her.

18
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,480
What's so funny?

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,420
[Military Chess]
Military chess?

20
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,750
Will your method of sending a chess game to test him actually work?

21
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,140
Judging by His Majesty's personality,

22
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,840
he'll definitely be interested in my game.

23
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,980
Why hasn't he summoned me yet?

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,580
How should I know?

25
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,460
Maybe he's too busy with official affairs.

26
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,029
He has handed everything over to Fan Ruhui.

27
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,340
What could he be busy with?

28
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,750
Here he comes.

29
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,190
Come in.

30
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,620
What is it?

31
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,820
Director Bai, His Majesty requests your presence.

32
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,910
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,650
This is?

34
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,350
Take a look. This is my new chessboard.

35
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,569
It's much better than your chess game. Right?

36
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,340
I even gave it a name.

37
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,650
I call it the "Battle of the Nine States."

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,550
Battle of the Nine States?

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,779
Fine. Your Majesty, you can name it whatever you like.

40
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,810
Tell me the rules then.

41
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,879
Your Majesty, you and I will pick a side respectively.

42
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,439
After that, we'll have 1,000 troops under our command.

43
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,160
The one who conquers Tianqi will conquer the entire world.

44
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,640
If so, what do these symbols represent?

45
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,999
Your Majesty, that symbol you're pointing at is the symbol of the Truth Master.

46
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,820
The one who obtains the Truth Master has their military strength increased tenfold.

47
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,840
Truth Master, huh?

48
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,850
That's right.

49
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,179
I was inspired by the Truth Master's Nine Diagram Deduction before I created this game.

50
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,670
Of course, we need the Truth Master.

51
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,740
However, don't you think increasing one's military strength tenfold

52
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,390
is too much?

53
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,020
With the Truth Master around,

54
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,660
he can distort the fabric of space itself.

55
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,630
Tenfold is an understatement.

56
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,350
He's related to the Truth Master indeed.

57
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,880
Is that so?

58
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,200
Come here.

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,920
Okay.

60
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,330
If so, let us begin.

61
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,350
Your Majesty, please.

62
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,100
Building a water conservancy project, obtain 3,000 troops.

63
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,020
Aren't you dizzy with all the calculations?

64
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,200
If I'm dizzy from calculating these,

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,270
I would've failed as an astrologer.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,070
Let's proceed.

67
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,279
I'm exhausted. I quit.

68
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,149
At most, you can visit Yunji Building whenever you want.

69
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,270
You should've told me earlier.

70
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,553
You're not allowed to go back on your words.

71
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:04,880
Do you think I would play dirty for such a trivial matter?

72
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,120
Qingzhan, good job.

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,620
With this, there's a higher chance for our assassination to work.

74
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,320
That's right.

75
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,500
- Princess Lian.
- Sister Lian.

76
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,599
Yezi, great timing.

77
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,790
Have you found out the secret behind his invulnerability?

78
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,690
I went to Yunji Building.

79
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,760
However, there were too many scrolls about him.

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,659
I only found out that Yu Xiuming might be related to the Truth Master.

81
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,299
Okay then. We don't have much time. We need to make haste.

82
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:48,320
Got it.

83
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,060
By the way, I have good news for you.

84
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,170
I came into contact with a general named Huo Lu.

85
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,630
He can help us sneak into the Ceremony of Stars.

86
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,340
A general?

87
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,410
Is he willing to participate in the assassination?

88
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,600
He was indebted to Jie Haitian.

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,439
He is upset that His Majesty executed Jie Haitian wrongfully.

90
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,940
He will redress his grievance during the ceremony.

91
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,249
By then, we can follow his plan and sneak into the ceremony.

92
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,449
However, he doesn't know about the assassination.

93
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,720
Huo Lu?

94
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,750
I've never heard of him before.

95
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,450
And...

96
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,499
Sister Lia, we still haven't found out why Yu Xiuming is invulnerable.

97
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,349
Don't you think it's too risky to do this?

98
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,249
Looks like you're scared. What a scaredy cat.

99
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:37,119
You won't get to avenge your clan by making one hypothesis after another.

100
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,830
I...

101
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,530
I have no time for you.

102
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,990
Sister Lian, I have to go.

103
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,880
- Yezi?
- If you're scared, you should get out of our way and not hinder us.

104
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,600
Chu Ye!

105
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,820
Yezi!

106
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,480
Yezi.

107
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,510
Yezi, I need your help.

108
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,960
This assassination is too risky.

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,169
You don't know any martial arts or secret techniques.

110
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,660
You don't need to do anything else.

111
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,259
However, the secret to the Emperor's invulnerability is vital to us.

112
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,519
And now, you have the highest chance of finding it out.

113
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,520
Got it, Sister Lian.

114
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,780
If you have any news, you can look for me here.

115
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,590
Don't worry.

116
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,480
I'll make a move first.

117
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,110
Commander Xie.

118
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,790
It's you?

119
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,670
Check over there.

120
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,280
- Yes, Commander.
- Yes, Commander.

121
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,000
Commander Xie, I'm here to inquire about someone from you.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Speak then. Who is it?

123
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,110
Did you have a subordinate called Huo Lu?

124
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,820
Huo Lu?

125
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,620
Why do you want to know?

126
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,450
I've been sorting out Supervisor Jie's old belongings

127
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,250
in the Bureau of Astrology the past few days.

128
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,840
I found out that Supervisor Jie left a note behind.

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,269
I think he has several items that he wants to give to his trusted aide, Huo Lu.

130
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,140
Trusted aide?

131
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,670
You're not joking, right?

132
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,820
Supervisor Jie did take care of Huo Lu in the past.

133
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,070
However, Supervisor Jie would never have treated him as his trusted aide.

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,240
Huo Lu isn't someone who's ready to stand up for justice.

135
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,140
He wouldn't get himself involved with the Jie family at this time.

136
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,240
I might be mistaken, then.

137
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,620
Thank you, Commander Xie.

[Winter Grass]

You're not here to deliver the Yin-Yang Calendar?

140
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,479
Your Highness, didn't I deliver it to you a few days ago?

141
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,010
If so, what are you doing here?

142
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,749
Your Highness, you always instruct the servants to take good care of me whenever I'm here.

143
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,460
I remembered your kindness.

144
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,140
That's why I wish to present some of the excellent teas I have to you,

145
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,450
Your Highness. Please try them.

146
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,700
Here.

147
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,030
What do you think?

148
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,519
I've never tried something like this before.

149
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,000
What tea is this?

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,040
We call this Winter Grass.

151
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,389
When I was still in Yebei, we always searched for them beside hot springs.

152
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,510
You've lived in Yebei for 19 years.

153
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,580
However, you still have plenty of years to live in Tianqi.

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,040
Your Highness, you're right.

155
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,160
By the way, Your Highness, I met General Jie by accident just a few days ago.

156
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,250
Do you mean Jie Zhuying?

157
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,310
I assume Jie Haitian and his wife have been buried.

158
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Supervisor Jie was beheaded at the court.

159
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,430
No one dared collect his body.

160
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,430
That's why people are deeply affected by it.

161
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,939
But it's to be expected.

162
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,280
Not many people were close with Supervisor Jie in private.

163
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,100
All of them were his old subordinates from Xijiang.

164
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,630
They fought for many years.

165
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,450
Most of them are dead.

166
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,460
Jie Haitian was always headstrong.

167
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,870
Although the current imperial army revered him as their superior,

168
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,270
they weren't close in private.

169
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,700
So no one had accepted benefits from Supervisor Jie?

170
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,870
According to what I know, no one.

171
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,710
To redress his grievance during the ceremony

172
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,110
and sacrifice his life to stand up for Supervisor Jie?

173
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,810
This must be someone who had received tremendous grace from Supervisor Jie.

174
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,600
It's impossible for Consort Tian to not know about him.

175
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,580
Although Xie Yu'an didn't say it out loud, it's obvious that he detests Huo Lu.

176
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,479
That means he isn't someone who will return someone else's kindness.

177
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,620
If so, why is he doing this?

178
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,790
He must be lying.

179
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,280
No.

180
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,939
I have to write to Sister Lian immediately.

181
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,570
I need to tell her to be careful.

182
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,180
Official Gu.

183
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,690
Official Bai.

184
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you doing here?

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,890
Official Gu, can you please do me a favor?

186
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,719
What is it? Please speak up.

187
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,580
Deliver a letter for me.

188
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,580
Is anyone there?

189
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,840
Is anyone there?

190
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,540
Brother Gu, just deliver the letter to this address.

191
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,539
If there's no one there, you can leave the letter there.

192
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,810
Who delivered this letter?

193
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,670
How should I know?

194
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,299
You're illiterate. Why did you take the letter?

195
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,940
Su, what's the matter?

196
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,789
Your Highness, someone strange delivered a letter to us.

197
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,770
He placed it in the courtyard.

198
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,310
A letter?

199
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,060
Your Highness.

200
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,480
What's the matter?

201
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,630
- Yezi suspects that Huo Lu was lying.
- Huo Lu?

202
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,139
She wants us not to act rashly and to delay our operation.

203
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,120
How could you believe in the harbinger of calamity?

204
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,299
Besides, she's just suspicious of him. She has no evidence.

205
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,040
You're right.

206
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,400
We mustn't hesitate anymore.

207
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,550
No matter what, we have to stake our life on it.

208
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,410
By coming to Tianqi together with my brothers, we no longer intend to live like cowards.

209
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,719
Although you're worried about us, we no longer care about your words.

210
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,179
This isn't related to you.

211
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,499
You don't need to join us.

212
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,830
"No longer intend to live like cowards?"

213
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,840
Sister Lian says she no longer intends to live like a coward.

214
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,840
If the assassination fails, does she intend to end her life as well?

215
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,330
If so... what will you do?

216
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,929
Since she intends to die, of course I can't just leave her be.

217
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,570
This won't do.

218
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,980
I need to create an Ice Crystal magic array for her escape.

219
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,399
But Ice Crystal is forbidden in Tianqi.

220
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,330
You won't find one here.

221

[Jianyue Pavilion]

222
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,350
Brother Wuyou?

223
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,359
Wuyou, have you fixed my whip?

224
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,070
I have.

225
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,400
Yezi, look.

226
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,020
The design is so intricate.

227
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,330
The handle was empty initially.

228
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,690
It has no friction.

229
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,609
That's why I acted on my own initiative and made some carvings on it.

230
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,730
Princess Zhuyan, I hope you don't mind.

231
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,879
I love it. So, of course, I don't mind.

232
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,580
I'll give it a try then.

233
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,799
Let me join you.

234
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,450
Yezi.

235
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,019
Last time, you said you didn't like to wear flowers.

236
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,760
I thought it was a waste to throw it away.

237
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,380
That's why I turned it into a wind chime.

238
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,540
Will you accept it this time?

239
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,280
Miss Ye.

240
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,690
You're finally back.

241
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,550

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,790
Yi Wuyou.

243
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,400
This is great. You're finally back.

244
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,580
Yezi, I was seriously injured.

245
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,460
I've been searching for you since I recovered.

246
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,330
However, there wasn't any news of you in Yebei.

247
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,329
I've been trying to inquire about you after I came to Tianqi, too.

248
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:42,360
They told me the owner of Jianyue Pavilion had changed.

249
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
I thought...

250
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,849
My identity might've been exposed after trying to save Princess Zhuyan.

251
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:50,330
They were afraid that the officials might find me.

252
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,420
But now, I'm back.

253
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,850
Where's A'Rui?

254
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,640
It's all my fault.

255
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,190
I failed to protect her.

256
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,290
As I was seriously injured and out of stamina,

257
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,930
we could only spend the night on the hill.

258
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,650
But when I woke up, she disappeared.

259
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,000
How did that happen?

260
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,460
Where exactly did A'Rui go?

261
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,370
After that, I searched for her as I was recovering from my injury.

262
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,450
But I still couldn't locate her whereabouts.

263
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,709
However, I encountered Dayuangu when I was looking for her.

264
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,230
You met my father?

265
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,380
When I found him, he was almost dead.

266
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,460
I brought him back to the old shack to treat his injury.

267
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,410
However, he didn't last long.

268
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,480
Yezi, how have you been?

269
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,710
Did the people of Chao pick on you?

270
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,410
Now, I'm working as a female official in the Bureau of Astrology.

271
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,310
I've changed my name to Bai Lu.

272
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,340
What?

273
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,459
You became an official of Chao? A female official?

274
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,240
Do you intend to serve him?

275
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
No.

276
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
I'm not trying to serve him.

277
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,060
What are you up to then?

278
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,210
You wouldn't understand.

279
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,999
With my current identity, I can do things that other people cannot.

280
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,070
I should go now.

281
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,830
Take care of yourself.

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,520
If... If you're willing,

283
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,220
please keep an eye out for me on ways to obtain the Ice Crystal.

284
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,330
Yezi, in the future,

285
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,750
if you see wind chimes hanging at the top of the Jianyue Pavilion,

286
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,990
that means I'm here.

287
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,280
I will keep a lookout for the Ice Crystal.

288
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,360
No matter what happens, I'll be here for you.

289
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,510
Sir, there's no Ice Crystal even on the outskirts of Tianqi.

290
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,939
If this continues, we'll have to leave Tianqi.

291
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,330
I haven't checked the Heluo stalls in the west of the city.

292
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,530
I'll check them when the night falls.

293
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,910
Miss, this isn't a place for you to play the guqin.

294
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,949
You look pale. You must have been starving for some time.

295
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:52,660
Why don't we have something together?

296
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,350
Miss, can you show me your guqin?

297
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,010
It's crafted by Master Jingyun, right?

298
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,509
Princess Jingyun has been living in Tanhou Palace for 23 years.

299
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:32,630
She's not favored, and she has no child.

300
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,570
She spends her life in solitude.

301
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,360
When the army of Chao attacked the city, Xue surrendered.

302
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,580
The princess said this with a sigh.

303
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,450
"I was born proud.

304
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,730
However, my father and siblings are spineless.

305
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,990
And I have to serve a spineless husband, too.

306
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,050
Today, I don't know which state to mourn."

307
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,500
After that, she burned the palace and died inside.

308
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,710
This guqin was the only thing she left behind.

309
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,180
Miss, may I know your name?

310
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,970
My surname is Tang, as in cherry blossom.

311
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,360
Tang?

312
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,450
Tang as a surname?

313
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,340
You're the relative of the cooks who serve the Yi family.

314
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,230
Back then, 300 servants followed the princess when she got married.

315
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,429
My parents were in charge of preparing the princess's meals.

316
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,909
Her Highness had no children.

317
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,140
So she taught us how to read and write when she was free.

326
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,730
Sir, it seems like you're paying too much for them.

327
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,750
Not at all. It's yours if you keep quiet.

328
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,840
Sir, thank you for supporting my business.

329
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,940
Don't worry, sir.

330
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,750
These four Ice Crystals

331
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,400
were purchased by a Heluo from Qingyu Ridge.

332
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
I've never seen you before.

333
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,680
Sir, take care.

334
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,000
Stop right there!

335
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,610
- Don't run!
- After her!

336
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,440
Stop right there!

337
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,570
Stop right there!

338
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,830
Don't run!

339
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,870
Stop right there!

340
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,730
After her!

341
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,170
- After her!
- Stop right there! Hurry!

342
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,559
- She's over there!
- Stop!

343
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,269
- Don't run!
- Stop right there!

344
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:01,370
Is she from the Winged Clan?

345
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,660
Stop right there!

346
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,360
- You have nowhere to hide! Stop right there!
- She's over there! Show yourself!

347
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,769
- Hurry!
- After her!

348
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,380
Hurry!

349
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,900
Hurry! Don't fall behind!

350
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm Tianying from the Winged Clan. Your Highness, thank you for saving me.

351
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,360
- Get up. Skip the formalities.
- Your Highness.

352
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,770
Don't call me that. The Winged Clan has been extinct since long ago.

353
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,850
You should leave.

354
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,040
No. Sir, I'm willing to follow you

355
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,660
and assist you in rebuilding our empire.

356
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,210
Remember. Remember their faces.

357
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,540
During the Ceremony of Stars, we will silence them no matter if they succeed or not. Understood?

358
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,110
- Yes, Commander.
- Yes, Commander.

359
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,320
General Huo.

360
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,980
Change into this armor.

361
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,860
Follow me to the imperial army tonight.

362
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,300
I've already made arrangements for everything.

363
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
You guys can rest assured.

364
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,949
General Huo, these children haven't seen the emperor before.

365
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:01,990
That's why they feel excited.

366
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,629
The ceremony will begin at the hour of Si (9:00-11:00 a.m.).

367
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:09,280
I will redress the grievance for Supervisor Jie

368
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,690
after His Majesty rewards his subjects.

369
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,190
By then, you guys just need to send me to the altar

370
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,290
and let me finish my speech.

371
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,650
General Huo, don't worry.

372
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,770
With us around, no one will hurt you.

373
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,889
You guys should get changed then.

374
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,550
I'll wait for you at the gate.

375
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,090
Okay.

376
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,350
- Brother.
- You guys should get changed.

377
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,510
Brother.

378
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,820
Brother, please bring me along.

379
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,179
Although I don't know any secret techniques,

380
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,229
I'm from Yebei, too. I don't fear death.

381
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,850
A'Su, listen to me.

382
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,199
Leave Tianqi immediately once the city gate is open tomorrow.

383
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,390
If you hear news of our failed assassination,

384
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,400
you should never return to Yebei.

385
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,800
Take good care of yourself.

386
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,790
Brother!

387
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,040
Yi Wuyou.

388
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
What's the matter? You told me to rush here.

389
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,270
What's the emergency here?

390
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,340
The Ceremony of Stars is in two days.

391
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,029
Do you plan to join Qihai Lian in assassinating the emperor?

392
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,980
How did you know?

393
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,699
I just want to tell you that this is too risky.

394
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:37,680
You shouldn't get involved.

395
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,660
Sister Lian has already made up her mind.

396
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,060
I can't convince her to stop.

397
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,129
She's strong with her secret techniques.

398
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:45,580
If she fights with reckless abandon, she might win.

399
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,630
However, you don't need to get involved.

400
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,859
This is too risky. I can't just abandon her.

401
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,680
I'm not telling you to abandon her.

402
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,200
She's the ruler of Yebei. She has the duty to protect the state and its people.

403
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,640
But you're different.

404
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,499
You've never enjoyed a single day when you were living in Yebei.

405
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,640
No one will blame you if you don't go.

406
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,760
A'Rui will blame me.

407
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,870
Princess Lian is A'Rui's most respected sister.

408
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,480
That's why I cannot abandon her.

409
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,900
Yezi, you cannot do this.

410
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,770
She's not worth risking your life for.

411
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,580
Yi Wuyou, I know you're saying this for my own good.

412
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,340
But you don't need to persuade me.

413
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,970
I shall leave now.

414
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,440
Hejin.

415
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,030
Sir.

416
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,180
Send the Ice Crystals and a Cloud Flame to the Bureau of Astrology.

417
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,880
Tell the Snow Crane Camp to be on standby.

418
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,540
Yes, sir.

419
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,590
Yi Wuyou is right.

420
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,100
You did help her to find an escape path.

421
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,770
But what about yourself?

422
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,160
You dummy.

423
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,630
The assassination will never succeed.

424
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,370
Are you that worried about me?

425
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,260
I'm not worried about you.

426
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,880
If you wish to die,

427
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,670
no one can stop you.

428
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm making this precisely because I don't want to die.

429
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,080
What's the use of that?

430
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,940
It might not be of any use at all.

431
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,660
However, I hope it can be of some use.

432
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,440
I don't know what you're thinking at all.

433
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,500
Don't worry.

434
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,220
I will help you to settle down.

435
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,020
Anyway, if I don't come back...

436
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,455
Touch wood.

437
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,230
I knew you couldn't bear to part with me.

438
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,430
That's nonsense.

439
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,820
What are you staring at?

440
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,710
You can go and die for all I care.

441
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,660
All right. It's time for me to sleep.

442
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,680
You must stay here and gather your qi and power.

443
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,100
This Wave-Cutting Cup is very safe.

444
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,030
If I can return alive,

445
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,270
I'll definitely keep helping you.

446
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

447
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,510
Tomorrow is the Ceremony of Stars.

448
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,439
What are you doing here today?

449
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,749
Your Highness, you may not know,

450
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,390
but tomorrow is also the Rainbow Festival in Yebei.

451
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,039
On this day, the women of Yebei will make embroideries for their closest kin.

452
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,750
That's why...

453
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,079
Pardon me for my skills,

454
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,399
but Your Highness, I made a pouch for you.

455
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,849
I came here today because I was afraid that I couldn't make it here tomorrow.

456
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,230
Both of us have lost our parents and clan.

457
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,919
We're in the same situation.

458
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,679
Come on. Sit down.

459
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,180
Yes, Your Highness.

460
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,839
Other girls make embroideries of insects or flowers.

461
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,610
What did you make?

462
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,769
When I was young,

463
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:54,269
I encountered the Truth Master by chance once.

464
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,399
Therefore, I made this

465
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,899
according to the design of the pouch that the Truth Master gifted me.

466
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,049
Actually, there's nothing special about the pouch.

467
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:10,470
However, it has a great scent.

468
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,529
My celestial power was sealed away for over 10 years.

469
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:14,489
The perfume was what I used to make me feel better.

470
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,470
Your Highness, you should give it a try.

471
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,920
Your celestial power was sealed away?

472
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,280
I used to have strange dreams when I was young.

473
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,850
Therefore, the people of my clan saw me as a harbinger of calamity.

474
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,570
That's why they sealed my celestial powers away.

475
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,640
Since young?

476
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,100
It must've been tough on you.

477
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,870
Seems like I was right about us being the same.

478
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,460
Thank you for this.

479
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,329
You're the first female official of Chao.

480
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:54,300
You were even ordered to participate in the Ceremony of Stars.

481
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,470
You've achieved something great for women all around the world.

482
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,970
You're finally being rewarded for all your suffering.

483
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,569
Your Highness, you must be joking.

484
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,529
You were the Commander of the Winged Guards.

485
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:09,410
You were the first female official of Chao.

486
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:38,174
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

487
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:41,694

495
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,300
General Jie.

496
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,820
You should call me Qihai Lian.

497
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,819
- But I...
- You're a general of Chao.

498
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:21,430
I'm the Grand Princess of Yebei.

499
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,910
We should never meet again.

500
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,540
When the Ceremony of Stars is over,

501
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,490
I will try to seek an audience with His Majesty for you.

502
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,290
It's because I promised you before.

503
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,950
No need for that.

504
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,835
You don't owe me anything.

505
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:50,494
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

508
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,979
Your Majesty, our hidden guards have found Qihai Lian and the rest in Lanxin Alley.

509
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,450
Lanxin Alley?

510
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,750
The city guards actually didn't know about their whereabouts

511
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,370
even though they'd been living there for so many days?

512
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,589
Most of the houses there were empty. And they were decrepit.

513
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:28,300
I assume the city guards didn't pay much attention to them.

514
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,300
I would like to see

515
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,710
how this princess, who had fallen from grace,

516
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,340
could make the Ceremony of Stars even better.

517
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,040
Commander Ling.

518
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,950
His Majesty is waiting for you in the study.

519
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,470
Official Bai, please.

520
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,160
Thank you.

521
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,630
Greetings, Your Majesty.

522
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,750
Your Majesty?

523
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,530
Greetings, Your Majesty.

524
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,200
Spare the formalities.

525
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,319
Your Majesty, I wonder why you summoned me at this late hour.

526
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,640
It's nothing.

527
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,890
I just want you to join me for a round.

528
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

529
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:17,610
Bai Lu, what kind of person is this Qihai Lian?

530
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,470
Why is he asking about Sister Lian out of the blue?

531
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,879
My father once read her fortunes.

532
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,100
He said she was blessed by the heavens.

533
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,820
If so, what do you think of her?

534
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,930
I think she's had a rough life.

535
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,029
She lost her mother since young.

536
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:46,710
After that, her father went to abduct other women outside.

537
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,430
Seems like she's pretty pitiful.

538
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,329
However, she never complained about it.

539
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,029
Instead, she told herself

540
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:57,090
to be the best grand princess that Yebei ever had.

541
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,610
Seems like you think highly of her.

542
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:07,730
However, everyone is pitiful in their own ways.

543
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:12,380
Those who are pitiful are detestable in a certain way.

544
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:21,520
Your Majesty, what are you trying to say here?

545
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,290
I have a question for you.

546
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,410
Who will you choose between her and me?

547
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,380
I've never thought about that question before.

548
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,570
It's fine.

549
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,990
You'll know very soon.

550
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,330
It's getting late.

551
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,909
You should return early

552
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:58,780
and wait for the Ceremony of Stars to arrive.

553
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,580
I shall take my leave.

554
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,090
Bai Lu.

555
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,750
Don't you have anything else you want to tell me?

556
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,609
Your Majesty, I've told Consort Tian

557
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:31,790
everything I wanted to tell you.

558
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,340
If you wish to know, you may ask her.

559
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,740
All right.

560
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,410
I shall wait for your return

561
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,270
so that we can resume our game.

562
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,760
I will surely join you

563
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,190
if I have the chance, Your Majesty.

564
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,420
