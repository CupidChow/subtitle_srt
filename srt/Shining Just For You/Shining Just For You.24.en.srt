[Episode 24]

15
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,490
Young Master, the Fan Family is going to have their ancestral ceremony tomorrow.

16
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,470
Yu Xiuming will personally attend the ceremony.

17
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,580
Very good. What about our people?

18
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,010
We've already sent someone to the Fan Residence.

19
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,310
When the time comes, Tianying and I will be on standby around the area.

20
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,140
Remember. We are just going to sound them out this time.

21
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,900
If anything happens, retreat at once.

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,530
We understand.

23
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,960
If Yu Xiuming has really lost his divine power just like Fan Ruhui said,

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,010
we can also defeat him once and for all.

25
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,470
Young Master.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,720
How is it going with the preparation?

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,810
Don't worry, Second Young Master. Everything is ready.

28
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,050
Everyone at the ancestral hall was hired by you personally

29
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,320
to help with the ceremony.

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,640
Young Master, please forgive me for being frank.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,070
But won't it bring attention to us

32
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,900
if we act in our own ancestral hall?

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,510
We have to do it in our place and in our own ancestral hall

34
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,670
so that no one will suspect us.

35
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,130
Yes, you are right.

36
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,570
Make sure to take care of it well.

37
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,670
If it's a success, I'll reward you handsomely.

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,190
Yes, Young Master.

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,740
Thank you very much, Supervisor Bai.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,320
Let me congratulate you first on the birth of your grandchild.

41
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,870
Where is the child's mother?

42
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,380
Don't you know?

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,140
How can you let a woman attend this ancestral ceremony?

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,170
What do you mean?

45
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,690
You can't have a grandchild without a mother.

46
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,650
Moreover, you are making it sound like it's your loss for having me

47
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,130
as your rite official.

48
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,890

The Bureau of Astrology represents His Majesty and the will of Heaven.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
Why do you have to bring gender into this?

51
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,700
I wanted her to come with us.

52
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,350
But she has just given birth and has yet to recover.

53
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,770
She doesn't want to come.

54
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,440
So, I asked her to rest at home.

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,790
You are right.

56
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,270
Let me congratulate you first, First Young Master.

57

Your Highness.

I never thought that you would join us today, Your Highness. I'm honored.

You've served the country well.

Now that you have a grandchild,

62
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,460
His Majesty has sent me to congratulate you in person.

63
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm humbled. This way, please, Your Highness.

Ever since I came to you,

I could spend more time with you.

It was my fault that you were attacked in the Fan Ancestral Hall.

Your Majesty.

What's the result of the investigation?

121
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,990
Fan Zheng had indeed hired a batch of odd jobbers.

122
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,900
And the assassins were the Winged Ones.

123
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,650
And I found the body of these odd jobbers in the backyard of the ancestral hall.

124
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,200
Winged Ones.

125
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,820
This is fishy.

126
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,150
Investigate this matter properly.

127
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,480
One more thing.

128
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,240
Keep a close eye on Fan Ruhui.

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,320

Why are you here?

132
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,560
Consort Tian was kind to me when she was still alive.

133
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,900
I'm here to mourn her.

134
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,490
Here. Take a seat.

135
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:31,710
I've brought Consort Tian's favorite food: dried cheese and flower tea.

136
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,100
Consort Tian had been by your side for decades.

137
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,670
She had served you all her life.

138
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,050
She died proving her loyalty to you.

139
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,360
I don't need her to die for me.

140
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,480
Maybe it's not about what you need.

141
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,060
It's more about what she wanted.

142
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,620
You were the target of the assassination.

143
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,010
In my opinion, we have to arrest the culprit soon.

144
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,190
For your safety and to make sure that Consort Tian can rest in peace,

145
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,710
I want to do something.

146
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,750
What is it?

147
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,850
I want us to get married soon

148
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,660
so that the culprit can walk right into our trap.

149
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,370
Official Fan, I've already arranged everything with the prison.

150
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,570
No one will treat Second Young Master harshly.

151
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,100
But the Bureau of Justice wants to interrogate him before they release him.

152
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,750
You've been loyal, and you've served the country well.

153
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,540
And Second Young Master is not involved in this incident.

154
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,520
His Majesty won't blame you for everything just because he was attacked

155
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,780
in your ancestral hall.

156
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,010
He was attacked at my ancestral hall.

157
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,630
I am ashamed to face His Majesty and our fellow officials.

158
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,260
I've already sent my resignation letter to the palace.

159
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,460
If you resign as the Great Steward,

160
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,730
the imperial court will be dominated by the Bureau of Astrology.

161
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,860
You can't do this.

162
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,680
His Majesty and I share the same blood.

163
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,140
And I've helped him for years.

164
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,320
If I beg His Majesty's for mercy,

165
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,620
I'm sure he'll give me a free pass for old-time's sake.

166
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,260
And the Bureau of Astrology will not be too harsh on me.

167
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,910
But in the future, it'll be hard for those of you

168
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,410
who've supported me for so long.

169
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,580
I will never forget the kindness that you've shown me

170
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,920
all these years.

171
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,940
No matter what happens to you in the future, just give me an order

172
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,060
and I'll do my best to fulfill it.

173
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,900
Official Yao, don't do this.

174
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,020
I'm right about you.

175
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,240
I'm thankful that we've been friends for so many years.

176
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,720
Are you really going to retire?

177
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,130
Are you doing this on purpose?

178
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,170
You are brilliant.

179
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,580
- Old Master.
- What's the progress?

180
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,950
Feel free to talk.

181
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:57,160
Everyone in this room right now are people we can trust.

182
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,530
Give me the report.

183
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,970
Yes, Old Master.

184
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,080
Like what you've ordered, I've hired a group of mercenaries in Wanzhou.

185
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,900
If we can help them infiltrate the imperial army,

186
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,320
we'll be able to take over the Imperial City.

187
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,150
Excellent.

188
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,350
Go and find me a more powerful mystic.

189
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,520
Let's plan a coordinated attack with Yi Wuyou from the inside.

190
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,100
Yes, Old Master.

191
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,880
Your Majesty, I've become old and fragile.

192
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,690
I'm no longer fit enough for my position.

193
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,040
Please allow me to retire from my position

194
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,250
and go back to live the rest of my retirement life in my hometown.

195
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,480
You've served the country very well.

196
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,770
And you've spent a lot of time and energy to help

197
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,770
with the governing of our country.

198
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,450
If you want to retire today,

199
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,150
I'll permit it.

200
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

201
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,550
But it's too early for you to go back to your hometown.

202
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:34,730
From now on, you can join our court meetings as a duke.

203
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

204
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,990
From today onward,

205
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,850
the Great Steward's residence will be taken out of the equation.

206
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,960
From now on, the Bureau of Astrology, the Bureau of Justice,

207
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,370
the Bureau of Public Works, the Bureau of Ceremonies,

208
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,410
the Bureau of Sima, and the Bureau of Situ will take part in the court meeting.

209
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,840
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

210
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,380
I have something to announce today.

211
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,120
After the unfortunate passing

212
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,170
of the Princess of Yebei, Princess Zhuyan,

213
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,960
Great Chao has not had an empress in a long time.

214
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,870
I've decided to follow Heaven's intention to find an empress for us

215
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,660
in order to stabilize our country.

216
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,940
Who is the empress that you are going to marry?

217
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,310
Of course, she's someone who's compatible with me in terms of our life star.

218
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,653
♫ I had witnessed the bright fireworks several
times flashing in the air ♫

219
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:12,583
♫ I had witnessed several beautiful sunsets ♫

220
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:18,603
♫ Eyes filled with warmth when you passed by ♫

221
00:20:18,603 --> 00:20:24,753
♫ Just like a lost amber, waiting for you to pick it up ♫

222
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:30,803
♫ A cold and lonely moonlight that dissipates
with the night breeze ♫

223
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:36,853
♫ I'm willing to lie in your arms ♫

224
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:42,753
♫ So, I was gazing at the nearest distance all along ♫

225
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:48,270
♫ Pouring everything into your heart ♫

226
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,080
I, Bai Lu,

227
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,710
have been on the receiving end of your kindness.

228
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm here today to greet you as a woman.

229
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,394
♫ Never fearing time, which passes slowly ♫

230
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:07,114
♫ I invite you to watch the splendid galaxy ♫

231
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:13,069
♫ It started as ripples and slowly turned into waves ♫

232
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:19,257
♫ I'll never forget the ups and downs I went through ♫

233
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:25,230
♫ I'm full of hope, waiting for you to drop by ♫

234
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:34,730
♫ I'm full of hope, waiting for you to drop by ♫

235
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,510
Is she really going to marry the Emperor of Chao?

236
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,360
You've been betrayed by her.

237
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,530
She's living a great life with the emperor.

238
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,490
I'm sure she has her own reasons.

239
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,840
Maybe I have to become the emperor to be worthy enough for her.

240
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,270
When we've gathered all the families of the Winged Clan,

241
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,670
I'll ascend to the throne as an emperor.

242
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,600
A'Su, stay back.

243
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,450
What's wrong?

244
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,240
I've managed to master part of the Guxuan secret arts skills.

245
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,140
I'm afraid that I'll hurt you.

246
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,960
So, it's better if you keep a distance from me.

247
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,980
A'Su, the moment that we've been waiting for has come.

248
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,350
Tell me about it.

249
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,080
Fan Ruhui has been looking for mystics in secret.

250
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,290
That's strange. If he's trying to revolt,

251
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,740
we can use him to kill His Majesty.

252
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,950
Are you willing to do it?

253
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,090
As long as I can seek my revenge,

254
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm willing to do anything to achieve that.

255
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,370
Someone.

256
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,990
Old Master, go and invite the master to come in.

257
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,620
Yes, Old Master.

258
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,820
Old Master, he's here.

259
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,120
At first, I thought that you were an ambitious man.

260
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,250
That was why I decided to join you.

261
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,090
I never thought that you would be like a commoner

262
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,040
who refused to act due to your own cowardice.

263
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,150
Since I'm of no use here, I should leave.

264
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,300
Who are you? Who do you think you are talking to?

265
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,050
Someone.

266
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,820
Drag him out.

267
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,580
Yes.

268
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,450
If you don't want to achieve greatness, I can leave.

269
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,300
Please don't do that.

270
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,880
My son offended you just now.

271
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,330
Please forgive us.

272
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,360
Let's sit down and discuss this matter together.

273
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,240
He managed to repair the Qionghua Spear.

274
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,320
I wonder where he got the Starstone.

275
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,750
Looks like the Qionghua Spear has chosen Yu Linkong as the Winged Emperor.

276
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,920
That's good.

277
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,450
That way, the Xue Family will be given merits for being his true supporter.

278
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,780
And Father, you can become his right-hand man.

279
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,560
Now that it has come to this, we can only collaborate with the Fan Family to achieve our goal.

280
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,780
Please accept our humble greetings, Your Majesty!

281
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,740
You may rise.

282
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

283
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,890
Ningzhou has already received the news of my enthronement.

284
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,790
I'm sure the Emperor of the Human Clan will find out about it soon.

285
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,600
I've already notified the head of each family to gather their troops

286
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,130
to wage war against the Emperor of the Human Clan.

287
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,540
Head of the Xue Family.

288
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,320
Go back to Ningzhou at once.

289
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,770
I'll leave it to you to work on our defense.

290
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

291
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,300
When are you going back to Ningzhou?

292
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,900
I still have things to do in Tianqi.

293
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,970
You are the ones who want to eliminate the Emperor of the Human Clan. Right?

294
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,290
Now, you have the perfect opportunity.

295
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,560
Please explain it further to us.

296
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,390
The Emperor of the Human Clan is busy preparing for his wedding now.

297
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,890
He won't have time to set troops to Ningzhou.

298
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,080
But he's cunning and has a lot of experience on the battlefield.

299
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,230
He's the nemesis of our Winged Clan.

300
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,760
If we don't get rid of him, do you think you can live in peace?

301
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,480
Do you have a way to defeat him?

302
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,150
This Qionghua Spear is a powerful weapon against the Emperor of the Human Clan.

303
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,510
I will kill him this time.

304
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,720
- Chao will perish!
- Chao will perish!

305
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,370
May Your Majesty rule over the Nine States soon!

306
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,820
This is of good quality.

307
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,810
Take a look at this.

308
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,530
Take a look at these fresh hazelnuts.

309
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,950
Sang Dan, I'll let you be in charge of the traders' path in Wanzhou this time.

310
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,130
Chu Ye, come up with a way to improve the pearl business of the merfolks.

311
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,680
That way, we won't have to worry about our food supply.

312
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,380
No problem. You can rest assured, Your Highness.

313
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,730
A'Lian.

314
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,880
Zhu Ying?

315
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,810
You can leave first.

316
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,740
Yes, Your Highness.

317
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,530
What is it? What happened?

318
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,880
We've received news from Tianqi.

319
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,040
His Majesty is going to get married soon.

320
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,600
And he'll take Bai Lu as the empress.

321
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,290
Yezi? She's going to be the empress?

322
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,060
In the past, I had already noticed that His Majesty was treating her differently.

323
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,040
Now, he's going to take her as his empress.

324
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,400
I think this is both good for her and Yuezhou, right?

325
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,460
Looks like we need to get ready to depart to Tianqi

326
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,880
to congratulate His Majesty and Bai Lu on their marriage.

327
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,320
I'm afraid that I can't go this time.

328
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,530
Are you feeling unwell?

329
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,300
- I...
- I'll get a physician right now.

330
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,200
Zhu Ying, the physician has already taken a look at me.

331
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,120
What did the physician say?

332
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,120
You are going to be a father.

333
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,860
I'm going to be...

334
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm going to be a father?

335
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,500
We have a child now?

336
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,170
- I'm going to be a father!
- Let me down.

337
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
Let me down. Don't hurt the baby.

338
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry, baby's mother.

339
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,660
From now on, I'll protect you

340
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,030
and our child forever.

341
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,050
We already have a tentative flow chart of the wedding.

342
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,740
Please take a look at it.

343
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,330
Are you sure everything is ready?

344
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,860
Yes.

345
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,570
Since it's your wedding, you should send an envoy to go in your stead.

346
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,960
And you can wait at Guangyang Palace.

347
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,790
When the empress has arrived, you can go out

348
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,620
and enter Qianyuan Hall together with the empress.

349
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,660
And the officials will wait for you at the meeting hall.

350
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,840
When you and the empress have taken your seats,

351
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,940
the officials will come out from the meeting hall

352
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,780
to hear you confer the title to Her Majesty.

353
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,280
What do you think?

354
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,470
Very good.

355
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,390
We'll do that.

356
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,820
Your Majesty, according to tradition, the city gate has to be opened for three days

357
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,260
so that the people can celebrate your wedding with you.

358
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,570
But...

359
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,640
But what?

360
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,560
Consort Tian was killed and we haven't caught the culprit yet.

361
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,000
As a precaution, shouldn't we cancel that?

362
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,690
Isn't it better for them to come?

363
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,390
We have His Majesty and the Winged Guards.

364
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,850
We don't have to be afraid of those sneaky rats.

365
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,600
By opening the city gate, it can show how close you are to your people.

366
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,370
We'll do that then.

367
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,620
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

368
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,720
Have mercy!

369
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,150
Greetings, Winged Emperor.

370
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,480
Now that I've seen the legendary artifact today,

371
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,650
I can see that it's indeed extraordinary.

372
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,140
What is the meaning of this?

373
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,620
I just wanted to verify something.

374
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,220
I'm sure it didn't do you any harm.

375
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,000
Official Fan, you don't trust my capability?

376
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
Winged Emperor, you've misunderstood.

377
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,710
I just wanted to see how powerful the Guxuan secret arts skills can be.

378
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,240
Guxuan secret arts skills?

379
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,300
I'm fortunate enough to have hired a master who is an expert

380
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,400
in the Guxuan secret arts skills to help us.

381
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,560
After I mastered the Guxuan secret arts skills, I thought that I was invincible.

382
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,020
And I once boasted to the Great Steward

383
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,510
that even the master of an artifact wouldn't be able to defeat me.

384
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,420
After fighting with you today,

385
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
I realized that the weapon made by the Truth Master

386
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,910
is indeed extraordinary.

387
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,820
I'm impressed.

388
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,970
Are you planning to kill Yu Xiuming

389
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,590
with the power of this mystic who has mastered the Guxuan secret arts skills?

390
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,120
That was my plan before this.

391
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,260
I've been at his side for many years.

392
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,940
And I've seen him fight more than 100 times on the battlefield.

393
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,990
He could always turn the tables when he was in an adverse situation.

394
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,810
He had done that many times.

395
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,520
Although he has lost his divine power now,

396
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,710
I'm still cautious of him.

397
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,780
Although you have an artifact with you,

398
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,690
if you want to win this battle, do hear me out on my plan and strategy.

399
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,970
I'm here in person today

400
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,120
because I want to listen to your brilliant plan.

401
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,240
For Yu Xiuming's wedding this time,

402
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,940
the city gate will open and there'll be no curfew.

403
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,810
The mercenaries I've hired will take over the city gate of Tianqi.

404
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,130
We'll take control of the imperial army.

405
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:31,110
When the time comes, this mystic will help you get straight to Qianyuan Hall.

406
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,600
To make sure that everything is kept a secret,

407
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,720
this will be the only meeting between us.

408
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,920
From today onward, there's no need to contact me at all.

409
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,890
Official Fan, you sound so sure. But how can we trust you?

410
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,940
If you change your mind,

411
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,550
are you going to let our emperor raid the palace himself?

412
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,570
Now that it has come to this, neither the Winged Emperor nor me

413
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,130
can take it anymore. And there is no going back either.

414
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:13,640
Even without your help, my plan will go on.

415
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,470
I also believe that with the city gate wide open,

416
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,990
you'll be able to enter the palace without any hiccups.

417
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm truly sincere in this collaboration.

418
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,450
Farewell, Winged Emperor.

419
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:45,960
Master, based on your observation, who will win? Yu Xiuming or Yi Wuyou?

420
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,520
It's a fight between the two masters of artifacts.

421
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,440
I'm just a commoner. I wouldn't dare to predict the outcome.

422
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,810
You have a lot of trusted subordinates in the palace.

423
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,900
If you wanted to overthrow him, you could've done so.

424
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,460
But Yu Xiuming is too powerful and can't be subdued.

425
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,260
So, what you need

426
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,050
is a person who can wound him badly.

427
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,690
With me here, we have a 50% success rate.

428
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,640
Moreover, we have the artifact of the Winged Emperor now.

429
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,630
You are right. Yi Wuyou just needs to cause serious injury to Yu Xiuming.

430
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,850
You just need to hold back Yu Xiuming's Dark Guard.

431
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,061
The imperial army has been taken over by my people.

432
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:31,741
With the city gate wide open, the imperial city will be done for.

433
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:34,330
But make sure not to use your power too much.

434
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,390
When Yi Wuyou and Yu Xiuming are both badly injured,

435
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:42,450
please kill them both.

436
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,460
Young Master.

437
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,950
I've found a magical weapon for you for tomorrow's assassination.

438
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,960
Thank you.

439
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
You don't have to thank me.

440
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,820
Let's go.

441
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,940
That person is from Yebei.

442
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
I know who you are.

443
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,580
Although you are powerful, if you act rashly,

444
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,530
I guarantee that I can behead you faster

445
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,480
than you can chant your spell.

446
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,860
Who are you?

447
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Come with me.

448
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,230
Father!

449
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,660
Ping'er, what is it?

450
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,960
Just now, I saw Fan Zheng with an mystic in a black robe.

451
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,770
And I saw Fan Yu gather a group of mercenaries in secret.

452
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,430
What are they trying to do again?

453
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:44,180
I'm the one who asked Fan Yu to hire mercenaries.

454
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,600
Father, no matter what, His Majesty is your cousin.

455
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,370
Even if someone is trying to frame us,

456
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm sure His Majesty will get to the bottom of it.

457
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,670
As long as you don't encourage Fan Zheng to dream of getting the throne for himself.

458
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,870
Stop putting our family in danger.

459
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,840
What did you say? Who's putting our family in danger?

460
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,320
Don't you know why Shengnan died?

461
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,540
You... Your life is too carefree!

462
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,010
You never contribute to our family.

463
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,620
You just know how to enjoy your life with your loved ones without worrying about anything!

464
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,470
Now, you are criticizing me for being greedy for money and power.

465
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,560
Without me to provide a safe harbor for you,

466
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,970
how can you enjoy the life that you have today?

467
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,080
- I...
- Let me tell you, Fan Ping.

468
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,640
Now, our family can no longer enjoy our wealth and fortune.

469
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,800
If I don't fight for our future generation, our family will be lost forever!

470
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,520
- Father!
- Enough!

471
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,830
Go back and protect your own son.

472
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,850
Protect him and watch him grow.

473
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,150
When the time comes,

474
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,870
you'll understand the love and effort of a father.

475
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,020
Father...

476
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,810
Ping'er, I am actually from the Xue Family of Ningzhou.

477
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,580
Now that my family is in trouble, I can't just abandon them and save myself.

478
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,180
Farewell, my dear. May you have a good life

479
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,070
after our separation.

480
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,130
Tang Yuan.

481
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,330
This day has eventually come.

482
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,020
How could you do this?

483
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,500
Your Majesty.

484
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,090
What is it?

485
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,930
I found Fengyin.

486
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,180
Where is he?

487
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,430
Where is he?

488
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,320
He's dead.

489
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,190
I found his body in the wilderness.

490
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,930
Fengyin had a much keener eye and better martial arts skills than me.

491
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,130
And he had always been cautious.

492
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,570
How did he...

493
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,790
Who did it?

494
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:47,515
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

495
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:50,815
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

496
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:56,395
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

497
00:42:57,235 --> 00:43:00,595
♫ Time as a scroll ♫

498
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:03,015
♫ The stars as the inkstone ♫

499
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:09,095
♫ Writing with the light of the sea ♫

500
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:13,155
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

501
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:16,395
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

502
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:22,835
♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

503
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,955
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

504
00:43:25,955 --> 00:43:29,155
♫ Void of someone ♫

505
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:34,135
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

506
00:43:34,135 --> 00:43:37,135
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

507
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:40,335
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

508
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:46,695
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

509
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:53,155
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

510
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:59,655
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

511
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:06,135
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

512
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:12,315
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

513
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:15,575
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

514
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:18,775
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

515
00:44:18,775 --> 00:44:25,335
♫ We enter the battlefield for the peace of the world ♫

516
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:31,595
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

517
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:38,701
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

518
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:44,675
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

519
00:44:44,675 --> 00:44:51,360
♫ The mountains and rivers between your brows
orbit the seas like a song ♫

520
00:44:53,175 --> 00:45:04,315
♫ The stars shine brightly for you and me ♫
