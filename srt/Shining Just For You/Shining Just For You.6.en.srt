[Episode 6]

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,800
Great Chao shall not adopt the feudal system but be divided into nine states.

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
We'll establish a protectorate in each state

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,400
with a Protectorate General managing the military and political affairs of the state.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Regarding the borders of the states,

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,700
the candidates for the Protectorate General,

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,000
and which offices to set up,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Fan Ruhui, I want you to submit a proposal after you draw it up.

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
I object, Your Majesty!

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Your Majesty, if the Protectorate General takes charge of military and political affairs,

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm afraid Your Majesty will live

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,900
with worries day and night

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,899
if they assume too much power.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,100
The Protectorate Generals I'm appointing are my most trustworthy ministers.

29
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,400
How can I doubt their loyalty?

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Even a father and son doubt each other,

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
let alone a ruler and his ministers?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,470
The Protectorate Generals are chosen by Your Majesty. They may be appointed by the imperial court.

33
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,300
But in terms of authority, it's practically the same as the King of the Winged Clan in the past.

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,200
If these city-states rise in rebellion,

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,700
the disaster of war will be in sight.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
Official Jie, I asked you to manage the Ceremony of Stars.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Now, the preparations for the grand ceremony are not satisfactory.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
You should focus on your own duty.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,500
My duty is to aid Your Majesty

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,300
by correcting your mistakes.

41
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,700
Compared to Great Chao, the Ceremony of Stars is insignificant.

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,400
Jie Haitian!

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,600
I've tolerated you again and again

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,900
that you've forgotten your place!

45
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,200
Your Majesty,

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
I'd like to impeach Jie Haitian for deceiving and humiliating the emperor.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
You distorted His Majesty's oral decree

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,800
and ordered the slaughter of tens of thousands of people in Yebei.

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
You've been harboring rebellious intentions and refuse to hand over military power.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,500
You deliberately try to influence His Majesty's decision.

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
What exactly is your intention?

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Jie Haitian!

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
Guards!

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Take Jie Haitian away!

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,100
Execute him in front of the palace!

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Supervisor Jie!

57
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,800
Supervisor Jie! Supervisor Jie!

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,900
Your Majesty!

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,000
Everyone, calm down! His Majesty is furious at the moment.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,400
If all of you plead with His Majesty now, you'll only make things worse.

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,200
All of you, wait here. I'll go and plead with His Majesty.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Please wait here.

63
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,420
How could this happen?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Your Majesty.

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Do you still want to impeach Jie Zhuying?

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Jie Haitian's actions are condemned by Heaven, which is unforgivable.

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
But I ask Your Majesty to show him mercy

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,500
and spare his family.

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,200
Director Bai, your counting rod fell on the floor.

71
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,600
It's a sign of great danger.

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,100
Bureau of Astrology, receive the imperial decree.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
"Former Supervisor Jie Haitian of the Bureau of Astrology has been executed

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
for acting presumptuously and deceiving His Majesty.

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,900
The Bureau of Astrology is the most important department of the dynasty.

76
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
It bears great responsibility and no matters shall be delayed.

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,200
I hereby, order Di Lanzhang to succeed as the Supervisor of the Bureau of Astrology

78
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,600
and assume all responsibility for the Ceremony of Stars.

79
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,100
He shall take office immediately and act without fail."

80
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,200
By command of His Majesty!

81
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,400
I humbly receive the imperial decree.

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,500
- Long live His Majesty!
- Long live His Majesty!

83
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,000
- Princess!
- Princess!

84
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,400
- Step back!
- Princess!

85
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Qingheng, what's wrong?

86
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
His Majesty's imperial decree has arrived!

87
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Jie Zhuying, receive the imperial decree!

88
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,000
I, Jie Zhuying accept His Majesty's imperial decree.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
"Jie Haitian deceived His Majesty

90
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,900
and showed great disrespect. He has been punished accordingly.

91
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,800
His wife of the Xiao Clan took her own life.

92
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
Jie Zhuying is hereby ordered to return to Tianqi immediately.

93
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
There shall be no delay."

94
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Why would my father die?

95
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Why would my mother take her own life?

96
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
You're lying.

97
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
Who are you?

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,600
How dare you disguise yourself as a bearer and deliver a fake imperial decree!

99
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,700
This is the imperial decree. How can it be fake?

100
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Impossible. Impossible.

101
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Impossible!

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Tell me! Is someone holding His Majesty hostage

103
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,000
and delivering a fake imperial decree? Tell me the truth!

104
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Commander-in-Chief, it's true.

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you don't believe it, you'll know once you return to Tianqi.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,100
How dare you lie to me again!

107
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,600
General, no! General!

108
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Get out of my way! Let go!

109
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Commander-in-Chief, it was His Majesty who issued the decree.

110
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Your father has already been executed in front of the palace.

111
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
Take care.

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
General.

113
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
General Zhuying.

114
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,700
Your sword.

115
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,300
I thought the trust between them...

116
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
would never change

117
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,400
even if the world turned upside down.

118
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
It has been 17 years.

119
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,800
My father has served him for 17 years.

120
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,400
He almost died during those days.

121
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
He should know...

122
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
that my father would never betray him.

123
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
He would never betray Great Chao.

124
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,600
He has always been so ruthless.

125
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,200
It's just that you've never stood against him.

126
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,900
It was not like that.

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He was not like that.

128
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,500
Back in the day, no matter what I did,

129
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,400
my father always protected me.

130
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,400
Now that he's gone,

131
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I don't even know how to seek justice for him.

132
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,500
Perhaps you'll know what to do...

133
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
after you return.

134
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
You're right.

135
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I should return.

136
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,200
I need to get some answers.

137
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,500
I...

138
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,300
- I want...
- Before I return to Tianqi,

139
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll take care of Yebei's affairs.

140
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Qingheng,

141
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,000
you're the only one I care about...

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
in this world now.

143
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,800
His Majesty has decreed!

144
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,400
"The state affairs concern me the most.

145
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,500
I have no interest in trivial matters.

146
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,200
I now appoint the Grand Chancellor, Fan Ruhui, as Great Steward,

147
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,000
which is equivalent to the position of Counselor-in-Chief of the past.

148
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
[Cai Can, Great General Who Guards the North] He is to take care of the general affairs.

149
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,800
Starting today, except for urgent military affairs,

150
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
submit all memorials of daily affairs

151
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,100
to the Great Steward first.

152
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,000
Only when Great Steward is unable to decide

153
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
can you submit the memorials to me."

154
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
By command of His Majesty.

155
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,500
- We shall obey as ordered!
- We shall obey as ordered!

156
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,100
Official Fan.

157
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

158
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I shall devote myself to the tasks

159
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
and not let His Majesty down.

160
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,600
Congratulations, Great Steward Fan.

161
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
You're the first Grand Councilor of Great Chao.

162
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,300
Great Steward is a founding hero.

163
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,700
And Madam brought His Majesty up.

164
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
During the Ceremony of Stars' investiture,

165
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm sure you'll be deemed the most meritorious person.

166
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,300
That's right.

167
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,700
With you sharing His Majesty's burden,

168
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm sure Great Chao will prosper in the future.

169
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,700
Also, it'll prosper for ages to come.

170
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,200
All the achievement I have today is granted by His Majesty.

171
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,400
If it weren't for His Majesty who established Great Chao,

172
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,200
I wouldn't have accomplished what I have today.

173
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,600
You're right.

174
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,400
Congratulations, Chancellor Fan.

175
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
I mean,

176
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,700
I should address you as Great Steward Fan now.

177
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,200
Brother Cai, thank you.

178
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
But without your support,

179
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,100
I wouldn't be where I am today.

180
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,700
Great Steward, you're too kind.

181
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,800
Great Steward, this way, please.

182
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,300
Brother Cai, you go first.

183
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
- Great Steward, this way.
- Great Steward, this way.

184
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,900
Come, let's go together.

185
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,100
[Manual of the Emperor Star]

186
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,400
Your Majesty, I've delivered the imperial decree.

187
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,700
How did the ministers react?

188
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,300
Official Fan was naturally delighted.

189
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,800
As for the other ministers,

190
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,000
they surrounded Official Fan to congratulate him.

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,700
One after another, they said that it was Great Chao's blessing

192
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,500
to have Official Fan share Your Majesty's worries.

193
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,100
My ministers don't seem

194
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,500
to lack the skills of flattery.

195
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,100
It looks like they really don't want me to attend the court assembly.

196
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,000
They think it will be easier to handle that Great Steward.

197
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,100
[Fan Residence]

198
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Lately, good things come one after the other.

199
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,100
There's another good thing?

200
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,900
Father, you're truly exceptional.

201
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,800
The second piece of good news

202
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,400
is that I've spoken with Left Commissioner-in-Chief, Zuo Jintian

203
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,600
about betrothing his daughter, Shengnan,

204
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,800
to be my eldest daughter-in-law.

205
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,400
Ping'er, His Majesty thinks highly of Mr. Zuo.

206
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,900
If you marry Shengnan,

207
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,600
it'll be a great help to the Fan Family.

208
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Mr. Zuo and I will decide on the date of your wedding.

209
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,600
[Fan Ping, Eldest Son of the Fan Family]
Father, this... this is too sudden.

210
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't want to marry yet.

211
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ridiculous. I've agreed to this betrothal.

212
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
- There is no reason for you to refuse.
- Father.

213
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,600
Father, if Ping is not willing,

214
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,500
I'm willing to take Miss Zuo as my wife... to share your worries.

215
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,400
Shut up!

216
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
Your brother is the Fan Family's eldest son, the successor of the Fan Family.

217
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
He hasn't married yet. How can you beat him to it?

218
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,300
He was only born two years earlier than me.

219
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,000
We still drink liquor and play the qin the same.

220
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
With what happened to Jie Zhuying,

221
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
he was muddleheaded and acted so recklessly.

222
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
How is he better than me? I'm different.

223
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
I've been doing all I can to rope in powerful people for you.

224
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
So that we can strengthen our influence.

225
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,300
- Also...
- You've got a lot of nerve, huh?

226
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,100
-Who told you to associate with those people?
- Father!

227
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,000
All the trouble that you've caused in the past,

228
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,500
I had to plead with His Majesty regardless of losing my face.

229
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
Do you think those city lords of the Winged Clan

230
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,600
sent you gifts because they wanted to flatter you?

231
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,500
All they want was for me to make them the Protectorate Generals!

232
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,900
Listen here. I forbid you to get close to them!

233
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,600
If these Winged People ruin His Majesty's great cause,

234
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
you'll also end up crying

235
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
at the coffin, just like Jie Zhuying!

236
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,100
I know what they want.

237
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
But one of them will be chosen by His Majesty

238
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
to be the Protectorate General of Ning State.

239
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
It'll be a waste not to take the money. Am I right?

240
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,600
Besides, I've already thought about it.

241
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,000
After the imperial decree has been issued,

242
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll return the gifts to them.

243
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,100
- All you care about is money!
- Father!

244
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,800
Do you know how much trouble you've caused me?

245
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,000
Are you here just to upset me?

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Get out! Get out!

247
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,100
Get out!

248
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Gu Wangran!

249
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
Gu Wangran, what's the meaning of this?

250
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
I've been in charge of the Ceremony of Stars.

251
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,100
Letting you review the design plans was only a formality.

252
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,500
Why are you causing trouble here?

253
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,200
[Gu Wangran]
I may not have experience in supervising.

254
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,400
[Director of Bureau of Public Works]
I don't know as much as you who's at the construction site all year round

255
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
But the accounts are in a mess.

256
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,900
How can I sign it?

257
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,500
But... Gu Wangran, you're still...

258
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,600
Do you need me to judge this?

259
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Who are you?

260
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
You're...

261
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm Bai Lu, Director of the Bureau of Astrology.

262
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,000
His Majesty is particularly concerned about the progress of the Ceremony of Stars.

263
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,400
So he ordered me to check the progress.

264
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,100
So you're Official Bai, the Director of the Bureau of Astrology.

265
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,200
What do you want to check?

266
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Which works are still not completed yet?

267
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
There are so many unfinished works.

268
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,800
These as well. None of these tally.

269
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
You...

270
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
Official Bai, ignore him.

271
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm in charge of the works of the Ceremony of Stars.

272
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,800
I will accompany you to see the unfinished works.

273
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Sure.

274
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
Let me give some instructions to the workers first.

275
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
You better be quick about it.

276
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,700
Official Bai.

277
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,600
Official Bai, this way, please.

278
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
Please come with me.

279
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,000

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Grab the stones!

[Bureau of Astrology]

Director Guan.

283
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,500
Bai Lu from the Bureau of Astrology is here to supervise the Ceremony of Stars.

284
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,400
Second Young Master Fan, Zhou Er said that His Majesty sent Bai Lu

285
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,900
to supervise the construction site of the Ceremony of Stars.

286
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,000
- Well...
- Why is she everywhere?

287
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,300
Bai Lu is evil, you see.

288
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,800
It's not that I'm scared of her.

289
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm just afraid she might say something slanderous to His Majesty.

290
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
It would be bad if it implicates Great Steward.

291
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
My father is such a coward.

292
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,500
Otherwise, this land would have belonged to our Fan Family a long time ago.

293
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,000
Mister, you can't say that. It's...

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,900
Listen. I'm determined to make money from this.

295
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,400
If you can't give me this amount,

296
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,000
you'll face the consequences.

297
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,500
Get lost!

298
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,300
Director Bai, all the documents related to the Ceremony of Stars are here.

299
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,400
I had a hard time getting them.

300
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
We're just checking the documents.

301
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Why did they make things difficult for you?

302
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,500
They kept making excuses and trying to stop me from taking them.

303
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,800
It took me a lot of effort.

304
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,600
Also, the official documents of the Ceremony of Stars

305
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
are always under Director Guan's control.

306
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
If these documents aren't complete,

307
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,400
do you want to ask Director Guan about them?

308
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
No need.

309
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,900
By the way, can you ask Official Gu from the Bureau of Public Works to come here?

310
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,400
All right.

311
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,000
Director Bai.

312
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,400
Official Gu.

313
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
You're here.

314
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,000
So it was you who wanted to see me.

315
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,100
I kept wondering

316
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,000
because I didn't know anyone from the Bureau of Astrology.

317
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,800
Have a seat.

318
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,400
Do you still remember me, Official Gu?

319
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
It's me, Ye Lingshuang.

320
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,800
I knew it was you.

321
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,400
But you changed your name and you're an official at the Bureau of Astrology.

322
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
I didn't dare to confirm if it was you.

323
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,000
I didn't expect to see you in Tianqi

324
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,200
after saying goodbye in Yebei.

325
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,600
I went to Yebei to study

326
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
and was almost eaten by a wolf.

327
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,700
Luckily, you and Princess Zhuyan saved me.

328
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Brother Gu, I asked to see you because I want

329
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,600
to ask you about the construction works of the Ceremony of Stars.

330
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,400
As expected.

331
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,300
Director Bai, please take a look.

332
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,300
This is obsidian from Mount Beimang.

333
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,700
The stone is hard and shiny,

334
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,800
and it's the best material to build the sacrificial altar.

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
Then take a look at this one.

336
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,000
This is inkstone.

337
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,400
It doesn't look so much different from obsidian.

338
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,800
But it's easy to break because it's not tough enough.

339
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,600
It should never be used in any construction.

340
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,700
The corrupt officials are trying to swindle money from His Majesty now.

341
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,900
His Majesty wants the construction done for the Ceremony of Stars.

342
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,600
There must be no mistake.

343
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,200
I really don't know what Zhou Er and those people are thinking about.

344
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,900
I know.

345
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,600
The cost of obsidian is over ten times higher than inkstone.

346
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,200
They would naturally pocket the difference in the price.

347
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,500
Are you saying they did this for money?

348
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,800
Official Gu, not only Zhou Er,

349
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,500
maybe His Majesty has very few things

350
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,700
that are more important than money.

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,300
Official Gu, can you please help me delay the as-built drawing for a while?

352
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,000
Don't ever sign it.

353
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,400
I'll find ways to stall them

354
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,700
and expose their fraudulent acts.

355
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,400
They switched quality stones with inferior ones.

356
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,200
So what?

357
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,300
No one would admit this sort of thing.

358
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,400
In the end, they'll demolish and rebuild it

359
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,600
to brush it off.

360
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,900
When that happens, you'll be the scapegoat.

361
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,600
I'm not going to be the scapegoat.

362
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,400
[Tianqi City]

363
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,700
Get out of the way!

364
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,400
I can't stay here any longer.

365
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
I've already returned to Tianqi.

366
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,900
But they won't let me go home to mourn at my parents' funeral.

367
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,400
Why is this?

368
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,000
General, I didn't mean to stop you.

369
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600
But according to the law of Chao,

370
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,000
tampering with the imperial decree is a serious crime,

371
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and the proper burial of the body is prohibited.

372
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,400
You...

373
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,800
General, this Yebei woman infiltrated our army

374
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
and followed us all the way.

375
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,300
You can leave first.

376
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,400
General!

377
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,600
Yebei people who leave the designated prison will be beheaded.

378
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,800
Do I need you to remind me? Get out!

379
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Why?

381
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Why are you also going against me?

382
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,000
You knew leaving without permission would result in the death penalty.

383
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Why did you have to risk your life?

384
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Because I want to plead for Yebei myself.

385
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,200
But I told you...

386
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,300
I told you I'd submit a memorial to His Majesty for you.

387
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,600
You can't even go home.

388
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,200
How are you going to submit the memorial for me?

389
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
You're right.

390
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,800
I can't even go home.

391
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,400
If he doesn't allow it,

392
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
I can't do anything.

393
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,600
I can't even be my parents' son.

394
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,100
I'll plead with His Majesty for you.

395
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,600
For me and for you, too.

396
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
How do you plan to plead with him?

397
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
I'll kneel in front of him.

398
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,500
If he refuses to see me, I'll keep kneeling.

399
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,800
I'll keep kneeling until he sees me.

400
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,800
General Jie, I've submitted the Mirror of Youth to His Majesty.

401
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,200
His Majesty said, "All right."

402
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,700
Did His Majesty issue other decrees?

403
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,800
Can I go home?

404
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,500
His Majesty didn't say anything else.

405
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Your Majesty, General Jie is still kneeling outside the palace.

406
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,000
Since he likes to kneel, he can keep kneeling.

407
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Concubine Tian.

408
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
Your Majesty.

409
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,900
How did you know I was here?

410
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,200
I went to Guangyang Palace,

411
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
but you weren't there.

412
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,500
I think you must be worried

413
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,800
about the progress of the Ceremony of Stars.

414
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,700
That's why you came to the South Palace.

415
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,200
If you want to plead for Jie Zhuying,

416
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
you can stop wasting your time.

417
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,500
I can't seem to hide anything from you.

418
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,900
I was just thinking that you watched Zhuying grow up.

419
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,600
His request is quite understandable.

420
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,500
Why must you make him resentful?

421
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm not that sentimental.

422
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,500
Be careful.

423
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,600
We traveled in fear from Yebei to Tianqi.

424
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,800
Wasn't it all for this moment?

425
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Princess, why are you hesitating?

426
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Princess is worried about the people of Yebei.

427
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,500
It'll be great if we succeed.

428
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,800
But if we fail, I'm afraid 50,000 people will die.

429
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,800
If you ask me, we should just head back.

430
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,400
It's hard to kill the emperor.

431
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
We can't even get anywhere near him.

432
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Keep quiet, you coward!

433
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,000
Princess, why aren't we making a move now that we're already here?

434
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,300
We won't have a chance to take revenge in the future.

435
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't fear death. Let me kill that emperor.

436
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
We can't act rashly when it comes to killing the emperor.

437
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,700
We still don't have the chance to meet the emperor.

438
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,000
We can only take one step at a time.

439
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,600
Tidy up the place and settle down first.

440
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,200
Without my permission, no one is allowed to leave.

441
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,600
Chu Ye!

442
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Father.

443
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Don't say a word.

444
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
You can't meet Jie Zhuying alone.

445
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,100
Both of Zhuying's parents are gone.

446
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,200
He can't go home because he's being held up at the courier hostel.

447
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,500
I should go and see him.

448
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,400
His Majesty wants to enlighten him.

449
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,200
It won't do him any good if you go and see him.

450
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
Father.

451
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,300
Mr. and Mrs. Jie have yet to be buried until today.

452
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,300
As a son, Zhuying must be in great pain.

453
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,600
Please request His Majesty to issue a decree.

454
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,200
No matter how he wants to punish Zhuying,

455
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
let him go home and bury his parents first.

456
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,600
Brother, why are you so concerned about Jie Zhuying?

457
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,500
Back then, because of his father, he stole our limelight in front of His Majesty.

458
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,800
Isn't this perfect timing?

459
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,600
His father became a traitor.

460
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,800
It's a chance for us to ridicule him.

461
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,000
You...

462
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,500
Darn you!

463
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,800
- Father!
- Zhuying earned his own military merit!

464
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
He's now the Commander-in-Chief.

465
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
Do you call this mediocre?

466
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,400
You still have the cheek to ridicule him?

467
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,900
Look at yourself!

468
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,700
You idle around all day without doing anything decent.

469
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,400
I'd like to know what you're even good at!

470
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,000
What is Brother good at then?

471
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,600
At least, I'd go to the government office every few days.

472
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
What about Brother?

473
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,900
He only holds an empty title.

474
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,700
He doesn't even know which side of the door is to the court conference.

475
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't worry about Jie Zhuying.

476
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm also his father's sworn friend.

477
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,800
I'll talk to His Majesty when the time is right.

478
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,600
Director Bai Lu of the Bureau of Astrology.

479
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,300
I have something important to report to His Majesty.

480
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
You're the only female official in Great Chao.

481
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,400
So everyone knows you, Director Bai.

482
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,800
But you were not summoned

483
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,300
nor do you have the Bureau of Astrology's seal.

484
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,400
We can't let you in.

485
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Then... let me see Concubine Tian. That's allowed, right?

486
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
He wants to meet His Majesty, too. But he still can't.

487
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,800
He has been kneeling here for three days.

488
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Just go back. Come again when you have the Bureau of Astrology's seal.

489
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,600
General Jie?

490
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Miss Ye.

491
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,500
Did anything happen in Yebei? Where's Princess Lian?

492
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,200
Princess Lian... is in Tianqi.

493
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,400
Where is she?

494
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,800
You can go and find her at this place.

495
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Thank you, General Jie.

496
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
What's wrong?

497
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
It's because of General Jie.

498
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,600
What are you muttering about over there?

499
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
It's nothing important.

500
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,300
Fengyin said General Jie is still kneeling outside

501
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,400
without eating and drinking for three days.

502
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,900
Under the scorching sun, I think he's going to faint.

503
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,800
When he was 13, he followed me to the desert.

504
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,970
He didn't even faint after traveling for nine days.

505
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,800
Now, he's becoming weaker and weaker.

506
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Just let him kneel.

507
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,900
If he faints once, punish him to kneel for three more days.

508
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,500
Wasn't he with Your Majesty back then?

509
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,000
He'd naturally be in high spirits.

510
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Now, he can't meet Your Majesty despite the close distance.

511
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,800
It's expected if he faints out of anxiety.

512
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,800
So many people are coming and going around me every day.

513
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,700
In my opinion,

514
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,400
only you two have a conscience.

515
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,600
So what have the ministers said these days?

516
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,300
Everyone stays away from him and doesn't dare to go anywhere near him.

517
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,400
Only Bai Lu from the Bureau of Astrology went to talk to him for a bit.

518
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Bring Bai Lu here to see me.

519
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,300
Do you know why I want to see you?

520
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,200
I don't know. Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

521
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I want to know what you told Jie Zhuying.

522
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
I didn't say anything.

523
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Before this, Supervisor Jie took care of me.

524
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
So I only said a few words to comfort General Jie.

525
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,400
If that's not what Jie Zhuying says,

526
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,500
you'll die.

527
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,800
If he didn't say that, it means he lied to you.

528
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,800
You should grant him the death punishment.

529
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,400
Is it up to you or me to grant anyone the death punishment?

530
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Your Majesty.

531
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,900
It's up to you, Your Majesty.

532
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Your Majesty,

533
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,500
I do know someone who deserves to be executed.

534
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,800
Is there anyone else who deserves death more than you?

535
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
Yes.

536
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Your Majesty, I never meant to offend you.

537
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,000
But that person treats you like a fool.

538
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
Who's that?

539
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,000
[Corrupt Practice of Ceremony of Stars]
Fan Zheng.

540
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,200
It looks like I do need to execute several people.

541
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,000
The old guy keeps saying how poor he is

542
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,900
while his son is pocketing my money.

543
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,600
Please come this way.

544
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
Official Fan.

545
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,500
- Official Fan.
- Official Fan.

546
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,800
What do we do

547
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,600
about the altar for the Ceremony of Stars?

548
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,300
What do you mean?

549
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,800
The stones used to build the altar were all inkstone.

550
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,700
If His Majesty pursues this matter...

551
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

552
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,200
But I do have one piece of advice for you.

553
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,000
If you want to protect your future,

554
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,400
just do whatever His Majesty orders you to do.

555
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,000
But , Official Fan, obsidian is rare.

556
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,800
If we start over to harvest them...

557
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Director Zhou, are you that useless?

558
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Are you telling me to do your work?

559
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,000
Or did I tell you to use inkstone?

560
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,400
See them out.

561
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,200
Sirs, please.

562
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,600
- I shall take my leave.
- I shall take my leave.

563
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,400
It looks like I have to pay a visit to the palace.

♫ The earth as a plaque ♫
