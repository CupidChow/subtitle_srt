[Episode 23]

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,970
Tang Yuan, not only did you deceive us,

16
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,650
but you're also trying to sneak away. Why are you doing so?

17
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,690
Master, I still have several relatives in my hometown.

18
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,230
Although this is something unspeakable, I still have to head back and tell them.

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,970
You and I are friends, after all.

20
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,940
Is there anything you cannot tell me?

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,290
Or Princess Xue, is it because you cannot tell me the plot devised by you and your father?

22
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,870
Tianying.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,510
Your Highness! It's my fault!

24
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,680
I couldn't control myself.

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,120
I fell for the eldest son of the Fan Family.

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,470
Now, I'm pregnant. I have no choice but to tell my family about it.

27
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,720
Your Highness, please don't reveal my true identity to him.

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,740
Yuan'er, what are you doing?

29
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,560
Get up.

30
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,170
Ping'er, Master might have misunderstood me.

31
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,320
Wuyou, I should've told you that Yuan'er and I were in love long ago.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,260
However, I couldn't find the chance to do so.

33
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,050
Now, I wish to take her with me. Please allow me to do so.

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,210
Young Master, we'll know whether she's speaking the truth after we read the letter.

35
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,020
Wuyou, must you do this?

36
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,890
It's a family letter. It'll be embarrassing if you read it now.

37
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,090
Wuyou, please retain a sliver of dignity for us.

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Master, you can read it if you like.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,970
Since I've committed such a shameful act,

40
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,680
I should bear the humiliation.

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,310
You guys can leave. I won't force you to do anything.

42
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,060
But the letter...

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,510
You can rest at ease now, right?

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,650
Tang Yuan, treat him well.

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,430
Master, thank you for being understanding.

46
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,440
Let's go.

47
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,160
Yuan'er, what's the matter?

48
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,800
Ping'er, I...

49
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,130
Is the content of the letter not appropriate for me to read?

50
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,510
I only know that you have many bitter reasons.

51
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,390
I know you have secrets that you cannot tell me.

52
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,710
But it's fine.

53
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,970
Now, you're the mother of my child.

54
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,590
I will give you a home. I will love you and respect you.

55
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,670
Sister, Qingsu is here.

56
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,370
Close the door. Qingsu, what's wrong?

57
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,020
Sister Yezi, Princess Lian sent us a letter.

58
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,090
The canal is in trouble. The Tubo people were killed.

59
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,920
Qingzhan said the culprits were seasoned.

60
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,210
They've already cleaned up the site.

61
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,760
In the end, he found an arrowhead on one of their bodies.

62
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,620
It's an arrow used by the Snow Crane.

63
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,760
Snow... Snow Crane?

64
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,180
Miss Ye, are you here for Young Master?

65
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,220
That's right.

66
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,210
Sorry, but he's not around.

67
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,930
He's not around? Where did he go?

68
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,560
He said he had something to attend to. Sorry, but I have no idea.

69
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,870
Young Master instructed me to tell you not to find him without any emergencies in the future.

70
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,990
What does he mean by that?

71
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,370
Is he not willing to see me? Or has he done something to let me down?

72
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,710
- You must be joking.
- I'm not joking.

73
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,810
Look at this.

74
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,750
I demand an explanation from him.

75
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,440
Miss Ye, you should head back first.

76
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,210
Fine.

77
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,170
I don't care when he comes back. Tell him to see me immediately after that.

78
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,330
Did anything happen today?

79
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,190
Young Master.

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,890
This arrowhead belongs to us.

81
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,940
Our men left it in Yuezhou. They picked it up.

82
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,700
Young Master, I was negligent. Please punish me.

83
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,840
Was Yezi here before?

84
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,270
Yes, Young Master.

85
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,090
Get up. She'll find out eventually.

86
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,090
Young Master.

87
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,100
Yezi, you wanted to see me?

88
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,850
Did your men assault the Tubo people in Yuezhou?

89
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,000
That's right.

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,180
Why?

91
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,930
Once the canal in Ningzhou is completed, the Chao Army can travel unobstructed.

92
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,530
For the sake of the Winged Ones in Ningzhou, I cannot let them complete the canal.

93
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,350
If so, you should've discussed it with me first.

94
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,330
This is what I must do.

95
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,540
Did you get yourself involved with Fan Ruhui?

96
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,190
Do you know that you're literally asking a tiger for its skin?

97
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,740
You're asking a tiger for its skin by staying with Yu Xiuming.

98
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,160
You!

99
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm the last descendant of the Yu Family.

100
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Reviving the Winged Clan is my duty and responsibility.

101
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,090
When I was in Yebei,

102
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,960
I never cared about Ningzhou or the Winged Ones.

103
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,750
I only had one person in my heart.

104
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,080
She was intelligent, beautiful, and gentle.

105
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,470
I could discard and ignore everything for her.

106
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,640
Yi Wuyou, stop it.

107
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,580
The past me was always staying by your side, like walking on thin ice.

108
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,310
As long as you wanted something, I would do my best to help you get it.

109
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,540
But now, I've finally figured it out.

110
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,490
You won't care no matter what I do.

111
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,020
I can only win your heart by obtaining power.

112
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,970
Yu Xiuming has committed many sinful acts to get to where he is.

113
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,680
Don't tell me you're going to blame him.

114
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
How could that be the same?

115
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,510
I will obtain power. I will also become the ruler of the world.

116
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,130
By then, you will treat me just like how you treat Yu Xiuming.

117
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,740
Fine. You can chase after your power.

118
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,810
But don't use me as your excuse when you want to rule the world!

♫ Pulling out, leaving it be ♫

126
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,900
Sister, you should have some soup.

127
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,210
Tell me.

128
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,770
I had complete trust in him.

129
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,270
And now, he's betrayed me.

130
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,020
Sister, don't be disheartened.

131
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,440
Maybe he had bitter reasons for doing so.

132
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,320
Slowly.

133
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,350
Yuan'er, is this place okay for you?

134
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,640
This is a great place.

135
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,110
It's quiet and convenient.

136
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,460
I love it.

137
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,150
I'm glad that you love it.

138
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,020
From now on, we can lead a happy life here.

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,110
Yuan'er, I wonder if our child is a girl or a boy.

140
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,640
If it's a boy, I can teach him how to recite poems and draw paintings.

141
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,440
If it's a girl, I'm sure she can inherit your excellent musical skills.

142
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:47,020
Music, Chinese chess, writings, paintings, poems, and so on, are mere interests.

143
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,540
I just hope that our child can lead a happy life

144
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,380
and stay away from the drama within the imperial court.

145
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,890
Ping'er, I'm thirsty.

146
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,410
Stay here. I'll make some tea for you.

147
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,330
Father? What are you doing here?

148
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,610
What exactly are you thinking?

149
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,840
Do you truly wish to spend your life with the eldest son of the Fan Family in a tiny place like this?

150
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,390
Father, please don't worry.

151
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,830
I've never forgotten my duty of reviving the Xue Family.

152
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,030
The situation in Tianqi is clear now.

153
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,310
Yu Linkong has joined hands with Fan Ruhui.

154
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,210
According to my knowledge, they've already eliminated the Tubo people in Yuezhou.

155
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,470
They'll join hands to go against the Emperor of Chao eventually.

156
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,970
After this child is born,

157
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,780
I will return to Ningzhou to assist you in military affairs, Father.

158
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,570
You must be careful.

159
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,450
I wonder why you've summoned me today.

161
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,640
Have a seat.

162
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,080
Your Majesty, why are you in the mood for glutinous dumplings today?

163
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,740
It's because today is my true birthday.

164
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,780
When I was very young, whenever it was my birthday,

165
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,440
my mother would make me sweet glutinous dumplings.

166
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,080
Now, my mother is long gone.

167
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,680
But I will still have glutinous dumplings on my birthday every year.

168
00:14:54,450 --> 00:15:00,250
If so, Your Majesty, I wish that your stable rule will last forever.

169
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,300
I already have that.

170
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,300
What I want...

171
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,080
is to close the gap

172
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,770
between me and a certain person.

173
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,640
Bai Lu,

174
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,230
you should understand what I mean.

175
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,900
Your Majesty!

176
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,450
- Your Majesty!
- Scram!

177
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,280
Your Majesty, wake up!

178
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,970
Your Majesty!

179
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,160
Your Majesty!

180
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,610
Your Majesty, don't do it!

181
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,200
You're Yu Xiuming! I'm Bai Lu!

182
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,220
You're the mighty Emperor of Chao!

183
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,540
- Your Majesty?
- Your Majesty.

184
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,150
Your Majesty?

185
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,390
What is...

186
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,710
Your Majesty!

187
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,520
Wake up!

188
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,100
His Majesty's old ailment is acting up again.

189
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,580
Imperial Physician, His Majesty has never exhibited such symptoms before.

190
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,930
What's going on?

191
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,160
Please pardon my ineptitude.

192
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,040
Right now, I can't give His Majesty a clear diagnosis yet.

193
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,110
I still need to observe His Majesty's condition.

194
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,640
You may leave.

195
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,500
Yes, Your Highness.

196
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,110
Bai Lu, were you beside His Majesty when he was suffering from it?

197
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,090
That's right.

198
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,610
Why does he always suffer whenever he's with you?

199
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,090
Sometimes, I don't know

200
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,050
whether letting you stay with His Majesty

201
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,830
is the right choice or not.

202
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,840
Your Highness, I was also taken aback when His Majesty was suffering from a relapse.

203
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,330
I was terrified, too.

204
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,690
What do you mean by that?

205
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,490
You should treat him better.

206
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,580
His Majesty truly cherishes you.

207
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,660
He moved boulders by himself on Zhenxia Mountain because of you.

208
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,340
After that, he risked his life to save you from the mystic.

209
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,810
That's why his divine power dissipated and he lost his immortality.

210
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,420
Don't you understand what it means?

211
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,290
I...

212
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,210
Your Highness, I don't understand what you're saying.

213
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,980
I shall take my leave.

214
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,560
- Official Bai.
- Official Bai.

215
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,590
Official Bai seems troubled by something.

216
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah.

217
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,230
Actually, His Majesty is very concerned about your safety, Official Bai.

218
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,830
Your Majesty!

219
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,110
If you continue to expend your divine power like this, your body won't be able to take it!

220
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,720
- Your Majesty!
- Even if I exhaust all of my divine power...

221
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,800
- Your Majesty!
- I have to get to her!

222
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,900
♫ Just like a lost amber, waiting for you to pick it up ♫

223
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,030
♫ I was once the lonely moonlight... ♫

224
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,720
Go to hell!

225
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,720
Your Majesty!

226
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,850
♫ I've not been able to cry for a very long time,
but I'm now shedding tears because of you ♫

227
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,720
My leg is broken.

228
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,960
- Yeah, as if.
- I thought you would never get hurt?

229
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,520
It's not that I won't get hurt.

230
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,830
It's just that I recover faster than other people.

231
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,050
♫ You're my ups and downs ♫

232
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:09,200
♫ A cold and lonely moonlight that dissipates
with the night breeze ♫

233
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,120
♫ I'm willing to lie in your arms ♫

234
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,090
♫ So, I was gazing... ♫

235
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,390
You're hurt?

236
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,160
It was because of my carelessness.

237
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,080
But your wounds would heal immediately in the past. Why isn't it healed yet?

238
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,160
I've sustained a serious wound because of you.

239
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,590
It would be my loss

240
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,160
if I didn't let you appreciate my scar of honor.

241
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,540
He moved the boulders by himself on Zhenxia Mountain because of you.

242
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,320
After that, he risked his life to save you from the mystic.

243
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,510
That's why his divine power dissipated and he lost his immortality.

244
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,710
♫ I'll never forget the ups and downs I went through ♫

245
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,900
- Why is Official Bai crying?
- I don't know.

246
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,630
♫ I'm full of hope, waiting for you to drop by ♫

247
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:12,580
♫ I'm full of hope, waiting for you to drop by ♫

248
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,360
Miss Yezi.

249
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,690
Brother Gu? Do you need anything from me?

250
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,230
I have something to tell you.

251
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,610
I've pondered on it for a few days. I think I need to tell you about it.

252
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,530
Before leaving, Yun Wen told me...

253
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,530
about the time-traveling passage.

254
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,100
Yun Wen said

255
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,830
the existence of the time-traveling passage itself goes against the law of nature.

256
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,330
It costs an extreme amount of celestial power to maintain it.

257
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,640
When one travels to the past through the time-traveling passage,

258
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,880
the celestial power within will cause irreversible mental damage to the user.

259
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,640
Yun Wen even said that as long as he is around,

260
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,790
you will never give up on returning to the past to save Princess Rui.

261
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,100
However, history cannot be changed.

262
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,110
If you enter the time-traveling passage repeatedly,

263
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,630
your body won't be able to take it.

264
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,470
And, back then, His Majesty wasn't trying to destroy the time-traveling passage.

265
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,880
He went back in time to save Princess Zhuyan on your behalf.

266
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,230
What did you say?

267
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,060
Right after you guys exited the time-traveling passage for the first time,

268
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,630
His Majesty inquired about the situation from Yun Wen

269
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,400
and told him not to tell anyone else.

270
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,980
It's a shame that it didn't work out the second time.

271
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,880
Worse, Truth Masters are not supposed to misuse the array of time.

272
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,510
Thus, His Majesty, who was blessed by the Truth Master,

273
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,470
suffered a backlash 100 times more than what normal people would suffer.

274
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,740
Miss Yezi.

275
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,180
Brother Gu, please stop.

276
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,900
Miss Yezi?

277
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,600
So, it doesn't matter if I can reverse time.

278
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
Fate remains unchanged.

279
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
A'Rui will still leave me.

280
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Where are you going?

281
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm going to do what I need to do.

282
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
I've been staying in Tianqi for too long.

283
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,200
If so, I won't keep you here.

284
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,100
But if you encounter any obstacles

285
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,600
or wish to come back,

286
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
you can come back anytime.

287
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,400
Bai Lu, you should take care of yourself, too.

288
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,600
If one day, you need to save someone,

289
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,000
you can try using this method.

290
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,700
His Majesty hasn't woken up yet.

291
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,000
I know.

292
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Your Majesty.

293
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,500
What medicine...

294
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,800
have you fed me?

295
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,500
It's nothing.

296
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,100
You are not...

297
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,100
allowed to do this ever again.

298
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Your Majesty, do you feel better now?

299
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,200
Did I scare you back then?

300
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Your Majesty,

301
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,800
did something happen to your celestial power?

302
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
It's the Truth Masters.

303
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,400
Your Majesty, what did they do to you?

304
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,000
They did nothing to me.

305
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,400
I'd accepted the power granted by the Divine Mirror.

306
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,300
That's why I become extraordinary.

307
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,600
But I don't know what exactly has happened to me.

308
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,800
Was it because of the time-traveling passage?

309
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
No idea.

310
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,800
However, this isn't my first time exhibiting such symptoms.

311
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
But this time, it's worse.

312
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,500
Your Majesty,

313
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,800
do you regret

314
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,000
accepting the Divine Mirror's power?

315
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
I don't.

316
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,900
Besides, it's pointless to regret it.

317
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

318
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What are you doing here?

319
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,200
Your Majesty, I wish to be your consort and serve you.

320
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
I won't allow it.

321
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,000
You're the woman I love.

322
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,600
I should tell you that instead.

323
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,200
I don't need you to serve me.

324
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,000
And I don't just want you to be my woman.

325
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,400
I want you to be my empress.

326
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
I want you to be the Empress of Chao.

327
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,200
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

328
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Why?

329
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,400
Are you going to reject me again?

330
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,400
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

331
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
No.

332
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Why would I reject Your Majesty?

333
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,400
All women in the world desire to be your empress.

334
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But, Your Majesty, I want to ask you something.

335
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
What do you like about me?

336
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,800
♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

337
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,000
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

338
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You look ordinary.

339
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,600
You have a bad temper.

340
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,300
And you say you hate me from time to time.

341
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,000
However, you're just like me.

342
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Isn't that good?

343
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,400
Your Majesty is a wise ruler unlike anyone has ever seen.

344
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,600
You never lose in war, and you're a brilliant strategist.

345
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,400
So, Your Majesty, for a ruler like you,

346
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
don't you think you should have an empress

347
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,900
who can join you in your battle?

348
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,900
What do you mean by that?

349
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,200
Your Majesty, I have a request.

350
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm willing to be your empress.

351
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,200
However, I still wish to remain in the Bureau of Astrology.

352
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,500
Please grant me your permission.

353
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,800
You're going to become the empress, you know?

354
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,300
Why do you still want to work in the Bureau of Astrology?

355
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,400
I can promise you that.

356
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,100
However, it all depends on how grand your dowries are.

357
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,800
I got them ready long ago.

358
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,300
Now,

359
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
close your eyes.

360
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Close them.

361
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Don't open them.

362
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,600
♫ ...countless sleepless nights ♫

363
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,300
♫ You are like the melody of my life ♫

364
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,800
♫ You hold a special place in my heart ♫

365
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,000
♫ You are the only one I want in life ♫

366
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
♫ I'll trade my youth for yours ♫

367
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,400
♫ I'll trade my youth for your kiss ♫

368
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,000
It's ready!

369
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,300
Look!

370
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,900
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

371
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,600
Are those our life stars?

372
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,400
That's right.

373
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,400
From now on, everyone in the world can see

374
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,100
that our life stars are shining together.

375
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,700
This dowry of yours came at an inappropriate time.

376
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,400
You know that I don't believe in destiny.

377
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,200
I don't believe in it either.

378
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,100
But I want the people of the world

379
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,400
to see that we are one.

380
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,500
You will marry me. And you have to marry me.

381
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,400
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

382
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay.

383
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,600
When court is in session,

384
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,000
I will announce our wedding to the entire court.

385
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I will let everyone see

386
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,500
that we're one.

387
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
This isn't the entrance to the Stone Vault either?

388
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,700
Why is this place so hard to find?

389
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,800
Excuse me.

390
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,300
It's you?

391
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,600
Are you here for my master?

392
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,900
That's right.

393
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,300
My master passed away last month.

394
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,600
She wanted me to be the new Aluoka.

395
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,000
But there are still plenty of things I need to learn.

396
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Since it's the intention of the former Aluoka,

397
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm sure you can do it.

398
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Thank you.

399
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
So why do you want to see my master?

400
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,800
Maybe I can be of help.

401
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,800
This is the sacred weapon of the Winged Clan.

402
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,800
I hope that Aluoka can repair it.

403
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Of course, it can be repaired.

404
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,800
However, there's no Starstone in the tip.

405
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,100
As long as you can retrieve the Starstone within the tip,

406
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,300
the elders of Heluo can definitely repair it.

407
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,000
It's a shame that I can't find

408
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,600
the Starstone no matter where I go.

409
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I heard that Starstones

410
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,800
are often found beside people who are blessed by the Truth Masters.

411
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,200
People blessed by Truth Masters?

412
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,000
Lingshuang...

413
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,000
is blessed by the Truth Masters.

414
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
Blessed by the Truth Masters?

415
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,800
Look. Is it this one?

416
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,700
Young Master, don't worry.

417
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,600
This is the Winged Clan's sacred weapon.

418
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,800
The Heluo Clan will be careful with it.

419
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,100
How was it?

420
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,800
Young Master, congratulations. Both the mother and the son are safe.

421
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
- It's a son?
- That's right.

422
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,400
Madam gave birth to a chubby boy.

423
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
Thank you.

424
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,600
Good boy.

425
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,400
Madam Liu, let me do it.

426
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Carry him properly.

427
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay. You can resume your work.

428
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
Okay.

429
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,400
Yuan'er.

430
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
Look.

431
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,200
Isn't he adorable?

432
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,600
Are you tired?

433
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,000
You should take a break.

434
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
Not at all.

435
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,000
I feel happy when I see you two like this.

436
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,700
You see,

437
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,200
I've let you down.

438
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
I couldn't marry you.

439
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Now, you've given birth to our son.

440
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,700
I will tell Father that I will marry you officially.

441
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,100
You know that I don't care about the title.

442
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,000
You may not care about it, but I do.

443
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If I can't marry the woman I love,

444
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm not fit to be a man.

445
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,700
But that's not what I need.

446
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,400
What about this?

447
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,600
If you're visiting your father,

448
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,200
you should bring our child to him.

449
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,200
That's what I thought.

450
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,400
I was afraid that our son

451
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,600
wouldn't be willing to part with you.

452
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
He's your son, too.

453
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,900
Fan Ruhui,

454
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,400
I heard that you've become a grandfather.

455
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,300
Your Majesty, my rebellious son committed something unthinkable outside!

456
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,700
Please punish me for my mistake!

457
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,800
This is a joyous occasion.

458
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
Why are you requesting punishment?

459
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
Fan, you're old now.

460
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,300
And now, you've got yourself a grandchild.

461
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,200
I should be happy for you instead.

462
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

463
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm truly ashamed!

464
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,000
This is my first grandnephew.

465
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,200
He has to be treated properly.

466
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,600
That's why I told the Bureau of Astrology

467
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,800
to name my grandnephew beforehand.

468
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,900
Bai Lu.

469
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

470
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,200
What name did you guys come up with?

471
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,800
Tell me about it.

472
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,700
After our careful calculations,

473
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,000
we came up with the name Tianshou.
(Bestowed by Heaven)

474
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Your Majesty, what do you think?

475
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
Tianshou?

476
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,700
That's a great name.

477
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
I like it.

478
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,400
I shall grant this name to my first grandnephew.

479
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,800
Fan Ruhui, what do you think?

480
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,400
Thank you, Your Majesty!

481
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,300
Those are precious words coming out of Your Majesty.

482
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,600
It's the honor of the Fan Family to receive such grace!

483
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,000
Thank you, Your Majesty!

484
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Fan, get up.

485
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,200
The Fan Family and I are relatives.

486
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,800
I hope that the Fan Family can become a big family and thrive.

487
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Congratulations.

488
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,000
Thank you, Your Majesty!

489
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,200
It's an honor for my family.

490
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,400
According to customs, we should pray in the ancestral hall.

491
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,300
At the same time, we can pray for Chao's everlasting rule.

492
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,700
All right.

493
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,200
Bai Lu, supervisor of the Bureau of Astrology,

494
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,600
shall be the rite official.

495
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,400
I will head there personally too.

496
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,500
Thank you, Your Majesty!

497
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,200
Thank you, Supervisor Bai!

498
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,600
Father,

499
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,600
why did you call me here at such a late hour?

500
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
You have to do something for me.

501
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
When Tianshou turns one-month old,

502
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
His Majesty will come to the Fan Family's ancestral hall.

503
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
I've already contacted Yi Wuyou.

504
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Recruit a group of handymen. Kill them and replace them with his assassins.

505
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
Father,

506
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
didn't you say that His Majesty isn't an ordinary human?

507
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,900
Can he... truly kill...

508
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Yu Xiuming?

509
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,200
I heard this from Consort Tian's servant a few days ago.

510
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,600
He said His Majesty was terminally ill,

511
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
and his divine power was exhausted.

512
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,400
To verify the news, I sneaked into Guangyang Palace.

513
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,800
I realized that his Divine Mirror was utterly shattered.

514
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,200
I think he must've lost his immortality.

515
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
However, His Majesty is hard to predict.

516
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
Maybe he's just trying to lure us out.

517
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,600
That's why this assassination is just a test.

518
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,800
Do it properly. We'll succeed soon.

519
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,000
We're finally going to take back

520
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,400
the things that belong to the Fan Family.

521
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
It's do or die.

522
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,200
That's right. He's my first grandnephew.

523
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,700
Your Majesty, it's rare to see you this happy.

524
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,800
What? Are you saying that I'm a cold person?

525
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,800
I've said the wrong thing again.

526
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,400
Fan Ruhui will pray in their ancestral hall in a few days.

527
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,000
I'll send my subordinates from the Bureau of Astrology

528
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,200
to host the ceremony.

529
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,900
I will head there personally as well.

530
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,600
Your Majesty, you just suffered a relapse not long ago.

531
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm worried about you.

532
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,200
I'm fine.

533
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,900
I won't die from this.

534
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,700
Your Majesty, could it be that you were affected by the time-traveling passage?

535
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Your Majesty, please allow me to join you.

536
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
That's enough.

537
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

538
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,200
Did I upset you again?

539
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm not upset.

540
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,000
I know that you're concerned about me.

541
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,600
I will permit you to do so.

542
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,400
Your Majesty, there's no me without you.

543
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,300
I will stay by your side forever.

544
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,400
You're Consort Tian now.

545
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
You're no longer the Commander of the Winged Guards.

546
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,100
You shouldn't worry about the things you shouldn't.

547
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

548
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
♫ The earth as a plaque ♫

549
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,400
♫ The sun and the moon as a poem ♫

550
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,300
♫ Turn the skies into the palace under the plaque ♫

00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,200

♫ Through several lives and reincarnations ♫

00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,000
♫ I search the world for wisdom ♫

♫ To smooth the folds of the years ♫

557
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,800
♫ There is a hole in my heart ♫

558
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,400
♫ Void of someone ♫

559
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,600
♫ Now I know what forever tastes like ♫

560

00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,600
♫ Draw the lines of fate, carve destinies ♫

564
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:04,400
♫ And our roles in the world with me ♫

565
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,600
♫ All worldly desires fall from your fingertips ♫

566
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,800
