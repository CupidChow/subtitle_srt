-Brother Yang.
-I think he must have found Brother Yang.

00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,420
They must have captured Brother Yang.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,250
Oh no.

5
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,880
My family went bankrupt.

6
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,380
I only had one last sum of money to open a shop here.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,370
Son, your parcel.

I'll try sending the numbers back later.

We can only wait.

11
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,090
Does he want us to help him?

12
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,680
We can look for him according to the address on the box.

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,850
Are we going to help Brother Yang?

14
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,920
Hey.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,340
Brother Yang, are you okay?

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,760
Didn't I tell you not to come? Why are you here?

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,680
I'm worried about you.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,820
If I had been captured, wouldn't you come?

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,120
Are you hurt?

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,100
Are you okay?

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,480
Did they hurt you?

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,560
Hey!

00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,560
Kneel down!

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,289
He's still injured. Be gentle.

25
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,160
Shut up!

26
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,810
Don't hit him.

28
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,580

148
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,110
Well...

151
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,780

152
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,200
Yes.

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,230
No, no.

154
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,970
Don't call the police.

155
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
If we call the police and they know it,

156
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,810
they will torture Phojai.

157
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,440
Oh no.

158
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,940
Then what should we do now?

159
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,070
Well.

160
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,790
Within three months,

161
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,890
we have to earn five million baht to pay the debt.

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,660
But don't worry.

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,190
Phojai will be fine.

164
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,930
A few days ago when Brother Yang was not here,

165
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
our daily sales were about 30,000 baht.

166
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,430
I think if we can work harder,

167
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,370
we will make it.

168
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,560
I know.

169
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,280
But it's five million baht.

170
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,650
Alas.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,140
That's too much.

-Yes.
-Guys, I know.

173
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,170
But we have to take the challenge.

174
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,720
Come on.

175
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,630
Let's work together

176
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,870
to get through this difficult time.

177
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,760
I believe we can make it.

178
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,530
Are you ready?

179
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,800
Yes!

180
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,990
Are you ready?

181
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,560
Yes!

182
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,810
It's just five million baht. We can earn that much.

183
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,700
Let's take a look at other goods.

-Yes.

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,610
And for those...

187
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,780
Oh, your new camera? I've never seen you use it before.

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,790
Yes, I bought it few days ago.

189
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,840
It's best used to record videos.

190
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,610
-Really.
-The videos are great.

191
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,320
Can the video be uploaded directly to your phone?

192
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:40,770
Yes.

193
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,770
I'll show you.

194
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,830
Oh my god. Look.

195
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,490
Not bad.

196
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,750
Here it is.

197
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,470
-For those who want to be healthy coffee drinkers
-That's me.
-Yes.

198
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,280
The video can be uploaded to your phone so fast!

199
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,760
Well...

200
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,660
The camera can be directly connected to my phone. I like it.

201
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,520
Yes.

202
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,500
Hey.

203
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,130
The boss wants to see you.

204
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,530
Guys, please follow me.

205
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,760
In this business district, the prices of goods are the lowest in this shop.

206
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,700
They have all the goods you want to buy.

207
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,850
-Welcome.
-Welcome to Little Sun.

208
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,730
Please enjoy shopping here.

209
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,830
Thank you so much.

210
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,470
You're welcome.

211
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,800
The goods in the shop sell so well.

212
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,040
I'll bring another tour group here next time.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,940
Hello.

214
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,030
Too heavy for you?

215
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,350
You're so weak.

216
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,450
Can I scan the QR code to pay?

217
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,370
Yes.

218
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,520
-Yes, you can.
-250.

219
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,620
Yes.

220
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,870
Oh.

221
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,520
-It's okay now.
-I just called.

222
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,440
-I'll do it as soon as possible.
-It's okay now.

223
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,920
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

224
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,090
It's not done yet.

225
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,700
It's okay now.

226
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,460
Well...

227
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,360
Handle with care.

228
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,450
Okay.

229
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,380
We can deliver it to you today.

230
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,570
Handle with care.

231
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,800
Which shop do I like best?

232
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,720
My favorite shop is definitely Little Sun.

233
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,130
Because there are so many delicious foods in Little Sun.

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,390
You can go to Little Sun and have a look.

235
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,220
The staff will warmly welcome you.

236
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,070
Are you okay?

237
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm worried about Phojai.

238
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,790
I wonder how he's doing now.

239
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,420
Phojai.

240
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,490
Just three months.

241
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,180
The sooner you earn enough money,

242
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,890
the earlier I can leave here.

243
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,360
But...

244
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,160
But if we can't earn enough money,

245
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,110
what will they do to you and what will happen to you?

246
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,780
Hey.

247
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,080
That won't happen.

248
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,400
I have confidence in you.

249
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,780
I believe you can do it.

250
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,350
You're my little brother.

251
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,570
Is there no any other solution?

252
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,430
Phojai.

253
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,340
But Brother Yang, don't be too worried.

254
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,770
Anyway, Phojai, I and all our friends really want to help you.

255
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,800
It's all because of me

256
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,990
that we are in this trouble.

257
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,710
Don't think this way.

258
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,810
We opened the shop

259
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,180
because we had the goal to make money.

260
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,630
Now, we just have to work harder to make more money

261
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,560
because now we have a bigger goal.

262
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,610
That's it, Brother Yang.

263
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,670
Brother Yang.

264
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,770
I was checking the sales figures.

265
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,220
We have sold a lot of our stock.

266
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,470
Let's go buy some more to replenish our stock.

267
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,960
Your foot is still injured. You can't go anywhere.

268
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,450
We can place an order on Makro PRO.

269
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,410
It's easy and convenient.

270
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,630
Oh, Makro PRO.

271
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,630
I was so busy that I forgot about this app.

272
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,930
Brother Yang, what are you doing?

273
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,100
Brother Yang, you don't have to do this.

274
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,750
I want to help you.

275
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,250
I hope you can recover soon.

276
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,240
Thank you, Brother Yang.

277
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,660
I should thank you.

278
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,030
Thank you for supporting me all the time.

279
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,200
Here.

280
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,990
Don't be too worried.

281
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,190
We'll get through this together.

282
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,790
We've gone so far.

283
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,819
We're close to victory.

284
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,430
I'll always be with you.

285
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,570
Brother Yang.

286
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,140
Are you doing the accounts?

287
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,740
Yes, we don't have much time left.

288
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,580
We can hardly earn enough money.

289
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,730
Look at the turnover. I haven't subtracted the cost.

290
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,720
Brother Yang, don't worry.

291
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,250
Have you ever heard of the Universe Principle?

292
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,410
If we believe we can make it, we will make it.

293
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,730
We will make it.

294
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,400
Don't worry. I'll always be with you.

295
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,230
Understand?

296
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,230
You're the best.

297
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,270
Hey.

298
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,670
-Uh.
-Qi'er.

299
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,770
Is Bojji on leave today?

300
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,620
Yes.

301
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,400
Do you know what happened to Bojji recently?

302
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:51,980
It seems

303
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,590
she has encountered some problems.

304
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,370
No, no.

305
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,810
She is doing okay.

306
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,780
Everything is fine.

307
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,890
Fine, I can tell you.

308
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,260
Well.

309
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,590
Her father had an emergency and was sent to the hospital so she needs 500,000 baht to pay for the hospital bills.

310
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,190
But she doesn't have so much money so she's been very anxious recently.

311
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,910
She really doesn't know where to get so much money.

312
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,410
I heard she planned to turn to an unofficial loan.

313
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,220
She wouldn't let me tell you.

314
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,140
-I'm also anxious.
-Qi'er.

315
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,900
This is such big news. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

316
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:58,770
She said you had a lot to deal with. She doesn't want you to be more worried.

317
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,870
She didn't want to ask you to help her.

318
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,390
Don't tell her I told you the news.

319
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,870
I'll help Bojji pay the medical bills.

320
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,970
Are you sure?

321
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,550
Not now.

322
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,620
But if necessary, I'll lend money to her first.

323
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,190
But it's been almost three months since we promised the creditor.

324
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,770
If you help Bojji now,

325
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,980
where can you get enough money to pay the debt?

326
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,810
But Bojji is one of our staff.

327
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,670
But I have the most shares in Little Sun.

328
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,670
I won't allow you to lend your money to Bojji.

329
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,020
-But...
-Bojji works for us.

330
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,640
As the biggest shareholder of Little Sun,

331
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,940
I have the responsibility to help her.

332
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,340
Brother Yang.

333
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,750
Don't worry.

334
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,230
Let me handle this.

335
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,940
Bojji.

336
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,140
Give back my money.

337
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,040
No need to count.

338
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,200
It's not enough.

339
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,210
We're still short of 200,000 yuan.

340
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,640
What?

341
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,510
You said you would pay off the debt within three months.

342
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
If you can't pay back all the money now, I'll capture all of you.

343
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,420
Go!

344
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,520
-Oh my god.
-Wait.

345
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,140
Hey.

346
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,990
It's you again.

347
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,460
Please wait a while.

348
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,750
Brother Yang.

349
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,330
Brother Yang.

350
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,670
Do you remember what I said to you?

351
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,030
Brother Yang.

352
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,110
Actually, I have some savings.

353
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,910
-My parents opened that account for me.
-That's your money.

354
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,880
I can't use it to solve my problem.

355
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,380
But...

356
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,930
I really can't use your money.

357
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,190
But you've already used it to help Bojji.

358
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,110
If we are only short of 200,000 baht,

359
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,080
I should have that much.

360
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,670
Phumjai.

361
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,250
I said I really couldn't use your money.

362
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,990
But you have no other choice now, Brother Yang.

363
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,160
Brother Yang.

364
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,020
I understand

365
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,070
when it comes to the money problem,

366
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,320
no matter how much money you need, you don't want to bother others.

367
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,200
But now we really have no other choice.

368
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,110
Let me help you, please.

369
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,770
Then...

370
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,330
You just think of it as my money to buy your shares in Little Sun.

371
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,200
What shares?

372
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,870
I didn't give you enough money to get the shares in Little Sun.

373
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,860
So you're not using my money. It's yours.

374
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,050
Deal.

375
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,780
Phumjai has 50 percent of the total shares.

376
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,390
Mr. Yang has 49 percent of the total shares.

377
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,420
Though Phumjai has more shares,

378
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,100
Mr. Yang has the final say on the decision related to the shop.

379
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,800
Because he's a discretionary investor.

380
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,250
Brother Yang.

381
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,360
You can take my 200,000 baht

382
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,830
as

383
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,380
my investment in our shop.

384
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,270
So that our shop will do better.

385
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,170
Let's be partners.

386
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,880
We should've done it in the beginning, right?

387
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,990
Okay, Brother Yang?

388
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,090
Let me help you, Brother Yang.

389
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:10,880
Okay?

390
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,110
Okay.

391
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,740
I'll accept it.

392
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,110
Enjoy the food, sir.

393
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,340
I'll get you more if you need. There's no hurry.

394
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,140
I'll get you another two, or three, or four if you need.

395
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,000
Let him out.

396
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,590
Guys, it's Phojai's voice.

397
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,610
What's wrong, Boss No.2?

398
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,680
Nothing. I slept for too long and got some cramps.

399
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,760
-Hey.
-It's all settled, right?

400
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,710
Yes.

401
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,130
Okay.

402
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,720
How are you, Phojai?

403
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,360
Are you hurt?

404
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,460
Are you okay, Phojai?

405
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,370
I'm fine.

406
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:41,670
Really.

407
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,640
Wait.

408
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,700
I heard him call you Boss No.2

409
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,440
or something else.

410
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,520
What is it? Did I mishear?

411
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,150
Well...

412
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,080
How could you let my competitors know our information?

413
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,820
What should I do now? Tell me.

414
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,220
Have you thought about it? Tell me.

415
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,190
Tell me.

416
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,680
I can help you.

417
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,440
To be honest,

418
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,430
But for you, my company would have collapsed.

419
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,700
Oh.

420
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,280
Thank you very much.

421
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,800
Too heavy for you?

422
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,810
You're so weak.

423
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,660
Come on.

424
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,010
I don't carry it every day like Boss No.2.

425
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,260
Look at his muscles.

426
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,710
I was so worried about you.

427
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,810
I shouldn't have been worried.

428
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Forget it. Guys, since Phojai has come back safely,

429
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,700
let's celebrate it. What do you guys want to eat?

430
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,460
Let me be the sponsor for your food this time.

431
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,250
The sponsor, yes.

432
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,200
I'll be the sponsor, yes.

433
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,280
What do you guys want to eat?

434
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,800
Qi'er, do you want to eat hot pot?

435
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,280
Phumjai, what would you like to eat?

436
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,340
Cheers!

437
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
So delicious.

438
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,280
Brother.

439
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,440
Thank you.

440
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,620
Great.

441
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,170
Guys,

442
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,570
there will be some changes about Little Sun.

443
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,630
We have an announcement to make.

444
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,710
Let me say thanks to all of you

445
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,540
for your hard work at Little Sun these days.

446
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,420
I don't know how to repay you for what you've done for Little Sun.

447
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,060
So I've decided

448
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,690
to give all my shares

449
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,210
to all of you.

450
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,030
Really?

451
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,840
The shares of Little Sun?

452
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,070
You are so nice, boss. I'm so happy! I'm going to be a boss!

453
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,690
Oh, boss, Phumjai.

454
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,790
I don't think I should accept it.

455
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,740
Give the shares to them.

456
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,510
You helped me a lot. I don't know how to repay you and Phumjai.

457
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,590
Bojji.

458
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,270
You don't have to give me the shares.

459
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,430
I think that's too much for me.

460
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,930
Just take it, Tag.

461
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,730
You deserve to have your own business.

462
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,440
Consider it

463
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,820
as a gift from me.

464
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,020
Thank you, Phumjai.

465
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,920
Thank you, Brother Yang.

466
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,210
You don't need to give shares to me.

467
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,790
I'm already very busy with my own work.

468
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,290
Me too, Yang.

469
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,220
Give your shares to them. They want to have their own business.

470
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,760
But boss, your shares left...

471
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,270
Yes.

472
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,480
It’s okay.

473
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,720
He is the real boss now.

474
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,330
And we

475
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:29,780
Oh?

476
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,160
have another announcement to make.

477
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,420
Really?

478
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,050
We're going to take three days off next week.

479
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,680
I've been waiting for it.

480
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,330
Guys, it's here.

481
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,370
Let's go.

482
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,470
Let's go.

483
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,400
Hello, mountains. We're from Little Sun.

484
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,500
Bojji, we've arrived. We've arrived, guys.

485
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,890
Come and get your luggage.

486
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,720
Okay.

487
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,670
Come with me.

488
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,410
I'm familiar with this place.

489
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,100
Brother Yang, come with me.

490
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:21,860
Phojai.

491
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,350
Are these all yours?

492
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,230
We'll stay here for only three days. Why did you pack so much luggage?

493
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,200
Are you moving?

494
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,300
Yes, I'm moving.

495
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,220
To where?

496
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,800
You told me you wanted me to move in with you, right?

497
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,800
So...

498
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,790
I'll move into your apartment after this trip.

499
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,500
Really?

500
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,000
Of course.

501
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,030
Are you serious, Phojai?

502
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,810
Yes.

503
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,060
I love you.

504
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,700
I love you too.

505
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,830
Okay.

506
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,890
-Let's go.
-Okay.

507
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,690
Guys, cheers!

508
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,610
Cheers!

509
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,020
Little Sun, oh yeah.

510
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,860
Guys, a friend of mine opened this new restaurant.

511
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,150
The shrimps are very delicious.

512
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,510
I want someone to shell a shrimp for me.

513
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,960
It's a difficult job.

514
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,450
I also want someone to shell a shrimp for me.

515
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,590
You want the shrimp, right?

516
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,180
Okay, I'll shell one for you.

517
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,280
Here you are, Bojji.

518
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,060
Thank you.

519
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,770
Are you messing with me?

520
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,660
You went too far.

521
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,760
It's fun.

522
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,340
Open your mouth, Bojji. Let's share it.

523
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,000
Do you want this, Phojai?

524
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,790
Yes.

525
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,300
Help yourselves.

526
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,680
I'll be right back.

527
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,670
Hi, son. How have you been?

528
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,530
I'm doing well here. Mom, you don't need to worry about me.

529
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,280
When will you come back?

530
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,040
I need to take care of my business here.

531
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,210
I can't go back now. But I'll be able to see you soon.

532
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,730
Okay.

533
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,080
Take care.

534
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
Okay.

535
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,240
Bye.

536
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,600
Nice shot!

537
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,780
Yeah. See? I did a lot better this time.

538
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:04,980
Yes.

539
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,699
You caught every ball I threw.

540
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:11,960
Well done.

541
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,320
Good job.

542
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,570
Good. Good.

543
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,330
Hey, you dropped the ball.

544
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:32,780
Nice shot!

545
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,460
Are you tired?

546
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,300
One last shot. Come on.

547
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,860
Let's take a break.

548
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,430
Brother Yang.

549
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,860
Do you know, I used to sit and wonder

550
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,690
when I started liking you?

551
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
But I can't figure it out.

552
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,580
Oh.

553
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,330
But you know what?

554
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,810
Whenever something good happens to me,

555
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,390
you're the first thing I think about.

556
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,650
I

557
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,320
want to share everything with you.

558
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:29,820
Well...

559
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,690
By the way, Brother Yang,

560
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,000
when did you start liking me?

561
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,420
I got it, I got it.

562
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,520
Pick up your phone.

563
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,090
I'm going to teach him a lesson and scare him. Just you wait.

564
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,990
-All right.
-Come on.

565
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,090
-One, two.
-What are you doing?

566
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,620
It's none of your business.

567
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,700
Hey, what are you doing?

568
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,090
Oh.

569
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,730
Damn it, I haven't filmed a video yet.

570
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,650
I'm sorry.

571
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,040
Whenever it was that I started liking you,

572
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,860
now I can't stop liking you anymore.

573
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,280
What are you doing?

574
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,530
Doing as you said.

575
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,230
What kind of love do you want?

576
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,100
Someone who feels comfortable,

577
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,340
who can share their feelings.

578
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,640
It would be even better

579
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:22,900
if we like the same things.

580
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,480
What would you do

581
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,410
if you really met someone like that?

582
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,780
If I really meet that person,

583
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,020
I might...

584
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,450
do this.

585
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,200
Congratulations, Brother Yang.

586
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,300
You met me.

587
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,940
Wait! Come here!

588
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,410
Where are you going? I got you.

589
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,780
-Where are you going?
-Stop! Stop!

590
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,260
Where are you going?

591
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,770
Where are you going?

592
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,550
Isn't it good?

593
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,360
Oh, it's great.

594
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,620
The sauce is spicy.

595
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,150
It's sweet and spicy, very spicy.

596
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,850
Guys, I haven't had a chance to talk yet. Don't laugh.

597
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,680
This is serious.

598
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,150
This is between men.

599
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,300
Try this.

600
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,330
Phumjai, open up.

601
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,250
Should I grill some more meat for you?

602
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,090
Thank you.

603
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,020
Does anyone want more food?

604
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,240
Anything is fine, I'll eat it.

605
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,990
I'll go help.

606
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,690
It's okay, Brother Yang.

607
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,230
I have something to tell Phojai.

608
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:02,890
Eat.

609
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:13,970
Okay.

610
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,080
Phojai.

611
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,430
Yes?

612
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,170
Thank you.

613
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,910
For what?

614
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,110
Well,

615
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,130
you helped me with the shop.

616
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,210
And

617
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,150
you chose to trust me.

618
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,090
Even though in the end,

619
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,430
I didn't make 5 million dollars in sales.

620
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,570
What do you mean?

621
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,700
It was just 3 months,

622
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,310
plus it's a new shop.

623
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,130
You've already done great,

624
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,330
my little brother.

625
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,380
Do you really think so?

626
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:17,960
Yes.

627
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,710
Actually,

628
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,670
I have something to apologize for.

629
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
What are you apologizing to me for?

630
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,860
Well,

631
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,150
I once told you that

632
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,430
you're a useless brother.

633
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,830
Hey, let me play with it.

634
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,790
No.

635
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,500
Can't I just play with it for a while?

636
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,890
-No.
-Just for a while, let me play with it.

637
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,920
Hey, give me my brother's stuff.

638
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,070
You rookie.

639
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,470
Hey, give it to me.

640
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,790
Do you want to get beaten up?

641
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,080
It's all ruined.

642
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,550
You're a useless brother.

643
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,150
I don't want a brother like you.

644
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,600
You still remember?

645
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,350
Tammy is so funny. Tammy!

646
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,080
You're a useless brother.

647
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,290
I don't want a brother like you.

648
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,170
Which woman would want

649
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,270
an unemployed person like you?

650
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,370
And to ask Mom and Dad for money like this.

651
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,210
It's all because of you. That's why my brother disappeared.

652
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,160
The number you have dialed is not available.

653
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,870
Please...

654
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,580
You're a useless brother.

655
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,940
I don't want a brother like you.

656
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,470
But that's not what I really think.

657
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,660
Sometimes,

658
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,970
I'm a little stubborn,

659
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,690
but for me,

660
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,610
you're the best brother in the world, you know?

661
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,990
Yes.

662
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,290
I want to apologize to you.

663
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,030
In the past,

664
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,920
I've been following you

665
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,250
and controlling you.

666
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,990
I just wanted to make sure

667
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,070
you can take care of yourself.

668
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,320
And I didn't want you to feel like

669
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,400
you didn't have a brother.

670
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,980
You're not mad at me, are you?

671
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,290
I'm really not angry with you.

672
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,420
My little brother.

673
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,440
From now on,

674
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,020
if you have any problems,

675
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,830
you can tell me everything.

676
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,410
You've been taking care of me.

677
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,760
I want to be the brother you can count on, too.

678
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,390
Okay.

679
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,570
Did you grab the chicken with your hand?

680
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,640
Let me wipe it for you.

681
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,320
Oh, no need.

682
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,620
Are you kidding me?

683
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,790
Wait, wait.

684
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,200
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,050
Do you think

686
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,220
I would forgive you?

687
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,970
You're getting your money's worth. I see you applying it every night.

688
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,600
We all have to take care of ourselves.

689
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,240
That's how you refresh.

690
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:00,840
Hey.

691
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,350
Do you want to try it?

692
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,170
Then you'd see its benefits.

693
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,620
Apply it for me too.

694
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,660
You don't even know how to apply cream yourself now, do you?

695
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,310
Hmm?

696
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,190
I'm done.

697
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,720
I'm not done.

698
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,820
It's okay, Brother Yang.

699
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:42,920
It's late.

700
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,860
Let's sleep.

701
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,470
Fine.

702
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,370
I'll make it up to you next time.

703
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:06,950
You said it.

704
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,100
Phumjai.

705
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:15,610
Hmm?

706
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,500
Wan an.

707
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:20,910
Does that mean good night?

708
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:22,830
Me too.

709
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,010
Wan an, Brother Yang.

710
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,420
But it's actually meaningful too.

711
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,980
Time flies.

712
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,200
We're going back to open the store tomorrow.

713
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,110
We haven't had enough fun yet.

714
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,000
Be careful.

715
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,760
Get on.

716
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,110
I just broke my shoes.

717
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,830
Brother Yang, don't exaggerate.

718
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:23,300
Brother Yang.

719
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:24,890
What are you doing?

720
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,290
I'm carrying you.

721
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,200
Isn't that good?

722
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:30,960
You don't have to walk.

723
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,110
Don't you find me heavy?

724
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:34,430
Heavy?

725
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,860
It's like holding a cat.

726
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,290
No, Brother Yang.

727
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,610
You always say that.

728
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,270
Brother Yang.

729
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:47,730
Yes?

730
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:49,460
When we're back,

731
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,300
come to my place for dinner.

732
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,190
Really?

733
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:54,400
Yes.

734
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,250
Are you nervous? You're going to meet my parents.

735
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:02,840
No.

736
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,100
We've met.

737
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:05,250
Oh.

738
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,290
How come I don't know that?

739
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,200
I went to see them when the matter was settled.

740
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,810
Like I said, Mom and Dad,

741
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,150
I got through this because Phumjai was always by my side.

742
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,400
From now on, I will do my best to take care of him.

743
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,180
I won't make him worry anymore.

744
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,460
And...

745
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,950
I want to thank you and apologize to you.

746
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,740
It's okay.

747
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,530
How come you never told me?

748
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,190
Why didn't you tell me?

749
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,700
Are you testing me?

750
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,940
Look.

751
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:57,850
Okay.

752
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,530
Someone is coming.

753
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,880
Yang.

754
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,500
Your mother and I plan to travel to China.

755
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,560
This guy wanted to go a long time ago.

756
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,700
Oh.

757
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,170
At first, I thought we'd go on a trip separately.

758
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,020
Because Mom and Dad would prefer to have sweet moments on their own.

759
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,330
What are you talking about? At our age?

760
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,190
It's better to let the kids have fun.

761
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,610
Shall we organize a trip?

762
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,160
That's good too.

763
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,970
Besides, we also have a Chinese person who knows the place,

764
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,610
so we won't be afraid of getting lost.

765
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:52,060
Yeah.

766
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,160
Yang, you can bring us around, right?

767
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,260
I'd love to.

768
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,170
Great.

769
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,150
Hello.

770
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,070
Sorry for being late.

771
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,620
My house was on the way, so I went home to pick up a few things.

772
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,180
Mom,

773
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,150
these are mangos from my tree.

774
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,950
Thank you, kid.

775
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:11,470
Yes.

776
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:14,270
Oh, I love this. Keep bringing them.

777
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,270
Thank you, kid.

778
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,720
Okay.

779
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,630
Sit down.

780
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,380
It'll be fun if the six of us go.

781
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,480
Where are we going?

782
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,770
We're thinking of going to China.

783
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,020
Finding excuses to travel again, I see.

784
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,910
Let's eat.

785
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,950
-Okay.
-Come on, kid.

786
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,150
Come over to my place for a meal next time.

787
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,890
Okay.

788
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,180
Thank you so much.

789
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,900
-Here.
-It's done.

790
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,970
Congratulations.

791
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:37,760
Thank you.

792
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,860
You're here to register a trademark.

793
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,960
Are you planning to open a chain of stores?

794
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:43,420
Yes.

795
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,430
Our chain mini mart.

796
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,500
Everyone.

797
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,600
Brother Yang and I

798
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,760
have something important to tell you.

799
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,670
That is,

800
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,380
we're going to have a second branch soon, everyone!

801
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,960
I thought something happened.

802
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,730
Great.

803
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,570
Congratulations.

804
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:30,730
Brother.

805
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,110
Phumjai and I are grateful to you, Bojji.

806
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,360
Your dad checked the location of the new branch.

807
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,280
Indeed.

808
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,790
If it weren't for Bojji, our shop may not be in the best location.

809
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,000
It's such a central location.

810
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,510
Don't mention it.

811
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,010
If it weren't for you and Phumjai,

812
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,780
I wouldn't be here today.

813
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,070
My dad got better because of this store.

814
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,600
I went home for the first time in 20 years

815
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,330
because of this store too.

816
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,650
If there's anything I can do,

817
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,440
I'd be happy to help.

818
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,420
Sister, it's all over.

819
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:13,890
It's okay.

820
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,720
Let's hug.

821
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,970
Thank you.

822
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,550
Everyone. On such a good day, I think we should

823
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,180
take a photo to contemplate.

824
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,330
Celebrate?

825
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:27,880
Ayy.

826
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:28,850
Commemorate.

827
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,320
Ayy.

828
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:30,620
That's right.

829
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:31,850
Let's take a photo.

830
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,530
Let's take a photo. Let's go.

831
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:34,610
Let's go.

832
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,190
Qi'er.

833
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:42,000
Who is this person next to you?

834
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,720
Stop it. We're just friends.

835
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:49,940
If in the future,

836
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,580
we can be more than friends, then I don't have to pay attention to other people's topics.

837
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,120
That way, I can have my own favorite topic.

838
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,000
Oh, Odo! I like it!

839
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,320
Hurry up.

840
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,380
Okay.

841
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,140
5, 4, 3, 2...

842
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,890
Little Sun!

843
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:27,030
[I miss everyone]

844
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,390
Brother Yang.

845
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:34,210
[Tammy, when will you come back to Thailand?]

846
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:41,640
[Soon. And I've sent you guys the original. It should be there soon.]

847
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:42,630
Tammy.

848
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,930
Nice to meet you.

849
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,270
You're beautiful.

850
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,500
Can I have your autograph?

851
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,530
There's a package

852
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,650
from Tammy.

853
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,280
This is it.

854
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,570
Hey.

855
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,870
Lian Lian Bu Dong.

856
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,820
Love in Translation.

857
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,630
Author: Tammy.

858
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,590
She wrote it herself?

859
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,930
What was it based on?

860
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,030
I know right.

861
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:33,060
All right, everyone. If you spend 500 baht at our store today,

862
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,710
you'll get a chance to win the lottery. It's worth 5,000 baht.

863
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,390
That's not all!

864
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,870
We have a special discount for today.

865
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,440
With every purchase of 300 baht, you get a free

866
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,900
-Oden skewer!
-Yeah!

867
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,600
Please.

868
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,660
This is unbelievable, Brother Yang. Our shop is almost a year old.

869
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,040
Time flies.

870
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,100
It feels like yesterday. We even fought over the name of the store.

871
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,010
Well... Our new branch will be open soon.

872
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,900
By then, we'll probably have our hands full.

873
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,520
I'll take a look over there and see if I can help with anything.

874
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,010
Wait.

875
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,730
What's wrong?

876
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,000
Do you have something to tell me?

877
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,670
Well,

878
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,330
I've been working with you for a year.

879
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,920
I have something to tell you.

880
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:50,920
Hmm?

881
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,740
You know what that means, right?

882
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,110
Brother Yang, this number...

883
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,230
This is what I want to tell you.

884
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,060
I love you.

885
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,490
For life.

886
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,600
I love you forever.

887
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,490
Phumjai.

888
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,520
From now on,

889
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,460
besides being business partners,

890
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,640
can we

891
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,150
also be life partners?

892
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,890
That's my answer.

893
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,160
I'll be with you forever.

894
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,150
I

895
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,640
want to be with you.

896
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,030
I have something for you.

897
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:39,830
What is it?

898
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,920
This is the ring my dad gave to my mom.

899
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:55,800
This...

900
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,910
It's so precious. I'm afraid I'll lose it Brother Yang.

901
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,530
I trust you.

902
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,350
You won't lose it, right?

903
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,010
But

904
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,500
I have nothing for you.

905
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,960
You've given me enough.

906
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:10,290
You're my life partner now.

907
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,260
I won't let you withdraw easily.

908
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,260
I don't plan to withdraw.

909
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,740
I'm the happiest I've ever been.

910
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
[Director: Phadung Samajarn
Worawut Thanamatchaicharoen]

911
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,460
Brother Yang.

912
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,740
Tell me about your childhood.

913
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,030
Or

914
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,850
do you have photos of your childhood?

915
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,080
I want to see them.

916
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:43,910
I'll show them to you later.

917
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:48,400
I'll reply the client first.

918
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,370
Okay.

919
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,500
Wait a minute.

920
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:56,590
Okay.

921
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,410
When I was young, my family used to do business in this building

922
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:17,830
before it was renovated.

923
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,240
I see.

924
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,350
Do you have friends there?

925
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,020
Yes.

926
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:28,120
There was a kid.

927
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,220
At the time, his parents often took him to the store to buy things.

928
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,810
Did you speak Thai then?

929
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,480
Then how did you communicate with him?

930
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,840
You know, talking without knowing the language.

931
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,720
I even took a photo.

932
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:49,690
What?

933
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,300
Brother Yang.

934
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,220
That's my photo.

935
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,150
Here.

936
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,020
Why can't I remember you?

937
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,760
It's not strange at all.

938
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:18,680
I was young back then.

939
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,330
But whether you remember it or not,

940
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,460
you're with me now.

941
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,240
You're right.

942
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,800
Tell me.

943
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:30,760
The two of us

944
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,180
are destined, right?

945
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:36,940
Do you still believe that?

946
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:37,810
Yes.

947
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,800
Don't you, Brother Yang?

948
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:42,870
In the past,

949
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:44,830
I didn't believe it.

950
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,430
But now,

951
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,260
I believe it.

952
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,950
Even though we don't know if we will succeed,

953
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,330
Start a business together.

954
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,180
I wish you good business.

955
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:24,710
at least on the journey,

956
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,030
Hey, what are you doing?

957
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,570
special things will happen,

958
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,920
and sometimes,

959
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,790
it may become the best thing in life.

960
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,830
Thank you, Brother Yot. Take care of Body for me.

961
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,510
Thank you for buying cat food for it.

962
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,640
I'll get going, Brother Yot.

963
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,990
Tell me if you need anything.

964
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:45,440
Okay.

965
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,880
Hello, Brother Yot.

966
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,170
Body.

967
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,700
It misses you.

968
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,210
Did you buy cat food too?

969
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,900
Oh, a guy bought some for it.

970
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,690
Sometimes, it's an incredible coincidence

971
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,910
to meet the right person

972
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,410
on a day when you're looking for something else.

973
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,850
-Tammy.
-Even though I neglected it

974
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,670
and only cared about other things,

975
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,460
fate will eventually make that person stand in front of us.

976
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,240
Just like you.

977
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,150
Who wouldn't like you?

978
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,140
As if to emphasize to us

979
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,530
that he's the one we're looking for.

980
01:07:51,120 --> 01:08:00,530
