00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,630
They like each other.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,410
Why should we stop them from being a couple?

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,990
If you want to do that, do it yourself.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,850
When I go on a date with her,

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,770
can I hold her hand?

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,310
What kind of person will you fall in love with?

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,570
Someone who can make me feel comfortable.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,300
Someone who has the same likes as mine.

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,520
Brother Yang.

11
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,530
When I was staying with Tammy,

12
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,290
your face kept showing up in my head.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,320
Do you know what wish I made in the shrine?

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,320
In the shrine,

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
I wished that...

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,160
Why did you kiss me?

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,849
-I was about to...
-No, no, no. Brother Yang.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,160
You don't have to answer.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,900
I...

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
I was just asking.

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:19,740
Wait.

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,750
How was your date?

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
How are things going with you and Tammy?

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,970
It's so late. Why do you want to see us now?

25
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,630
There must be something exciting, right?

26
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,190
-I think so.
-You're amazing.

27
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,479
Hey, you look so serious.

28
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,640
Tell me.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,740
Well...

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,940
Brother Yang kissed me.

31
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,110
What?

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,970
Did you say the wrong name?

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,370
What?

Right.

56
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,330
I don't get it. Why did he kiss you?

57
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,970
Didn't he help you chase Tammy at first?

58
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,530
That's true.

59
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,490
This is so weird.

60
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,250
I think you should talk to him.

61
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,690
Calm down.

62
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,960
Sit down.

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,170
Is it because

64
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,080
he fell in love with you when helping you?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
Do you like him?

66
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,550
If you do,

67
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,500
it is not a big deal that he kissed you.

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,600
-It's done.
-Nonsense. No.

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,290
Or...

70
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,490
You have feelings for Brother Yang?

71
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,570
See? You don't even know your feelings yourself.

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,750
He shouldn't have done that to you. Kissing means a lot.

73
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,620
Right.

74
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,030
He can't do that.

75
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,990
This is sexual harassment.

76
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,390
Hey, what are you going to do?

77
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,720
I'll call my guys.

78
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,690
What he did is worrying.

79
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,550
I'll handle it for you.

80
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,550
Enough.

81
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,130
You two...

82
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,380
I told you this

83
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,420
not to ask you to cause him trouble.

84
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,580
But...

85
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,110
I was a little confused after he kissed me.

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,460
Now I don't know

87
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,840
how I feel about him.

88
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,260
That's what happened.

89
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,970
I'm going to kill him!

90
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,190
Where are you going? Calm down.

91
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,990
You're always so impulsive. I shouldn't have told you this.

92
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
If you don't tell me everything,

93
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,190
I will punish you.

94
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,870
Was he insane?

95
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,100
Why did he kiss my brother all of a sudden?

96
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,440
Was it like this?

97
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,290
-Hey. Stop.
-You have food in your mouth.

98
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,750
Go away.

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,290
Where are you going? I want to know what it was like. Come back.

100
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,830
Stop thinking about it.

101
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,520
See you at the shop tomorrow.

102
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,690
Oh no.

103
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,460
Hey.

104
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,330
What are you doing?

105
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,980
Go into the shop.

106
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,340
I...

107
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,190
I don't know what to do when I see Brother Yang.

108
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,170
Oh.

109
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,420
I think there are only two options for you.

110
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,140
First, talk to him.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,000
Second,

112
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,450
just pretend nothing happened.

113
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,659
But no matter what you do,

114
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,130
I think

115
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,450
you should keep a distance from him.

116
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:44,860
Well...

117
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,290
He's been acting kind of weird lately.

118
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,000
All right.

119
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,100
Let's go inside.

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,100
Hurry.

121
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,760
You stay here. I'll go get the uniforms.

122
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,380
Hey, Tag.

123
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,840
It's okay.

124
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,920
Where is he?

125
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,810
-Hey, are you okay?
-Hello, Brother Yang.

126
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,110
-I'm sorry.
-Hello.

127
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,150
I haven't eaten yet.

128
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,770
I'll go get something to eat.

129
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,310
Bye.

130
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,860
Hey, wait.

131
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,090
Phumjai.

132
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,640
Did you buy stuff to decorate the shop again?

133
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,220
So much stuff.

134
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,080
Tammy asked me to deliver these things here.

135
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,180
The consignee is Phumjai, Little Sun.

136
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,280
How is Little Sun?

137
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,370
Well.

138
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,920
Still the same.

139
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,890
Sometimes, we reached the sales target. Sometimes, we didn't.

140
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll be free tomorrow afternoon.

141
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,130
If you don't mind,

142
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,640
I can go to the shop and promote it for you through livestreaming.

143
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:43,910
Huh?

144
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,880
Really?

145
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,530
I'll send the things we need to the shop tomorrow.

146
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,550
-Okay.
-Good.

147
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,160
Oh no.

148
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,260
I forgot.

149
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,640
What?

150
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,060
It's Tammy who sent the stuff.

151
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,620
She said she would promote our shop through livestreaming today.

152
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,490
Wow!

153
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,050
Phumjai.

154
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,740
How could you forget such an important thing?

155
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,330
Come on, open it.

156
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,610
These four are the same?

157
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,050
It's a bit heavy.

158
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,950
One, two, oh.

159
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,470
So big.

160
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,020
I've checked it.

161
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,780
Put it in the box.

162
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,160
Okay.

163
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,680
-Okay.
-Oh, and this.

164
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,090
Let's take it down together.

165
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,500
Let's help each other.

166
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,410
Lift it.

167
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,530
This is the new era.

168
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,090
Is it a billboard?

169
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,600
A billboard?

170
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,300
It's a billboard.

171
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,310
Can I help you?

172
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:48,920
Do it.

173
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,500
Sorry, I just put it in.

174
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,730
Tag. Tag.

175
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,830
Help me lift it.

176
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,230
-Help me lift it.
-Okay.

177
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,050
Excuse me, Brother Yang.

178
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,040
Here.

179
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,570
Okay.

180
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,510
-Oh.
-Okay.

181
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Hey, are you okay?

182
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm fine.

183
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,790
The floor is slippery.

184
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,060
I'll go get the mop.

185
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,250
The floor is slippery.

186
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,060
Didn't Phumjai say he would get the mop?

187
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,490
I'll go find him.

188
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,410
Okay, boss.

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,620
Be careful, boss.

190
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,240
I can't stand staying with Brother Yang anymore.

191
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,570
Well...

192
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,230
Can you find an excuse for me so that I can leave here?

193
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm serious.

194
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,750
I can't stay here and watch him for one more second.

195
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,550
Please help me.

196
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,140
Well...

197
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,790
I...

198
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,380
I think...

199
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh my God.

200
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,750
Oh no!

201
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,640
Is staying with me

202
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,740
making you so uncomfortable?

203
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,960
It's my fault.

204
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,510
I didn't mean to

205
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,940
make you uncomfortable.

206
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,070
From now on,

207
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,510
I will stay away from you.

208
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,610
You don't have to hide from me.

209
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,490
I'm really sorry.

210
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,180
You'd better talk to him.

211
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:19,360
I...

212
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,130
I don't know what to say to him.

213
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,890
Here, here and here.

214
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,370
I've mopped the floor. Why is it still so slippery?

215
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,510
-There.
-Why is it so slippery?

216
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,690
Look.

217
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,740
Bojji.

218
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,310
-Yes?
-Did you see Brother Yang?

219
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,780
Boss?

220
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,010
I don't know where he is, but I saw him walking out just now.

221
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,190
I'll be right back.

222
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:48,980
Okay.

223
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,110
If Tammy comes, tell her I'll be back soon.

224
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,410
Okay.

225
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,050
Hello.

226
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,350
Hello.

227
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,460
Oh.

228
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,940
-Hello, Tammy.
-Hello.

229
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,850
Are you looking for Phumjai?

230
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
He left just now.

231
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,360
Wait a second. I'll call him.

232
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,720
It's okay. He should be back soon.

233
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,740
Yes, he will.

234
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,360
Please wait a moment.

235
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,610
Where should I put these?

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,610
Oh, you can put them here.

237
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,670
Okay.

238
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,560
Qi'er will help you.

239
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,230
Tammy.

240
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,630
The theme of your campaign is destiny.

241
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,400
Is there anything special about it?

242
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,200
Oh.

243
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,540
I've been interested into things about the destiny lately.

244
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,970
And

245
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,960
the Qixi Festival (the Chinese Valentine's Day) is coming.

246
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,540
So I think it'll be a good opportunity for Little Sun.

247
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,340
It's like

248
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,500
the destiny leads you to the shop you like.

249
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,290
The destiny brings the right person in front of you.

250
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,090
Sometimes we meet the right person,

251
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,700
when are busy with something else.

252
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,910
This is also an unbelievable coincidence.

253
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,760
Although it's often ignored and we're occupied with other things,

254
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,490
the destiny will bring the right person to us.

255
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,660
It seems that the destiny is telling us

256
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,980
that the right person is what we should cherish the most.

257
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,030
Brother Yang, it's not your fault.

258
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,850
You don't have to apologize.

259
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,140
I couldn't stand staying with you

260
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,030
for personal reasons.

261
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,660
Actually,

262
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,750
I think I have feelings for you.

263
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,460
You know what? You look so handsome every time you smile.

264
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,820
If you meet that person,

265
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,530
what will you do?

266
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,980
If I meet that person,

267
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,250
I guess...

268
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,190
You...

269
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,850
You might feel uncomfortable.

270
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,870
But I'm pretty sure I have feelings for you.

271
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,570
Don't worry.

272
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,530
I'll handle it very soon

273
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,170
so that we won't be so embarrassed.

274
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,150
You

275
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,110
have feelings for me?

276
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,820
Once we meet that right person,

277
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,350
we don't want to let him go.

278
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,090
So the right person

279
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,970
for you is...

280
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,500
I also have feelings for you.

281
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,230
Are you thinking about Tammy?

282
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,730
It's okay.

283
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,050
Think carefully.

284
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,180
Follow your heart when making the choice.

285
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,580
Where did you go?

286
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,680
Tammy has waited for a long time.

287
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,570
Oh, I ran into Brother Yang.

288
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,160
Okay, just do your jobs.

289
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,140
Tell me if you need anything.

290
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,530
How can I help you with the decoration, Tammy?

291
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,410
Oh, it's all good now.

292
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,690
Oh, about the script...

293
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,130
Which part do you think needs to be revised?

294
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
I think it's all good.

295
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,020
Great.

296
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,830
Hello, everyone. This is Tammy's livestreaming from Little Sun.

297
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,860
Today, I want to recommend

298
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,620
my favorite shop.

299
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,660
That is, Little Sun.

300
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,070
The destiny brought me here.

301
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,980
And I see so many cute fans in our live stream.

302
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,600
Maybe when you come here,

303
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,780
you will meet the right person.

304
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,390
Brother Yang.

305
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,360
Do you like Phumjai?

306
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,140
Or do you want something from him?

307
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,890
What?

308
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,630
What do you mean?

309
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,420
That's what I mean.

310
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,970
I don't understand. Weren't you helping him pursue Tammy?

311
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,840
But after Tammy fell in love with him,

312
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,800
you made it complicated.

313
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,220
You made him think he likes you.

314
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,420
Why did you do that?

315
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,710
If I like Phumjai,

316
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,290
and he has feelings for me too.

317
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,470
What's wrong?

318
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,490
Now, Phumjai's feelings are the most important.

319
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,510
You should ask yourself.

320
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,010
Do you really like him?

321
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,590
Or is it because the closer he gets to you, the more anxious you feel?

322
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,200
You shouldn't hurt a good guy

323
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,700
like Phumjai.

324
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,710
Don't worry about him.

325
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,690
I would never make him sad.

326
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,700
Phumjai, what did you make me do?

327
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,340
Gosh.

328
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,820
Am I going to get kicked out now?

329
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,830
Come on, it's for your beloved friend.

330

I hope so.

331
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,130

332
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,670

That's my goddess.

If it weren't for Tammy, we would've been in trouble.

340

you made it complicated. You made him think he likes you.

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,960
brought you some noodles.

374
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,530
I'll leave it at the door.

375
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,900
Don't knock it over when you open the door.

376
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,290
What are you doing?

377
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,430
We're decorating for Valentine's Day.

378
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,630
Yes.

379
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,650
Phumjai, it's Chinese Valentine's Day.

380
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,800
Qixi Festival.

381
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,240
Yes, Chinese Valentine's!

382
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
Oh.

383
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,490
- The Qixi Festival in China.
- Yeah.

384
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,710
So beautiful.

385
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,270
Thank you.

386
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,500
I mean Little Sun is beautiful.

387
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,120
Okay.

388
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,830
Brother Yang.

389
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,890
Is this for me?

390
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,060
Goodness.

391
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,290
No.

392
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,260
It's the Chinese Qixi Festival tomorrow.

393
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,180
Go find Tammy.

394
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,660
Usually during the Qixi Festival,

395
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,890
lovers give each other gifts.

396
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,170
You should spend more time with Tammy.

397
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,380
You already have a gift.

398
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,130
Wait.

399
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,150
Hello, Tammy.

400
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,790
Are you free tomorrow?

401
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,750
Let's meet at eight.

402
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,230
Is this pretty?

403
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,230
Yes.

404
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,110
It's pretty.

405
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,290
I like you too.

406
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,800
Usually during the Qixi Festival,

407
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,710
lovers give each other gifts.

408
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,240
You should spend more time with Tammy.

409
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,080
Is this okay?

410
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,970
This one looks good too.

411
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,120
Go back and think about it.

412
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,570
Follow your heart.

413
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:14,930
Oh.

414
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,750
Did your souls switch?

415
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,600
Phumjai is moody

416
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
and you met your "true love".

417
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,290
But I should be the main focus

418
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,150
when buying gifts for girlfriends.

419
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,800
I need you two to help me

420
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,770
pick a gift for Qi'er.

421
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,080
- Please.
- I told you to take this one, but you didn't want to.

422
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,880
- Yes.
- Hey.

423
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,980
The two of you are just saying okay.

424
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,280
What's the use?

425
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,940
I think chocolates

426
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,080
are still the most suitable.

427
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,180
And it's meaningful.

428
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,010
The first layer of meaning works,

429
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,740
and the second layer too.

430
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,770
The first layer - it's delicious.

431
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,090
For the second layer, it means

432
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,180
the person who gave it is delicious.

433
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,620
Right?

434
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,320
So sweet.

435
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,250
But since you've made up your mind,

436
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,210
why did you ask us to help you choose?

437
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,590
Help me choose.

438
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,050
Do you think this looks good?

439
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,530
Huh?

440
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,710
Tammy.

441
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,010
Is Phumjai okay?

442
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,420
I'm so happy I get to see my munchkin this morning.

443
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,090
Is this a special day?

444
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,420
Because it's Valentine's Day. So I wanted to see you.

445
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,200
Oh.

446
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,660
It's the Qixi Festival.

447
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,410
But...

448
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,420
I...

449
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,880
have nothing to give you.

450
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,220
It's okay.

451
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,650
I just wanted to give you something special.

452
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,190
What? What is it?

453
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,980
Wait for me.

454
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
What is it, munchkin?

455
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,130
Hang on.

456
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,190
Here.

457
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,990
Honey.

458
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,330
You gave me a necklace?

459
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:21,710
Yes.

460
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,020
Oh, honey, this is so beautiful.

461
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,570
And they're a pair.

462
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,310
You're the cutest.

463
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,250
I love you the most, you know?

464
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,260
I know.

465
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,150
Munchkin.

466
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,860
Is there something urgent? Why did you call me so early in the morning?

467
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,810
Don't tell me

468
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,730
something happened because I didn't go to the store with you.

469
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,830
Nothing is going on at the store today.

470
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,500
I just wanted to see you.

471
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,929
It's Valentine's Day.

472
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,080
Munchkin, it's not February 14 today.

473
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,750
It's Chinese Valentine's Day.

474
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,650
Chinese Valentine's Day?

475
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:21,340
Yes.

476
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,800
That has nothing to do with us.

477
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,949
We usually meet each other every day.

478
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,020
Right?

479
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,620
But we didn't meet on February 14.

480
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,510
I just wanted to give you something special.

481
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,909
You have something for me?

482
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,320
Hang on.

483
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,130
Here.

484
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,830
And I have one too.

485
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:06,780
Ah.

486
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,180
Munchkin.

487
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,280
What?

488
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,890
You don't like it?

489
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,610
No, no, I like it.

490
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,320
But...

491
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,010
If we wear a couple necklace,

492
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,880
wouldn't people know about our relationship?

493
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:30,980
Well,

494
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,080
you can hide it in your clothes.

495
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,850
No one will see it.

496
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,060
I just...

497
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,160
want us to have a couple necklace.

498
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,150
Oh, munchkin.

499
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,030
I think

500
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,470
it's not necessary.

501
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,260
We're both grown ups.

502
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,480
There's no need, right?

503
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,270
Right?

504
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,280
Honey,

505
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,380
maybe you're right.

506
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,760
I remember you have an appointment with a client, right?

507
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,760
Go now, or you'll be late.

508
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,910
Wait, wait, munchkin.

509
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,360
M-m-munchkin!

510
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,860
Hi Tammy.

511
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,370
How long have you been waiting?

512
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,690
Not long. Just for a while.

513
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,290
Ah, just for a while

514
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,760
and you even ordered drinks.

515
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,730
Yes.

516
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,540
Sister, are you hungry?

517
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,500
A little.

518
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,550
A little bit.

519
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,650
Yes, I ordered coffee.

520
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm late, but I'm here.

521
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,490
Happy Valentine's Day, Qi'er!

522
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,800
Odo.

523
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,640
We sell chocolate too.

524
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,590
Why did you still give me chocolate?

525
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,170
It's different.

526
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,470
This chocolate is delicious.

527
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,120
Wow.

528
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,260
So you're saying our chocolate doesn't taste good?

529
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,690
- No.
- What are you doing?

530
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,390
They're all delicious.

531
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,650
But each has its own taste.

532
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,430
Trust me.

533
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,930
This is more delicious.

534
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,270
And the person who gave it to you

535
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,070
is the most tasty.

536
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh, my.

537
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,000
What a couple!

538
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,370
Oh.

539
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,240
This chocolate is so sweet.

540
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,570
Oh, Phumjai.

541
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,040
Aren't you supposed to meet Tammy?

542
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,280
Why are you back so soon?

543
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,110
Uh...

544
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,660
Where's Brother Yang?

545
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,330
The boss is in the warehouse.

546
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,450
Oh.

547
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:14,980
Oh.

548
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,130
What's wrong with him?

549
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,740
Take the chocolate.

550
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,760
I gave it to you.

551
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,640
Okay?

552
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,220
Hey, stop it.

553
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,050
Brother Yang!

554
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,470
What are you doing here?

555
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,730
Why didn't you go on a date with Tammy?

556
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,900
Did I do something to make you angry?

557
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,540
What?

558
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,480
Why should I be mad at you?

559
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:09,950
Well...

560
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,020
that day, I wasn't sure about my feelings,

561
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,800
so...

562
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,680
I said I'm not sure how I feel about you and Tammy yet.

563
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,110
I'm not angry.

564
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,360
Then what's wrong with you?

565
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,350
Why are you pushing me to Tammy?

566
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,650
Didn't you tell me to take my time

567
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,900
and follow my heart?

568
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,260
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

569
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,760
What?

570
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,270
I just wanted to see how you feel.

571
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,250
I told you I like you

572
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,350
because I wanted to test

573
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,420
how loyal you are to Tammy.

574
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,680
No.

575
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,650
I don't believe it.

576
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,430
You're not that kind of person.

577
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,710
Do you know what kind of person I am?

578
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,790
The Brother Yang I know

579
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,330
won't joke about this.

580
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,260
Just tell me what you want.

581
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,210
Didn't I tell you?

582
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,730
I never took you seriously in the first place.

583
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,730
Isn't that

584
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,830
reason enough?

585
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,730
I said I don't believe it.

586
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,440
Do you know?

587
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,700
Actually,

588
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,030
I'm Tammy's ex.

589
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,140
What?

590
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,030
Did you see that?

591
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,420
That's how I am.

592
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,860
How's that? I fooled you.

593
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,470
How do you know what kind of person I am?

594
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,260
Why did you do that?

595
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,200
Only then can you grow up.

596
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,760
Only then will you know that people are complicated.

597
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,280
Complicated?

598
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,250
Then tell me.

599
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,150
You don't like me.

600
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,610
Tell me you don't feel anything for me.

601
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,250
Why?

602
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,300
Why aren't you saying anything?

603
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,160
You want to test my sincerity, right?

604
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,670
Fine.

605
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,740
I'll prove it to you.

606
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,980
[Director: Toh Worawut Thanamatchaicharoen]

607
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,070
Where is Phumjai?

608
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:49,850
I don't know.

609
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,330
Because of you,

610
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,970
my brother is gone.

611
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,490
Hello Tammy. Is Phumjai with you?

612
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,350
No.

613
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,260
No one knows where he is. I can't reach him.

614
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,250
I don't know where to find him either.

615
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,350
Please.

616
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,450
If you get in touch with him,

617
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,150
or if you hear anything from him, tell me immediately.
