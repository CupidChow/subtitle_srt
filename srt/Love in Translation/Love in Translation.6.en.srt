1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,880
I don't know what to do when I see Yang.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,540
I think you should keep a distance.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,430
It's my reason

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,910
when I say I couldn't stay with you.

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,550
I have a crush on you.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,110
I like you too.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,820
Someone like Phumjai.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,710
He's a good man. You shouldn't hurt him.

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,610
Why do you keep pushing me to go to Tammy?

11
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,420
I told you I like you just to test you.

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,310
I wanted to see how loyal you were to Tammy.

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,990
I'll prove it to you.

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,230
Boss,

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,450
didn't Phumjai take only one day off?

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,090
Why didn't he come to work today?

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,330
He'll be here soon.

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,580
Boss,

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,620
the canned pineapple will expire next week.

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,020
What should we do? There's one box left.

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,360
One box?

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,010
Yes.

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,750
Where is Phumjai?

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,160
Phumjai took a day off yesterday.

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,250
Where did she go?

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,680
I don't know.

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,860
How could you not know?

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,510
My brother went missing

29
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,140
because of you.

30
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,000
He hasn't been home for two days.

31
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,700
I can't get in touch with him.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,730
Isn't it because of you?

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,090
-What's going on? -I know.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,820
Then tell me.

35
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,830
If you don't like me,

36
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,450
just tell me.

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,430
Tell me you don't have any feelings for me.

38
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,440
Why?

39
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,720
Why did you stop?

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,580
You want to test my feelings, right?

41
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,190
Fine.

42
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,700
I'll prove it to you.

43
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,940
I have no feelings for you.

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,400
Even now,

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,290
no matter how many times you kiss me,

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,660
I won't have feelings for you.

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,940
I understand.

48
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,580
The person you have reached is not available.

49
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,010
Please take care of the store.

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,170
Tell me if Phumjai calls.

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,580
Boss.

52
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,950
Boss, where are you going? Aren't you taking an umbrella?

53
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,120
Hey, Tammy, are you with Phumjai?

54
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,180
No.

55
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,540
What's wrong?

56
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,370
I don't know where Phumjai is. No one can reach him.

57
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,000
If Phumjai calls you, please tell me.

58
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,240
No matter how many times you kiss me,

59
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,520
I won't have feelings for you.

60
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,620
I understand.

61
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,220
Shit.

62
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,900
Did I sleep all day?

63
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,790
Yes, Tammy.

64
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,250
You finally picked up. Where have you been?

65
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,470
I was looking for you.

66
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,110
Really?

67
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,210
Where are you? What's wrong?

68
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,820
I got caught in the rain, so I'm not feeling well.

69
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,030
Hold on.

70
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,300
Phumjai, open the door for me.

71
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,420
Okay.

72
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,610
What did you buy?

73
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,330
Eat up and take your medicine.

74
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,370
Okay.

75
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,870
I'm sorry.

76
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,470
You had to do all this because of me.

77
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,170
Don't think like that.

78
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,470
Friends should help each other when they're in trouble.

79
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,080
Then why are you alone?

80
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,930
Well, I just want to be alone for a while.

81
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,550
I was caught in the rain,

82
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,990
I wanted to stay here for a night.

83
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,500
I didn't know I'd sleep for a whole day.

84
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,730
Tammy.

85
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,630
Can I ask you a question?

86
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,340
Sure.

87
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,230
Well.

88
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,580
Have you ever dated Yang?

89
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,570
Did Yang tell you?

90
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,030
Actually, I didn't want to hide it from you.

91
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,410
But Yang begged me.

92
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,510
Also,

93
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,370
I thought it'd been so long.

94
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,280
Why didn't Yang ask you to tell me?

95
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,060
He probably

96
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,970
didn't want you to think I was bad.

97
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,030
Then

98
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,190
why did you break up at that time?

99
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,750
There were many reasons.

100
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,650
But mainly,

101
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,430
I had many pursuers.

102
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,110
And Yang was busy.

103
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,170
And we quarreled a lot.

104
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,550
We had no choice but to break up.

105
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
In that case,

106
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,710
let me ask you.

107
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,460
Although I like you very much,

108
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,950
I don't love you that way.

109
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,070
I'm sorry, Tammy.

110
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,260
Actually,

111
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,670
it's good to be frank.

112
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,360
Also,

113
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,560
it's good to be loyal to yourself.

114
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,520
So,

115
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,490
we can still be friends, right?

116
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,590
Sure.

117
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,350
When you told me you like someone…

118
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,580
I like someone.

119
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,490
I've never had such feelings

120
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,330
for anyone.

121
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,070
Is that Yang?

122
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,660
How do you know?

123
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,790
Actually, I've been suspecting it for a long time.

124
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,570
But I didn't expect you to like Yang.

125
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,140
Only Yang has been so obvious about it.

126
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,240
What obvious?

127
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,660
That he likes you.

128
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,260
It's not true.

129
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,700
He doesn't like me.

130
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,430
Trust me.

131
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,790
I can't be wrong.

132
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,339
He has been so obvious.

133
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,510
Stop coming to Phumjai.

134
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,869
Don't hurt a good person.

135
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,810
And about the video,

136
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,190
how would you like to edit it?

137
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,070
I think it's good.

138
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,560
Okay.

139
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,690
I don't know where to find him.

140
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:37,790
Tammy.

141
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,580
I beg you.

142
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,490
If you can contact Phumjai, or if you know anything about him,

143
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,030
tell me.

144
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,910
Go get some rest.

145
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,090
I think the medicine is working.

146
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,070
Okay.

147
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,740
Hmm.

148
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,480
Get some rest.

149
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,410
Thank you.

150
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,670
Qi'er, Tag.

151
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,410
Where did Phumjai go?

152
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,300
Yeah, I don't know.

153
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,440
I hope nothing bad happens.

154
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,700
That's right.

155
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,410
I hope he'll be fine.

156
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,530
Bless him.

157
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,230
Okay.

158
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,000
-Boss, where are you going? -Please take care of the store.

159
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,890
Oh.

160
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,550
Boss.

161
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,650
Boss.

162
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,750
Boss, aren't you bringing a raincoat?

163
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,000
Where is he rushing to?

164
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,440
Hello?

165
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,160
I found Phumjai. He's fine. I'll explain to you later.

166
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,480
Wait.

167
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,880
Oh.

168
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,010
Yang called and said he found Phumjai.

169
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,700
Then we can rest assured.

170
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,550
Yes.

171
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,940
But I'm still worried.

172
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,120
Is it Yang?

173
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,500
Hmm.

174
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,300
Why are you here?

175
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,510
Oh.

176
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:28,830
Wait.

177
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,240
Why did you get soaked?

178
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,710
Worry about yourself.

179
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,310
You don't have to wipe it for me.

180
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,530
Can you do it yourself?

181
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,120
We are all worried about you.

182
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,660
I almost called the police.

183
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,080
You're crazy. How's the shop?

184
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,440
Just

185
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,420
go back and look after the store.

186
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,340
Don't worry about the store.

187
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,440
Your business is more important

188
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,540
now.

189
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,960
Let me make some porridge for you

190
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,910
and I'll go back.

191
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,260
What's going on between you and Phumjai?

192
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,760
Since you like each other, why don't you talk about it?

193
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,370
Phumjai is a person who is loyal to his feelings.

194
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,750
During the day, he told me

195
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,350
he had a crush on someone.

196
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,230
Are you going to let it go?

197
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,890
You told me

198
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,950
if I knew anything about Phumjai, I should tell you.

199
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,290
So I have a request too.

200
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,200
Don't break his heart.

201
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,130
Be careful. It's hot.

202
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,740
Thank you.

203
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,240
I made you uncomfortable, did I?

204
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,200
Why would I?

205
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,020
I wasn't thinking about anything.

206
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,910
You told me

207
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,420
you had no feelings for me, didn't you?

208
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,390
I'm the one who made you uncomfortable.

209
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,540
I'll get going.

210
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,190
Call me if you need anything else.

211
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,080
Okay.

212
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,390
Thank you.

213
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,360
Let's go.

214
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,780
Let's go home.

215
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,440
Yes.

216
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,100
Hey.

217
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,390
Hello. Hello.

218
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,730
How are you?

219
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,930
I'm fine.

220
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,090
You can speak Chinese so well now.

221
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,540
Tell us how you can learn it so well.

222
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,500
Because I have a good teacher.

223
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,330
Yes.

224
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,450
Only these?

225
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,720
Tag.

226
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,390
Yes?

227
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,760
What are you doing?

228
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,320
These foods are about to expire.

229
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,930
Brother Yang asked me to throw them away.

230
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,130
Oh.

231
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,230
Why not sell them at a discount?

232
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,610
Brother Yang.

233
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,590
Can we sell them at a discount?

234
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,190
How much should we lower the price?

235
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,670
How about

236
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,040
we give an 80% discount?

237
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,850
We can still get 20% of the original price.

238
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,990
If we throw them away, we get nothing.

239
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,520
Okay.

240
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,480
Let me help you.

241
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,070
How are you?

242
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,520
Give it to me.

243
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,100
Let me help you.

244
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,260
Phumjai.

245
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,820
How is it?

246
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,310
Did you catch a fever because you went on a date with Tammy?

247
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,820
Well...

248
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,200
Uh...

249
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,730
Well...

250
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,710
When Tammy is here, ask her yourself.

251
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,480
Oh, you have a girlfriend now.

252
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,380
Brother Yang, let me help you.

253
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,740
Oh.

254
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,640
This is heavy.

255
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,750
What's going on with you?

256
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,130
Are you feeling unwell?

257
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,680
No.

258
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,380
Hello, welcome to Little Sun.

259
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,770
Tammy.

260
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
I told you that you don't have to come.

261
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,890
How can I not come? I want to know if you really recovered.

262
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,490
I bought donuts for you guys.

263
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,390
Hey, donuts!

264
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,090
Guys, have some donuts!

265
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,590
Thank you, Tammy.

266
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,060
It's so nice of you, Tammy.

267
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,960
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

268
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,800
I'll start eating now.

269
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,870
And...

270
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,970
I'll start eating, too.

271
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,450
These donuts are good.

272
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,220
Brother Yang, have some donuts.

273
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,770
No, thanks.

274
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,220
I'm not hungry.

275
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,280
Try some. They're good.

276
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,760
Oh.

277
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,230
I'm glad you knocked on the door this time.

278
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,930
Are you okay?

279
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm fine.

280
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,400
Do I look not okay?

281
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,930
So in the end,

282
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,030
what happened

283
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
between you and your partner?

284
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,150
Well...

285
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,630
Nothing happened.

286
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,730
Anyway,

287
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,090
he doesn't like me.

288
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,910
I know that now.

289
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,550
Are you sure?

290
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,480
Are you okay?

291
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,450
Yes.

292
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,230
I'm fine.

293
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,640
I feel good.

294
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:20,880
Phumjai.

295
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,060
Yes?

296
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm your brother.

297
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,310
You think I can't tell?

298
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,520
You're not okay.

299
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,740
You can tell me

300
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,950
anything.

301
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,080
I promise I won't scold you.

302
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,240
You usually have no motivation?

303
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,380
I see you fool around with Bojji every day.

304
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,420
I have motivation every day.

305
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,900
But today I've got more of it

306
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,900
because you trust me.

307
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,450
Wish the business of Little Sun will thrive.

308
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,480
Wish Brother Yang can be my partner forever.

309
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,390
[Wish the business of Little Sun will thrive]

310
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,700
Forever.

311
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,060
That day,

312
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,010
I was going to tell him that I would pick him.

313
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,410
Say it. Say you have no feelings for me at all.

314
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,100
No matter how many times you kiss me,

315
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,450
I still have no feelings for you.

316
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,760
How could he do that to me?

317
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,790
I didn't say anything.

318
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,210
I think

319
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,760
it would be better if I stay alone.

320
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,100
Because I'm always thinking about him.

321
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,500
When I'm around him...

322
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,390
It's okay.

323
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,440
I still have feelings for him.

324
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,150
Why?

325
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,220
Why did he reject me?

326
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,090
Why did he not have feelings for me?

327
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,370
What should I do?

328
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,770
Welcome to Little Sun.

329
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,610
Work hard. Go.

330
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,530
Okay.

331
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,219
Why are they so cheap?

332
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,040
Oh.

333
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,139
They're about to expire.

334
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,120
Phumjai.

335
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,290
I'm going to eat at the secret restaurant in the alley.

336
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,370
I heard the food there is delicious.

337
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,950
The food at this restaurant is really good.

338
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,890
Unfortunately,

339
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,920
not many people know it.

340
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,630
Maybe its owner thinks the quality of the food

341
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,850
might be lower if she serves too many customers.

342
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,900
How can that happen?

343
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,000
The restaurant is not run by her alone.

344
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,410
If it's too busy for them, they can get more people to help them.

345
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,050
Maybe it's for some personal reasons

346
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,950
and no one else can help.

347
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,220
Have you ever tried to tell others your problem

348
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,740
before you make a choice for them?

349
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,160
Here's your food.

350
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,260
Thank you.

351
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,990
Okay.

352
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,250
Sir, what would you like to order?

353
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,450
So delicious.

354
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,190
I want the same as his.

355
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,920
It's sold out. He got the last one.

356
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,300
Would you like to try something else?

357
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,850
We serve many foods. You can take a look at our menu.

358
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,720
Okay.

359
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,190
See?

360
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,170
Good food won't wait for you.

361
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,140
If you don't get it quickly, you'll starve.

362
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,620
Listen.

363
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,810
I talked to Phumjai.

364
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,260
I want him

365
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,850
to withdraw his shares in Little Sun.

366
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,660
But

367
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,160
don't worry.

368
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,530
I'll find you a new partner as soon as possible.

369
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,060
Have you decided what to order?

370
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,550
You've read this menu.

371
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,420
Do you want to see other menus?

372
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,430
Hey, munchkin.

373
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,080
What are you doing here?

374
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,770
Do you need me to do anything else for Phumjai?

375
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:48,640
What?

376
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,240
Phumjai is not in a relationship now.

377
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,930
But if you keep protecting him,

378
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,440
when will you admit that I'm your boyfriend?

379
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,980
Hey, munchkin.

380
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,080
What happened?

381
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,150
I just don't know what I am to you.

382
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,060
It's...

383
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,340
I feel you are just using me.

384
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,690
Hey, it's not like that, munchkin.

385
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,610
I feel you don't love me as much as I love you.

386
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,600
I'm tired of it.

387
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,620
Munchkin.

388
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,390
Don't say that.

389
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,720
Anyway, I didn't tell anyone about us.

390
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,780
Actually, this is good for both of us.

391
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,310
When we break up,

392
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,460
we don't need to tell anybody about it.

393
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,400
Munchkin.

394
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,650
We were not a real couple from the beginning.

395
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,240
When we break up, it's like nothing ever happened between us.

396
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,810
Don't say that, Munchkin.

397
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,330
Munchkin.

398
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,470
Munchkin. Munchkin.

399
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,940
Huh?

400
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,390
Brother Yang.

401
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,310
Can I talk to you?

402
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,590
What's up?

403
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,450
Well...

404
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,740
Phojai told you that I'm going to

405
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,700
withdraw my shares in the shop, right?

406
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,610
Well.

407
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,110
You know what happened

408
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,750
between me and Tammy.

409
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,760
It's over.

410
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,370
It really is.

411
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,970
I have no reason to continue to run the shop now.

412
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,520
But

413
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,360
don't worry.

414
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,750
Phojai will find you a new partner as soon as possible.

415
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,860
Then...

416
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,450
I'm going to pack up.

417
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,770
Good luck.

418
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,100
Phumjai.

419
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,480
Phumjai.

420
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:21,080
If canned pineapples have expired, will you just throw them away?

421
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,400
What?

422
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,790
Tell me,

423
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,060
is our relationship

424
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,980
coming to an end?

425
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,340
If I'm no longer a shareholder of this shop,

426
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,610
our relationship will come to an end.

427
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,050
But you're still a shareholder.

428
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,750
Does that mean our relationship hasn't come to an end yet?

429
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,360
Well...

430
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,620
I'm a little confused.

431
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:52,720
But I'll say

432
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,710
you're right. It hasn't come to an end yet.

433
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,970
I'm sorry.

434
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,300
Please don't leave me.

435
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,870
What's the reason for me to stay?

436
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,460
You know what?

437
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,780
On the day when we went on a date like a couple,

438
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,460
I prayed to Buddha

439
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,440
that the business of our shop would thrive

440
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,180
and that you would be my partner forever.

441
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,040
When you disappeared,

442
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,680
I realized how important you were to me.

443
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,810
I want to be with you.

444
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,040
I want you to cook instant noodles for me.

445
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,290
I want you to knock on my door.

446
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,980
I want you to ask me to teach you Chinese.

447
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,570
I want to sit down and watch Tammy's live stream with you.

448
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,040
I want to look at you when we eat together in the evening.

449
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,360
I want to go on a real date with you.

450
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,760
I want to be with you when you're sick.

451
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,880
When everything is fine,

452
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,850
I want to be the one who will take care of you.

453
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,110
I want to call you

454
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,820
boss.

455
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:50,910
You know what?

456
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,840
This is the first time you've said so many words after I met you.

457
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,030
If you promise me that no matter it's good news

458
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,760
or bad news,

459
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,340
you'll tell me everything,

460
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,080
I will stay.

461
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,330
I promise you.

462
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:23,870
Then,

463
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,190
I'm not going anywhere.

464
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,070
Let me put my things away.

465
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,350
Thank you.

466
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,010
I should thank you, too.

467
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,790
I know you don't need to learn Chinese now.

468
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,050
But I want to teach you a sentence.

469
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:15,820
Let's

470
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,010
be a couple.

471
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,110
Does that mean

472
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,880
"Can you be my boyfriend?"

473
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,320
Yes.

474
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,950
You asked me

475
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,170
what I would do

476
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,120
if I met someone I like.

477
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,800
If...

478
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,710
What's going on, Brother Yang?

479
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,090
I

480
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,130
will do this.

481
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,360
Didn't you

482
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,060
give this necklace to Tammy?

483
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,330
This belongs to you.

484
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,390
How can I give it to someone else?

485
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,570
Something must be going on

486
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,550
between the two.

487
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,340
After we close the shop today, let's play baseball.

488
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,250
Okay.

489
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,060
Brother Yang.

490
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,020
If you don't pay me back one million today,

491
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,960
you'll have to work here

492
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,900
until you can pay off the debt.
