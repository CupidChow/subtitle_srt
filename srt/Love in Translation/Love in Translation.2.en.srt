2
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,080
Mr. Yang, have you found a Thai partner?

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,019
I don't know anyone here.

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,190
I want to learn Chinese. What can I do?

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,470
I can teach you

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,210
and make you feel you are born to learn Chinese.

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,250
Let go of me. I didn't do it.

8
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,610
If you want to be my fan,

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,010
you should have your own business.

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,820
How can I have my own business?

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,010
Can you help me find a partner or not?

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,420
There's someone who is interested.

13
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,400
Hey! Stop it.

14
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,030
You two, shake hands and start your business.

15
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,030
I hope your business will thrive.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,130
Hey.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
There are no customers now.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,340
Teach me Chinese.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,110
Yi (one).

20
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,390
Er (two).

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,550
San (three).

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,360
Si (four).

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,470
Stop.

24
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,920
Everyone knows these easy words.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,760
Teach me some other words.

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,780
Lao Ban (boss).

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,770
It means a business owner or a boss.

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,440
That's all for today.

29
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,560
What?

30
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,130
That's it?

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,350
I hope you can remember this word first.

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,510
Lao Ban.

33
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,810
Because you

34
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,720
should call me Lao Ban.

35
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,590
No way.

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm the Lao Ban.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,980
I have more shares than you do.

38
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:22,650
So?

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,490
Wait, let me remind you.

40
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,020
According to the contract we signed,

41
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,450
-I hold 51% of the total shares.
-But you didn't invest money.

42
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,300
But I have more shares than you do.

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,350
Uh.

44
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,930
Welcome to Little Sun.

45
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,030
Yeah.

46
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,810
Where is the subway station?

47
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,470
Go straight,

48
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,289
and turn left. Then you'll see it.

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,110
Thank you.

50
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,670
You're welcome.

51
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,170
Bye.

52
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,600
It's okay, guys.

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,700
Today, she only asked for directions.

54
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,800
But next time, she might come back and buy something.

55
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,050
You're right.

56
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,120
Smile, or the customers won't come.

-Hello, Mr. Rookie Businessman.
-Hello.

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,089
Odo!

00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:18,910
I miss you!

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,579

Tag.

81
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,230
Hey.

82
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,930
Phumjai.

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,630
Who is she?

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,780
Oh, that's Qi'er. She works here.

85
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,670
So cute.

00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,360
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,190
Nothing.

88
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,380
I just passed by, so I want to say hello to you and visit your shop.

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,150
What about you, Tag?

90
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,170
Why are you working here?

91
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,630
Me?

92
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,200
I just...

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,420
Have you seen anything weird?

94
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,650
No.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,750
Yang seems to be a good guy.

96
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,940
Keep an eye on him.

97
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,900
I think he's suspicious.

98
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,810
Okay.

99
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,180
How about Phumjai?

100
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,460
Phumjai?

101
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,310
He's quite happy.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
As long as a customer comes to our shop,

103
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,800
he'll be very happy for long.

104
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,400
But I think

105
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,770
if the shop goes on like this,

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,130
they won't be able to run the business for long.

107
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,170
-What should we do?
-Listen.

108
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,760
In the beginning, take photos of the shop and post them on social media.

109
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,040
Let people know what you are selling.

110
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,450
And promote a few selected products that sell well.

111
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,370
Munchkin.

112
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,050
Anyway, please help me take care of Phumjai.

113
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, I will.

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,200

116
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,400
Give me some energy.

117
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,810
Let's go.

118
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,890
He's my good friend.

119
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,870
He volunteered to take pictures to promote the shop.

120
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,620
Really?

121
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,920
Yes, I've got a new idea.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,860
What is it?

123
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,960
We can select five or six products in our shop

124
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,650
and promote them. Do you think it'll work?

125
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,010
Hey.

126
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,090
Good idea.

127
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,580
Man, you're smart.

128
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,020
-Of course.
-You're smart.

129
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,740
You are not like Odo.

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,260
What?

131
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,320
Odo is not a real friend.

132
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,420
He's never helped me.

133
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,370
In the future,

134
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,250
I might come here often.

135
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,510
Hey.

136
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,220
We're here, bro!

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,580
Odo, I'm here!

138
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,020
Yeah, I mean...

139
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,060
How about I come to help you and be your partner?

140
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,000
That'll be too much. Is that necessary?

141
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,890
Of course it is.

142
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,470
You and your partner always fight.

143
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,670
Hey, this is good.

144
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,330
I'll take it now.

145
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,650
Hey.

146
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,020
-What's up?
-Let's have a meeting.

147
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:01,960
Okay.

148
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,930
Let's think about how we can increase our sales.

149
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,750
Okay.

150
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,510
Where is Phumjai?

151
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,690
Phumjai?

152
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,770
Where is he?

153
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,280
I'll go find him.

154
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,660
Guys.

155
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,560
Hey!

156
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,380
What are you doing?

157
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,380
This is Tammy's display board.

158
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,450
I want to use it

159
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,850
to decorate our shop.

160
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,350
If her fans see it,

161
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,060
they'll immediately come to our shop and buy stuff.

162
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,610
What the heck are you thinking?

163
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,630
-It's useless.
-Stop!

164
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,370
What's wrong with you?

165
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,690
We can take photos of it and our shop

166
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,030
and use the photos to promote our shop online.

167
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,170
I told you. If we use the picture of Tammy to promote our shop,

168
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,270
our sales will definitely go up.

169
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,820
Don't fight.

170
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,000
Drag them apart.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,020
Calm down, boss.

172
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,570
I think

173
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,580
we can try Phumjai's idea first.

174
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,410
It might work, right?

175
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,980
Yes, boss.

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,580
Let's give it a try.

177
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,650
Yes.

178
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,490
Calm down.

179
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,260
Okay.

180
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,150
We'll try his idea.

181
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,809
Tammy, are you okay?

182
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,860
Just now,

183
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,179
someone was trying to hurt you.

184
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,419
I'll always protect you.

185
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,809
Where should I put it?

186
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,330
This one?

187
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,210
Yes. Is it okay?

188
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,100
If it's a product recommended by Tammy,

189
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,600
we can put a picture of Tammy next to it.

190
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,660
These are all her favorites.

191
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,460
So I came up with this good sales plan

192
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,820
to promote some selected products

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,350
with the hashtag #TammyLikesIt.

194
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm sure her fans will come to our shop to buy stuff.

195
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,660
You remember everything Tammy likes?

196
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
It seems that

197
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,560
you really like Tammy, right?

198
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,680
So,

199
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,900
when did you

200
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,290
start to be so crazy about her?

201
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,980
Tell us.

202
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,100
The thing between me and Tammy

203
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,140
happened three years ago.

204
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,160
That day, I was in a bad mood because I had a fight with my brother.

205
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,000
[Excuse me.]

206
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,570
[Is this Charoen Krung?]

207
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,350
She asked me for directions.

208
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,070
But I didn't really know Chinese.

209
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,770
[Charoen Krung.]

210
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,740
Talking with her was like talking with a mute.

211
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,660
[Yes.]

212
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,610
We also used several English words.

213
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,920
[It's very delicious.]

214
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,300
Good. Good. Good.

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,620
I quickly forgot about the fight with Phojai and offered to be her guide.

216
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,890
[Want to try some?]

217
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,460
Okay.

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,310
I want to go there.

219
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,510
[This way. This way.]

220
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay.

221
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,750
[Thank you so much.]

222
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,010
[I couldn't make it without you.]

223
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,960
No one

224
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,080
had ever looked at me with that much appreciation.

225
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,960
And no one had praised me like that.

226
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,000
Food review.

227
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,830
[I love it.]

228
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,230
After the trip,

229
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,810
Tammy went back to China.

230
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,340
If you liked her that much, why didn't you keep in touch?

231
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,590
Well...

232
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,410
I was so excited. I forgot to ask for her contact info.

233
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,090
And then?

234
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,470
Then Tammy became a KOL in the next year.

235
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,660
I went to see her.

236
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,910
You know what?

237
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,320
It was because of that trip that Tammy wanted to learn Thai.

238
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,680
Oh.

239
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,630
She wants to visit Thailand again.

240
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,730
She's sweet.

241
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,700
Did she tell you that?

242
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,480
Or is it just your imagination?

243
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,410
Well, it's possible.

244
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,610
It's the same now. I get to talk to her by leaving her comments.

245
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,240
We

246
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,270
can communicate

247
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,970
-with each other again.
-What a surprise.

248
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,170
If she can speak Thai, why are you learning Chinese?

249
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,680
Why don't you talk with each other in Thai?

250
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,950
Because Tammy said a lot of people tried to chase her.

251
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,180
Those who can pass the first test

252
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,750
must be able to speak Chinese.

253
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,080
If Tammy agrees to talk to a person,

254
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,180
she will reply in English.

255
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,910
So if I want to chase her,

256
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,310
I have to learn Chinese first.

257
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,410
That makes sense.

258
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,610
Let's get back to work.

259
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,230
-Hey, guys.
-What's up?

260
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,900
What's up?

261
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,290
Tammy uploaded a short video with the hashtag #TammyLikesIt.

262
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,930
-Where?
-Here.

263
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,840
It's true.

264
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,420
She's so sweet.

265
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,480
Phumjai, give her a reply.

266
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,140
Right. Let me thank her first.

267
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,580
-Tell her.
-say "thank you" to her.

268
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,130
What language should I use?

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,630
Here.

270
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,030
Please type "Thank you" in Chinese.

271
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,630
I'm serious.

272
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,420
All right, guys. Our shop is going to be a popular one.

273
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,050
Alright.

274
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,810
We'll have a lot of customers.

275
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,840
Tammy likes it. Tammy likes it.

276
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,990
Hello.

277
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,360
Guys.

278
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,510
We've got an order.

279
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,610
What?

280
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,100
Go on.

281
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,160
What would you like to order?

282
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,650
The customer wants to buy all products

283
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,150
labeled #TammyLikesIt.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,090
See? I told you. That's a great promotion plan.

285
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,630
Okay. Anything else?

286
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,740
The customer wants to pay a deposit

287
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,520
of five thousand baht.

288
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,150
Is it convenient for you to transfer the money now?

289
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,800
He said yes.

290
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,590
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

291
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,680
We'll pack the products and deliver them to you as soon as possible.

292
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,780
Thank you.

293
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,570
-Bye.
-Bye.

294
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:43,870
Then,

295
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,760
go pack the products and deliver them.

296
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,210
Do we have enough time to deliver them today?

297
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,480
-Oh. right.
-Right.

298
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,760
Tag, let's pack the products.

299
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,810
Tammy likes it.

300
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,910
And this.

301
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,730
What else?

302
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,110
Are you looking for an assistant?

303
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,590
Oh, it's him.

304
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,460
It's late. Hurry up.

305
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,040
Tammy, you're outside for so long.

306
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,700
It's hot.

307
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,800
I brought you inside, so you feel cooler with the AC.

308
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Oh.

309
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,200
But even if you were in the sun for so long, you still look pretty.

310
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,220
I need to thank you, Tammy. If it weren't for you,

311
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,240
we wouldn't be selling so well.

312
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,730
Thank you.

313
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,130
A customer wants them all.

314
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,110
What do you want to eat? I'll go...

315
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,120
[Piengjai Rawichotpitak]

316
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,690
This is the last box.

317
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,240
There's no more, honey.

318
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,170
Dad, Mom.

319
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,600
Oh.

320
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,550
Wow!

321
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,580
What did you order?

322
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,090
Aren't they from Little Sun?

323
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,380
Did Phumjai ask you to buy them?

324
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,150
Hey, it's not like that.

325
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,030
Oh.

326
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,200
Wait.

327
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,710
It's too late, honey.

328
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,260
Thank you, Tammy.

329
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,760
Hey.

330
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,990
Come here.

331
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,099
Phumjai.

332
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,839
Come here.

333
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,349
Phojai, what's up?

334
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,420
Why did you ask Mom and Dad to buy from your shop?

335
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,440
What are you talking about?

336
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,970
Are you saying you don't know about it?

337
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,840
There are a lot of packages sent from your shop in our house.

338
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,950
Did Mom and Dad

339
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,000
order them all?

340
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,130
I...

341
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,160
I really don't know that the big order was from them.

342
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,170
Phumjai.

343
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,280
In the end, you still asked our parents for help, right?

344
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,250
You said you wouldn't ask your family for help.

345
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,650
Have you forgotten what you said?

346
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,210
Have you ever kept your word?

347
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,330
In your eyes,

348
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,330
I am such a bad brother, right?

349
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,040
Why have you never trusted me?

350
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,320
I hope

351
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
you won't be a bad influence on my brother.

352
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,940
My idea

353
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,890
didn't work.

354
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,820
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,230
Do you have plans after we close the shop?

356
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,100
Well...

357
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,200
No.

358
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,850
What would you like to eat?

359
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,280
Let's go eat together.

360
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,710
Okay.

361
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,530
I can help you with the marketing plan.

362
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,510
Why didn't you tell me about that?

363
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,820
I told you everything.

364
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,330
But I really don't know about that

365
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:43,900
Gosh.

366
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,470
Since the shop opened,

367
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,220
has my brother ever paid attention to his work?

368
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,940
Yes.

369
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,830
He paid attention to Tammy's livestreams.

370
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,460
Munchkin, I didn't mean that.

371
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,380
I mean, has my brother ever paid attention to running the shop?

372
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,430
Is he doing okay?

373
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,530
Are people in the shop nice to him?

374
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,110
Is his partner a good guy?

375
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,700
Alright.

376
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,350
Don't worry about it.

377
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,490
I'm helping you take care of him here.

378
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,130
Don't you

379
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,230
worry about me at all?

380
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,210
Huh?

381
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,160
I always worry about you, Munchkin.

382
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,060
Hey.

383
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,600
It's so good.

384
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,620
Is this

385
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,840
the food you like?

386
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,250
Yes.

387
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,600
Try it.

388
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,640
It's delicious.

389
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,030
No.

390
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,340
Open your mouth. Try some.

391
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:54,640
Hey.

392
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,530
Fine.

393
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,470
I'll try it

394
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,390
Open your mouth.

395
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,970
Please feed me properly, okay?

396
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,610
How is it? Is it good?

397
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
It's good, right?

398
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,030
It's been a stressful day.

399
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,170
Thank you for bringing me here.

400
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,120
I brought you here to talk about work.

401
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh,

402
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,580
the marketing for the store, right?

403
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes.

404
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,460
But...

405
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
before we talk about that,

406
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,700
there's one more thing.

407
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,500
In the future,

408
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:05,920
you

409
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,720
must call me brother.

410
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,250
What?

411
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm older than you, you should call me elder brother.

412
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,640
What the heck?

413
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,530
If I call you brother,

414
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,490
what will you call me?

415
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,600
I'll call you "you".

416
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,720
What? It's not fair at all.

417
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:24,530
Hey.

418
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,350
If you call me brother,

419
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,100
I'll think about your marketing plan.

420
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,980
Really, Brother Yang?

421
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,470
Are you really going to?

422
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,330
Tell me what you're planning to do.

423
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,390
Let me tell you,

424
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm full of ideas.

425
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,410
I want to promote the store so that everyone knows about it.

426
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,970
Through online channels, social media.

427
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,510
What are you babbling on about?

428
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,530
This is a global era.

429
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,180
The social media is getting bigger.

430
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,980
We must make our supermarket widely known.

431
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,630
In other words, we need to reach out to young people.

432
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,460
If our shop gets famous,

433
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,040
I'll be more motivated to work.

434
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,170
And you wouldn't be motivated otherwise?

435
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,850
I see you play with Bojji every day.

436
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,210
I'm motivated every day.

437
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,730
But today, I'm even more motivated because

438
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,740
you, Brother Yang, trust me.

439
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,800
Brother, you know,

440
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,520
since I was little,

441
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,340
my family has never trusted me.

442
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,540
They never trusted me to do anything.

443
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,050
When I was young,

444
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,790
my parents wouldn't even

445
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,560
let me ride a bike.

446
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,410
So I...

447
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,050
still don't know how to ride it to this day.

448
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,740
I'm someone

449
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,590
who doesn't know how to do anything.

450
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,250
Let me teach you.

451
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,340
You'll teach me how to ride a bike?

452
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,620
Give me your hand. Hold it. What are you afraid of?

453
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,400
Is what you just told me true?

454
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,260
Yes.

455
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,380
Slowly.

456
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,990
Okay.

457
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,070
Lift your legs up.

458
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,090
Don't be afraid of falling.

459
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,400
Keep your balance. Then lift your leg.

460
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,390
OK. Lift your legs.

461
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,320
Keep your legs up and turn right.

462
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,090
Right, right.

463
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,860
Go straight.

464
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,570
Hold tight.

465
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,570
Okay, hold tight.

466
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:54,980
Turn.

467
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:55,930
Turn.

468
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,880
Slowly. Watch the road.

469
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,750
Watch the road.

470
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,950
Okay.

471
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,920
Turn around.

472
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,530
Ride properly.

473
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,170
To the left.

474
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,000
Ah, Brother Yang.

475
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,050
Brother Yang.

476
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,920
Are you okay?

477
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,020
Turn.

478
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,040
- Okay.
- Let's go.

479
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,730
Okay.

480
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,330
Brother Yang.

481
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,460
I can ride now, Brother Yang. I can ride now!

482
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,840
Be careful.

483
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,370
I can ride now.

484
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,040
Great!

485
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Ride faster.

486
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,340
Oh.

487
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,820
Hey.

488
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,360
Isn't it too fast?

489
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,200
Brother.

490
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,300
Ride well.

491
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,880
Hey.

492
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,560
Hey.

493
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,270
- Brother Yang.
- Be careful!

494
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,810
- Brother Yang!
- Stop! Stop!

495
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,160
Are you okay?

496
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,250
I'm going back to the supermarket.

497
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,190
Don't stay out here until late.

498
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,910
You're not trying to ride to Lhasa,

499
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,250
understand?

500
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,460
Ride...

501
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,120
Bicycle.

502
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,660
Ride a trend.

503
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,760
I've got to tell Brother Yang now.

504
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,550
Brother Yang.

505
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,280
Brother, I got it.

506
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,900
Brother Yang.

507
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,200
When you teach me Chinese,

508
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,850
can't you just teach me pick up lines?

509
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,580
Yes.

510
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,120
I'll teach you later.

511
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,220
That's great.

512
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,610
Well, then...

513
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,900
Brother Yang, do you have a girlfriend?

514
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,620
No.

515
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,580
Why do you ask?

516
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,140
Oh.

517
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,240
I was hoping you could help me get girls.

518
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,010
Will this work?

519
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,920
Hey.

520
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,310
I'm hungry.

521
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,740
Do you want to eat something nice with me?

522
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,010
Spicy instant noodles?

523
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:04,910
Well...

524
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,960
You're off topic again.

525
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,040
Didn't I tell you to memorize the words and wait for me?

526
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,590
I'm just hungry, Brother Yang.

527
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,170
My stomach is growling.

528
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,570
I haven't eaten anything since I got off work.

529
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,000
If I'm hungry,

530
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,980
how can I memorize these words?

531
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,850
So many words.

532
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,870
Fine, I'll eat.

533
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
I'll have some too.

534
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,860
Okay. Two packets.

535
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,570
Here are your noodles.

536
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,210
Clean up the table. It's heavy.

537
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,260
This is yours.

538
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,290
This is mine.

539
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,550
Open it for me.

540
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,480
Hey.

541
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,330
Tammy is live.

542
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,000
Let me watch the livestream.

543
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,900
Hello, you're here again with Tammy,

544
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,230
the Chinese girl who loves Thailand.

545
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,630
You're here again with Tammy, the Chinese girl who loves Thailand.

546
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,250
Today is very special

547
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,890
because today I'm celebrating the fact that I've reached 300,000 subscribers.

548
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:59,750
I'm going to have a special show - 50 facts about Tammy. Yay!

549
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,490
Great!

550
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,980
Let's start with the first question.

551
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,480
The first question.

552
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,900
What color does Tammy like?

553
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,380
Blue!

554
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,750
What color do you like?

555
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,470
Green, Brother.

556
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:32,180
The second question is, which animal do I like more, dogs or cats?

557
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
I like...

558
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,390
Cats!

559
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,270
Dogs!

560
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,250
Did you guys get it right?

561
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,760
For the third question.

562
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,520
My favorite food

563
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,860
is Thai food.

564
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,180
But it can't be spicy.

565
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,410
She said she likes Thai food too.

566
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,890
But it has to be non-spicy.

567
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,290
But

568
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,570
everything I like is spicy.

569
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,370
Oh, there were 49 facts.

570
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,580
I haven't got the same answer to a single question.

571
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,730
We've come to the last one.

572
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,180
How is it? Are there many people who got it right?

573
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,920
The last question is

574
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,390
my favorite sport.

575
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,620
Brother Yang, listen carefully.

576
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,090
My favorite sport is...

577
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,260
Baseball.

578
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,710
Baseball.

579
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,760
Baseball.

580
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,240
Baseball...

581
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,980
Hey.

582
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,260
Don't tell me that she likes it.

583
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,660
No.

584
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,660
Tammy doesn't like it.

585
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,550
What?

586
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,010
But I...

587
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,380
I like it.

588
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,280
Brother Yang, do you like baseball too?

589
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,500
From what I heard,

590
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,080
You and Tammy have
nothing in common.

591
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,010
Can you keep it going?

592
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,960
It's okay.

593
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,070
Although the 50 facts didn't match,

594
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,260
there may be

595
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,520
a 51th fact

596
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,180
or a 52nd fact

597
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,820
or other questions that match.

598
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,240
Okay.

599
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,510
Come and learn Chinese.

600
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:44,870
I'm full.

601
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,130
Can you read this word for me? I don't know how to say it.

602
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,970
Do you remember the words you memorized last time?

603
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,180
Yes, Brother.

604
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,530
Hello.

605
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,630
How are you?

606
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
How are you?

607
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:00,560
What about goodbye?

608
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,910
Hello bye.

609
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,590
Let's go.

610
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,040
Clean it up.

611
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,090
But the word

612
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,420
- But you haven't looked at this word...
- Hello bye.

613
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,650
I'm so proud.

614
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,770
Brother Yang!

615
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,460
Tammy replied me.

616
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,880
What should I reply?

617
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,750
Oh, Tammy.

618
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,870
Brother Yang, please help me reply Tammy.

619
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,900
Reply her!

620
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,850
Brother Yang!

621
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,300
Tammy replied me in English.

622
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,520
It means I've passed the first test.

623
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,220
Can I invite her to the supermarket?

624
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,860
Are you sure?

625
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,440
Yes.

626
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,260
Tell her for me.

627
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,630
If you get the chance, please come to my supermarket.

628
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,090
Like that.

629
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,390
[The cafe you recommended is awesome.]

630
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,500
Tammy, we can meet now.

631
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,780
Tammy.

632
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,360
Hello.

633
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,010
Qi'er, can I help you?

634
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,110
Oh.

635
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,300
Yes.

636
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,600
Tell me.

637
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,380
I can help you with everything.

638
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,630
In that case, can you

639
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,150
move further away from me?

640
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,540
It's uncomfortable.

641
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,470
Oh.

642
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,880
Your angry face is so cute.

643
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:40,950
No.

644
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,170
Please

645
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,820
keep it for when we're far away.

646
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,400
Keep it in your heart.

647
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,080
Dear customers,

648
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,790
please follow me.

649
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,060
Here, a whole shelf.

650
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,350
All these products are the ones with #TammyLikesIt.

651
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,940
Thank you.

652
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,810
I followed Tammy's livestream

653
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,470
- and saw a lot of comments on delicious food.
- Yes.

654
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,430
I saw the video of Tammy replying with a funny poster.

655
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,980
I wanted to try it too.

656
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,870
You have to try. You're in the right place.

657
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,530
All the products here sell very well.

658
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,790
It's almost sold out. Only one box left.

659
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,700
I want this.

660
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,870
Your "ride the trend" plan

661
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,620
is very effective.

662
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,770
Of course.

663
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,110
Our store's sales went up quickly.

664
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,390
What?

665
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,050
Don't just stand there.

666
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,220
Another new order?

667
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,500
Pack it up.

668
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,010
Okay.

669
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,680
You're still up?

670
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,630
Today,

671
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,730
you haven't taught me Chinese yet.

672
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,010
Oh.

673
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,060
Wait for me. I need to work.

674
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,000
Little things, when combined together,

675
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,770
can create something special.

676
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,680
Even though we don't like the same things in those 50 facts,

677
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,250
there may be

678
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,460
a 51th fact,

679
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,120
or a 52nd,

680
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,800
or other questions where we match.

681
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,280
Don't jump to conclusions.

682
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,060
If you really don't know,

683
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,020
don't think you can't do it.

684
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,120
If you haven't tried...

685
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,700
Well,

686
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,220
in the end,

687
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,600
how is it?

688
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:55,860
Hey.

689
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,090
When did I fall asleep?

690
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,310
If you're sleepy,
go sleep in your own room.

00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,500
Tammy, do you remember,

701
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,960
we met three years ago.

702
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,760
Was that you?

Yang.

704
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,670
Brother Yang, Tammy said hi to me.

705
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,310
Brother Yang, do you think she's asking me out?

706
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,880
Obviously, she's talking to a lot of people.

707
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,150
I won't allow her to lie to Phumjai.

708
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,790
She may not be as good as you think.

709
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,590
As long as she didn't push me away,

710
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,020
I'm very happy.

711
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,600
This might be a good starting point, Brother Yang.
