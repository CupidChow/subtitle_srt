00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,590
Your Tammy is flirting with many people.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,230
Knowing that, do you still want to talk to her?

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,210
No matter what, I still like her.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,580
If she's really a player, I'll just have to do better than everyone else

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,480
so that Tammy can see me.

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,960
I don't talk to other people anymore.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,190
[I already have someone I want to take seriously.]
[Thank you for being frank with me.]

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,740
Don't worry.

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,120
I've been thinking about being serious with Phumjai.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,440
Do you think Tammy really wants to date me?

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,220
[Are you free this Sunday? Let's go out together.]

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,800
What are you going to do?

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,770
Teach me how to date.

15
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,140
Okay, Brother Yang?

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,840
Uh...

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,150
Excuse me.

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,470
I'll leave the store to you today. I'm going out.

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,090
Okay, boss.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,190
Call me if you need anything.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,160
Okay.

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,289
Come here, let's talk.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,620
Didn't you say you won't let Tammy get involved with the shares of the shop?

24
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,630
But what's going on now?

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,680
You're teaching my brother how to date?

26
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:35,920
What will you do

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,789
if the two of them actually start dating?

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,690
I know you're worried about your brother.

29
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,229
But now,

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,570
Tammy stopped flirting with other people.

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,479
Also,

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,500
Tammy wants to take your brother seriously too.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,250
You...

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,930
Have you also been brainwashed?

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,080
If they love each other so much,

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,690
why should we stop them?

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,410
It's something that makes your brother happy.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,870
As his brother,

39
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,690
shouldn't you support him?

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,430
But what if it's not what you think?

41
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,910
If my brother gets hurt

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,960
and disappointed, what will you do?

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,940
Your brother will learn a lesson.

44
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,490
No.

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,960
If we knew that would happen,

46
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,910
we shouldn't let it happen.

47
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,560
Hey.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,700
Have you ever been in a relationship?

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
It's because no one knows what the outcome will be.

50
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,320
Maybe the Tammy that you dislike

51
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,100
might be his best lover.

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,910
She may even be

53
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,400
someone who will stay with us.

54
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,240
Someday,

55
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,500
he might not be by our side anymore.

56
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,060
I won't stop them.

57
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,400
If you want to stop them,

58
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,190
you can do it yourself.

What about places you haven't been to?

Then you can find something to talk about.

Then...

96
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,770
Should we walk or take the car?

I have this, brother.

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,550
Am I good? What if Tammy didn't eat anything?

113
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,930
And then?

114
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,770
Would you let Tammy open it herself?

115
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,720
That's true.

116
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,340

Let's go.

121
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,909
Let's go.

122
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you.

123
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,950
Okay.

124
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,970
At the time, Tammy wanted to eat Thai food

125
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,930
so I brought her here.

126
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,750
So?

127
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,500
But I'm not sure

128
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,710
if I should order something so spicy?

129
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,210
Tammy doesn't like spicy food.

130
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,560
But

131
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
I like it.

132
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,110
Hey.

133
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,120
Don't worry about it.

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,930
We're just practicing today.

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,020
Eat whatever you want.

136
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,890
Should I?

137
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,740
Yes.

138
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,840
Have you heard of this?

139
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,740
What you eat is not important. What's important is who you're eating with.

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,010
Whether the food is yummy or not doesn't depend on what you're eating

141
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,600
but who you eat with.

142
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,990
I know.

143
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,710
Then I'll have the spiciest food.

144
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,550
Okay.

145
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,600
Why don't you use chopsticks?

146
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,610
I'm not used to it.

147
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,500
Take them. I'll teach you.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,140
If you can't use chopsticks when eating with Chinese people, it'll be embarrassing.

149
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,050
Hold it like this.

150
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,680
Lean against that part and put pressure here.

151
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,170
Then try holding it up.

152
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,810
Okay.

153
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,140
Yes.

154
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,240
Then open it. Like this.

155
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,420
Like this.

156
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,520
I see.

157
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,240
Try using it.

158
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,670
Come on.

159
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,970
Can you do it?

160
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,650
Yes.

161
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,490
Try getting some food.

162
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,060
Okay. You can do it.

163
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,110
See? Like this.

164
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,570
Adjust it.

165
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,370
Hello, Brother Yang.

166
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,460
I brought Tammy here last time, right?

167
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,780
She seemed to like it. She was very happy.

168
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:04,810
Yes.

169
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,550
Here.

170
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:07,550
A brush.

171
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,960
Do you still like drawing?

172
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,040
I kind of like it.

173
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,750
But my drawing is not good.

174
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,490
It's just entertainment.

175
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,800
Although some people say I'm good at it.

176
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:28,930
By the way,

177
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,560
I won an award once when I was young.

178
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,030
What are you drawing?

179
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,730
A dog, brother.

180
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,840
Because Tammy likes dogs.

181
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,870
What dog is blue?

182
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,990
Because Tammy likes blue and dogs.

183
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,630
Why can't I draw a blue puppy? It's so cute.

184
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,390
Blue dog, brother.

185
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,430
Blue dog.

186
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,430
Isn't it cute?

187
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,030
Yes.

188
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,180
It's cute.

189
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,380
Then why aren't you drawing?

190
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,190
I don't know what to draw.

191
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,750
Well,

192
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,230
draw what you like.

193
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,640
If you really can't imagine it,

194
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,030
you can draw me.

195
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,240
Did you even bring her to pray?

196
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,340
Because her phone was lost at that time,

197
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,690
so I brought her here to make a wish

198
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,460
hoping she could be lucky.

199
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,420
What wish did you make?

200
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,730
You look serious.

201
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,460
Of course I wished that my love life would pan out.

202
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,610
What about you? What did you ask for?

203
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,070
I'm not telling you.

204
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,280
This is a secret between me and the Buddha.

205
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,740
What is this?
That's cheating. You told me to tell you. Tell me.

206
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,920
Tell me. What did you ask for? I want to know.

207
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,400
You're cheating. You know mine. But I don't know yours.

208
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,330
No. No.
Tell me.

209
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,180
By the way, when we're on a date,

210
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,000
can I hold her hand?

211
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,940
This depends on the person.

212
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,060
Try holding her hand.

213
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,290
If she doesn't dodge,

214
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,700
it means you can.

215
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:38,800
Hey.

216
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,100
Brother Yang.

217
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,570
This way.

218
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,680
Hey.

219
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,150
How did you know I wanted this?

220
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,750
Can you read my mind?

221
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,320
You need to pay attention to your date.

222
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,420
What she's looking at

223
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,110
and what she likes.

224
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,110
Wow.

225
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,920
By the way, do you know about coconut pancakes too?

226
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,550
Yes.

227
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
When I was young... Hey!

228
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,940
It's hot.

229
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,340
I was about to tell you.

230
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,880
Give it to me.

231
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,750
Blow it before eating.

232
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,680
Look.

233
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,540
And you were talking about me. Did you burn yourself?

234
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,820
It's hot.

235
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,550
It's really hot.

236
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,150
I didn't know it was that hot at first.

237
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,460
Do you want more?

238
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,700
Sure.
Let me blow it for you.

239
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,470
I promise it's not hot anymore.

240
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,450
The view here is as beautiful as ever.

241
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,050
What are you doing here?

242
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,150
Tammy followed the scenic spots on the postcard and came here

243
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,500
so I came with her.

244
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,540
It may not look like anything,

245
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,840
but

246
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,050
this was a great time.

247
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,060
Don't forget to take photos next time.

248
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,760
The view is so beautiful.

249
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,840
Yeah.

250
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,480
The view is really beautiful.

251
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,100
By the way, Brother Yang,

252
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,820
we've never taken a photo together.

253
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,340
Shall we take a photo?

254
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Let's take a photo.

255
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,510
Take a selfie.

256
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,280
Yes.

257
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:04,970
Sure.

258
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,400
But don't post it.

259
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
Okay, come on. Take a picture.

260
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,880
One, two, three.

261
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,640
Look at the camera. 1, 2, 3.

262
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,930
- Isn't it pretty? There's a ferris wheel too.
- Yes.

263
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,370
What?

264
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,400
They sell it in pairs.

265
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,200
It looked cute

266
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,230
so I bought it for you.

267
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,540
Thank you, brother.

268
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,120
What is it? A magpie?

269
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,080
Yes.

270
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,420
As for the other one,

271
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,010
it protects the female magpie.

272
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,730
It's Chinese Valentine's Day in a few days.

273
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,990
It's called the Qixi Festival.

274
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,380
According to legend, there is a bridge. The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl meet after they cross it.

275
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,130
That bridge is called the Magpie Bridge

276
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,330
because the magpies gather to form a bridge.

277
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,100
Are you going back?

278
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,020
Not yet.

279
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,300
Let's go.

280
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,320
Let's go to the last place.

281
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,970
There's more?

282
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,730
Follow me.

283
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,320
Hurry up. Follow me.

284
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,010
Oh no.

285
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,520
You even put tea in your bag?

286
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,130
I know it's hot today.

287
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,870
So I had to bring something refreshing.

288
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,830
When people are refreshed...

289
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,220
Yes.

290
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,180
It's refreshing.

291
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,170
Hey, this is good for you.

292
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,700
And it's good, right?

293
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,040
It's good.

294
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,580
Hold this for me.

295
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,730
Are you going to invite Tammy to play baseball?

296
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,690
No, I want to play with you.

297
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,800
I remember you like baseball

298
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,110
so I wanted to invite you to play pass-the-ball.

299
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,730
You probably haven't played it since you came to Thailand.

300
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,030
So I wanted to invite you to play with me.

301
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,550
Can you still play?

302
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,120
Catch it.

303
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,650
Uh.

304
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,060
Throw hard.

305
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,500
Good job.

306
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,790
Catch.

307
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,870
Harder.

308
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,410
Nice.

309
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,920
Brother, catch it.

310
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,920
Brother Yang, how long has it been since you played catch?

311
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,300
Well...

312
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,600
Two or three years.

313
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,700
- Yes, two or three years.
- Here.

314
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,510
Brother Yang.

315
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,880
Tell me about your ex-girlfriend.

316
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,950
About what?

317
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,280
I'm just wondering.

318
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,510
Why do people break up?

319
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,280
If we date someone,

320
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,740
we must know each other very well, don't you think?

321
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,310
That's how relationships are.

322
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,390
People can go from people you like

323
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,490
to people you don't.

324
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,280
But they can also go from people you don't like

325
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,420
to people you do.

326
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,330
Hey.

327
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,760
The weather is nice.

328
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,300
We can't

329
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,680
guarantee our feelings.

330
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,900
So...

331
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,570
What kind of lovers don't you want to meet?

332
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,030
Well...

333
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,720
Maybe someone who likes to judge people from their looks.

334
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,900
People who judge others from their looks.

335
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,170
So,

336
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,000
what kind of lovers do you want to meet?

337
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,630
Huh?

338
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,720
Someone with whom I feel comfortable

339
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,040
and have something in common.

340
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,200
It'll be better

341
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,480
if we like the same things.

342
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,460
So

343
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,860
what would you do

344
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,720
if that person shows up?

345
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,230
If I met that person,

346
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,070
I might

347
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,610
do this.

348
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,990
Walk properly. Be careful.

349
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,590
Take care.

350
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,960
Are you okay?

351
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,500
Yes.

352
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,050
Go on.

353
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,520
Did we

354
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,060
disturb them?

355
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,370
No.

356
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,010
Can we take a look by the way?

357
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,130
I hope you meet that person soon.

358
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,280
Thank you so much for today, Brother Yang. See you tomorrow.

359
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,490
Oh, right. We won't see each other tomorrow.

360
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,210
I'll get going then. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

361
00:25:53,650 --> 00:26:11,120
[Do your best tomorrow]

362
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:36,950
[Don't forget to memorize the sentence I taught you]

363
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,140
Did you invite Tammy to play baseball too?

364
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,220
No. I'm playing it with you.

365
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,280
I remember you like baseball.

366
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,570
So I wanted to invite you to play catch.

367
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,210
You probably haven't played it since you came to Thailand.

368
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,580
So I wanted to invite you to play with me.

369
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,300
Good luck.

370
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,780
Ask me if you have any questions.

371
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,450
-Phumjai. -Hi, Tammy.

372
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,140
Where should we go?

373
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,950
I want to go shopping today.

374
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,970
You want to go shopping. Follow me.

375
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,460
Okay.

376
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,700
Where did they go?

377
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,040
I know, right? We were following them just now.

378
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,710
What should we do now?

379
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,980
How about this?

380
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,950
Let's follow them there.

381
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,870
We'll keep tracking them if we see them.

382
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,970
But if we don't see them,

383
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,940
we can take it as a date.

384
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:55,840
Okay?

385
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,610
We've been disguised like this.

386
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,260
No one can recognize us.

387
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,310
Okay, Phumjai?

388
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,430
Is that okay?

389
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,780
But even

390
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,180
someone we think will always be by our side

391
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,050
may leave us

392
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,240
one day.

393
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,340
Okay, Phumjai?

394
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,110
You're not in their way anyway.

395
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,440
Is that okay?

396
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,420
All right.

397
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,330
Let's go.

398
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,990
Let's go, Tag. Let's go.

399
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,750
Oh, follow me.

400
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,610
Qi'er, look.

401
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,010
Hey, Tammy's post.

402
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,280
-Is this Phumjai? -Let me see.

403
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:05,900
Hey.

404
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,230
-Here. -It is him.

405
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,950
They're together.

406
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,710
What a beautiful view!

407
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,540
Is this the scenery on the postcard that Phumjai mentioned?

408
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,000
It is.

409
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,860
Yeah, the view is really beautiful.

410
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,690
-Yes. -Think about it. It'd be nice

411
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,130
if they took photos together.

412
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,080
We lost them anyway.

413
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,550
But we're here on a date, aren't we?

414
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,170
Isn't it nice?

415
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,040
Yeah.

416
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,490
Like this.

417
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,060
I can rarely come out with you.

418
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,940
You're always busy with work and don't have time.

419
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,870
You're exaggerating.

420
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,090
No.

421
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,080
I should thank Phumjai this time.

422
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,750
You're being dramatic.

423
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,300
Tell me where you want to go.

424
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,760
That's all.

425
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,890
You said that.

426
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:11,830
Yes.

427
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,930
Then...

428
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,630
Can we not pretend when I want to go on a date next time?

429
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,090
Why?

430
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,190
Don't I look cool this way?

431
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,190
Well, I just think Phumjai has a job now.

432
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,170
And he's getting better and better.

433
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,410
I think we can make it public.

434
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,650
Is that okay?

435
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,010
Sure.

436
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,540
Really?

437
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
But

438
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,010
let me think about it first.

439
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,000
Okay.

440
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,889
Brother Yang,

441
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,989
I have something to tell you.

442
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:19,540
What?

443
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,780
Are you here to show off your date with Tammy?

444
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,210
Huh?

445
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,590
So you didn't have time to read my texts.

446
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,810
The date went well.

447
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,100
But... Why isn't it what I thought it would be?

448
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,719
Why?

449
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,420
You had a date with someone you like.

450
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,000
Aren't you happy?

451
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,929
I don't know.

452
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:45,639
But

453
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,420
I feel strange.

454
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:52,949
Okay.

455
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,040
When we were eating together,

456
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,600
the chopsticks reminded me of the time you taught me how to use them.

457
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,640
Phumjai.

458
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,970
Phumjai.

459
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,140
What, Tammy?

460
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,070
Is my sunflower cute?

461
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,280
Yes.

462
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,930
When we were at the cake shop,

463
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,730
I drew a sun on the cake.

464
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,540
Then I thought of the name of the supermarket

465
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,610
and your name.

466
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,620
We went to the market together.

467
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,580
But when I saw the coconut pancake, I thought of you

468
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,570
burning your mouth on a coconut pancake. It was funny.

469
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,360
Do you want some?

470
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,460
No.

471
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,410
Let's go. Let's keep going.

472
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,570
I'm so happy to be back here.

473
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,770
But last time, I lost my phone. We didn't take any photos.

474
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,120
Let's take a picture together this time.

475
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,520
Okay.

476
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,880
Although I could take photos with Tammy,

477
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,770
it reminded me of the time when I took a picture with you

478
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,430
and you made fun of me.

479
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,530
It was funnier.

480
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,410
I wanted to give

481
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,180
the necklace you bought for me to Tammy,

482
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,230
but then I changed my mind.

483
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,340
Then, I sent Tammy back to her apartment.

484
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:55,360
Thank you for taking me to have fun today.

485
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,010
Thank you, Tammy.

486
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,870
To be honest,

487
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,360
I was worried you'd be bored.

488
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,140
Of course, I wouldn't.

489
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm with a special person.

490
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,830
Yeah.

491
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,450
I'm with a special person.

492
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,690
Of course, I enjoy it.

493
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,920
I believe

494
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,860
it is fate

495
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,130
that we can see each other again.

496
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:35,770
What do you think?

497
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,830
Yeah.

498
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,740
I have to go.

499
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,980
I need to help my friend with work.

500
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,190
I'll get going.

501
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,280
We almost kissed.

502
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,960
But I couldn't do it.

503
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,740
So I left.

504
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,520
Why?

505
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,990
You worked so hard to get the chance.

506
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,510
I don't know why that happened.

507
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,830
Although

508
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,760
I was so close to Tammy,

509
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,060
I only

510
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,460
thought of your face.

511
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,160
Your face kept appearing in my mind.

512
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,150
And I didn't know

513
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,350
what to do.

514
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,730
Do you know what I prayed for in the shrine?

515
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,690
[Directors: Phadung Samajarn, Worawut Thanamatchaicharoen]

516
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,030
I don't understand why he kissed you.

517
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,040
Didn't he help you woo Tammy?

518
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,050
Now I don't know how I feel about him.

519
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,460
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

520
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,990
You may not be wrong.

521
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,850
It's because of me.

522
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:24,620
I…

523
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,710
I accidentally developed a crush on you.

524
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,540
Do you think

525
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
you have a crush on me?
