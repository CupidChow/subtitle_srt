Tammy.

Uh... Phumjai.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,480
What should I do?

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,530
I don't know what to say.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,400

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,310

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,019

Yang, now...

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,160
How do I look?

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,260
You look fine.

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,440
No, it's not okay. Look at what I'm wearing. I'm not handsome at all.

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:17,970
Well...

23
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,830
Yang, do you have a suit? Can I borrow it?

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,300
Hey.

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,900
Calm down.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,289
Can you be rational?

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,050
It's good to be yourself.

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,580
You won't be yourself if you're being too deliberate.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,390
Then...

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,360
What if Tammy doesn't like me?

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,600
That's good.

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,370
You'll be clear then.

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,350
If she likes you, keep it. If she doesn't, that's it.

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,850
It's better than forcing yourself to be someone unlike you, right?

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,420
All right.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,560

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,230
you made these brands by yourself?

Yes.

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,590

79
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,200
My name is Phumjai.

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
I chatted with you online

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,930

do you remember

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,740
that we met three years ago?

86
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,080
It was

87
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,430
when you came to Thailand.

88
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,630

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,140
Oh.

90
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,620
You lost your phone, didn't you?

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,440
I can recall it. Is that you?

92
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,890
I knew it. You look familiar to me.

93
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,159
Then why didn't you tell me from the start?

94
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,770
I was looking for him when I came to Thailand too.

95
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,500
But I didn't have his contact.

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,060
I wanted to treat him to a meal to express my gratitude.

97
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,820
It's okay.

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,280

99
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,300

101
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,890

120
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,940

125
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,890
Yeah. I put these labels on the things you like.

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,409

143
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,950
Wait.

144
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,200
Look here and zoom in.

145
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,680
Look at this photo.

146
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,260
You're my sweetheart.

147
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,820
And look here.

148
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,960
Look, she's grabbing the corner of his clothes.

149
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,570
The same person, right?

150
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,270
Oh no.

151
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,550
She is obviously a player.

152
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,590
I won't let this woman fool Phumjai.

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,780
-Yang. -Yeah.

154
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,720
Yang, Tammy sent me a message.

155
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,800
Can't you translate it yourself?

156
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,230
Why do you have to bother me?

157
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,830
I'm happy.

158
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,670

159
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,360

160
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,070

161
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Right.

162
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,730
I'll talk to them first. Good night.

163

164
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,370
Are you here to see me?

165
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,830
No, I'm here to protect Phumjai.

166
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,670
So if Tammy suddenly shows up, I can handle it in time.

167
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,220
What a shame.

168
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,520

169
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,000
It's good that you're here.

170
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,360
I can

171
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,700
have you by my side.

172
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,800
I'll think of it

173
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,780
as your protection for me.

174
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,990
Get back to work.

175
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,990
-You'll get caught. Go. -Okay.

176
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,290
I want to set a goal for our store. Sales increased 300,000 baht a month.

177
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,870
What do you think?

178
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,140
Great, boss.

179
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,460
I think if our website is completed,

180
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,790
the online orders will increase.

181
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,890
Sir.

182
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,550
What should we do about the storefront?

183
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,670

184

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,890
Great.

188
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,590
Hey.

189
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,150
I hope the sales can stay at 5,000 baht.

195

198
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,290
Amazing, boss.

199
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,530
Phumjai, the boss is looking at you.

200
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,480
What?

201
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,260
Oh.

202
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,350
Oh.

203
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,490
Online. Yeah, online.

204
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Very good. Let's do it.

205
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
Let's do the oden.

206
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,290
Go help Tag with online sales.

207
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,980
I'll go get the oden ready.

208
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,860
If you keep distracting,

209
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,110
I won't teach you Chinese.

210
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,970
I understand.

211
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,500
Let's go, Tag.

212
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,870
Let's do the website together.

213
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,910
Let's go.

214
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,880
Yang.

215
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,750
Can you translate the word for me?

216
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,650
What word?

217
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,230
She said she was exhausted, not a failure.

218
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:31,900
Gosh.

219
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,140
Why is the website translated like this?

220
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,630
Why is "failure" followed by "555"?

221
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,000
Why is Tammy laughing?

222
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,400
The "555" here is not like "Hahaha" in Thai. It means "crying" in Chinese.

223
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,810
"555" means the sound of crying.

224
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,020
It represents crying.

225
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,750
So is what I copied and pasted from the internet

226
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,000
correct?

227
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,680
Oh.

228
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,100
Yang.

229
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,720
Yang, is this sentence weird?

230
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:10,780
Thank you.

231
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,530
Yang, please reply to the message for me.

232
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,240
Thank you.

233
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,340
You talk to her so frequently.

234
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,050
Don't you think

235
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,640
she has other chatting partners?

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,410
But she came all the way here to see me.

237
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Thank you.

238
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,810
-Yang, translate for me. -I told you. Don't disturb me if it's not necessary.

239
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,620
It's necessary every day.

240
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,930
Tammy,

241
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,970
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

242
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,540
Well, I was shooting nearby,

243
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,710
so I came to buy something.

244
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,430
Sure.

245
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,610
Pick whatever you want. I'll carry it for you.

246
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,710
Stop here.

247
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,450
Here you are.

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,490
Wow.

249
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,390
What brings you here?

250
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,370
I came to buy something.

251
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,340
A white ant spray.

252
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,250
I think

253
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,460
there are many white ants nearby.

254
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,510
It's over there. Pick one yourself.

255
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,710
Okay, let's go and pick out the products together.

256
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,490
Here.

257
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:48,990
What?

258
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,850
Take it.

259
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,250
You said you wanted the spray.

260
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,750
Oh, right. Did you write all the stuff online about your store yourself?

261
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,690
Yes.

262
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,790
How did you know?

263
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,660
I thought of your character after reading it.

264
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,450
How could it be someone else?

265
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,070
The content is so good.

266
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,190
You're indeed a boss.

267
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,330
You're the first one to call me boss.

268
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,610
Really?

269
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm happy I'm the first one to call you that.

270
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,110
I wouldn't care

271
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,540
if you were the last one to call me.

272
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,340
I think we should choose the products.

273
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,690
What?

274
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,020
What's wrong?

275
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,310
Why are you still here?

276
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,110
I don't like that woman messing with my brother.

277
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,200
What about you?

278
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,330
You're keeping an eye on them.

279
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,330
Do you have any idea?

280
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:55,960
Well,

281
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,770
your brother doesn't care about the shop,

282
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,660
but Tammy.

283
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,680
Tammy, do you eat collagen?

284
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,480
But

285
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,470
I don't think you need it.

286
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,359
Look.

287
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,099
I don't think she can switch channels in time.

288
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,800
I have to do something.

289
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,119
Hey, wait.

290
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,010
What?

291
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,690
I'll do it.

292
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,940
What else flavors do you like except the taste of pork?

293
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,600
Choose what you like.

294
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,390
Oh, okay.

295
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,860
Which flavor do you like?

296
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,830
I like this flavor.

297
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,210
Oh.

298
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,570
Aren't you picking up?

299
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,440
What are you doing?

300
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,310
If you are still the same, don't give others false hope.

301
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,890
Especially, he's my partner.

302
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,030
You're fooling others around.

303
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,910
I think it's troublesome

304
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,370
when people relate my store with you.

305
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,000
What are you talking about?

306
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,310
I told Yang that the quality of the things I bought last time

307
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,590
was not good…

308
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,020
So I suggest returning it

309
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,530
and buying it from other shops.

310
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,670
What?

311
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,110
Yeah.

312
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,270
I haven't invited you to dinner

313
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,120
to thank you that you took me out last time.

314
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,500
I'll take you to a great restaurant next time.

315
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,940
Okay.

316
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,260
Oh.

317
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,710
A great restaurant where you'll post

318
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,050
"Alone"

319
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,540
on Instagram,

320
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,350
but with two pairs of chopsticks.

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,360
Phumjai, I like to use two pairs of chopsticks.

322
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,020
Will you believe me?

323
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
It's normal.

324
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,660
You need to keep extra.

325
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,370
Don't waste your energy.

326
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,320
You're wasting your energy.

327
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,720
You're cunning.

328
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,620
I'm cunning?

329
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,720
You're the shameless one.

330
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,090
What are you talking about?

331
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,720
I think I heard the word

332
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,350
"Shameless".

333
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,450
What does it mean?

334
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,980
Oh, I'm praising him for being considerate.

335
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,340
"Shameless."

336
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,210
Oh, I see.

337
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,130
I also think Yang is...

338
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,530
"Shameless".

339
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,480
"Shameless".

340
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,600
"Shameless".

341
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,510
I'll use it more often to describe Yang.

342
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,800
Thank you.

343
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:43,980
You're welcome.

344
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,060
You're just partners.

345
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,220
Why do you care so much?

346
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,020
Let's go, Phumjai. Let's go check out.

347
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,700
Bye.

348
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,800
OK.

349
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,360
"Shameless."

350
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,770
Yang is a shameless person.

351
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,470
Yeah.

352
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,120
-Hahaha. -Great.

353
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,110
Yes, "shameless".

354
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,000
"Shameless".

355
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
Very fluent. Tell me if you want to learn Chinese.

356
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,860
Thank you.

357
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,610
When do you get off work?

358
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,810
Actually, I can get off work now.

359
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,020
Look, Tammy texted me again.

360
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,840
I think she's interested in me too.

361
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Right, Yang?

362
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,650
She just sent messages.

363
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,470
Don't think too much.

364
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
You're just acquaintances

365
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,580
who helped each other.

366
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,530
She may not only talk to you.

367
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,880
But I'm happy

368
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,740
as long as she doesn't ignore me.

369
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,510
Yang, this may be a good start.

370
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,810
She may not be as good as you think.

371
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,720
It's okay.

372
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,960
Each of us has a side that we don't want to be discovered.

373
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,260
Look at this.

374
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,330
Your Tammy

375
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,180
talk to many people at the same time.

376
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,200
Will you continue to talk to her after finding it out?

377
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,430
She has a lot of fans.

378
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,770
Isn't it normal for her to talk to a lot of people?

379
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,260
Alright, take it back.

380
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,150
Okay?

381
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,580
How can you laugh?

382
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeah.

383
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,130
I knew about this long ago.

384
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,590
Look.

385
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,650
The KOL you're chasing is not just talking to you.

386
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,170
Look.

387
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,340
How is it?

388
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,870
Brother.

389
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,530
Is this all you see? How do you know it's Tammy?

390
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,670
Are you blind?

391
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,780
I'm here to remind you

392
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,170
because I don't want you to be cheated by a woman.

393
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,850
Brother, Tammy is not a bad person.

394
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,030
Phojai, you don't have to worry about me.

395
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,780
Phumjai! Phumjai!

396
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,080
No matter what happens,

397
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,230
I will like Tammy as before.

398
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,940
If she is dating many guys at the same time,

399
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,640
I will be nice to those guys.

400
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,220
So that she can date more guys.

401
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,820
Wish you success.

402
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,930
What should we do

403
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,600
to increase sales?

404
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,310
Well, boss...

405
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,870
Sun Wu, a famous ancient Chinese strategist once said,

406
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,440
"If you know the enemy and know yourself,

407
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,630
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."

408
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,060
So,

409
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,990
we need to pay a visit to other shops,

410
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,640
and see what they are doing.

411
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,440
Come on, Brother Yang. Let's go.

412
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,740
Let's go see other shops

413
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,010
so that we can learn from them.

414
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,860
You want to increase sales, right?

415
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,950
Let's go. Come on. I also want to have more customers.

416
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,160
Let's go see other shops.

417
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,390
Come on.

418
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,110
Brother Yang, let's go.

419
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,980
Croissant.

420
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,300
Chicken salad.

421
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,170
Not bad.

422
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,380
So,

423
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,480
you came here to enjoy the food?

424
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,370
There is no point

425
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,830
in coming here.

426
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,610
Brother Yang.

427
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm not just eating the food.

428
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,990
Look over there.

429
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,860
There is a place where people can take photos in the restaurant.

430
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,250
The customers take photos there before having their meals.

431
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,330
It's a good idea. They will help promote the restaurant.

432
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,890
But we are running a small shop

433
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,850
not a restaurant.

434
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,430
But we can try this idea.

435
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,100
I brought you here

436
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,680
because you haven't had a nice meal for days.

437
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,210
Besides our shop, Little Sun,

438
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,870
I also care about you.

439
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,290
Here, eat.

440
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,060
It's delicious.

441
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,710
Look.

442
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,930
If we hope to attract more young people,

443
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,860
we should learn from this shop. It will work.

444
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,000
But it will cost a lot of money

445
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,650
if we redecorate Little Sun.

446
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,090
Not necessarily.

447
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,190
We can try DIY.

448
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,730
Do It Yourself.

449
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,130
It's not expensive.

450
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,390
Really.

451
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,080
No.

452
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,180
No one

453
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,750
will agree with you.

454
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,650
Everyone agrees but you.

455
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,670
Come on.

456
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,120
Give me some money for the redecoration.

457
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,110
You have to give me the money.

458
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,170
Everyone agrees to try my idea.

459
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,200
OK, boss?

460
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:19,980
Okay?

461
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,100
Let's do it together.

462
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,620
Brother Yang. You're tall. Help me with this.

463
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,440
Brother Yang.

464
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,060
Get ready.

465
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,080
Okay, okay.

466
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,490
One, two. Ten seconds.

467
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,640
-Ten seconds.
-Hurry.

468
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,430
The photo will be taken right away.

469
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,650
Let's check the photo.

470
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,000
This shop?

471
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,620
Yes, this one.

472
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,620
Look, it's here.

473
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,680
Welcome to Little Sun.

474
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,030
Excuse me.

475
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,370
Can you take a photo for us?

476
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,080
Sure.

477
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,560
Let's go.

478
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,170
Be closer.

479
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,200
It's pretty.

480
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,650
One, two, three.

481
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,680
Okay.

482
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,410
Hope to see you again.

483
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,570
See? More and more people are coming to the shop.

484
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,630
Yeah, many people came.

485
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,540
But they didn't buy anything.

486
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,050
They just took a photo and left.

487
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,180
They will buy stuff next time.

488
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,100
Don't worry. It'll take some time.

489
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,050
Brother Yang, look.

490
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,240
Our online sales have reached 1,500 baht today.

491
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,950
-Hello.
-Hello.

492
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,890
-Hello.
-Welcome to Little Sun.

493
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,870
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

494
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,530
-Welcome. Many goods are on sale. Come and have a look at any time.
-Yes.

495
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,090
Welcome.

496
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,760
We have a dancing cat.

497
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,630
-We have a dancing cat.
-Come in and have a look.

498
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,970
Take the flyer, please.

499
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,190
-Please take it.
-Dancing cat! Dancing cat!

500
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,670
-Dancing cat!
-It's so funny. I want to dance with the cat.

501
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,450
Dancing cat! Dancing cat! Let's dance together.

502
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,610
-Dancing cat! Dancing cat!
-Little Sun! Little Sun!

503
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,550
Should we keep dancing?

504
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,640
What's wrong, Brother Yang?

505
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,240
This is your idea?

506
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,710
Tell me,

507
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,640
why are you doing this stupid thing?

508
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,770
And the costume...

509
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,390
How much is it?

510
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,910
I was just trying a different method.

511
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,180
Getting people to take a photo near our shop isn't...

512
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,210
So you think dancing in this costume will work?

513
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,470
How could it be possible?

514
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,790
They came to take a picture and left.

515
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,320
Do you have a better idea?

516
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,210
Tell me.

517
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,600
I can't think of a better idea.

518
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,690
Is the dancing cat here?

519
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes.

520
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,250
Wait a minute.

521
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,960
Boss,

522
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,850
that costume...

523
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,060
Phumjai used his own money to buy it.

524
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,760
He didn't use the money at our shop.

525
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,360
Don't blame him.

526
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,020
It's his first time to run a business.

527
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,110
Why are you doing this stupid thing?

528
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,010
Do you have a better idea?

529
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,590
Tell me.

530
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,370
I can't think of a better idea.

531
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,360
Here.

532
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,980
It's hot here.

533
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,080
Have some water.

534
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,960
Aren't you mad at me?

535
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,310
You think my idea sucks.

536
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,100
Well.

537
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,500
But we have more customers now

538
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,070
than we did when we just opened the shop.

539
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,910
Really?

540
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,200
Yes.

541
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,650
Although the sales are not very high,

542
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,870
more and more people are coming to the shop.

543
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,720
Look.

544
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,210
More and more people

545
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,740
are following our shop's page.

546
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,180
Wow.

547
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,930
-Then I should go attract more customers.
-Wait.

548
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,200
After we close the shop today,

549
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,960
let's go eat ice-cream bread.

550
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,290
Oh.

551
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,590
You want to ask me

552
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,460
to go see other shops and learn their marketing strategies, right?

553
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:15,550
I...

554
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,710
Uh...

555
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,060
Yes.

556
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,170
Have some water.

557
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,050
Drink it.

558
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,600
Bye.

559
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:37,970
I'll go back to work.

560
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,100
Brother Yang.

561
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,240
Aren't you tired? You've been dancing all day.

562
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,290
I made our customers happy. Now I'm making you happy.

563
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,239
Hey, you are smiling.

564
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,580
You know what? You look handsome when you smile.

565
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,540
You should smile more often, okay?

566
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:40,340
When the customers came, you looked so frightening

567
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,510
that they didn't dare to come in.

568
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,230
Don't tease me.

569
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,150
Welcome to Little Sun.

570
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,949
Tammy!

571
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,420
I'll be right back.

572
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,370
What do you want to tell me?

573
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,270
Stop seeing Phumjai.

574
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,150
He's a nice guy. Don't hurt him.

575
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,760
Why do you think I'll hurt Phumjai?

576
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,940
Is it because you didn't get over me?

577
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,870
No.

578
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,900
There are two explanations.

579
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,110
You didn't get over me

580
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,560
Or...

581
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,180
-You like...
-No, no.

582
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,620
I told you it's because he's my business partner.

583
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,330
I don't want to see the shop go out of business.

584
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,540
Well, you're right.

585
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,580
Actually, I didn't want to have a serious relationship with Phumjai.

586
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,200
She may not be as good as you think.

587
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,300
Brother Yang, it's okay.

588
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,870
Everyone has a side that we don't want to be discovered.

589
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,070
But after knowing him,

590
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,790
I found he was a simple person.

591
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,770
He's innocent

592
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,910
and cares about others.

593
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,450
I care about Little Sun.

594
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,690
I care about you too.

595
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,480
Not only does he know my likes and dislikes,

596
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,340
he's also been trying to really know about me.

597
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,440
And he never makes others feel embarrassed.

598
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,160
You know what? You look handsome when you smile.

599
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,830
Whenever I look back,

600
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,020
he is always there.

601
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,860
It's like...

602
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
When I am thinking of him,

603
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,430
I cannot help smiling.

604
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,120
So I think I should take it seriously now.

605
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,450
I'm not dating any other guy now.

606
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,250
You may rest assured.

607
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,680
Please do not interfere with my decision.

608
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,860
[Thank you for telling me]

609
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,860
[I've met someone I really love]

610
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,530
And about the shop.

611
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,240
You don't have to worry about it.

612
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,040
I didn't meant to ruin Phumjai's shop.

613
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,580
Instead, I'll help you promote your products.

614
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,530
I made the hashtags popular so that more people will come to your shop.

615
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,480
For Phumjai,

616
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,140
I'm willing to do everything.

617
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,550
What a pity. Tammy didn't come with us to eat the ice-cream bread.

618
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,770
Oh, Brother Yang.

619
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,020
I have a question.

620
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,510
Do you have any friends in Thailand?

621
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,330
Where are your parents?

622
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,650
Where are they? I haven't seen them.

623
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,850
They are in China, of course.

624
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,410
Why are you asking this?

625
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,630
Here, look at this.

626
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,910
This is today's sales.

627
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,400
Today,

628
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,760
we sold five 5,000 baht worth of goods offline.

629
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,890
Wow.

630
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,970
The online sales are 6,000 baht.

631
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,670
Wow.

632
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,120
If this continues,

633
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,810
our shop will have more and more profits.

634
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,990
I'm so happy, Brother Yang.

635
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,230
I'd like to dance every day for our shop.

636
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,670
Wow, there is a cat.

637
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,570
Meow, meow, meow.

638
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,230
Do you like cats too?

639
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,740
I didn't know about that.

640
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,570
I like cats too.

641
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,930
I got to know it long ago.

642
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,600
Did I tell you?

643
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,420
You told me when we were discussing how to name our shop around the table.

644
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,120
You said

645
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,350
you like green, cats,

646
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,940
spicy food,

647
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,930
and baseball.

648
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,330
What?

649
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,020
You remember everything about me?

650
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,620
Well...

651
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,330
I have a good brain

652
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:29,730
so I have a good memory.

653
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,450
I can remember anything even if someone says it only once.

654
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,300
Oh.

655
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,660
You have a good memory.

656
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,270
Do you want some?

657
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,860
Take a bite.

658
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,130
Eat it in one bite. It's melting on my hands.

659
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,360
Eat it.

660
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,810
Isn't it good?

661
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,270
Brother Yang.

662
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:03,880
Does this mean...

663
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:05,840
What happened?

664
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,310
What's going on?

665
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,670
Does this mean

666
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,700
[Are you free this Sunday?]

667
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,210
Tammy is asking me out?

668
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,550
Maybe.

669
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:25,910
What?

670
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,680
Aren't you happy?

671
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm happy.

672
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:30,960
But...

673
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,560
I can't believe it's true.

674
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,730
Tammy is asking me out!

675
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,900
Will you go see her?

676
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,360
Of course.

677
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,300
I will definitely go see her.

678
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,040
It's Tammy!

679
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,710
Brother Yang, Tammy is asking me out!

680
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,720
But...

681
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,750
I've never gone on a date with anyone.

682
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,260
How about this?

683
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,770
Do me a favor.

684
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:03,870
What favor?

685
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,170
Teach me how to have a date.

686
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,000
OK, Brother Yang?

687
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,410
Help me, please?

688
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,560
Teach me.

689
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,140
Let's go. Are you ready to go on a date with me?

690
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
It's said that the first date shouldn't last more than three hours.

691
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,970
Where should Tammy and I go?

692
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,540
Don't be nervous. We're just practicing today.

693
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,540
Brother Yang.

694
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,550
What's up, Brother Yang?

695
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,440
The Qixi Festival (the Chinese Valentine's Day) is just a few days away.

696
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,890
It looks beautiful

697
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,320
so I bought it for you.

698
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,140
What kind of person do you think you'll fall in love with?

699
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,960
Someone who makes me feel comfortable

700
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,950
and can empathize with me.
