00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:47,630
Okay?

186
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,280
Fine.

187
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,360
Yes.

188
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,550
Look, Puzai.

189
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,490
Where?

190
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,430
What are you doing, munchkin? What if someone sees us?

191
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,230
What is that?

192
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,340
I wanted to return that.

193
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,810
One sugar free Americano, please.

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,690
Me too.

195
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:12,990
Okay.

196
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,070
Thank you.

197
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,010
Thank you.

198
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,880
[Partnership investment agreement]

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,780
Uh.

200
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,510
Excuse me.

201
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,610
This...

202
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,820
mini supermarket partnership investment agreement...

203
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,790
Does it have anything to do with Chinese?

204
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,120
Chinese.

205
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,310
Do you mean you need the documents to be in Chinese?

206
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,660
No.

207
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,440
We had a deal. Aren't you going to teach me Chinese?

208
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,170
Huh?

209
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,690
When did I say that?

210
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,140
What? In the elevator.

211
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,160
You said I looked passionate,

212
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,010
so you wanted to teach me Chinese.

213
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,690
No, no, no.

214
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,900
I meant, you seem passionate about business.

215
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,520
Weren't you going to register for the SME Business course?

216
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,050
No, I think you misunderstood.

217
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,320
I was going to sign up for Chinese class.

218
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,610
Here. See?

219
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,210
50% off Chinese class.

220
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,670
Oh.

221
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,770
Then why didn't you make it clear?

222
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:17,900
What?

223
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,680
Why didn't you make it clear?

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,550
Hey.

225
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,580
It's almost past the deadline
for signing up.

226
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,030
What a waste of time.

227
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,360
Oh no.

228
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,050
Where is my phone?

229
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,090
Oh no, where's my phone?

230
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,350
I must have left it at the cafe.

231
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,810
Hello.

232
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,530
Hello.

233
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,020
This way.

234
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,170
Brother, catch him! He's running away! He's in the elevator.

235
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,900
What is he running away from?

236
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,180
Let go of me! Let go!

237
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,610
Calm down.

238
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,970
Give me back my phone.

239
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,200
Steal?

240
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,970
You forgot it.

241
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,880
You're so stubborn.

242
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,980
I saw you trying to escape in the elevator.

243
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,280
Gosh.

244
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,260
If I really wanted to steal it, I would have run out of this building.

245
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,770
I wouldn't be standing here and letting you catch me.

246
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,640
That's what thieves say.

247
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,260
That's what all thieves say.

248
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,250
Ah, she's on live now.

249
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,350
Tammy.

250
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,130
Oh.

251
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,410
Where are you going?

252
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,690
- Tammy!
- My screen is broken.

253
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,050
Today's theme is

254
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,660
- unexpected fate.
- Let go of me!

255
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,020
Stop it!

256
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,450
Come here. My phone screen is broken.

257
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,410
Stop, stop, stop.

258
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,370
See?

259
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
I said I didn't steal it.

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,510
I'll get going then.

261
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,710
How could I know?

262
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,480
If I didn't catch you in the elevator,

263
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,580
you probably would've taken it.

264
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,740
Not only did you frame me,

265
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,950
but you also broke my phone screen.

266
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,460
Pay for it.

267
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,870
For what? It was an accident.

268
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:33,940
Hey.

269
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,570
Is that okay?

270
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,670
Don't you know how to apologize?

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,540
Tammy is livestreaming today.

272
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,880
I've always believed in fate.

273
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,450
What about you guys?

274
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,270
Have you experienced events related to fate in your lives?
- She's live.
-You're not going to apologize?

275
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,080
Hey, give it back.

276
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,530
Give it back!

277
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,230
Hey.

278
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,830
Give it back!

279
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,800
Give it back!

280
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,440
What did you send?

281
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,210
Gosh.

282
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,130
Did you get me blocked?

283
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,810
Humph, you thug!

284
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,270
You hit me first, you idiot!

285
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,720
You have a bad temper and low IQ.

286
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,340
Idiot.

287
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,800
What childish? I'm not childish.

288
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,060
You coward!

289
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,150
Don't shit where you eat.

290
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,920
What? I cleaned it.

291
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,730
Stop.

292
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,110
Both of you, stop!

293
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,220
Please help me.

294
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,590
- He got me blocked.
- He broke my phone screen.

295
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,850
But my account got blocked.

296
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,330
He broke my phone screen.

297
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,860
My account has been blocked.

298
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,740
Who will take responsibility?

299
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,890
Hey!

300
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,820
Stop, stop, stop.

301
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,450
Okay?

302
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,910
It's all his fault.

303
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,010
I have to create a new account.

304
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,710
So troublesome.

305
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,550
Tammy is on live today.

306
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,450
A lot of people came to watch my livestream today.

307
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,180
I’m very happy.
Hey, Tammy.

308
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,730
Thank you so much.

309
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,110
On a bad day,

310
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,980
I still have Tammy.

311
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,790
You're my oasis and my power bank.

312
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,260
I never thought

313
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,700
I would come to Thailand,

314
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,700
speak Thai

315
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,900
and even have Thai friends.

316
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,210
I think this is fate.

317
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,880
And today, I'm here to seek fate.

318
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,200
My future boyfriend

319
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,870
must meet these three conditions.

320
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,360
There are three conditions that must be met to be Tammy's boyfriend.

321
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,430
What are they?

322
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,420
First,

323
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,100
you must speak Chinese.

324
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,480
I can only say hello. Does that count?

325
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,160
Hello.

326
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,410
Second,

327
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,520
you must have leadership qualities and keep your word.

328
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,460
Keep your word.

329
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,820
And the third?

330
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,260
Lastly,

331
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,870
he must be a businessman who has his own business.

332
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,230
I will like that very much.

333
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,140
Because it shows that he's mature.

334
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,490
Then... I have to have my own business.

335
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,260
- Also, I've prepared an event for my fans.
- Okay.

336
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,570
Please

337
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,310
recommend a good restaurant, and if I like it,

338
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,210
you'll receive a reward from me.

339
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
Don't forget to leave a lot of comments.

340
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,570
Restaurant?

341
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,990
No, the restaurant.

342
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,000
This one.

343
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,410
It looks delicious.

344
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,750
It has to be me, Tammy.

345
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,070
Hey, everyone.

346
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,560
How can we have our own business?

347
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,960
Didn't you say you weren't interested in the SME course?

348
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,340
I think Tammy likes businessmen.

349
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,590
By the way, what are you going to do about learning Chinese?

350
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,650
Let me tell you.

351
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,150
I'm so annoyed today.

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,040
I met a crazy guy so I didn't have time to sign up for Chinese class.

353
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,470
Damn it!

354
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,420
Oh, right, Odo.

355
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,640
Keep an eye on the business thing for me.

356
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,060
Bro, no problem.

357
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,190
I'll handle it for you.

358
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,720
Please.

359
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:38,760
This is my name card.

360
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm looking for a business partner.

361
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,690
I want to be your business partner.

362
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,460
Give me the details.

363
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,420
Well...

364
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,520
I have to go.

365
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,339
What?

366
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,230
Aren't you going to talk about the details?

367
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:25,750
Sir.

368
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,660
I know you're looking for a business advisor,

369
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,550
right?

370
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,780
[Business Advisor]
[Antonie Detslip]

371
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,730
Mr. Yang, have a seat.

372
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,960

558
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,990
I just found a partner that fits my requirements too.

559
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,990
Oh, really?

560
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,430
It sounds like

561
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,530
you're a serious person.

562
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,560
I believe

563
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,660
you'll meet a good partner

564
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,110
and succeed together.

565
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,390
Thank you.

566
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,890
I also believe that others can discover your talent.

567
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,560
Thank you.

568
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,630
They all look good.

569
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,430
I'm going to sign the contract tomorrow.

570
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,880
I'll make us reunite as soon as possible.

571
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,670
Hey, go in first.

572
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,910
The partner is already inside. I need to use the toilet.

573
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,740
Okay.

574
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,260
See you later.

575
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,010
See you later.

576
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,430
Hello.

577
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,550
-Oh. -Oh.

578
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,570
What's going on?

579
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,900
Where is he? Odo told me

580
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,680
the partner was in this room.

581
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,700
Don't tell me...

582
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,250
Hey.

583
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,270
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

584
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,490
Anyway, the oranges are for me.

585
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,280
Think of it as my acceptance.

586
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,470
Darn it.

587
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,750
Hey.

588
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,750
Are you crazy?

589
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,660
You bought them for me anyway.

590
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,960
Consider it my acceptance.

591
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,440
We're even now.

592
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,970
We're even?

593
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,140
Chinese oranges

594
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,730
has an auspicious meaning.

595
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,830
It's even more auspicious

596
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,090
if you eat it.

597
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,800
it's very auspicious, right?

598
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,430
If so, you have to eat the skin too.

599
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,360
Wait.

600
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,060
-Let go of me! -It's auspicious, isn't it?

601
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,060
Get lost.

602
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,150
What?

603
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,440
Don't throw it away.

604
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,830
Just take it.

605
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,090
Just take it?

606
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,420
Don't throw it at me.

607
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,190
Just eat it since it's auspicious.

608
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,910
Don't...

609
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,380
You want to do this?

610
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,120
Like this?

611
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,550
Stop it!

612
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,950
Let me summarize again.

613
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,490
Puzai holds 51%.

614
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,750
Mr. Yang has 49% shares.

615
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,060
Even if he has more shares,

616
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,740
Mr. Yang has the final say.

617
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,410
He's the general investor.

618
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,930
And Mr. Yang,

619
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,260
you have to teach him Chinese.

620
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,130
Are you two

621
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,790
signing the contract?

622
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,290
[Can I get your answer about the rental tonight?]

623
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,930
You said you'd wait for me to rent it.

624
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,350
If that gentleman makes the decision first,

625
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,950
I'll give it to him.

626
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,900
Wait and see.

627
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,450
I'll never ask for money from our family again.

628
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,750
And I'm going to make Tammy like me.

629
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,600
The last one is that like

630
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,470
entrepreneurs very much.

631
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,420
Whoever recommends me to a good restaurant

632
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,280
will get a gift.

633
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,520
If Tammy can reply to me,

634
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,140
I'll sign the contract.

635
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,699
Wow, Odo.

636
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,800
Tammy replied.

637
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,139
My gosh.

638
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,310
-Oh, my. -Oh, my.

639
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,380
She replied to me.

640
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,120
My gosh.

641
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,310
Can you sign it now?

642
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,060
Well,

643
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,340
I can sign it.

644
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,440
It's out of pity,

645
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,540
since no one wants to do business with you.

646
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,320
I'm willing to sign it

647
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,900
because I see a child craving to grow up.

648
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,240
Alright.

649
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,390
Congratulations on your business.

650
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,420
Come on.

651
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,400
You're starting a business together.

652
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,610
I hope your career will thrive.

653
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,340
I believe

654
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,440
you'll meet a good partner

655
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,320
and succeed together.

656
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,290
I also believe that others can discover your talent.

657
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,020
Put it over there.

658
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,900
It's better to put it here.

659
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,380
It's better over there. It's close to the window.

660
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,370
But it's easy to grab it here.

661
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,430
It's close too.

662
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,830
I told you to put it there.

663
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,790
-Put it here. -It's close to the window.

664
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,740
It's close to the window.

665
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,230
What's the use of getting close to the window?

666
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,460
Good ventilation.

667
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,140
Put it here.

668
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,460
Put it here.

669
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,850
Why does it need ventilation? Put it closer.

670
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,390
It's better here.

671
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,450
Hey, Tammy.

672
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,900
Hi, Tammy. Hahaha.

673
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,170
Tell me

674
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,420
what she said.

675
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,220
The restaurant you recommended is delicious.

676
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,040
She wants to give you a gift.

677
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,120
What?

678
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,870
Is she going to give me a gift?

679
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,100
Really?

680
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,760
Wow, she's going to give me a gift.

681
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,860
Tammy wants to give me a gift.

682
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,260
Hey.

683
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,780
After this,

684
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,290
help me decorate the shop.

685
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,670
Tammy. Tammy.

686
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,420
She has a gift for me.

687
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,260
Tammy.

688
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,120
Hey.

689
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,580
Have you thought about what to put in the fridge?

690
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,400
I thought of something.

691
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:35,860
Look.

692
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,250
You recommended the shop in the comment section

693
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,790
and then I got the gift.

694
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,200
See? Tammy is so beautiful.

695
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,450
By the way,

696
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,140
please type "Thank you" for me.

697
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,260
Who did you recruit?

698
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:56,990
Well.

699
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,740
I've already decided.

700
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,120
Look.

701
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,310
Here are they.

702
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,740
The first one is Qi'er.

703
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,440
She is 22 years old.

704
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,790
She used to work in all kinds of supermarkets

705
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,460
and pays attention to details.

706
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,980
She's more powerful than Daiyu.

707
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,820
She's the daughter of the owner of a Thai boxing club. Even thieves are afraid of her when they rob.

708
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,440
Next is

709
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,280
Bojji, she's amazing too.

710
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,520
Let me recommend it to you. Come here.

711
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,230
Bojji, 30 years old.

712
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,230
She has sold everything on Earth.

713
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,030
If you want to go diving or pray in the nine temples,

714
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,440
you can reserve it here.

715
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,250
If you want to worship the nine great temples in Bangkok,

716
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
I've arranged everything for you.

717
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,320
Aren't you excited?

718
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,430
It's fine if you're not interested.

719
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,390
The last one.

720
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,850
This is my friend,

721
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,400
Tag. He's my best friend from high school.

722
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,470
He's diligent, hardworking who replies in a second and takes photos.

723
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,010
That's all. There are only three of them.

724
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,700
Fine.

725
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,560
I have no option anyway.

726
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,990
The shop will open soon.

727
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,990
If something goes wrong,

728
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,200
we have to solve it together,

729
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,880
because we're partners.

730
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,130
You should be responsible.

731
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,870
Hello, this is "Chinese girl Tammy loves Thailand". We meet again.

732
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,050
Hello, we meet again. Tammy...

733
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,370
Hey.

734
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,710
Can you name the shop?

735
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,980
That's the name.

736
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,890
Proud Shop. [The name of the male lead means "proud" in Thai]

737
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,140
No.

738
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,240
It's better to have this name.

739
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:45,980
What is it?

740
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,250
Dazzling

741
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
sunlight.

742
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,650
Dazzling sunlight.

743
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,470
Dazzling sunlight?

744
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,870
No, that's old-fashioned.

745
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,510
No way.

746
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,420
It's so long.

747
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,600
It's very auspicious.

748
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,050
Your name is so long. Who can pronounce it right?

749
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,220
So isn't "Rich and Auspicious" a long name?

750
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,590
It's a bisyllable. I don't want it.

751
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,080
So you don't want "Millions" either?

752
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,460
I don't want this word either.

753
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,060
Why not?

754
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,530
I don't know.

755
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,110
But no "Dazzling" either.

756
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,840
Let's pick an auspicious one.

757
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,060
For example, "Mountain".

758
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,800
No.

759
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,850
What mountain? Is our shop on the mountain?

760
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,530
Let's call it "Kitten" because I like cats.

761
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,400
Who would go to a shop called "Kitten"?

762
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,360
Think about the name "rolling".

763
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,880
Didn't you say

764
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,460
you want an auspicious one?

765
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,380
That's too much.

766
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,260
I don't want this either.

767
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,470
What does this word mean? Translate it for me.

768
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,580
This one. It's also auspicious.

769
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,330
Wait a minute.

770
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,270
Xiao...

771
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,170
Tai...

772
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,270
Yang…

773
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,710
Xiao Tai Yang.

774
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,380
What does that mean?

775
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,400
Xiao Tai Yang

776
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,870
means

777
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,760
"Little Sun".

778
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,360
Oh, Little Sun.

779
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,990
Not bad.

780
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,500
Let's turn "lek" into "noi". [Both these two words represent "small"]

781
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,210
I like the word "Noi".

782
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,540
Uh.

783
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,640
But I want "Little Sun".

784
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,830
Everyone, the package is here.

785
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,630
Hurry up.

786
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,050
Wow.

787
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,510
It's so pretty.

788
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,880
Put it on.

789
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,050
Put it on.

790
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,470
Put it on.

791
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,480
Put it on.

792
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,070
The color is so pretty.

793
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,950
Yeah.

794
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,050
It looks good.

795
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,720
Are you done?

796
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,680
Go back to work after you're done.

797
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,800
You're not wearing it right.

798
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,720
Not bad.

799
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,770
It's nice.

800
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,990
You look good.

801
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,900
Indeed.

802
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,210
So good.

803
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,390
Not bad.

804
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,140
Welcome to "Little Sun".

805
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,580
[Directed by Phadung Samajam, Worawut Thanamatchaicharoen]

806
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,210
Has my brother been working hard since the opening?

807
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,240
What is this?

808
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,180
Tammy's signboard.

809
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,230
Why are you putting it here?

810
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,500
A customer booked all the label products.

811
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,920
I like it.

812
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,560
From now on,

813
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,630
you must call me brother.

814
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,410
If you call me brother, I'll consider

815
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,850
your market plan.

816
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,190
Yang. Yang.
