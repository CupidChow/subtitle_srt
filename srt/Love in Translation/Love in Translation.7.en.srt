00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,140
Fish tofu.

188
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,710
- Freeze cheese tofu.
- Do you want it?

189
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,000
Chikuwa.

190
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,200
Look at Bojji's typing. What's Chiwkuwa?

191
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,320
This is Chikuwa. Fishcake.

192
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,480
- Octopus balls.
- These are fish balls and octopus balls.

193
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,630
If you combine them, you get octopus fish balls. Crab-shaped fish balls.

194
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,610
There are crab-shaped ones?

195
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,810
And this, fish tofu.

196
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,090
See? But this is not crab-shaped.

197
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,890
You eat a lot.

198
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,670
Here. No. 2 eggs.

199
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,660
Do you have this egg?

200
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,760
082 435
[Phone number]

201
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,410
Take it.

202
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,190
No?

203
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,650
No, there's only my number.

204
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,180
Can you get something from the car?

205
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,000
Okay.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,470
Sure.

207
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,270
Let's go.

208
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,530
Let's go.

209
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,300
I'll go put the stuff down.

210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,310
Okay.

211
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,200
Hey Odo.

212
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,190
You're still here?

213
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,530
You took my car.

214
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,140
Let's go.

215
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,250
- Bye.
- Bye, Phumjai.
- Bye.

216
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,550
Okay. Bye. Bye.

217
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,440
Be careful on your way back.

218
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,870
Come on time tomorrow.

219
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,820
- Of course.
- I'm always on time.

220
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,780
I'll ask the boss to dock your pay.

221
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,900
Does it hurt, Brother Yang?

222
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,510
Why would it hurt?

223
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,020
Even a cat running over and hitting me would be more painful.

224
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,640
Then why were you standing there? I wouldn't have seen you.

225
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,880
I wanted to help you mop the floor.

226
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,870
Didn't you have to go home to get your baseball gloves?

227
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,040
Oh, right.

228
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,710
I'll be back soon.

229
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,540
Okay.

230
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,940
See you later.

231
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,150
Hello, Brother Yang.

232
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,020
How do I say this?

233
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,000
You just left.

234
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,990
You're not missing me already, are you?

235
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,410
You're exaggerating.

236
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,290
But I really miss you.

237
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:10,880
Yes.

238
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,460
I miss you too.

239
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,960
By the way, why did you call?

240
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,150
Oh, I just wanted to tell you.

241
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,130
I'm on my way back.

242
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,040
Okay.

243
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,770
I'll wait for you.

244
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,340
See you later.

245
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,850
Brother Yang!

246
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,870
Brother Yang!

247
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,530
Brother Yang!

248
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,680
Brother Yang!

249
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:10,790
Brother Yang!

250
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,000
Brother Yang!

251
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,579
Brother Yang.

252
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,359
Brother Yang.

253
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,030
What should we do?

254
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,740
Can't anyone in China get in touch with Brother Yang?

255
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,680
I've tried to contact as many people as I can.

256
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,550
But Yang hasn't contacted any friends from China

257
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,810
so no one can reach him.

258
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,570
If someone gets in touch with him, I'll let you know right away.

259
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:46,880
Okay.

260
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,300
By the way, Phumjai,

261
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,060
I'm sorry I can't be there for you.

262
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,540
It's okay, Tammy.

263
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,580
Tammy, you've already helped a lot.

264
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,190
Thank you.

265
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,420
Phojai, what do we do?

266
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,050
Calm down.

267
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,090
Be rational.

268
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,840
Think. Did Yang say anything to you?

269
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,800
Well...

270
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,250
I rejected you

271
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,750
because I didn't want you to get into trouble.

272
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,890
My family

273
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,700
has been through a lot.

274
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,550
I'm down to my last dollar to open this place.

275
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,370
If the creditor finds me,

276
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,850
he'll probably take all my money.

277
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,140
My parents will be in even more trouble.

278
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,240
Then...

279
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,820
Where are your parents?

280
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,510
Why don't you get them to move in with us?

281
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,110
To be honest, I don't know either.

282
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,490
I can only contact them through email.

283
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,270
And I only know that they are safe.

284
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,250
Why?

285
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,280
As long as we don't know each other's addresses,

286
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,370
if either of us are taken away someday,

287
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,380
we won't be able to provide the other's address.

288
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,790
That's why we agreed not to know before we separated.

289
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,310
Then...

290
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,210
What are you going to do next?

291
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,390
If the store is profitable,

292
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,760
we'll be able to pay off the debt soon.

293
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,390
Don't worry.

294
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,580
Let's help each other.

295
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,520
I don't know when the creditor will find me.

296
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,840
If he does,

297
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,500
what will happen to our shop?

298
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,170
I think the creditor found Brother Yang

299
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,190
and took him away.

300
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,620
Oh no!

301
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,490
If that's the case,

302
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,440
will he hurt him like in the TV shows?

303
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,390
Bojji.

304
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,810
Calm down.

305
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,250
It might not be what we think.

306
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,790
Calm down.

307
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,820
Hello.

308
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,800
Hello.

309
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,420
We'll investigate the scene of the accident and the CCTV footage first.

310
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,230
No problem.

311
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,730
It's okay.

312
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,020
Calm down.

313
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,230
This...

314
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,910
I don't think today's footage is here.

315
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,720
I think all the footage, since yesterday, is missing.

316
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,210
Maybe something is wrong with the camera.

317
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,310
What do you think we should do?

318
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,290
It's all my fault.

319
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:27,850
I...

320
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,600
Hey, Phumjai.

321
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,170
It happens all the time.

322
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,390
If you don't pay me back a million dollars today,

323
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,530
[If you don't pay me back a million dollars today,]

324
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,010
I'm going to get all of your people.

325
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,140
[I'll get the staff from the store to pay your debt.]

326
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,150
[This has nothing to do with the staff.]

327
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,930
The people in the store have nothing to do with this.

328
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,320
[I don't care.]

329
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,910
I don't care.

330
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,000
[You only gave me interest.]

331
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,180
The interest you gave me...

332
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,230
[Principal amount of debt outstanding]

333
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,270
Are you paying me back or not?

334
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,440
You think 100,000 a month in interest

335
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,650
[100,000 per month in interest]

336
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,830
[is it that easy to find?]

337
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,510
is that easy to find?

338
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,370
[Can't you give me some more time?]

339
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,190
Give me some time.

340
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,060
Okay?

341
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,210
Then work here

342
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,380
[Then work here.]

343
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,360
[Don't go anywhere until you pay off your debt.]

344
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,240
until you pay off your debt.

345
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,370
Remember.

346
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,230
If you mess with me, the people in your store are dead.

347
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,200
Your duty is to move all the things here.

348
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,740
If you're not done,

349
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,840
you won't be able to rest.

350
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,740
Thank you, sir.

351
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,590
No problem.

352
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,140
I'll let you know if there's any progress.

353
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,880
Thank you very much.

354
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

355
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,830
Okay, then...

356
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,250
Let's clean up.

357
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:46,950
Let's go.

358
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,310
Bojji, it's okay.

359
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,660
It's getting late.

360
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,870
Go back and rest.

361
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,730
I'll stay and handle it.

362
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,640
Oh.

363
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Aren't you going back with me?

364
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,030
I'm going to wait for Brother Yang here.

365
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,580
If he hasn't been kidnapped,

366
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,460
he might come back here.

367
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,030
Oh, Phumjai!

368
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,970
You can't do that. If anything happens to you, what should we do?

369
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,970
If you want to stay,

370
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,530
I'll stay with you.

371
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,360
Me too.

372
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,010
Me too.

373
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,420
Me too.

374
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,110
Me too.

375
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,760
Okay, everyone stays. Let's clean up the store together.

376
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,510
Okay?

377
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,810
Let's go.

378
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,960
- Let's go.
- We can help each other out if we want to go home early.

379
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,750
But it's getting late.

380
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,010
- No. Come on.
- Let's all sleep together.

381
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,810
It's been a long day.

382
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,810
Good night.

383
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,850
Good night.

384
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,010
- Good night.
- Good night.

385
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,570
Good night.

386
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,220
Munchkin.

387
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,780
Are we really going to be so silent?

388
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,650
You just came out like this?

389
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,000
Aren't you worried

390
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,150
that they'll know about us after they wake up?

391
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,190
Phumjai has already

392
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
known about us.

393
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,490
Wait.

394
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,360
In fact, Phumjai has known about us for a long time.

395
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,700
Brother, is this your necklace?

396
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:04,770
Yes.

397
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:07,990
Tag…

398
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,700
Gave it to me.

399
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,800
Actually,

400
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,410
-Tag and I... -You're together.

401
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,460
Brother.

402
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,160
I already knew about this.

403
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
You don't have to hide it from me anymore.

404
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,970
Wait.

405
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,870
Did…

406
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,270
Did you already know?

407
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,180
Come on.

408
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,210
I'm your brother.

409
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,130
And Tag is my friend.

410
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,600
How could I not know?

411
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,050
Aren't you mad at me?

412
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,400
After all, I kept it from you.

413
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,350
No.

414
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,940
I'm sure you have your reasons.

415
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,040
It's better to wait for you to tell me.

416
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,540
Though it's too late,

417
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,620
I'm wearing it.

418
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,400
But your necklace is broken.

419
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,000
I know

420
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,640
why you don't want to

421
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,150
fix it.

422
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,670
Why wouldn't I want to fix it?

423
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,090
I didn't want it to break from the beginning.

424
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,880
I'm sorry, cutie.

425
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,760
You knew Phumjai had known about us from the beginning.

426
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,360
Why didn't you tell me?

427
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,960
Because you

428
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,710
just wanted to avoid me.

429
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,050
That's because I didn't know.

430
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,430
Don't go anywhere, okay?

431
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,130
There you are.

432
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:16,900
Brother.

433
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,280
Did you make up with Tag?

434
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,120
Yes.

435
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,010
Congratulations.

436
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,630
So...

437
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,260
What are you going to do with the store?

438
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,180
Should we close it for a while?

439
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,120
The customers just found out about our store.

440
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,790
Besides,

441
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,070
I want Yang to come back and see

442
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,790
our shop run well.

443
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,910
Okay.

444
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,270
Let me help you.

445
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,600
But I'm not the only one.

446
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,150
-I'll help too. -Me too.

447
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,020
We'll help too.

448
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:26,960
Come here.

449
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,179
-Don't cry. -Why are you crying?

450
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,929
Thank you.

451
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,159
Welcome to Little Sun.

452
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,780
Welcome to Little Sun.

453
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,389
Please wait a moment.

454
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,360
You can scan the QR code.

455
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,500
It's good.

456
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,340
Maybe you need to put it lower.

457
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,070
All the goods are here. Move them.

458
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,580
We should turn around.

459
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,150
Nice ride. Be careful.

460
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,800
Left. Turn left.

461
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,920
Be careful.

462
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,660
Watch where you're going.

463
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,500
-Watch the road. -Okay.

464
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,090
Hello, Mom.

465
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,100
Phumjai, a package has arrived.

466
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,100
What is it?

467
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,710
Mom, I didn't buy anything.

468
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,580
I usually have my packages sent to the store.

469
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,260
Huh? But the company name on this package is Chinese.

470
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,200
Really?

471
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,560
Hey.

472
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,330
Mom, where is my stuff?

473
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,090
Here.

474
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,040
Yang.

475
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,610
Is this the package you were waiting for?

476
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,580
Mom.

477
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,250
Mom.

478
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,640
456

479
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,740
360

480
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,270
Mom, I should go.

481
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,470
Okay.

482
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,890
Phumjai, take care of yourself.

483
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,990
Okay, Mom.

484
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,890
I'm sure Yang wrote this.

485
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,670
Wait, what number is this?

486
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,220
This is Yang's language code.

487
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:34,990
Here.

488
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,090
456

489
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,680
360

490
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,740
It's "I miss you".

491
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,690
Oh. Boss.

492
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,900
Is this the only thing you sent?

493
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,270
Is this it?

494
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,910
There is nothing else?

495
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,030
I think there must be more.

496
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,010
Who has a knife?

497
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,040
Here you are.

498
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,330
Thank you.

499
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,540
Wait a minute.

500
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,420
I think we should keep this as evidence.

501
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,630
Open it from the other side.

502
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,820
Be careful.

503
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,800
A tape.

504
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,250
Is there more?

505
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,930
No.

506
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,940
That's it?

507
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,160
What is this?

508
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,580
Could it be that Yang couldn't send clear messages after he was caught?

509
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,150
Yeah, it's really strange.

510
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,690
Let's go find him at the address on the package.

511
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,110
Let's go save Yang together.

512
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,020
-Hold on. -Phumjai.

513
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,270
Isn't that strange?

514
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,370
He sent a package saying he missed you.

515
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,070
Why can't he

516
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,840
write something like "Help"?

517
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,290
Right?

518
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,070
Why would he send it

519
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,980
if he didn't need our help?

520
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,620
What if he's just saying

521
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,540
that he's doing well?

522
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,230
Otherwise, you'll be so worried that you can't eat or sleep.

523
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,330
Brother, do you want me to do nothing?

524
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,430
I can't do anything, right?

525
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,690
Calm down.

526
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:19,970
How about this?

527
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,270
We'll send something back to him later

528
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,870
and see if he needs our help.

529
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,540
What if the codes can't reach Yang?

530
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,590
If we don't help him

531
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,960
and something happens to him…

532
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,060
-What will happen after that? -Phumjai.

533
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,460
Phumjai.

534
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,810
But the most important thing is your safety.

535
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,500
And I'm sure

536
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,350
he feels the same way I do.

537
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,950
Calm down.

538
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,150
Guys.

539
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,470
What is it?

540
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,170
I found the company in the package.

541
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,190
Yes, this is it.

542
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:01,790
It really is.

543
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:02,790
Phumjai.

544
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,510
Have you chosen the codes to send?

545
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,840
548

546
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,490
234

547
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,700
234

548
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm sending it.

549
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,030
Okay.

550
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,880
Just wait.

551
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,190
Hey.

552
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,200
Pack it and send it to my customer later.

553
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,340
Please deliver it quickly.

554
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,080
Okay.

555
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,920
548, 234.

556
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,650
What is this?

557
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:01,860
Let me see.

558
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,610
It's none of your business.

559
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,710
Mind your own business and get lost.

560
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,550
If it's delivered, it should be here.

561
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:25,750
Come on, move them.

562
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,210
And this.

563
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:33,810
Guys.

564
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,830
Yang really sent it back.

565
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,280
9482

566
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,870
It's here. Brother.

567
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,750
Just don't come.

568
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,230
Don't come.

569
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,890
But we can't leave Yang alone.

570
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,840
-Calm down. -Phumjai.

571
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,650
I know you're worried about him.

572
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,120
But if he said so,

573
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,570
it means he didn't want you to save him, right?

574
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,270
Welcome to Little Sun.

575
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,470
Welcome to Little Sun.

576
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,200
Welcome.

577
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,680
Welcome.

578
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,340
-You can consult me. -Uh, do you need help?

579
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,030
-Qi'er, come and help me.

580
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,360
Coming.

581
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,490
You can consult me.

582
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,680
-Hello. -Hello.

583
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,900
Hello.

584
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,300
This is good.

585
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:58,450
Hey.

586
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,270
It must be here.

587
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,500
Oh.

588
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,960
Didn't you ask me to come here?

589
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,650
Oh, right. I think I came to the wrong place.

590
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,120
Oh no.

591
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,110
Yang.

592
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,920
[Directors: Phadung Samajarn
Worawut Thanamatchaicharoen]

593
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:41,740
Let's go.

594
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,790
You're funny.

595
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,100
I'd like to know how you're going to pay his debts.

596
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,230
A million baht. Are you going to pay it back for him?

597
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,890
You can do whatever you want

598
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,990
if I can't pay his debt in three months.

599
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,520
Sorry for causing you trouble.

600
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,150
Anyway, Phumjai and I really want to help you.

601
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,420
We'll get through this together.

602
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,420
I'll always be with you.

603
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:06,960
You don't have to take it.

604
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,050
It's not enough.

605
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,790
I'll arrest you all if I don't get the money.

606
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,340
Oh my.

607
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,000
Go get them.
