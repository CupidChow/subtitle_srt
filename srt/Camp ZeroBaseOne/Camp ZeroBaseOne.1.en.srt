(Zhang Hao)

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,160
(CAMP ZEROBASEONE)

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,440
(ZEROBASEONE has been busy preparing for the debut)

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,770
(In their busy everyday life)

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,340
(ZEROBASEONE's debut reality show finally started)

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,620
(That's why we prepared the ZBI camper for ZEROBASEONE only!)

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,150
So excited!

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,930
It's more exciting that Tae Rae hyung is driving.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,170
I like everything, Hyung.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,570
You'd grow to like each other.

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,020
They're being so nice unconditionally?

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,530
It looks so suspicious.

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,060
- A part-time job?
- P-Part-time job?

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,670
(They have to do everything on their own for this camping trip!)

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,780
(Is their friendship in jeopardy?)

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,730
The leader spends too much time worrying!

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,420
(How will ZEROBASEONE's first camping go?)

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,050
Gosh!

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,780

(CAMP ZEROBASEONE)

31
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,290
You and I were separated and incomplete then.

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,590
- I want to survive.
- Go back up...

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,160
- I want to debut.
- Somewhere higher...

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,650
- Debut...
- Boys Planet...

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,680
The final Top 9...

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,450
Han Yoo Jin!

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,790
I'll become the best artist!

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,950
- Kim Ji Woong!
- For ZEROBASEONE...

39
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,970
- Kim Gyu Vin!
- Thank you for your time and energy...

40
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,390
- Kim Tae Rae!
- The troublemaker Tae Rae debuted.

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,840
- Park Gun Wook!
- I succeeded!

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,300
- Ricky!
- There's still a long way to go. It just got started.

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,220
- Seok Matthew.
- It's like a dream that I finally get to live my dream.

44
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,990
- Trainee Sung Han Bin.
- I'll work hard as Sung Han Bin of ZEROBASEONE!

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,300
- Zhang Hao!
- Let me introduce myself as Trainee Zhang Hao for the last time.

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,130
I'll shine as Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE from now on! Thank you again!

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,030
The moment our dreams connected.

48
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,270
We were born under one name.

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,820
D1! Be the one!

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,290
Hello! We're ZEROBASEONE!

51
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,730
We started from zero.

52
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,370
They really chose the right ones!

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,730
We're starting to become one.

54
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,690
It's still hard to believe.

55
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,590
We'll be called ZEROBASEONE.

56
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,930
For an impressive debut...

57
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,500
- We've been doing our best...
- To train ourselves.

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,960
- As ZEROBASEONE...
- There's a lot we want to do.

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,800
- If the nine of us...
- Work together,

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,180
everything would be fun.

61
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,740
We shine more because we're together. Our story starts now.

62
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,430
I knew it!

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,790
I told you!

64
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,270
(What happened to them, anyway?)

65
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,310
(An hour before the incident(?))

66
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,850
Hello!

67
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,050
Hello!

68
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,300
Oh, hello!

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,450
Are we just eating after all?

70
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,510
- Wow.
- Are we really just having a meal?

71
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,090
We can share the table.

72
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,970
Wow.

73
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,730
What are those? They're moving!

74
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,090
Wow!

75
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,300
They're really moving

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,590
Daebak!

77
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,710
(We spent money for a fun shoot)

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,300
The name of the show is...

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,870
CAMP ZEROBASEONE.

80
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,300
Oh!

81
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,650
Camping?

82
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,450
I thought we should do what you guys want to do most.

83
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,870
Daebak!

84
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,230
- Camping!
- Somewhere with a valley.

85
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,560
A vacation spot where we can heal.

86
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,890
I have an idea!

87
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,960
What is it?

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,920
We'll return the favor to the fans.

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,030
- Something that could surprise them.
- A surprise event!

90
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,470
Do the fans have a nickname?

91
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,040
ZEROSE.

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,470
In ZEROBASEONE, if you take out ZEBAONE, you get ROSE.

93
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,540
It means there's ZEBAONE and ROSE in ZEROBASEONE.

94
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,750
That's how it became ZEROSE.

95
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,480
(That's how ZEROSE and ZEROBASEONE became one)

96
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,660
How do you want to present yourselves on the show?

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,920
Show our raw side? I want to appear raw.

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,760
I want to show us becoming one.

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,200
You want to show our bond getting tighter?

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,720
(They want to show different sides of themselves)

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,850
- A trip sounds great!
- You mentioned going on a trip a lot.

102
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,940
So the show will be about you becoming one through camping.

103
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,340
Wow!

104
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,100
Camping is all about barbecue.

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,010
Right! We're Carnivore BASEONE.

106
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,510
- Wow!
- Woah!

107
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,550
Kkanpunggi!

108
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,520
It's a lot.

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,840
Are you just giving them to us?

110
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,500
- Wow.
- I'm so happy.

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,910
- Enjoy!
- Thank you!

112
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,640
Eating tasty food is my favorite!

113
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,710
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,850
It's so good.

115
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,470
Gyu Vin.

116
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,110
- It's so good.
- It's really good.

117
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,100
I'll never get my clothes dirty.

118
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,320
(Inhaling carefully)

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,950
(Inhaling just like Hyung)

120
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,670
Ricky, do you like jjajangmyeon or champong?

121
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,350
- Jjajangmyeon.
- He doesn't like spicy food.

122
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,820
- You don't?
- I don't eat spicy food at all.

123
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,590
(I don't like spicy)

124
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,800
(I love jjajangmyeon)

125
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,030
(Tae Rae opened the can with one hand)

126
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,160
That was kind of sexy.

127
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,740
(It's nothing!)

128
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,080
Did you open it with one hand?

129
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
That's how it's supposed to be done!

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,880
I've never done it before. I can't.

131
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,780
(In that moment)

132
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,400
(Han Bin is suddenly looking around)

133
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,370
Aren't there too many?

134
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,050
Aren't there too many cameras?

135
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,220
I can't get used to it.

136
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,840
Let us know when you're done. There are desserts, too.

137
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,200
(Desserts, too?)

138
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
(After everyone finished their meals)

139
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
They're...

140
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,590
being so nice unconditionally?

141
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,030
(They can't stop being suspicious)

142
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,380
It makes me worry.

143
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,060
Wow!

144
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,380
- Thank you!
- They have stuff like this at a Chinese restaurant?

145
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,490
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

146
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,860
(They stopped being suspicious again)

147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,990
Wow, Daebak.

148
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,220
It's good.

149
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,910
Wow, the macaron is yuzu flavored.

150
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,170
Why are they leaving one by one?

151
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,210
(The filming crew disappeared while they were distracted)

152
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,430
- It's happening, right?
- Yes.

153
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,150
The lights will go off, the monitor will go on and it'll say...

154
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,460
"Dear members of ZEROBASEONE."

155
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,590
(It's time to be suspicious again)

156
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,180
The door won't open, either?

157
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,400
"Boys Planet season two starts now."

158
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,250
By the way, I found it suspicious that

159
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,200
the camera set up here pointing at a weird angle.

160
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh! You're right!

161
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,270
There's one in there, too. In there.

162
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,910
This is...

163
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,550
(Gosh!)

164
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,330
(The monitor went on as expected)

165
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,740
What's this?

166
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,080
One hour!

167
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,790
- Oh, my God!
- I wanted to eat comfortably!

168
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,160
I knew it!

169
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,300
- What?
- I told you!

170
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,160
- What is this?
- Hold on! Wait!

171
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,740
Wouldn't they tell us something?

172
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,290
Did you enjoy your meal?

173
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,350
Yes!

174
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,930
We'll start CAMP ZEROBASEONE now, then.

175
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,370
Of course, nothing is for free!

176
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,630
What's this?

177
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,920
Have a seat first.

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,800
- Let's gather around first.
- Hey!

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,490
The door won't open.

180
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,900
- Maybe that one's not supposed to open.
- Does this not open, either?

181
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,440
(Shut tightly)

182
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,570
Hold on, hold on! Let's calm down. Calm down!

183
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,770
- Let's gather around for a second.
- Do we have to escape now?

184
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,130
During the meeting earlier, one of you said you need

185
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,010
a crisis for ZEROBASEONE to be one.

186
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,780
We talked about a crisis. Didn't someone bring it up?

187
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,240
What do you think you need to become one as a team?

188
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,910
- A crisis!
- A crisis?

189
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,580
(Gun Wook was the culprit)

190
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,170
- I'm sorry.
- Who was that?

191
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,410
Starting now, escape this room within an hour.

192
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,950
Escape?

193
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,430
- Oh, my God!
- Why are we escaping?

194
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,000
The only way to escape is

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
to unlock the lock on a box.

196
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,740
Where's the box?

197
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,970
It's this one! It's this one!

198
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,100
Is it in here? It's right here!

199
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,540
(The escape box will determine their fate)

200
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,890
(The lock combination has four digits)

201
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,640
(ZEROBASEONE's escape room. Find the hidden clues in the restaurant to guess the combination)

202
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,230
If you fail to escape in an hour,

203
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,750
CAMP ZEROBASEONE

204
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,460
will not happen.

205
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,590
- will not happen.
- What?

206
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,510
(Mnet is at it again)

207
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,470
No! It needs to happen!

208
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,770
(They're looking for a clue)

209
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,270
It scared me!

210
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,340
It says to look for our pictures first.

211
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,000
(What's the box Han Bin is holding?)

212
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,650
(While looking for the escape box)

213
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,570
There's this, too! There's one like this like an actual escape room.

214
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,680
It says look for the members' photos first.

215
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,470
I found something!

216
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,370
I found something! It's a photo of Gun Wook.

217
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,360
- That's me.
- Hold on.

218
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,450
(He found a photo in front of the suspicious camera)

219
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,120
I found a photo of Kim Gyu Vin!

220
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,660
It was tied up here.

221
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,180
- I want to see it, too.
- Let's collect all the photos here.

222
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,850
Let's collect them here.

223
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,630
Open up the seat cushions, too, Gun Wook.

224
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,210
- I found one!
- What is it?

225
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,630
It's Matthew hyung!

226
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,780
We're all looking down in the photos.

227
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,590
(A photo of Matthew looking down)

228
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,880
Yes, yes! It's true! It's true!

229
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,680
I got the chills!

230
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,590
(The members are looking down in the photos)

231
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,930
We're all looking down.

232
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,100
(Genius Gyu Vin is checking under the table)

233
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,570
Oh! Hey!

234
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,000
- He found it! What is it?
- He found something!

235
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,930
Is this trash?

236
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,740
What's that? That's trash!

237
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,890
- Oh!
- Did you find it?

238
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,920
A photo of Hao hyung!

239
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,650
(Hao's photo was at a suspicious spot)

240
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,480
- Tae Rae!
- Tae Rae hyung is looking up!

241
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,340
(The photos keep showing up)

242
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,360
- Wow! I found it!
- What is it?

243
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,720
(A photo of Kim Ji Woong)

244
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,350
- We should find all the photos for now.
- Hold on for a sec.

245
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,490
What's this? It's Yoo Jin!

246
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,870
Yoo Jin!

247
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,260
(A photo of Han Yoo Jin)

248
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,030
(They found seven photos in total so far)

249
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,780
Right here, right here!

250
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,150
It's probably not here.

251
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,260
(Baby Yoo Jin is checking his face)

252
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,680
What are you doing, Yoo Jin?

253
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,200
Yoo Jin, we're on a show right now.

254
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,270
Here it was! Han Bin hyung is here.

255
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,080
- Huh?
- I just looked there!

256
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,100
- I just checked, too!
- It's right here!

257
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,990
(Han Bin showed up underneath the chairs)

258
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,810
I found another one!

259
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,110
It's a photo of Ricky.

260
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,620
(They successfully found a photo of Ricky)

261
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,940
But they're all in different sizes.

262
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,270
But they're all in different sizes.

263
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,810
It gets smaller and smaller.

264
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,110
- It gets smaller in the order of age.
- You're right.

265
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,760
(If you follow where they're looking at in the order of sizes)

266
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,150
Left. Left. Down. Down.

267
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,690
Up. Right. Down. Down. Left?

268
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,750
It opened!

269
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,470
What's this?

270
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,270
Eight. It says the number eight on it.

271
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,610
(They acquired number eight for the lock combination)

272
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,360
Should we look for something else?

273
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,590
I want to be on the reality show.

274
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,070
Oh? Hyung.

275
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,800
Sorry.

276
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,670
(The youngest is curious about everything)

277
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,860
We failed.

278
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,520
(Everyone is looking for a new clue)

279
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,510
- Everyone!
- What?

280
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,190
At the end of the menu, it says, "Shin Young, Eum-papa, Zero, and Hao."

281
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,680
(A new clue was hiding at the end of the menu)

282
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,450
This is in French.

283
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,940
(Seok Matthew: Speaks English, Korean, and French)

284
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,350
- What does it say?
- Hold on.

285
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,910
(Using his entire brain)

286
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,140
At a flower shop, someone stole something.

287
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,930
(There was a burglary at a flower shop. The police investigated the four people who were there during the incident as suspects...)

288
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,280
Only one of them is telling the truth.

289
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,720
The rest of them are lying?

290
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,700
I think Eum-papa told the truth.
(Eum-papa is Gyu Vin's dog)

291
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,310
That's what you want to think!

292
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,560
(There's no way my Eum-papa would do that)

293
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,340
Let me try solving it!

294
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,130
If Shin Young is telling the truth, Zero is the culprit.

295
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,140
(Shin Young: Zero is the culprit. - True)

296
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,260
But Eum-papa is saying he's not the culprit.

297
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,100
So Shin Young definitely lied.

298
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,130
If Eum-papa is actually not the culprit,

299
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,100
Eum-papa can be excluded as a culprit.

300
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,880
Wow, this is so confusing.

301
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,370
Two are missing.

302
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,930
What?

303
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,180
I knew there'd be something under here!

304
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,100
(A math quiz that requires finding the rule between the numbers)

305
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,480
A-B+C+D equals the question mark.

306
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,170
There must be a rule here, right?

307
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,480
Hold on!

308
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,120
One, two, three, four, five...

309
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,000
Six, seven, eight, nine.

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,290
- Wow!
- There are two fours.

311
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,280
If Hao was telling the truth,

312
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,840
If Hao was telling the truth, Zero was lying. If Zero was lying...

313
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,270
Hao and Eum-papa possibly told the truth for now.

314
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,300
(Meanwhile, time is running out)

315
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,850
(Five minutes later)

316
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,930
(They're still struggling with numbers)

317
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,290
If look, one, two, three, D, A, B...

318
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,210
It's ZEROBASEONE.

319
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,350
It's one and nine.

320
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,980
I don't know.

321
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,670
(The leader stepped in)

322
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,110
(Never mind)

323
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,840
(He's taking a break, not running away)

324
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,190
(Ricky was quietly studying the quiz)

325
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,170
I figured out A, B, and C.

326
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,230
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Right?

327
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,180
Here, here, here, here, here, and here. So...

328
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,250
Nine, one. And eight, two. The next is seven, three.

329
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,420
The next is six, four. So B is six, four.

330
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,000
The last is five. So...

331
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,340
(If you arrange the numbers according to the rule Ricky found)

332
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,300
So the answer is nine.

333
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,200
(Another way to solve this is with the multiplication table)

334
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,260
We got eight and nine. Two digits.

335
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,640
Aren't I smart? Do you acknowledge it?

336
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,140
I think you are.

337
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,320
You acknowledge it?

338
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,050
Zero lied. So his denying being the culprit is false.

339
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,610
It wasn't me. That's false.

340
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,010
(He's been staying at one spot)

341
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,390
This is an audio game.

342
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,420
This is an audio game.

343
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,850
Please prepare a pen and a piece of paper.

344
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,350
(The pen and paper are in front of Detective Park)

345
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,400
Pen and paper!

346
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,140
Pen and paper!

347
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,820
Listen to the question carefully and find something in common.

348
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,990
The member Han Bin feels most guilty toward is Gun Wook.

349
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,190
Ji Woong likes the broth of pho that costs 12,000 won.

350
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,210
Ricky wakes up at 5 am to do eye makeup.

351
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,640
Tae Rae altered up to 10 pieces of Hao's clothes.

352
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,880
Matthew and Yoo Jin planned to meet at a restaurant in Sangam-dong at four.

353
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,500
Gyu Vin gifted a carnation to his mother.

354
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,100
Why is it 12,000 won, by the way?

355
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,960
It's because of inflation.

356
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,640
- With extra meat?
- Yes, with extra meat.

357
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,670
It said find something in common.

358
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,710
(Do you notice one thing in common in these sentences?)

359
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,500
It says, "Most guilty."

360
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,410
And "Favorite."

361
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,280
It doesn't say he reformed 10. It says, "Reformed up to 10."

362
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,900
- Up to 10?
- I wonder if it was to do with these sounds.

363
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,250
Why did he wake up at five for eye makeup?

364
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,740
- What is this?
- Sangam-dong.

365
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm stressed out! Let's just eat.

366
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,300
(LOL)

367
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,570
(He needs to get his sugar level up)

368
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,310
(They're reading what they wrote down)

369
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,200
Jang Mi! (Rose)

370
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,610
Most guilty. (Gajangmianhan)

371
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,710
Ji Woong likes the broth of pho that costs...

372
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,910
Sooguk! (Hydrangea)

373
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,810
- Sooguk!
- Oh!

374
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,960
Isn't that a flower?

375
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,360
- Maehwa! Maehwa! (Plum blossom)
- Yes, they're flowers!

376
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,310
Gaenari! Gaenari! (Forsythia)

377
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,150
Dongbaek! Dongbaek! (Camellia)

378
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,990
If so... Flower! One! (Hana: flower in Japanese. Hana: 1 in Korean)

379
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,010
Wow.

380
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,650
(The answer is one)

381
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,670
(They acquired three digits for the lock)

382
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,390
You have ten minutes left.

383
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,570
No!

384
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,510
(They haven't solved the flower shop quiz)

385
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,200
This is really hard.

386
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,260
How many digits do we have for sure?

387
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,010
(The oldest hyung is trying to unlock first)

388
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,780
Is Shin Young told the truth and Eum-papa lied,

389
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,280
it's not Hao...

390
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,740
(They're looking for a clue for the order)

391
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,070
It has to be a lie no matter what.

392
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,830
- You have five minutes left.
- Five minutes left!

393
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,040
Hold on! This is too hard!

394
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,560
When Hao told the truth, Zero lied.

395
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,460
That's why Eum-papa must've lied.

396
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,020
But if he lied by saying, "I'm not the culprit"

397
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,940
it means he has to be the culprit.

398
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,770
Eum-papa is the culprit! He is!

399
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,100
Let's start with the smallest numbers.

400
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,570
Oh?

401
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,730
- No.
- Geez!

402
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,120
You have four minutes left.

403
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
2189.

404
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,550
It's notworking.

405
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,700
(Is this the end of our show?)

406
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,810
They might've made it simple intentionally.

407
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,010
(Putting in the numbers calmly)

408
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,710
It worked!

409
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,010
It worked! It worked!

410
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,180
9182.

411
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,610
(The lock passcode: 9182)

412
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,210
(Inside the lock)

413
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,530
(There's the address of the next destination)

414
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,740
- It stopped!
- It stopped.

415
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,650
- Did we succeed?
- Okay!

416
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,910
(The show is happening)

417
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,870
Congratulations. You guys will be having a reality show.

418
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,210
Thank goodness!

419
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,400
Yay!

420
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,860
Let's go to the address that's written on the paper, then.

421
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,260
Okay!

422
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,120
- Let's pack up the rest of the desserts and leave!
- Let's go!

423
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,370
My sugar level dropped.

424
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,110
Gun Wook, it was so thrilling when the lock opened.

425
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,390
I told you. It didn't make sense there were so many cameras.

426
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,610
(ZEROBASEONE successfully escaped the room)

427
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,780
Good job!

428
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,510
(Did you find out the hidden meaning behind the passcode?)

429
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,610
(9ZBB1)

430
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,910
(They got on the car to go to the next destination)

431
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,880
What do you think we're going there for?

432
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,340
(Everyone got in the car)

433
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,280
(Where is ZEROBASEONE headed to?)

434
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Where do you think we are going? It was in Yongin.

435
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,510
Yongin reminds me of two things.

436
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,560
- Where is it?
- The fantasy land and...

437
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,470
(The famous theme park in Yongin?)

438
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,440
J-Ark.

439
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,820
(Yongin's tourist attraction(?), Planet Camp)

440
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,240
(Is one of them the correct answer?)

441
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,570
It was fun, but we all saw it coming.

442
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,600
Am I the only one who got fooled?

443
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,010
It was a bit suspicious somehow.

444
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,500
I was totally fooled.

445
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,440
It didn't make sense there was a TV at a chinese restaurant.

446
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,380
Among the places we...

447
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,600
wanted to visit... will we...

448
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,570
I'll take a nap for five minutes.

449
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,680
Good idea.

450
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,070
(Aftermath from using their brains too much)

451
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,050
(After driving for a while)

452
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,730
(The arrived to the destination while everyone was asleep)

453
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,060
Let's get up now.

454
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,170
Hey! We arrived!

455
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,830
(Where are we?)

456
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,400
Where are we? Is it a park?

457
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,510
- We're at a park.
- A park!

458
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,770
Where are we?

459
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,920
- What?
- What's this?

460
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,910
- What?
- What's this?

461
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,780
What's this? Woah!

462
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,220
This is Daebak!

463
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,810
- What? Wait a minute!
- What's this?

464
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,120
- What's this?
- It has pictures of us on it.

465
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,940
What? It has our faces on it.

466
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,390
It was custom-made! Custom-made!

467
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,330
- So crazy!
- ZB1 Edition!

468
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,340
It's ours! It's ours!

469
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,800
(ZEROBASEONE camper was finally unveiled!)

470
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,530
(A one-of-a-kind camper prepared for ZEROBASEONE)

471
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,760
One, two, one, two, one, two!

472
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,770
What's this?

473
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,680
A ZEROBASEONE edition camper!

474
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,120
There are roses, too.

475
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,950
(Roses have to follow everywhere they go)

476
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,430
Can we open it?

477
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,140
- Wow!
- This is Daebak!

478
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
(They go in while humming the familiar meody)

479
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,000
Wow, what's this? What's this?

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,510
- This is Daebak!
- Is there something inside?

481
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,110
(We'll show you inside the camper!)

482
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,290
(ZEROBASEONE camper is filled with countless roses!)

483
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,270
(A kitchen for Carnivore BASEONE is ready to go)

484
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,920
(A bathroom, TV, microwave, and a refrigerator)

485
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,250
(The camper is all ready to go!)

486
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,290
We'll be living in here together.

487
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,620
- It has a microwave, too.
- Woah!

488
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,930
With this audio, we can listen to our album together!

489
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,200
This is Daebak!

490
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,560
Huh? There's something in here! They're toys!

491
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
Badminton rackets?

492
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,180
We have these, too!

493
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,610
Matthew is unboxing the camper right now.

494
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,980
He's taking out everything in there.

495
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,510
Hold on. Can we peel this off?

496
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,810
(Matthew is unboxing the camper)

497
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,930
(Checking the bathroom drawers, too)

498
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,190
Wow, Daebak!

499
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,900
(Opening everything he's curious about)

500
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,440
Is there anything? No.

501
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,490
I found everything!

502
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,970
(He's still searching busily with his eyes)

503
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,810
Will we drive this from Gangnam, Seoul and...

504
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,120
Beep, beep!

505
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,110
Here come ZEROBASEONE!

506
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,320
- Wow, the keyring is-
- It's a ZEROBASEONE keyring!

507
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,720
Wow, that's cool!

508
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,980
It has a keyring. Wow!

509
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,240
- I want one.
- They gifted it to us!

510
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,210
It's our car now!

511
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,950
It's true! It's ours!

512
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,360
Are we really driving this to the camping site?

513
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,270
We prepared a trip in which you can return the favor to ZEROSE.

514
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,980
- Woah!
- Really?

515
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,480
- Woah!
- Really?

516
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,340
How will we return the favor?

517
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,840
What did we do in the very beginning of Boys Planet?

518
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,800
(What did we do?)

519
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,090
Signal Song?

520
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,960
(The revealed the Signal Song, "Here I Am")

521
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,200
The live...

522
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,100
The live taping anniversary?

523
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,210
It was January 5th.

524
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,240
The Charm Show!

525
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,980
(They had a "Charm Show" in which they met the fans for the first time)

526
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,790
There'll be an event, in which you can return the favor to the fans at the end of the trip.

527
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,190
Wow!

528
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,480
(Daebak)

529
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,550
- Wow.
- I got the chills!

530
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,930
Instead, the number of the roses you acquired

531
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,000
will determine how many fans you can return the favor to.

532
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,710
It could be fewer than us!

533
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,350
Let's pick up everything.

534
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,450
Let's set a goal! 40,000!

535
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,010
Let's fill the whole Sangam-dong!

536
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,010
Everything is up to you guys.

537
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,380
(How many roses will they be able to acquire?)

538
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,170
Everything was planned out.

539
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,470
Good luck preparing for the camping trip

540
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,820
and we'll meet you during the next trip.

541
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,880
(The next trip?)

542
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,210
Is that it for today?

543
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,410
- Yes.
- Pardon?

544
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,350
- We don't believe you anymore!
- Really?

545
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,170
(Their relationship started with distrust)

546
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,710
- What?
- I told you!

547
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,030
I don't buy it anymore!

548
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,040
We drove for an hour and a half.

549
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,700
I know.

550
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,750
There's no way they'd end it like this.

551
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,620
Everyone.

552
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,500
We'll start the first mission.

553
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,790
Yay! Nice!

554
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,740
(We were kidding! We're actually done!)

555
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,540
Really?

556
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,590
It's okay!

557
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,360
That was a bit surprising.

558
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,470
(Let's leave when we can)

559
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,320
Really?

560
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:09,360
(Please look forward to the event with ZEROBASEONE)

561
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,650
(Gimpo International Airport)

562
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,780
(All nine of them showed up at the airport)

563
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,560
(They're leaving to Japan for KCON Japan 2023)

564
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,810
(ZEROBASEONE is leaving for KCON Japan 2023 as a group for the first time. They proved their popularity before debut)

565
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,500
(With ZEROSE's enthusiastic cheering)

566
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,740
(they're on their way to Japan)

567
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,290
(Makuhari Messe)

568
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,420
I'm Park Gun Wook of ZEROBASEONE.

569
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,890
This is our first overseas event as ZEROBASEONE.

570
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,670
I'm so excited and I'm really nervous, too.

571
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:35,000
We worked hard on it. I hope you look forward to it.

572
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,620
See you soon!

573
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,080
I'll give away this photo during the meet and greet today.

574
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,860
I hope the one who gets it feels happy about it.

575
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,040
(A lot of ZEROSE members showed up to show support)

576
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,160
(They're screaming as they show up)

577
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,610
(ZEROBASEONE is making happy memories with their fans for the first time)

578
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,440
I was so happy to see ZEROSE members up close.

579
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,190
(The rehearsal comes next)

580
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,750
D1! Be the one!

581
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,080
Hello, we're ZEROBASEONE!

582
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,670
(Han Bin is checking the flow thoroughly)

583
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,150
Let's do the rehearsal one more time.

584
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,460
The stage is huge

585
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,160
and thinking ZEROS will be filling up the audience seats,

586
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,800
I feel so overwhelmed.

587
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,040
We'll give a great performance.

588
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,680
(ZEROBASEONE is getting ready to be on stage holding hands)

589
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,510
(Our first performance started with faith on one another)

590
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,110
(Under the name, ZEROBASEONE,)

591
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,140
(they got to perform for the fans for the first time)

592
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,450
(They finished the performance while the fans are cheering)

593
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,840
The fan response was so great.

594
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,270
They made it an unforgettable moment for us.

595
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,460
I realized there are so many people who support ZEROBASEONE.

596
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,460
I want to do better and work harder from now on.

597
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,640
I'll work hard so I could reciprocate all the love.

598
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,340
Love you!

599
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,270
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

600
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,600
(Having a lot of fun)

601
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,610
(Eating a ton)

602
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,010
I was talking about our future!

603
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,270
(Be suspicious)

604
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,460
(And be suspicious again!)

605
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,850
I said we shouldn't owe anyone!

606
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,580
(How will ZEROBASEONE's first camping go?)

607
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,020
Don't you think we'd look like thugs?

608
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,850
Get the tools ready!

609
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,900
(Men in black showed up with a scary comment)

610
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,630
Hello!

611
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,930
Hello!

612
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,750
- Hello.
- Are we doing a photoshoot today?

613
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,070
What are we doing today?

614
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,040
- We're here to shoot the opening.
- The opening!

615
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,470
The opening.

616
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,250
We're finally getting started!

617
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,010
We'll wrap up after we finish filming the opening.

618
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,710
Yes! Got it!

619
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,950
So handsome!

620
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,280
Wow, Yoo Jin looks great.

621
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,390
He's so good!

622
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,360
Hush! Hush!

623
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,810
Did I make you anxious

624
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,290
(Ji Woong's "Love Killa" performance)

625
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,410
(Did I make you anxious?)

626
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,290
Wow, so good!

627
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,520
He's doing method acting. He's so serious.

628
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,160
(Everyone is watching him acting)

629
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,910
So cute!

630
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,150
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

631
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,970
No way!

632
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,540
Oh, no!

633
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,190
(The individual shoot is almost over)

634
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,530
What's going on today, anyway?

635
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,970
Is it really over after this?

636
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,410
There's no way.

637
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,760
I'm curious.

638
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,330
There's definitely something going on. I'm sure.

639
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,160
I'll find all the clues.

640
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,280
Right, we need to get roses.

641
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,540
The first mission will be about getting the roses.

642
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,400
Oh! There are three roses right here.

643
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,750
What? What's that?

644
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,700
Why are you guys doing this?

645
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,920
They couldn't have put them there for no reason.

646
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,040
I don't think they're hinting at us for no reason.

647
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,630
This is the first clue.

648
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,740
Don't forget that they gave this to us.

649
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,050
(Storyboard for the opening)

650
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,670
- What is it?
- The storyboard.

651
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,720
Why was it here?

652
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,540
They don't let us see stuff like this for no reason.

653
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,080
They're doing all of this intentionally.

654
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,360
Let me analyze the storyboard. There must be a secret. Let's read it vertically.

655
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,670
Jesonyeogudanjeul.

656
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,980
What are you saying?

657
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,100
- Shall we take a look around?
- Shall we?

658
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,120
I can't stand it because it's so suspicious.

659
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,610
(Eating)

660
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,680
(Genius Gyu Vin is more serious than usual)

661
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,220
(Eat and figure it out)

662
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,250
I think there's something over there.

663
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,100
- There?
- He keeps sitting there.

664
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,490
I'm glad you thought of it.

665
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,690
(There has to be something)

666
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,810
(He suddenly thought of something)

667
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,810
(Checking the water bottle)

668
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,980
(X)

669
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,720
(How about here?)

670
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,930
(During the escape room mission)

671
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,010
(The clue was hidden under the dessert plate)

672
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,720
(He failed this time)

673
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,010
If they just send us away after shooting the opening,

674
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,730
there must be something at our lodging.

675
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,100
Huh? The lodging?

676
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,050
(Unfortunately, that's a bit of a stretch)

677
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,540
I'm sure there's something like that.

678
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,970
(We actually put the camper behind the white curtain)

679
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,730
(Although there was a mistake)

680
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,740
(They prepared a hidden camera for ZB1 today!)

681
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,060
(The camper is nowhere to be find)

682
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,280
- A group shot.
- A group shot?

683
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,760
Why do I feel like this isn't just a shooting?

684
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,210
We're walking into disaster now, then.

685
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,790
This is scary.

686
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,610
Two, three! D1! Be the one!

687
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,560
Hello, we're ZEROBASEONE!

688
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,750
(Buzzing)

689
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,480
(Buzzing)

690
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,580
Oh, no!

691
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,980
Geez!

692
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,560
I knew it!

693
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,110
What's this?

694
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,600
(Bam, bam, bam!)

695
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,350
(The campers showed up)

696
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,480
Gosh! It's getting started!

697
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,560
How did you...

698
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,250
(They can't believe what just happened)

699
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,080
My gosh, the ones who weren't there before showed up.

700
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Hello.

701
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,660
Where have you guys been?

702
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,550
(They were hiding where Gyu Vin was suspicious of)

703
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,820
Look how the cameras are showing up!

704
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,370
(CAMP ZEROBASEONE filming has started officially!)

705
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,350
I knew CJ would do this.

706
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,410
Today, right in this moment...

707
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,480
(Right now? Today?)

708
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,580
you'll go on the trip.

709
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,690
Woah!

710
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,040
you'll go on the trip.

711
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,710
(They're going on their first camping trip right away)

712
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,840
Before we get going, I'll explain the general rules first.

713
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,350
- Is this an orientation?
- This will be so fun.

714
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,000
Firstly, all the expenses

715
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,140
you'd need while camping has to be earned...

716
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,850
earned by doing a part-time job.

717
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,440
A part-time job?

718
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,540
A part-time job?

719
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,710
A part-time job?

720
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,670
Although, you can get an advance.

721
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,740
An advance?

722
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,880
(Advance?)

723
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,560
(Sounds good!)

724
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,310
No, no. We shouldn't create debt.

725
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,390
- Let's not create any debt!
- We shouldn't do that.

726
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,020
We can't do that.

727
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,930
There's the most important thing in CAMP ZEROBASEONE. What was that?

728
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,890
- Roses!
- Collecting roses.

729
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,360
While you're camping, you'll be given the roses

730
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,540
during an impromptu mission

731
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,240
Impromptu mission? I. M.

732
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,290
- How could we go down lower? Geez!
- Let's find the roses.

733
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,850
- What are you doing?
- Roses.

734
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,310
This is your first trip with the nine of you.

735
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,710
I'll tell you the destination right now.

736
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,380
Oh? Okay! This is the most important part.

737
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,380
The first destination for your trip is...

738
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,630
Mountains.

739
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,760
(Excited)

740
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,070
It's a place with mountains, fields, and valleys.

741
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,970
(Curious)

742
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,870
We're going to Hongcheon, Gangwon-do!

743
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,890
We're going to Hongcheon, Gangwon-do!

744
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,970
- Hongcheon, Gangwon-do?
- Where's that?

745
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,140
It's known to be really pretty.

746
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,030
That sounds fun!

747
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,200
(It's filled with lush mountains and clear streams)

748
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,740
(We're going to Saldoon Village in Hongcheon, Gangwon-do)

749
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,220
We'll get going now, then.

750
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,700
Are we really going?

751
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,960
Let's get going!

752
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,990
Let's go right now!

753
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,290
Let's go!

754
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,610
(They're getting on the campers in two groups)

755
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,160
Hello, Assistant!

756
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,630
(Tae Rae's car: Gun Wook got the passenger seat)

757
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,700
Wow, it's so comfortable in here!

758
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,420
We're leaving this world.

759
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,820
Let's go to Hongcheon, Gangwon-do!

760
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,580
(Kim Tae Rae, Park Gun Wook, Zhang Hao, Kim Ji Woong and Han Yoo Jin got in their camper)

761
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,920
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors!

762
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,570
(Matthew and Ricky won)

763
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,330
I lost again.

764
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,340
Are you choosing who'd take the passenger seat?

765
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors!

766
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,270
(Matthew won)

767
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,670
Okay!

768
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,440
Han Bin hyung!

769
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
(Sung Han Bin, Seok Matthew, Ricky, and Kim Gyu Vin got in the camper)

770
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,410
Very nice!

771
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,000
(Tae Rae's camper is leaving first)

772
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,460
Hyung, you can drive that smoothly, right?

773
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,620
You're good!

774
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,470
Kim Tae Rae!

775
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,490
(Han Bin is driving skillfully)

776
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,190
So cool!

777
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,890
Wow, so smooth!

778
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,780
(Let's go to Hongcheon!)

779
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,360
- I'm more excited because Tae Rae hyung is driving.
- Me, too!

780
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,650
You're so sexy, Kim Tae Rae.

781
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,350
Let's go!

782
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,460
Wow, they really chose the perfect day.

783
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,240
We're taking a trip with the nine of us for the first time.

784
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,530
- How do you feel?
- Excited!

785
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,390
- Wow!
- Oh, yes!

786
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,980
What song comes to your mind when you go on a trip?

787
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,460
♫ Let's go search for a valley where ♫

788
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,730
♫ we can hear our echos ♫

789
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,140
♫ Let's go on a trip ♫

790
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,960
♫ It was so pretty ♫

791
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,820
♫ They way you were ♫

792
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,280
♫ looking at me ♫

793
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,650
♫ Can we make up in the morning ♫

794
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,840
(Yoo Jin is putting on a show)

795
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,100
(Singing his heart out)

796
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,160
I'm curious how they're doing in the other car.

797
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,540
How are things over there?

798
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,650
Answer him.

799
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,410
Matthew passed out, too.

800
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,650
Hey, wake up!

801
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,360
(It was a dream)

802
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,500
I think it's because I'm a good driver.

803
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,110
(While everyone in Han Bin's car is dreaming)

804
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,430
Let's make an acrostic poem with camping.

805
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:47,050
- Cam.
- ZEROBASEONE is going camping!

806
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,470
- Ping.
- Ping! Ping! We're going crazy!

807
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,220
- Wow!
- Wow!

808
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,750
He really killed it.

809
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,980
Right? Didn't he?

810
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,210
Ji Woong is rapping! Woong. Woong. Woong.

811
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,120
(Excited to the max)

812
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,580
(Woong is drunk with happiness)

813
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,940
(Tae Rae's car is having fun, too)

814
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,540
How does it feel to go on a trip with Hyungs?

815
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,520
- We're not there yet.
- Baby, baby!

816
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,890
Kim Gyu Vin. Seok Matthew. You won't end up on TV!

817
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,660
- La-la-la-la-la-la.
- I'm excited!

818
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,200
I haven't been to a service station in a while!

819
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,230
(Arrived in a service station in Hongcheon)

820
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,920
Wake up, please. Please wake up.

821
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,710
- Are we on a plane?
- Is this a plane?

822
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,960
We arrived!

823
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,830
- We're here!
- We're here!

824
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,120
Thank you, Han Bin hyung!

825
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,300
Yes, thank you!

826
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,880
Wow, Tae Rae hyung is really good at driving.

827
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,700
He made me so sleepy.

828
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,620
(Tae Rae's car is as comfortable as a living room)

829
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,240
Tae Rae hyung is a good driver. I keep getting sleepy.

830
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,640
(You can sleep, Gun Wook)

831
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,260
Wow, it's a service station!

832
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,040
When was the last time you've been to one, Yoo Jin?

833
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,130
I don't remember.

834
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,510
We're all wearing a suit

835
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,680
at a service station. It feels different.

836
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,430
Hey! We're here to take over this service station!

837
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,570
- Ricky, you've never seen stuff like this, right?
- It's so pretty!

838
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,620
There's stuff like this in the middle?

839
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,780
Is this the Alps of Korea?

840
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,130
I feel like we should yodel.

841
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,660
(The green mountains that makes you feel relaxed)

842
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,480
(The clean air is making them yodel)

843
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,810
Should we take a photo at this photoshoot spot?

844
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,890
Let's take a photo and eat.

845
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,270
We'll put this in our album booklet.

846
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,270
(What a beautiful sight)

847
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,200
(It's God's gift)

848
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,450
Okay!

849
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,870
- Nice!
- Let's eat, let's eat!

850
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,530
Let's look around and see what they have!

851
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,630
Hao hyung has never been to a service station.

852
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,160
Why are there so many shops?

853
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,300
There are so many here.

854
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,840
This is a service station of Korea.

855
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,820
(All the essential mukbang dishes are here)

856
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,840
(What are the iconic Korean service station dishes chosen by ZB1?)

857
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,370
It smells good!

858
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,840
We don't have any money, guys.

859
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,120
- What should we do?
- Do we have to get a part-time job?

860
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,740
We have get a part-time job!

861
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,500
In order to eat at the service station,

862
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,690
you'll start your first part-time job now.

863
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,920
Yay!

864
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,250
This is exciting.

865
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,840
Please bring us the goods!

866
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,250
(What would the first part-time job be?)

867
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,990
Isn't this... Isn't this an actual part-time job?

868
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,090
This is like a side hustle!

869
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,790
My goodness.

870
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,070
You're giving us a real part-time job.

871
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,440
Seriously?

872
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,560
Please bring us the goods!

873
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,360
- What is it?
- Isn't this...

874
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,200
Isn't this an actual part-time job?

875
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,350
This is like a side hustle!

876
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,080
W-What is it?

877
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,780
- Aren't they fried chicken boxes?
- Domino Pizza?

878
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,130
My goodness.

879
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,250
Gosh!

880
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,740
You're giving us a real part-time job.

881
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,810
Seriously?

882
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,470
Your first part-time job is delivering boxes.

883
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,880
It's actually not too bad.

884
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,130
When you finish delivering the boxes,

885
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,770
you'll be able earn pocket money.

886
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,340
Wow!

887
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,900
- Instant cash.
- How did you know we were dexterous?

888
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,610
- This is nothing!
- Han Bin is good with hands. He can do all sorts of stuff.

889
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,260
(Han Bin got his dexterity from tutting)

890
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,600
Let's pick a business manager before we start.

891
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,020
Who's good at math?

892
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,440
Who's good at organizing?

893
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,020
- Me!
- Who's good at organizing?

894
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,190
Let's set Ricky aside for now.

895
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,480
Do you want to sit down and take a break, Ricky?

896
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,390
(Could someone explain it to Ricky?)

897
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,820
I recommend either Han Bin or Ji Woong hyung.

898
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,140
- How about Ji Woong hyung?
- Me?

899
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,360
Should I give it a try?

900
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,810
Give us pocket money so we could buy snacks.

901
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,990
Let's start the first part-time job, then!

902
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,390
Loosen up your hands.

903
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,220
We'll do it like this.

904
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,740
Han Bin, distribute these first.

905
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,120
- Let's go
- Distribute them!

906
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,700
- Distribute them!
- Please read it for us!

907
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,750
Here it comes! Here it comes!

908
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,240
"Hello, ZEROBASE members.

909
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,840
I need 10 fried chicken boxes very urgently right now.

910
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,200
10 fried chicken boxes!

911
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,670
Okay! Be calm, everyone!

912
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,110
Fold it where it's scored first.

913
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,090
It's easy if you do it one by one.

914
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,790
Wow, this is kind of hard.

915
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,460
Wow, this is really hard.

916
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,630
Is that so?

917
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,500
Was that you, Hyung?

918
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,030
You little!

919
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,500
Guys, are you all folding quickly?

920
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,720
Be quiet and fold quickly!

921
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,760
I'm a bit scared.

922
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,800
Work hard, little ants! Hurry!

923
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,670
We collect as much money as we worked.

924
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,380
The manager is watching everything!

925
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,420
- Work harder!
- If the manager doesn't think you worked hard...

926
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,930
(Thanks to Han Bin's leadership, Team Chicken Boxes is moving faster)

927
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,440
Why is Team Chicken Boxes so fast?

928
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,490
I always just ate the pizzas.

929
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,970
I don't know how the boxes are folded.

930
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,010
It's so funny that we're doing this in suits right now.

931
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,860
Wow, this is kind of hard.

932
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,740
No, it's really easy!

933
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,360
What's that, by the way?

934
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,250
Matthew wants to do it.

935
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,910
- Do whatever you want to do!
- Okay.

936
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,910
We'll need this eventually, right?

937
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,120
We have ten pizza boxes!

938
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,620
- Are you done folding the boxes?
- Yes!

939
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,910
Who wants to deliver them? Let's just pick four people.

940
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,070
- I'll go!
- Me!

941
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,070
Hurry up and go right now!

942
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,910
A red parasol. Over there!

943
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,900
I thought it was this way...

944
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,280
Aigoo!

945
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,840
- No!
- Matthew hyung!

946
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,640
No, Matthew!

947
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,960
(Troublemaker Matthew is on his way)

948
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,560
Quickly! Quickly!

949
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
Right there! Right there!

950
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,570
(She's obviously a crew member)

951
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,250
(Finished)

952
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,610
- Okay!
- Thank you!

953
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,420
- Wow!
- Are we getting paid?

954
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,470
Hey! What are you doing?

955
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,170
We already had the money!

956
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,430
(They're not running with money. They're just happy)

957
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,410
This is fun! It's like I'm on Running Man!

958
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,700
- Guys! We got paid!
- Look at that money!

959
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,830
We really got paid.

960
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,120
- Manager! Manager!
- Daebak.

961
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,310
1,000 won. 2,000 won. Okay.

962
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,570
Did we get another order? 15 chicken and pizza boxes!

963
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,330
Okay! Let's go!

964
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,630
Nice. Chicken!

965
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,570
Hyung, you're pretty quick now.

966
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,340
It's a piece of cake!

967
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,040
Hyung, why are you an idol?

968
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,990
What kind of question is that?

969
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,380
It's making me feel funny.

970
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,430
Why is Team Pizza Boxes so quick?

971
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,800
- We're doing well.
- Yoo Jin!

972
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,650
- Huh?
- You finally found your talent!

973
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,390
- Finally!
- I found my talent doing this.

974
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,870
- We got another order!
- Another one!

975
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,740
"I need 150 pizza boxes...

976
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,190
- Hold on, hold on.
- 150?

977
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,280
150 pizza boxes!

978
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,310
150 pizza boxes!

979
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,310
I think we should just fold all of these.

980
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,680
This will get us 40,000 won!

981
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,120
Which parasol do we go to?

982
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,880
Hold on. Two, four, six, eight...

983
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,080
Why are you singing?

984
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,980
Everything is more fun when it's rhythmic.

985
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,380
A chicken box part-timer who loves music.

986
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,990
Let's make money! Let's make money! Yup, yup, yup.

987
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,040
- What was the license number?
- 1780.

988
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,850
Hurry, guys! We need to find it fast.

989
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,470
Where is it? Let's find it!

990
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,410
No?

991
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,980
1780! Where are you?

992
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,490
Customer 1780!

993
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,090
It's hot, Producer. Aren't you hot?

994
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm not, too.

995
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,580
Will 150 be possible?

996
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,060
150? It'd go fast, Hyung!

997
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,330
(150? Can't believe it's 150, not 15)

998
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,730
(Where are you going, Gyu Vin?)

999
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,120
(Is he giving up?)

1000
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,720
Are you sitting now?

1001
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,420
This is no good.

1002
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,910
(He never quits! Mr. Slow is starting to fold)

1003
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,210
We're make a fortune by folding 150 of them.

1004
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,630
- Let's start new lives!
- Let's do it!

1005
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,920
Someone's running around.

1006
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,840
Let's go! Let's go! Run!

1007
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,440
Hello!

1008
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,750
Where are they? What's going on?

1009
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,840
It's here! It's here!

1010
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,740
It's here!

1011
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,750
(1780)

1012
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,460
Hello.

1013
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,850
Thank you!

1014
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,890
Are you having a party, by chance? Why did you order so many?

1015
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,980
Please hire us again.

1016
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,010
Take are of the money.

1017
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,930
How much is it? 5,000 won?

1018
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,750
- Let's put them underneath.
- We made 5,000 won!

1019
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,890
Let's first get it done.

1020
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,140
Where's the 5,000 won?

1021
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,820
Yoo Jin has it.

1022
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,920
I think Yoo Jin will buy food with it!

1023
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,060
You'd better not, Yoo Jin.

1024
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,880
Yoo Jin brought it right away!

1025
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,540
Yoo Jin! You have all 5,000 won, right?

1026
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,300
Yes!

1027
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,200
We made 5,000 won.

1028
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,460
I don't think we can eat meat if we make money this way.

1029
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,560
When will we get rich if we make money like this?

1030
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,720
Should we go on a diet?

1031
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,870
Another one!

1032
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,770
Hold on! Stop!

1033
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,640
Can I just turn this off?

1034
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,510
Put 5,000 won worth of walnut waffles in them and bring them in front of the arcade machine?

1035
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,230
- Walnut waffles-
- I just saw the walnut waffles!

1036
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,680
Aren't they just making us run errands?

1037
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,500
They're making us buy walnut waffles?

1038
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,790
Hold on! If so, are we making 4,000 won?

1039
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,170
Oh, really? Let's go!

1040
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,200
- We'll get going!
- Okay!

1041
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,360
Gun Wook! The finish quality is excellent!

1042
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,660
Hyung, I'm basically a machine.

1043
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,010
(Gun Wook is working hard without a break)

1044
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,690
(Working so thoroughly with huge hands)

1045
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,140
(Finished)

1046
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,380
(Is Gun WOok taking a break?)

1047
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,940
(He never stops. He kept going non-stop)

1048
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,350
I think the walnut waffle shop is here.

1049
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,180
The weather is so nice!

1050
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,200
(The three of them are headed to the walnut waffle shop)

1051
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,210
- Thank you!
- Are they ready?

1052
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,010
Should we just try one of them?

1053
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,450
Block the camera, then.

1054
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,510
Let's see...

1055
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,980
(The thugs are delighted by one walnut waffle)

1056
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,900
It's a bit heavy.

1057
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,290
We had to check if there were any bad ones in there.

1058
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,640
Should we have just one more?

1059
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,510
Knock, knock!

1060
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,300
Oh? Hello!

1061
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,510
By chance...

1062
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,960
They said there are 12 of them in total.

1063
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,380
- We must've dropped one on the way.
- They're clumped together inside.

1064
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,810
But if you try it first...

1065
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,220
Okay! Looks like they're not all there,

1066
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,050
but you worked hard. So I'll pay you.

1067
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,630
Thank you!

1068
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,540
Can we just split one of them?

1069
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,780
Give us three of them!

1070
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,840
(I'll buy them with money!)

1071
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,970
(Don't do that. It's embarrassing)

1072
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,310
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1073
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,260
Good work!

1074
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,940
The delivery guys... They're here. They're here.

1075
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,380
Let's pretend like we've been running!

1076
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,650
- Guys!
- We saw you over there!

1077
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,800
Why are you acting?

1078
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,060
Why are you acting?

1079
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,890
Let's eat first! Should I feed you one each?

1080
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,180
- What was over there? A puppy?
- Yes.

1081
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,680
Because we wanted to share them with you,

1082
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,850
- We brought some back.
- It's so good!

1083
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,420
Let's go!

1084
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,840
Here we go!

1085
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,470
Thank you for doing this on a hot day!

1086
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,470
Thank you. Not at all.

1087
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,660
Keep them coming.

1088
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,660
- Here you go.
- Got it! Got it!

1089
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,390
You're bringing the chicken boxes, too, right?

1090
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,450
Yes, of course!

1091
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,070
(They're finishing up the chicken boxes, too)

1092
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,680
I want to see who can do this faster.

1093
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Should we do a match, then?

1094
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,070
One, two, three!

1095
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,770
(Leader's pride?)

1096
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,290
This is no good.

1097
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,530
It was easier when I was sitting.

1098
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,110
(Who will be the winner?)

1099
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,600
- Okay!
- Seriously?

1100
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,310
Wow, why are you so quick?

1101
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,710
I know.

1102
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,160
Zhang Hao is always in 1st place.

1103
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,870
Okay, I admit.

1104
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,920
(The second delivery team is having fun)

1105
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,730
Hello, sir!

1106
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,990
(Finished)

1107
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,100
- Buy something tasty with this.
- Thank you!

1108
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,480
- Can't we buy some food?
- With this?

1109
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,050
- Behind their backs?
- Yeah.

1110
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,670
(They went off the route)

1111
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,780
(This is a real chase scene)

1112
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
(The Mad-Maks succeed with the betrayal)

1113
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,980
(Mad-Maks betrayed successfully.)

1114
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,530
(Kyu Vin and Gun Wook return after delivery with no idea)

1115
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,640
- It's 30,00 won?
- Yeah.

1116
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,560
Hey, hey. They're walking past.

1117
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,740
(Traitors are behind the pillar!)

1118
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,410
(A sweet time after a tense moment)

1119
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,800
(Slapstick comedy out of the blue)

1120
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,790
(We're happy, right?)

1121
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,870
(Meanwhile, an additional delivery request arrives)
Hey, everyone!

1122
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,950
♫ Everyone ♫

1123
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,240
Please hurry and deliver 30 accessory boxes.

1124
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,730
Then Matthew hyung and...

1125
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,080
Hey, see? I was on point about our future!

1126
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,150
Good job!

1127
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,230
Hey, hurry and fold those.

1128
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,720
Hyung, scold him.

1129
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,600
Keep working.

1130
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,960
I am working!

1131
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,360
- You won't get paid!
- We need to eat!

1132
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,510
Why are you folding something useless?

1133
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,590
(The last order goes smoothly thanks to Matthew folding them in advance)
You're smart.

1134
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,230
- I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1135
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,520
(Delivery location: A general store that sells dog toys; Quantity: 30 accessory boxes)
Five minutes.

1136
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,510
(It's an emergency here)
Hey, hey. They're coming here.

1137
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,280
(He moves according to his gut)

1138
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,870
What are you doing right now?

1139
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,450
You guys were...

1140
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,580
(His bad acting is the most awkward)

1141
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,360
(Good! That was natural(?))
Where is it? Where is it?

1142
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,140
- Hello.
- What took so long?

1143
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,010
- We're sorry.
- We did our best.

1144
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,670
- Okay. Fighting!
- We really did our best.

1145
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,000
- Thank you.
-Thank you!

1146
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,310
- We'll use it well.
- Okay.

1147
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,830
Ji Woong hyung and Yu Jin keep getting distracted by weird things!

1148
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,220
What do you mean? I put everything I received inside.

1149
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,010
- Hyung!
- I-I... I- Don't look at me with those eyes.

1150
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,110
But we did spend some money in between.

1151
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,930
- We spent some money in between and calculate the walnut bread, too.
-That's right.

1152
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,240
Nope. Your, "that's right" sounded weird.

1153
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,720
Yu Jin, do you have money?

1154
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,500
I have the walnut bread I bought earlier.

1155
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,140
- Open it up.
- Sure.

1156
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,040
- What I bought earlier.
- Bought what? It's right here.

1157
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,910
Yu Jin's lying to us this time!

1158
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,640
What's this and what's that?

1159
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,330
This was the one from earlier! It was this one.

1160
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,900
- It was this one!
- You traitor!

1161
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,450
(Detective Matthew arrests the culprit!)

1162
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,160
(What do I do? Should I run? Disappear? Is it now? I'm the eldest)

1163
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,150
(Once a traitor, always a traitor.)

1164
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,270
- Would we not buy you anything?
- Huh?

1165
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,520
Would we not buy you anything?

1166
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,370
Yu Jin, what happened?

1167
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,480
- Just tell us if you want to eat something!
- Did you eat it by yourself?

1168
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,170
Did you eat it by yourself, Yu Jin?

1169
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,970
- Don't just drink water.
- That was wrong of you.

1170
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,130
(Traitor Mad-Maks forever)

1171
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,250
- How much is the total?
- 102,000 won.

1172
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,410
- Whoa!
- Minimum wage! We earned higher than minimum wage.

1173
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,440
- What?
- We did well.

1174
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,060
We can use 10,000 won per person.

1175
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,720
- Everyone did a good job.
- We can get more than enough food with this.

1176
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,520
We're rich, Yu Jin. We got our labor's worth.

1177
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,750
We need at least...

1178
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,080
- one drink.
- You're right.

1179
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,000
Two strawberry smoothies, please.

1180
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,680
(Plenty of cold ice cream, too)

1181
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,370
This, too. This, too.

1182
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,550
I think Han Bin hyung will like this.

1183
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,830
He's here! He's here! He's here!

1184
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,560
- Whoa!
- Hey guys!

1185
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,270
- Hot dog!
- Ta-da.

1186
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,590
It's tteokbokki!

1187
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,480
- Tteokbokki!
- It's the tteokbokki I like.

1188
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,250
- The menu is-
-Here comes the rice wine bread.

1189
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,550
- Agh! I love you!
- Agh!

1190
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,600
(One bite of tteokbokki)

1191
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,150
(One bite of so-tteok*)
(Sausage and rice cake)

1192
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,820
(One bite of potato)

1193
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,400
(Two bites of potato)

1194
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,510
It's here.

1195
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,700
Good job! You did so well, everyone.

1196
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,100
- I thought you'd like something spicy, Hyung.
- Good job.

1197
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,410
Kyu Vin doesn't like coffee, so I bought that.

1198
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,680
Whoa, two strawberry smoothies?

1199
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,920
- Top sense?
- Top sense.

1200
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,690
(Matthew feeds Han Bin hyung who's getting ready to drive with top sense as well)

1201
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,980
(Takes a clean bite)

1202
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,440
Eat this, too.

1203
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,050
(Matthew has fun feeding his hyung)

1204
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,280
(The good part slips out)
It's okay.

1205
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,060
(Nom)

1206
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,170
(The partners are lovey dovey today, too)

1207
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,270
(A brief service area ASMR moment)

1208
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,810
Sung Han Bin, drive safely.

1209
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,830
The chicken skewers were a legend.

1210
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,050
It's good, right?

1211
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,640
I never imagined we'd get a box folding job.

1212
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,930
It was tough, but it was fun.

1213
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,870
And since we bought food with the money we earned...

1214
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,560
- It's more meaningful.
- That's right.

1215
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,200
Completing missions was fun.

1216
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,620
This is our life.

1217
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,540
- The teamwork between the nine of us was really good.
- It really was.

1218
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,300
We're becoming one team for sure.

1219
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,930
(The ZB1 team's camping car drives and drives...)

1220
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,710
(and moves deeper into the countryside)

1221
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,970
Everyone, look at the picture.

1222
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,820
If you look to your right, it's pretty.

1223
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,430
(Everyone should share the pretty view)

1224
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,080
It really is pretty.

1225
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,590
- Whoa, there's a valley over there.
- It's so pretty.

1226
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,380
Whoa, it's really pretty!

1227
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,320
Wow!

1228
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,560
(Zerobaseone's pretty first camping site)

1229
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,880
(Between the healing view of the green mountains)

1230
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,690
Whoa, the water's so clear.

1231
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,740
You can see everything.

1232
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,900
Whoa, that's crazy.

1233
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,100
(It's Saldun Village located in Gangwondo, Hongcheon)

1234
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,680
Whoa, the air is different here.

1235
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,100
(What will happen in the first camping site, Saldun Village?)

1236
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,800
It's right in front of the valley.

1237
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,270
Whoa, it's a valley!

1238
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,670
Let's do a love dive before we go.

1239
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,310
♫ Hold your breath, love dive ♫

1240
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,480
(Arrived at Zerobaseone's base camp!)

1241
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,150
- Yo!
- Hey, hey. Good job.

1242
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,520
You did well, Hyungnim.

1243
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,370
- Tae Rae, thanks for the ride.
- You're so sexy today.

1244
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,140
Hyung, thanks for the ride.

1245
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,890
You did a great job.

1246
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,030
(Best driver, Han Bin)
(Best driver, Tae Rae)

1247
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,260
Whoa!

1248
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,680
We can fish, too.

1249
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,050
What is this nature?

1250
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,720
- Whoa!
- As expected!

1251
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,280
- What is this place?
- This is Korean?

1252
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,510
This is... whoa!

1253
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,140
How is it this beautiful?

1254
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,410
There was a palce like this in Korea?

1255
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,410
(They suddenly start singing)

1256
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,800
(Join me?)

1257
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,630
(Zerobaseone is already drunk on the view)

1258
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,140
(They're ready to hold their breath and camp dive)

1259
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,540
The water is so neat.

1260
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,090
Let the rock skipping begin!

1261
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,600
Bring it on.

1262
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,680
What the heck?

1263
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,890
Whoa, three?

1264
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,580
Kim Gyu Vin, look. I'll show you what real rock skipping is.

1265
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,910
(Second player, Park Gun Wook's attempt)

1266

(Gun Wook's rock skipping, infinity)

1267
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,060
Whoa, that was... that was pretty cool.

1268
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,160
I concede.

1269
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,930
Are you watching, Dad?

1270
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,710
Am I a son you can be proud of?

1271
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,430
The air feels so nice.

1272
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,590
(Honk)

1273
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,910
(The noisy siren elicits deja vu)

1274
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,260
Gosh, we just got here.

1275
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,820
We just arrived.

1276
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,160
What the heck?

1277
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,830
(The rose mission starts when the siren rings)

1278
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,300
(Rose Mission: If they win the mission assigned, they earn a rose stamp)

(They can repay the Zeros with the ultimate number of roses they earned)

1280
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,710
- Everyone. How does it feel to be here?
- Yes?

1281
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,000
- It feels so good!
- Good!

1282
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,090
- The air feels nice.
- I feel the phytoncides.

1283
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,850
I'm sorry.

1284
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,330
You'll be staying overnight at this village.

1285
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,690
The village chief possesses a rose.

1286
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,600
- Whoa, where?
- Look for the chief?

1287
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,670
(First Rose Mission: Look for the Chief!)

1288
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,140
(The Chief is somewhere within the village)

1289
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,510
I'm so hungry.

1290
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,300
(Earn a rose if you find the Chief)

1291
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,040
We'll give you a hint.

1292
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,980
Is it a montage?

1293
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,110
Oh, there's a map, too.

1294
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,470
The Chief is wearing a pink t-shirt.

1295
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:46,930
There's also someone who will pretend they're the Chief.

1296
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,680
(Hint 3: This is a photo of the young Chief)

1297
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,450
How will we recognize the Chief after 50 years have passed?

1298
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:58,340
If you think someone is the Chief, you just need to shout, "this is the Chief."

1299
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,780
- Okay.
- You have three chances.

1300
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,910
You have to get it correct in three tries.

1301
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,590
- Okay!
- We need to be cautious.

1302
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,350
- Where are we right now?
- Here.

1303
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,380
Should we check out the right side first?

1304
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,740
(Find the Chief, START)

1305
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,060
Someone wearing a pink shirt.

1306
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,030
We already found someone wearing pink.

1307
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,040
- The pink shirt...
- Are you the Chief?

1308
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,370
No, no, no, no!

1309
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,240
I think he's just pretending.

1310
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,290
Hello.

1311
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,900
(Chief candidate 1: The first elderly they meet in the village)

1312
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,440
- What are you doing here?
- We're looking for the Chief.

1313
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,990
- Oh, the Chief?
- Do you know this person?

1314
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,770
The way his lips turn down is the same.

1315
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,050
I don't think it would be this easy to find him from the start.

1316
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,080
That's why I'm more certain he's the Chief.

1317
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,480
- Oh!
- Me, too.

1318
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,470
- I do get that vibe.
- That's right.

1319
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,320
His eyebrows and lips look similar to the child in the photo.

1320
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,950
- Really?
- They do look similar.

1321
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,520
How would you like to take a walk with us?

1322
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,980
Become our friend!

1323
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,670
Why not?

1324
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,320
The eyebrows look the same.

1325
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,890
What could it be?

1326
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,630
Two people are watching us.

1327
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,940
There are two people.

1328
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,000
There are two of them.

1329
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,180
- Does this village only have pink shirts?
- Hello!

1330
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,490
It's the village's personal color.

1331
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,080
The neighborhood turned bright with the arrival of handsome young men.

1332
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,910
- Gosh, thank you.
- Thank you.

1333
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,950
We heard the Chief possesses a rose.

1334
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,750
We're looking for that rose.

1335
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,930
- A rose?
- A rose.

1336
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,400
For whom? Are you going to give it to us?

1337
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,810
(Give the roses to the madams instead of the Zeros?)

1338
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,470
The two of you are the roses.

1339
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,880
(Even the hyungs are moved by the '05's pickup line)

1340
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,500
(Dad, are you proud of me?)

1341
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,400
(Shoulders dance)

1342
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,980
(Gun Wook, double thumbs up)

1343
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,770
Huh? The Chief candidate disappeared.

1344
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,760
Huh? The Chief candidate disappeared.

1345
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,080
Where did he go?

1346
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,510
- He ran away!
- What? Where did he go?

1347
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,040
He's a guru, in my opinion.

1348
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,700
Is he Jeon Woo Chi?

1349
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,540
Seriously, where did he go?

1350
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:59,080
Was he your friend by any chance?

1351
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,170
Gosh, why is he so ugly, though?

1352
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,400
(Taken aback by the sudden countryside diss)

1353
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,320
Why is he so ugly?

1354
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,390
In my opinion, I don't think it's either of them.

1355
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,990
I think we should hurry up.

1356
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,480
There's no time. No time.

1357
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,230
There's someone up ahead.

1358
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,050
The Chief is approaching, everyone.

1359
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,560
The Chief has swag.

1360
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,640
He's different.

1361
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,340
He has sunglasses on.

1362
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,270
Wait! I think I've seen him before!

1363
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,290
- He's somewhat...
- Whoa, whoa.

1364
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,340
- Hello.
- Hello!

1365
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,600
- Hello.
- Hello!

1366
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,010
What are you all doing?

1367
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,350
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

1368
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,870
(Is this elderly with the remarkable reaction Saldun Village's Chief?)

1369
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,570
He looks really similar.

1370
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,260
(He looks similar to the boy in the photo)

1371
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,810
- Chief!
- Do you know this person?

1372
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,180
It's my childhood photo.

1373
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,890
- Oh...
- Hold on!

1374
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,080
- Hold on!
- Is he acting?

1375
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,580
He could be acting.

1376
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,470
Why is my photo in your hands?

1377
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,140
But he looks really similar.

1378
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,570
Of course, I do.

1379
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,900
(He confidently compares his own face to the photo)

1380
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,980
Wait a minute.

1381
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,350
Wait, there are three more people in pink over there.

1382
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,040
Wait, there are three more people in pink over there.

1383
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,070
(ZB1 turns suspicious)

1384
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,570
I was the previous Chief.

1385
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,620
- Are you looking for the current Chief?
- Yes!

1386
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,390
(The person who shows them where to go. Is he real or fake?)

1387
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,070
(Chief candidate 4: Saldun's fashionista; claims the Chief's childhood photo is himself)

1388
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,030
I honestly think he's the Chief. I honestly think he's the Chief.

1389
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,340
No, the first person could be the chief.

1390
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,770
Whoa, look at that. Look at that.

1391
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,630
These are all lettuce.

1392
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,200
- Whoa!
- My grandmother has a field, too.

1393
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,340
You know rabbits live in there, right?

1394
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,690
- Here?
- Moles.

1395
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,130
Here?

1396
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,300
(The friendly rabbit brothers)

1397
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,310
What? There are too many.

1398
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,570
Wait a minute.

1399
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,920
- There are so many.
- There are five people.

1400
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

1401
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,110
- Wait, is this the main quest?
- This is too hard.

1402
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,090
(The mission turned difficult due to the many candidates)

1403
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,040
- Hello.
- Hello!

1404
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,890
The person wearing the hat?

1405
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,520
How would you like to take a walk with us?

1406
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,570
(Everyone Hao meets looks like the Chief to him)

1407
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,440
(Han Bin is confused by Hao's dung radar)

1408
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
How happy your parents must be.

1409
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,640
- Thank you.
- Hyungnnim, have a seat.

1410
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,790
- Chief, have a seat.
- Have a seat.

1411
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,390
(They're calling him, Chief?)

1412
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,300
(He's the Chief?)
Chief?

1413
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,320
- Chief?
- Chief?

1414
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,060
I said, I'm not the Chief.

1415
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,370
(Who should we believe?)

1416
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,050
Whoa, if they're not acting, then...

1417
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,390
Do you have a rose?

1418
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,760
- I have roses at my house.
- Really?

1419
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,280
Really?

1420
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,480
- Do you really?
- Are you the village Chief?

1421
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,300
(The elderly man who has roses at his house. Is he the Chief they were searching for?)

1422
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,980
- I'm not.
- Huh?

1423
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,390
- He is the Chief.
- He's the Chief.

1424
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,580
This is so difficult.

1425
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,210
- Shocking!
- The person wearing the hat.

1426
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,470
There's no guarantee it's a boy. It's in black and white.

1427
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,930
Auntie, you hold yourself differently.

1428
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:08,060
- I do?
- That's right.

1429
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,090
Are you someone with a title?

1430
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,190
She's my wife.

1431
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:16,150
I'm sorry.

1432
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,560
(Chief couple? Real or fake?)

1433
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,640
There's no chief here, so let's talk about something else.

1434
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,950
You're pretty.

1435
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,450
(Pretty Matthew turns shy at the Chief's compliment)

1436
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,290
He is the Chief.

1437
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,500
We're not so easy to fool.

1438
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,880
We don't have much time left.

1439
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,380
This is all a deception.

1440
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,440
Let's choose one person and...

1441
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,290
- We need to use one chance. We don't have time.
- Half the time already passed.

1442
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:43,070
The photo looks really similar to her.

1443
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:46,320
She looks really similar to the photo.

1444
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,210
It's black and white. I don't think the clothes have anything to do with it.

1445
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,030
I think she's the Chief.

1446
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:57,110
I think he should take off the mask.

1447
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,670
- Should I ask him?
- Yeah.

1448
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,470
Chief, could you please do us a favor and take off your mask?

1449
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,210
Please show us your handsome face.

1450
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,430
I want to see your face.

1451
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:10,810
In certain angles, he seems...

1452
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,030
- What do we do?
- He looks similar.

1453
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,290
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Whoa.

1454
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,400
Wait.

1455
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,840
- Who could it be?
- Let's make one guess.

1456
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,700
Wait! Should we go with the gentleman?

1457
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,920
- I vote for the gentleman.
- I also think it's him.

1458
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,020
- I think it's him.
- Me, too.

1459
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,800
- I think it's the madam.
- I think so, too.

1460
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,170
I think it's the gentleman.

1461
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,660
The gentleman?

1462
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,200
Then let's go with the gentleman.

1463
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,180
I don't think so.

1464
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,090
Sir, are you the Chief?

1465
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,700
(Is he the Chief of Saldun Village they've been looking for?)

1466
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,060
- He's not.
- Agh!

1467
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,080
- He's not.
- Agh!

1468
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,340
(Crow Hao)

1469
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,000
(Those who voted for him are mindblown)

1470
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,910
- Go to the village meeting hall.
- Thank you!

1471
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,920
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1472
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,410
We have 13 minutes left. 13 minutes.

1473
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,510
Let's hurry up for now.

1474
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,870
The madam won't leave my mind.

1475
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,840
- I think it's her.
- She smiled like this when she saw the photo.

1476
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,170
She was smiling like this.

1477
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,830
She could just be acting, too. Let's go to the meeting hall for now.

1478
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:14,790
- Chief, come out, over.
- Chief, come out, over!

1479
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,640
- Hello!
- Hello.

1480
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,630
Whoa, there are so many.

1481
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,980
(Chief candidates 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)

1482
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,420
- Nice to meet you!
- Hello.

1483
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,540
We're here to find the village chief.

1484
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,890
You came all the way here.

1485
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,840
Sing us a song.

1486
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,790
- Sing us a song before you look for him.
- Oh.

1487
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,700
One, two, three, four!

1488
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,390
If we sing a song, could you tell us who the Chief is?

1489
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,320
Could you tell us?

1490
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,840
We'll see after the song.

1491
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,350
(They start singing before they change their minds)

1492
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,520
(They automatically start singing their song)

1493
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,020
(Good job)

1494
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,850
♫ I've definitely seen that expression, those eyes ♫

1495
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,070
("Here I Am" (ft. nature sounds) spread in Saldun Village)

1496
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,910
That's all!

1497
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,520
(Customer satisfaction 710%)

1498
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,640
You're all so good.

1499
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,630
Could you give us a small hint?

1500
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:11,950
A hint? A hint?

1501
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,370
A hint?

1502
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,260
A man. The Chief is a man.

1503
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,920
- Oh.
- Oh.

1504
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,140
(Then...)

1505
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,780
(The madam who Hao and Tae Rae were sure of)

1506
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,750
This is hard.

1507
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,560
- Should we use a chance here, too?
- Should we use one?

1508
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,760
- The one all the way on the left.
- Yeah, yeah.

1509
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,910
(Peeks)

1510
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,020
I think it's the one all the way on the left.

1511
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,050
- Right? He lost all his baby fat.
- He looks a bit different.

1512
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,640
Are you the Chief?

1513
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,560
(Find the Chief )
(Will their second attempt be correct?)

1514
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:47,630
No.

1515
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,740
- Whoa!
- Goodbye. Thank you for everything.

1516
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,560
He's not the Chief. Wrong!

1517
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,410
We'll move on now. We'll come back. Thank you so much!

1518
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,540
- Thank you.
Thank you.

1519
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,500
- Should we go to the cabin?
- Saldun cabin?

1520
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,210
Didn't we just pass the cabin?

1521
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,770
- The first place we were at.
- Right.

1522
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,470
- Towards the inside.
- We're self-recording, Hyung.

1523
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,060
You took that? You picked it up?

1524
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,660
That's an extra large self-cam. Wow, it comes out nicely. We look so good.

1525
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,710
So nice and clean cut, huh?

1526
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,230
It's heavy.

1527
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,260
It was your own choice.

1528
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,060
- Should we hurry up since we don't have time?
- This is the boss's dungeon.

1529
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,700
- It's the final stage, everyone.
- Final, final...

1530
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,160
- There are six people here.
- They're the people from before.

1531
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,660
- Hello.
- Hello!

1532
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,680
Whoa, they're all men. We're in trouble.

1533
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,280
What do we do about this?

1534
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,440
- Everyone's here.
- Where's the photo?

1535
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,030
Number four? Why do I think it's him?

1536
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,620
- The fifth person looks so similar.
- Right?

1537
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,190
That's what I thought as soon as I saw him.

1538
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:47,240
(Two people suspect it's Chief candidate 18)

1539
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,510
Oh?

1540
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,960
He looks really similar.

1541
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,620
(Hao and Tae Rae suspect Chief candidate 15)

1542
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,750
Should we choose a chief?

1543
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,750
We have three minutes left.

1544
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,510
- Let's talk about this.
- Should we discuss this?

1545
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:01,070
Let's discuss this. This is the last place anyway.

1546
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,050
The fifth candidate.

1547
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,610
- The fifth one?
- Yeah.

1548
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,770
- The hyung wearing jeans.
- The hyung wearing jeans?

1549
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,010
No, the gentleman wearing jeans.

1550
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:15,570
- Hyung.
- I think it's him.

1551
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:18,040
We think it's the fifth...

1552
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:23,500
Huh? Wait, that person also looks similar...

1553
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,460
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1554
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,630
(Confusion finds them again)

1555
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,550
- No. No, no.
- No, no, no.

1556
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,580
No! Get it together!

1557
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,240
Wait! His jaw looks eally similar.

1558
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,970
- You have one minute left.
- Let's give it a shot!

1559
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,720
One, two, three!

1560
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,520
Are you the chief?

1561
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,370
(The result is?)

1562
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,780
You are right.

1563
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,690
(Zerobaseone's first Find the Chief, success!)

1564
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:02,060
Everyone, we should trust our choices!

1565
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,340
We mustn't waver!

1566
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,910
- He really looks similar.
- What a relief.

1567
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:08,190
That was hard.

1568
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:12,190
(Out of 18 people, Find the Chief, success)

1569
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,910
- I'll give you a stamp.
- Thank you!

1570
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

1571
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,600
Thank you.

1572
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,080
Oh, that mission was worth nine roses? Wow!

1573
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,210
Could we have found three Chiefs?

1574
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,280
Oh, there's only one Chief?

1575
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,190
(Rose Mission current situation)
(Find the Chief: 9 roses)

1576
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,370
Good job completing the Rose Mission.

1577
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,290
(Incredible, ZB1)

1578
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,010
Chief, nice shot!

1579
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,380
I'm hungry. I want meat.

1580
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,100
(Yu Jin wants meat, too)

1581
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,960
But we don't have money.

(Young and Ricky/Born in '04)
(Doesn't know what it means to have no money)

1583
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,810
How much money do you have left?

1584
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,590
Do we have any left?

1585
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:57,900
(No way. You ate diligently)

1586
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,240
Wow...

1587
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,210
When will we get another part time mission?

1588
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,100
I'll give you a menu.

1589
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,550
- Menu?
- A menu?

1590
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,850
- All right.
- What is it?

1591
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,480
Part time menu. 2,000 won each.

1592
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,990
300 limit.

1593
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,960
- 300...
- Then we should do 300.

1594
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,420
I don't think doing 300 is right.

1595
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,590
Don't you think the fact they set a 300 limit is because it's doable?

1596
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:29,280
- If it's 300, isn't that 600,000 won?
- Do we need that much?

1597
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,270
- I do want to have a party today.
- Let's live modestly.

1598
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:37,110
Wait! If the nine of us work together,

1599
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,810
we can do everything.

1600
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,210
We'll do 200.

1601
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,740
We'll do 200.

1602
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,060
We'll do 200 for 400,000 won.

1603
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,860
- Yeah, 400,000 won sounds good.
- 400,000 won.

1604
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,060
- Then should we settle on 200?
- Yeah, 200 sounds good.

1605
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,510
So you want 400,000 won in advance, right?

1606
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:54,940
- Yes!
- Yes.

1607
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,880
(A memory flashes by)

1608
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:01,930
If you happen to get an advance, there will be a big disadvantage.

1609
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:05,240
We shouldn't make debt.

1610
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,010
Zerobaseone.

1611
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,930
If you can't pay the advance back within the span of this trip,

1612
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:18,910
we'll take half of the roses you've earned until now.

1613
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:20,640
I said let's not live in debt.

1614
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,610
There's a reason they're giving us so much.

1615
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,460
We'll show you the part time job now.

1616
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,420
- Something's coming.
- What is that?

1617
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,880
- Putting eyes on a doll?
- That's not worth 2,000 won, though.

1618
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,670
- Those are toys.
- Huh?

1619
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:33,010
(What is ZB1's second job?)

1620
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,340
Oh, do we need to match them up and divide them?

1621
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,270
Our client made a mass purchase, but they can't find the match.

1622
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,370
Don't you think it's a scam if he bought them for this price?

1623
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,040
I think he needs to seek consumer resources.

1624
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,100
(ZB1 instead of consumer resources)

1625
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,720
Then should we make a grocery team?

1626
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,040
He already started.

1627
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,420
Life is interesting.

1628
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,630
We came here to camp, but we're doing this.

1629
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,110
Whoa, Korean reality programs are interesting.

1630
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:00,500
We'll keep in touch.

1631
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,580
Have a safe trip.

1632
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,390
We'll be working diligently.

1633
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,320
(Korean reality shows keep us busy)

1634
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,360
Should I set evreything up first?

1635
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,930
(They prepare to set up the camping site and start their job)

1636
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:14,860
Yu Jin and I will be working on this first.

1637
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,820
(Matching rubber gloves, socks, and chopsticks, START!)

1638
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,330
Which one is for the gloves?

1639
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:21,640
(Did you see that?)

1640
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,230
(What a fun hyung)

1641
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,940
Is this for the gloves?

1642
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,380
I'll match them and hand them to you.

1643
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,890
We could do 300 of these.

1644
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,890
(Neatly, chop chop)

1645
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,940
(They work efficiently as a team)

1646
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,860
- We can finish this in one hour.
- In no time.

1647
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,940
(Half-hearted ones prepare for camping on one side)

1648
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,570
- Do you want to set up the tent with me?
- The tent?

1649
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,720
It doesn't lift. Is this right?

1650
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,430
Agh!

1651
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:53,950
I learned how to do it last time.

1652
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,850
But this is the first time setting up camping tools in my life.

1653
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,540
We need to find the front and back and spread it our first.

1654
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,900
Spread it out.

1655
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,940
(Camp-Vin does a good job following the lead)

1656
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,240
This gets stuck as you pull on it!

1657
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:10,850
(The tent is slowly getting completed.)

1658
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,530
(They finished setting up the tent in a moment with perfect teamwork.)

1659
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,500
(He's installing pegs so the tent doesn't fall.)

1660
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,240
Hold it there for a second. Okay, thank you.

1661
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,170
(Charisma explodes)

1662
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,350
(Setting up the tent is sailing smoothly.)

1663
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,480
Gosh, this thing is too sticky.

1664
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,970
(They're wrestling the package stickers, instead of doing their part-time job.)

1665
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:32,250
Wait, wh-what's wrong with this? It really won't come off.
(He's complaining to the staff for some reason.)

1666
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,880
Hyung, is it doable?

1667
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,170
(He's in a state of extreme concentration.)

1668
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,770
Huh?

1669
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,180
(It's fine. You can continue.)

1670
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,690
(Embarrassed)

1671
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,540
(What about the grocery team?)

1672
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,600
- Let's go buy meat.- Whoa, the air smells nice.

1673
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,860
It definitely is different, perhaps because it's the countryside here.

1674
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,040
- The country smell?
- Yes.

1675
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,350
(They arrived at a discount market near the village.)

1676
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,310
Only buy what we need, quickly and neatly!

1677
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,830
- Deal!
- Okay.

1678
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,690
(He's excited, first thing after entering.)

1679
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,070
The most important thing is ramen! Shall we buy some ramen first?

1680
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,770
(Ramen definitely is the number one camping food.)

1681
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:09,730
There's some over there, too, but they have Thai ramen here.

1682
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,470
(A sudden appearance of Thai ramen in a countryside discount market.)

1683
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:15,080
Should we buy a few?

1684
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,800
Yeah, not bad, not bad.

1685
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,420
N-No, no. We need to buy the one that goes well with our food.

1686
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,180
(Type T man calms down the other members.)
The same thing we eat all the time, not something else.

1687
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,370
But don't you eat more than you usually do when you're away from home?

1688
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,390
- I can eat a lot!
- How many?

1689
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,060
- About four!
- Four?

1690
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,170
- Four?
- Yes.

1691
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,310
- Wait, wait, wait. Four of those?
- Yes.

1692
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,740
(Four packages of five ramens, which is equal to 20 ramens?)

1693
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,040
What about this one?
(This time, it's the canned peaches.)

1694
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,720
F-First off, we need-

1695
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,550
(It's not bad, but focus on what we need, please!)
I mean, desserts aren't bad. Get one.

1696
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,940
Can we get one of these?

1697
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,500
- What is it?
- It's tom yung koong.

1698
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,640
(Tom yun koong appears out of nowhere.)

1699
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,040
(On his Day of Suffering, Tae Rae gave up.)
Don't we need some onions?

1700
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,560
(Finally, an understandable choice of menu is here!)
They have onions? We need them for sure.

1701
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,820
- Such much?
- Do you plan on making curry?

1702
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,300
- Should I get just one?
- Yes, just one!

1703
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,030
What's this?

1704
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:06,980
(Hao spotted a new target.)

1705
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,400
- Well, what is this?
- Is it a hat?

1706
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,120
(Hao'd like to buy this mysterious looking item as well.)

1707
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,940
Though I don't know what it is.

1708
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,950
(This situation feels like a dream to Tae Rae.)

1709
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,640
- Shall we call it a day here for now?
- This is more than enough.

1710
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,230
(Its most likely Ricky's first time being nervous at the counter.)

1711
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,040
(Just how much would there total be?)

1712
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,990
- What?
- Whoa!

1713
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:28,510
(334,200 won left.)
It came out to be a lot lower than I expected.

1714
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:31,400
(He's a man who spends when he has to.)
Should get about 350,000 won's worth of meat in this case?

1715
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,040
- Should we get pork belly, pork shoulder, and ribeye?
- Sounds good!

1716
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,950
Whoa, I want to see how you do it!

1717
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,480
(I want to see.)

1718
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,070
(Hao and Ricky has never seen how meat is cut at a butcher shop.)

1719
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,840
(Whoa, this is amazing.)

1720
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,260
- This is pork shoulder.
- Yes, pork shoulder.

1721
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,130
This ribeye looks very cool.

1722
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,760
(Who are you talking to, Hao?)
I did mean it looks cool, not tasty.

1723
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,940
Why are you so good at Korean?

1724
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,960
As soon as he saw the meat, out of nowhere...

1725
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,970
- This one's got some chuck in it.
- Oh, yes!

1726
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,830
(He carefully chose a good quality meat for ZB1, a countryside kindness.)

1727
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,430
Beautiful.

1728
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,070
(They purchased 1.8 kg of pork belly, 1.2 kg of pork shoulder, 1.8 kg of ribeye = 20 servings.)

1729
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,740
- 260,000 won.
- That's breaking just even.

1730
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,210
(The second purchase, buying meat, is also a success.)

1731
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,850
(They successfully finished buying meat as well.)

1732
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,240
(On the other hand, Han Bin and Gun Wook are finishing setting up the tents at the campsite.)

1733
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,470
- Wow!
- It's done.

1734
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,880
(Proud)
Hey, we're done. Nice job.

1735
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
- Whoa!
- It looks cooler, now that it's complete.

1736
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,910
(Let's take a break since we built our home.)

1737
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:29,430
- Give me a break.
- I think we can just sleep like this and it'll be comfortable.

1738
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,700
(While those two are taking a break after driving a long distance and setting up the tent...)

1739
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,800
(How cute.)
How is it, Hyung?

1740
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,200
(Yu Jin wore some socks.)

1741
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,600
You're really the maknae.

1742
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,450
I never thought I'd be doing this at a place like this, wearing a suit.

1743
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,890
Breathe in the air from time to time, Hyung.

1744
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:48,040
(Mad-Maks are syncing often today.)

1745
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,870
That was nice and refreshing.

1746
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,400
Clear!

1747
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,000
(Not so fast! They must be checked.)
We'll check them if you bring them here.

1748
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,610
(The world isn't so easy.)

1749
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,050
(They're inspected meticulously with eagle eyes.)

1750
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:02,760
(Incorrect pair of socks are disqualified.)
This is defect.

1751
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,010
(Improper packing is disqualified.)
This is all wrinkly, too.

1752
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,410
(Redo those 29 pairs and bring them back, please.)
What?

1753
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,510
(29 defects were spotted by the staff.)

1754
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,340
What do we do, Hyung?

1755
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,470
(What can you do, but go and redo them?)

1756
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,220
How does this look?

1757
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,960
I'll redo it.

1758
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,910
This one's not good enough?

1759
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:26,060
- When are the guys coming back?
- Don't you think they're goofing around?

1760
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,140
(Correct!)

1761
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,550
(What brings them to a clothing store?)

1762
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,760
It's too small for you, Ricky.

1763
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,610
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable to do camping and grill the meat, wearing the suit and the shirt?

1764
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,960
- It is a little-
- It's too uncomfortable!

1765
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,780
- Ji Woong hyung!
- Ji Woong hyung, we have 70,000 won left, right?

1766
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,690
Okay.

1767
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:49,450
If we

1768
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,990
we'll have just enough money to buy the clothes.

1769
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,200
(Blinking)

1770
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,010
Ji Woong hyung, you're not angry, right?

1771
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,810
Should we look for something cheaper?

1772
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:03,400
(However, getting paid in advance is inevitable due to more expensive than expected prices.)

1773
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,500
- Seriously, the dishes after the meal-
- The clean up.

1774
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,610
- Clean up after we eat.
- Okay. All right.

1775
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,940
(Additional work hours and clean up after eating were traded.)
Buy the clothes and return quickly, okay?

1776
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,480
We won't be beat up later, will we?

1777
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,170
I do think we're in for deep trouble.

1778
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,930
Take out the gourd looking thing from earlier.

1779
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,190
Do we need to work more?

1780
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,610
Mom...

1781
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,000
Mom... Dad...

1782
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,570
A video letter?

1783
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,420
I'm living a diligent life.

1784
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,350
It was my first part-time job and it isn't easy.

1785
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:40,390
Gosh, I was really wondering if this is my life.

1786
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:44,490
If I lack money like this later in life, when I have my own family...

1787
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,180
I'll need to work hard.

1788
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,700
(In the meantime, grocery team returned.)
Great work!

1789
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,390
- Wow, you're here?
- Great job.

1790
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,970
(Grocery team's members came back with full hands.)

1791
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,240
- There's a lot of stuff.
- Whoa!

1792
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,390
- Han Bin hyung...
- Yes?

1793
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:00,780
There's one. There's two.

1794
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,370
There's three and there's four.

1795
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,510
This is ribeye.

1797
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,010
(MOV)
Ribeye?

1798
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,470
Three chunks of ribeye.

1799
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:14,750
We've spent all of the money we prepared!

1800
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,380
Precisely! To the dot!

1801
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,600
Good job, good job.

1802
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,620
That's why we have a lot of meat.

1803
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,440
(It's a meat set for Carnivore Base One!)

1804
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,900
Wow!
(Thinking about eating meat makes him smile?)

1805
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,080
- And this is lettu-ced!
- Lettuce.

1806
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,560
Lettuce!

1807
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,650
Sorry.

1808
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:35,350
We also have a uniform, which we took the freedom to choose.

1809
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,310
- Whoa! I'm curious!
- I can make you all become really pretty.

1810
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:40,410
We bought one for each person and according to his character.

1811

(Fashion Bomber Tae Rae's Live Commerce)
We'll now unbox!

1812
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,650
- All right.
- Yay!

1813
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,580
- We all have the same body type.
- Hey, that's not bad.

1814
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,500
They said there are people who wear these at this village.

1815

(New S/S arrival, latest trend for the elderly)
I saw them earlier.

1816
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,320
- But the shoes are the point!
- We get shoes, too?

1817
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,440
The shoes will become memorable for all of you.

1818
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,170
Our latex junk.

1819
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,310
So cute, right?

1820
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,880
(The market package is endless, even after the pants and the shoes.)

1821
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,470
(He loves it.)

1822

- Han Bin.

(For Kangwondo's weather?)
(A windbreaker?)

What are you cheering for? Why is it so thin?

1827
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,640
He was given a yellow one since he has a cool tone.

1828

1829
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,720
and reappearing again after changing?

1830
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,350
- I love it.
- Let's all jump then.

1831
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,310
One, two, three!

1832

(And they forgot about "Go!")

1833

- Wow.
- W-Wow.

1834

He's doing a fire show for us.

1835

Hyung, aren't you torturing the meat at that point, instead of cooking it?

(Kim Ji Woong the Fire Type)

(The smoke keeps attacking him.)

1839

Hyung, you're crying and your eyes are swollen!

1840
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,520
(Even the man of fire couldn't help it against the smoke.)

1841

- Yes?

(Two cuties next to the men on fire)
Do you like your pork belly chewy or crunchy?

1845
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:58,450
I like them either way, crunchy or not.

1846
01:13:58,450 --> 01:13:59,930
I'll cook them both ways then.

(Chewy and crunchy meat for Hao hyung)

Do you want some sauce?

Whoa...

1854

There, what a good boy.

1855
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,890
Feeding Matthew...

1856
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,710
gives me peace.

1857
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,510
It feels like raising a baby.

(They're only two years apart.)

1859

Aren't you cold? Should we make some space here?

Eat a lot, Yu Jin.

- Yes.

- What do we do about Matthew?

Okay, Matthew. I think it's nice, too.

- Five.

01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,250
(Han Bin delivers ramen to Ji Woong who's grilling meat.)
I haven't tried it, either, but...

1902
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,510
Hyung, come and take a bite.

1903
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:24,840
(Friendship blooms over a bite of ramen.)

1904
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,760
It's hot, right?

1905
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,500
(As expected, Matthew gets ramen from Hao.)
Hey, Matthew.

1906
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,510
- Let's use this.
- Oh, thank you, Hyung.

1907
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:34,290
We should come tomorrow...

1908
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,820
(Matthew's busy trying to eat the ramen and listen to Hao hyung at the same time)
the day after, and everyday to camp.

1909
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,730
Guys, let's all fill our glasses here and

1910
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,780
raise a toast to commemorate our coming here.

1911
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,180
(What's this cup, which will help Zero Base One to toast?)

1912
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,170
Yu Jin, what do you want to drink? Do you want grapefruit or mango?

1913
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,230
(They're the custom cups for each member, bought at the camping store!)

1914
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:52,130
We bought a cup for each person, according to his colors.

1915
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:53,240
That's right.

1916
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,150
- Let's do, "Camp, Zero Base One!"
- Camp, Zero Base One!

1917
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,600
- Yes, I like that.
- All right, here we go!

1918
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,540
- Camp...
- Zero Base One!

1919
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:03,720
(Everyone toast!)

1920
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,550
(A glass of beverage to unwind a day's work with the members whom they shared the work with.)

1921
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,720
Let's drink up.

1922
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,240
- Wow, that's good.
- That's nice.

1923
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,100
Shall we start cleaning everything up?

1924
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,830
- I regret it.
- We have to exercise now.

1925
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,640
The rest of us have something we need to do.

1926
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,470
- What?
- Oh, this...

1927
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:21,130
What is it? Did we not do that yet?

1928
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,100
We didn't get to do that yet.

1929
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,520
- Oh, then let's clean everything up.
- Okay.

1930
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,630
- I'll wash the dishes.
- The dishes?

1931
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,600
Thanks.

1932
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,100
(The shopping team's clean up time.)

1933
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,200
When you put them in, please put them in as nicely as possible.

1934
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,210
If it gets crumpled, then it will be need to be redone.

1935
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,630
- We'll be penalized?
- Yes.

1936
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,990
So make sure it doesn't get crumpled.

1937
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,640
Hello. I'm a rookie.

1938
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,760
- I need lessons.
- Oh, you're new?

1939
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,110
Thank you.

1940
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,990
Let's each do five more and I think we'll be done.

1941
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,260
These rubber gloves are so cute so I should try them on.

1942
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,170
- You keep it.
- You look like a superhero.

1943
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,310
I'm high school detective, Nam Do Il.

1944
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,150
- Mi Ran?
- Mi Ran!

1945
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:02,840
(The wrapping job seems to be coming to an end)

1946
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,830
They say that this seems to be done carelessly.

1947
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,870
- Carelessly?
- Who did that one?

1948
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:09,910
- Who did this?
- That was done really carelessly.

1949
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,040
Yu Jin!

1950
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,470
Who did this?
- Oh my god.

1951
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:17,870
Isn't this a bit too much?

1952
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:21,030
- Isn't that a bit too much?
- Who did this one?

1953
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,830
I'm sorry, it was me.

1954
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,440
I got so angry.

1955
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,650
I mean, honestly, it's so upsetting when it doesn't fit inside when you've already taken off sticker part.

1956
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:32,590
I mean, is this right? The chopsticks are so long that it doesn't fit inside.

1957
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,890
Gosh, come on!

1958
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,450
Oh, there's a lot of mistakes like that.

1959
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:40,500
This one is not matching.

1960
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,520
Gosh, who is it?

1961
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,480
He made it look suspicious as he put it in. They found out.

1962
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,560
Are you going to do your job like this?

1963
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,870
The members fall over laughing over another defective product.

1964
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,630
They're too different!

1965
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:01,460
Gosh, that's so funny!

1966
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:04,150
(It's clear that they don't match)

1967
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:06,150
(The one responsible for this defective product is Hao.)

1968
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,510
(This one only had one sock)

1969
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,950
Wait!

1970
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,080
(Takes it back himself)

1971
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,680
He's grown in being sneaky.

1972
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,900
Let's live honorably!

1973
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,730
I think this should be about a hundred.

1974
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,360
You've finished the hundred you need to make.

1975
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,120
We've paid off our debt! I shine!

1976
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,280
I suddenly feel like going on a zipline.

1977
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,800
The one where you ride in the air?

1978
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,790
I want to go on the Disco Pong Pong.
- The Disco Pong Pong?

1979
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:37,280
You know, this one.

1980
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,650
Oh, the Disco Pong Pong?
- Disco Pong Pong?

1981
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,550
Isn't it Disco Pong Pong?

1982
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,850
It's Disco Pang Pang.

1983
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:47,730
(Alarm blares)

1984
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:49,960
Seriously?

1985
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,630
- Did you manage to rest a bit?
- What?
- No.

1986
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:56,220
- Isn't this too much of you?
- It's only been 2 minutes since we started our break.

1987
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,470
Before we wrap things up for today,

1988
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:59,780
Yes?

1989
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:04,060
we will give you one more chance to earn roses.

1990
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:07,980
- I don't want to do anything else, but I don't mind earning roses.
- If you have nine, then only nine people can come.

1991
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,100
Didn't you guys say 40,000 people in the beginning?

1992
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,220
Let's set a goal. 40,000 people!

1993
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,810
(Target goal for number of Zeroes: 40,000)
(Current number: 9 (Only 39,991 more to go))

1994
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,830
We will give you the opportunity to earn roses.

1995
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:22,010
In this village, there is a very old abandoned school.

1996
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,480
(In denial)

1997
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,910
- No, no.
- H-Here?

1998
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:30,120
Wait, this is a horror experience!

1999
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,740
(Welcome... you've never experienced an abandoned school in a village, right?)

2000
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,440
Supposedly, roses have bloomed inside this abandoned school.

2001
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,520
I don't think that's likely...

2002
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,510
(Why not?)

2003
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:45,010
It's even scarier.

2004
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:47,920
We will break up into four teams

2005
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,720
(The official scaredy-cat of ZB1)
- I don't want to do this.

2006
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,460
- First, we will break up into four teams... let me explain the rest of the rules.
- Two, two, two, and two.

2007
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:57,150
You will break up into four teams, and you need to

2008
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,880
collect roses and rose stamps.

2009
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,270
From the ghosts?

2010
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,390
(The maknae is starting to lose his mind from fear)

2011
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:08,510
Finding the roses won't count unless you get the rose stamps.

2012
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:12,110
Oh, a rose that you accept. ♫ A rose that you accept! ♫

2013
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:14,130
(The fear is taking over his mind)

2014
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:20,030
This rose mission will demonstrate how great your teamwork is,

2015
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:25,640
so your hands will be connected together.

2016
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,600
I like it.

2017
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,580
We'll grow affectionate with each other.

2018
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:32,930
- I've never done this before.
- We might grown attached to each other.

2019
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:38,550
Also, if you succeed in the mission without getting disconnected,

2020
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:40,920
we will give you two times the roses that you find.

2021
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,730
- Really?
- It's double!

2022
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,940
We can do it.

2023
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,140
The first team is...

2024
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,000
(Who is it? Ji Woong?)

2025
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,630
Yu Jin and Hao.

2026
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:55,120
I don't want to go...

2027
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,520
This is scary. I'm really not good with stuff like this...

2028
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,880
Since you put it on, Hyung, I'll put it on too.

2029
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,760
I'll go and make some kimchi.

2030
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,790
Do you have a lot of fear?

2031
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,980
(Is Hao hyung worried about his fearful younger brother?)

2032
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,270
I tend to get scared pretty easily, too.

2033
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:10,080
- He says he gets scared easily, too!
- Yeah, oh well.

2034
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,870
We're still on the same team, regardless.

2035
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:17,320
Yu Jin, you're a formidable 17 year old.

2036
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,110
(Never heard of that before)

2037
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,160
(The formidable 19 year old hyung's encouragement)

2038
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,020
(Will they manage to bring back the roses safe and sound?)

2039
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,230
I put the wood in the fire for nothing.

2040
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,750
Fighting, fighting.

2041
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,240
Goodness...

2042
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,590
Good luck!

2043
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:35,070
What's this?

2044
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,810
(A weak paper wristband will connect the members)

2045
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,620
This falls off really easily.

2046
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,820
They connect us together with paper. That's cute.

2047
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,890
I thought they would connect us together with a cable tie.

2048
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:47,140
They're giving us double the roses because it's difficult, I see.

2049
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:50,020
But this will probably break really easily.

2050
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:52,780
Yu Jin, tighten your fist and grit your teeth.

2051
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,830
(Okay, got it)

2052
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,540
Han Yu Jin, what are you doing?

2053
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,260
I'll take this.

2054
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,370
(Our proud scaredy-cat Lv. 1: Gained 1 pebble)

2055
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:04,220
I'll take just one.

2056
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:07,430
Good luck, guys.

2057
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,500
(Bam!)

2058
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:13,100
- Hao and Yu Jin, please get going.
- Yes.

2059
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,510
Have a safe trip!

2060
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,200
- Have a good time!
- Bye bye!

2061
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,540
I'll see you later!

2062
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:20,400
Yu Jin, don't cry. Your hyung's heart breaks when you do.

2063
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,280
But I think it will be really scary in there.

2064
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,670
I think the path going there will also be scary.

2065
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,490
Gosh, I'm scared.

2066
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:31,560
Why isn't there that thing here. Are there no lights for the road?

2067
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,340
- The lights?
- Yeah.

2068
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,110
(Hao and Yu Jin walk a dark rural path)

2069
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,680
I think that's it.

2070
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,230
What?

2071
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,310
Where the red lights are.

2072
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,040
It's there, right?

2073
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,320
(Faint red lights in the distance)

2074
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,970
- Gosh, I hate this.
- Why are there no lights?

2075
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,540
I hate this already.

2076
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,340
(Hao and Yu Jin arrive at the school yard and their Rose Mission starts!)

2077
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:01,590
Hey! Hey!

2078
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,570
- This is so interesting.
- Hey!

2079
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:07,030
I've never heard that kind of voice before.

2080
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:08,200
Isn't that a water deer?

2081
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,250
(A formidable water deer appears)

2082
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,660
Hey!

2083
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:15,690
W-What is that?

2084
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:18,270
That white thing... What is that?

2085
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,000
It looks like a person.

2086
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,660
It's moving, no?

2087
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,990
The person is moving!

2088
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,780
I saw it.

2089
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:28,020
We're screwed.

2090
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,380
The person is sitting there.

2091
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:36,450
(Extremely wary)

2092
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:38,420
Whatever. Let's hurry up and go.

2093
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,150
A warning sign.

2094
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:43,010
(Hao and Yu Jin arrive in front of the warning sign.)

2095
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:46,960
It's this, right?

2096
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,950
When you read this warning, they will also...

2097
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,670
Gosh, that scared me.

2098
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:55,400
(Teenagers get scared from just sound of a passing breeze)

2099
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,240
be with you.

2100
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:01,440
(Warning: When you read this warning, they will also be with you. I'll go back to the school to find my lost friend. I write these rules you should know about this school...)

2101
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,540
(Our proud scaredy-cat Lv.1: Obtained a flashlight)

2102
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,360
It says not to make footstep noises.

2103
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,890
Okay.

2104
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:09,100
It says there is no third classroom here.

2105
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,910
The third classroom is missing.

2106
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:13,240
Oh, when you enter the third classroom,

2107
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,380
like this-

2108
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,430
(The crash helped to relieve anxiety for a moment.)

2109
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:21,930
Okay.

2110
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,210
Gosh, seriously...

2111
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,650
(What lies before their eyes?)

2112
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:29,690
(A dark and scary abandoned school full of red light)

2113
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:33,070
Gosh! I can't do something like this!

2114
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:35,100
I really can't do this.

2115
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,340
Hold the flashlight, Hyung.

2116
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,430
I might end up throwing it.

2117
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,970
Let's go in now.

2118
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,570
We shouldn't make footstep noises.

2119
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,670
- What?
- You can't make footstep noises.

2120
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:50,310
Okay.
- Let's go, slowly.

2121
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:54,230
We're starting from here, right?
- Yes, yes, go in first!

2122
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:03,180
- What is that?
- What is it?

2123
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,340
A lady...

2124
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:10,490
- It's a person.
- No, it's a ghost.

2125
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,640
There is a ghost lady over there.

2126
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,140
(They've repeated retreating to the start multiple times already)

2127
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,030
We really can't do this!

2128
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:21,890
It's so scary!

2129
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,370
Gosh, seriously.

2130
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:27,470
- Go inside first.
- It's not anything super scary, right?

2131
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:30,270
You should go and find the roses.

2132
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,510
(They want to find roses...)

2133
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:36,480
(But they're also scared of ghosts.)

2134
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,360
We shouldn't make footstep noises.

2135
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:42,530
But if it's just the footstep noises, then our voices are okay, right?

2136
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,600
I don't know...

2137
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,930
(The two arrive at the first classroom 40 minutes after they started)

2138
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:47,870
You should enter first.

2139
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:50,370
Don't make footstep noises.

2140
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,150
Don't make footstep noises.

2141
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:55,300
(Tense)

2142
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:59,070
(Hao looks around the classroom carefully)

2143
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:02,100
Go!

2144
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,890
Go, go, go! Whoa!

2145
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,920
Gosh!

2146
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,020
No!
(To be continued)

2147
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:13,980
(Next week)
- Do you trust me? Just trust me.
- We trust you.

2148
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,010
I'm your hyung. I'm not scared at all.

2149
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:18,900
My father was a soldier in the navy.

2150
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,210
♫ A navy warrior who vanquishes ghosts ♫

2151
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,680
- This is scary!
- This is too much!

2152
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,340
(Will the members be able to finish the Rose Mission without any issues?)

2153
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:29,330
(The details regarding the fan even will be posted on mNet's official social media in the future.)

2154
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:31,890
Let's go to work.
- I haven't woken up fully yet.

2155
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:33,890
- It looks that way.
(The second day of camping after staying up all night)

2156
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,970
This isn't easy.

2157
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:38,030
You completely squished the scallion.

2158
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,690
Okay.

2159
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,110
You have to wrap a hundred each.

2160
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:42,520
(And!)

2161
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:46,520
Everyone! We've come to Jeju-do!

2162
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,370
(This time it's a healing camp...)

2163
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:50,740
(Or so you thought!)

2164
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,930
(Even more amazing and more ridiculous,)

2165
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:55,470
(Zero Base One's second camping trip)

2166
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,280
(Next week is even more fun)
