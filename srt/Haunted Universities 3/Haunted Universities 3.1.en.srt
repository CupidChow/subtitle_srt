1
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:44,583
Princess Nuankaew

2
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:51,291
The beloved

3
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,583
Royal daughter

4
00:00:55,666 --> 00:01:02,000
Of the Lanna Kingdom

5
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:08,833
Tormented by a love affair
Beset by social class

6
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:13,083
She and her lover parted by death

7
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:18,000
And a tale of revenge began

8
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:22,041
It is a long-held belief

9
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:28,833
That if someone breaks their promise
After making a wish to her

10
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:35,250
They will suffer and die in pain

11
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:39,375
Summarily beheaded

12
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:43,833
And violently killed

13
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:48,875
Condemned to become a ghost

14
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:54,125
Lost in a graveyard

15
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,500
CHIANG MAI

16
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,291
- It's lit.
- Careful.

17
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,875
- Ready?
- Make a heart.

18
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,125
- We're late.
- Look.

19
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,916
- Look over there. Selfie?
- So beautiful.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,375
Let's take a selfie.

21
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,291
Beautiful?

22
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,458
Tu, let's hang out for some more time.

23
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,166
It's just us now.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,708
No need to pretend anymore.

25
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,083
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,750
I got carried away.

27
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,041
Sure. It's okay. Let's go.

28
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,166
Tu?

29
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,125
What's that on your neck?

30
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,500
What's it, Tu?

31
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,791
Tu!

32
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,916
I'm sorry!

33
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,208
Princess, I'm sorry!

34
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:06,041
THE PROCESSION

35
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,916
So,

36
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,000
you've got a girlfriend?

37
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,916
Yes.

38
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,791
We've secretly been together for a while.

39
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,916
Yeah.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,875
Stay away from my sugar bear.

41
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,125
Or I'll kick your ass.

42
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,000
Is he the best you can do?

43
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,708
"Is he the best you can do?"

44
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,583
An insult to you or me?

45
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,875
- Yeah. Mr. Heartthrob.
- Yeah. That's me.

46
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,000
Being so handsome is stressful.

47
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,000
You should've been honest with her.

48
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:12,041
She was so obsessed with me.

49
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,083
If I'd told her straight up,
she would've had a meltdown for sure.

50
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,250
She'd take it online.

51
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,125
She and I have been friends for so long.

52
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,833
It'd be weird if we became an item.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,291
How will you compensate me
for playing along?

54
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,083
Compensate you?

55
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,791
- I had to modify my scooter for you.
- And?

56
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,583
You'll be my chick-punk rider. I had to…

57
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,625
That hurt.

58
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,291
Your lips.

59
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,166
Finish up the painting
and the carving today.

60
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,166
- I'll go see Tae.
- Sure. Okay.

61
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,791
I know you can do it.

62
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,708
- Hey, how is it going?
- Very busy, bro.

63
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,916
What's that?

64
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,333
Your sedan chair is a killer this year.
It's dope, man.

65
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,875
Better than yours last year.

66
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,458
Whatever, fat ass.

67
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,666
For real, man,

68
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,875
you've really stepped up
your craftsmanship.

69
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:19,583
But I've never seen you work this hard.
What's the deal?

70
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,875
I'll include it in my portfolio
for the internship application.

71
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,041
- Really?
- Yeah.

72
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,666
Cool. Good luck then.

73
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,458
I'll leave you to it.

74
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,500
Good. You're wasting my time.

75
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
- Hello.
- Have you transferred the money?

76
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,166
I don't have any money.

77
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,833
I have bills to pay.

78
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,083
Oh, come on.

79
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,083
You go to college
and spend too much time with friends.

80
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,916
Other people go to college
and make a lot of money.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,625
You should study hard. Be more reliable.

82
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,791
All right.

83
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,750
I'll transfer once I have it.

84
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,916
Better be soon.

85
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,250
Working so hard.

86
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,916
Huh? Oh.

87
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,125
Why the long face?

88
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,833
Your mom called to ask for money again?

89
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,083
- Yes.
- Oops.

90
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,791
How come I never win a lottery?

91
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,375
So,

92
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,625
have you applied for the scholarship?

93
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,291
Yes, I have.

94
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,666
Right after you. Don't worry.

95
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,541
I won't let you take it all.

96
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,333
Girl just wanna have fund.

97
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,083
You bet.

98
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,291
Are you finishing the costume today?

99
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,708
Yes, but I have to finish this drawing
for a customer first.

100
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,583
Okay, I'll sew it for you.

101
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,208
Holy moly, you're going to sew it?

102
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,041
Damn you, Koy.

103
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,125
You're insulting your class president.

104
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,291
Class president. Sure.
Mr. Class President.

105
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,500
Okay or not?

106
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,125
Hope you enjoy it. I feel bad.

107
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,791
Do you really feel bad? Huh?

108
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,916
Hey, Tey!

109
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,083
Sew his head back on first.

110
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,166
He's dead.

111
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,375
All right. I'll sew it back on.

112
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,750
It's like I explained.

113
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,541
We only have one scholarship this year

114
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,625
due to the budget cuts.

115
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:27,750
The faculty will make a decision based on
the academic performance of the applicant.

116
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,333
Damn it.

117
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,541
We have to compete against each other.

118
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,708
Who's going to get it?

119
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,833
May the best student win.

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,958
Hey.

121
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,708
Why don't we go ask for a blessing?

122
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,666
From who?

123
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,375
The princess.

124
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,875
The princess? Who?

125
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,875
You've never heard the story?

126
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,041
They say that by the big pond,

127
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,083
there's this secret shrine.

128
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,458
A secret one.

129
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,625
If you find it, you're allowed one wish.

130
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:24,541
Tey, the princess
likes to play hide-and-seek?

131
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,666
Maybe she has a sense of humor.

132
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,916
If you want my blessings, find me first.

133
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,416
Well, this is unlike you.

134
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,666
Normally, you're not superstitious.

135
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,750
Well, I'm not but you are.

136
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,500
It's up to you.

137
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,750
No pressure.

138
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,750
If you don't want to go, then don't.

139
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,666
Your choice.

140
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,791
Centuries ago,

141
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,000
the princess, the daughter of the king,

142
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,958
was secretly in love with a slave.

143
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,791
When the king found out,

144
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:24,458
he had all the bearers beheaded
to preserve her honor.

145
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,541
This story has many versions.

146
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,833
It's not clear who was actually killed.

147
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:36,000
But her story
became a legendary tale of tragic love.

148
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,750
She became a sacred being
worshipped by all.

149
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,083
Some believe that

150
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,875
if a couple comes
and makes a wish together,

151
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,791
their wishes will be fulfilled.

152
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,208
But for those

153
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,708
who are not together
and come to make a wish,

154
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,000
one of them will die because of love.

155
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,625
What?

156
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,250
What are we doing here then?

157
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,666
We're not a couple.

158
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,791
It's okay.

159
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,333
Let's pretend we are, like we did before.

160
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,208
Oh.

161
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,583
That would be an insult to the princess.

162
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,833
You just said one of them would die
because of love.

163
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,791
What do we do if we die?

164
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,833
Don't be silly.

165
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,708
People make this stuff up
to make it more mystical.

166
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,458
What?

167
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,791
So?

168
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,458
What now?

169
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,291
We're here.

170
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,083
Koy, you think she's cold?

171
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,041
Look, all her windows are open and old.

172
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,541
Don't play the fool.

173
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,250
Sorry.

174
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,041
Behave yourself.

175
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,166
I'm just curious.

176
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,833
So? Feel better?

177
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,166
Do you think she knows

178
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,708
we're not a couple?

179
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,083
I didn't think that far ahead.

180
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,916
Don't you wonder if she is even real?

181
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,250
Sorry, ma'am.

182
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,708
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

183
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,666
Let's go.

184
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,833
Come on.

185
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,125
I was just saying.

186
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,250
Shut up.

187
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,458
What are you so scared of?

188
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,250
Well, well, well.

189
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,208
I know you and Koy
went to the pond last night.

190
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,416
Man, do you really believe that story?

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,375
That princess story.

192
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,125
- It's all bullshit.
- Oh.

193
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,875
I took her there to calm her nerves

194
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,125
because only one student
will get the scholarship.

195
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,833
We'll compete against each other.

196
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,416
One scholarship, but you went together.

197
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,541
Like a couple.

198
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,791
- Smart asses.
- Don't be shy.

199
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,333
How cute.

200
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,125
How cute.

201
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,875
- Big event.
- No!

202
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,708
You're doing it wrong.

203
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,250
- Here.
- Show me.

204
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,458
This way.

205
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,791
This way you'll conserve your energy.

206
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,333
So damn heavy.

207
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,666
- Hey!
- Hey!

208
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,375
Tey, what the heck?

209
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,791
What is it?

210
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,458
Are you okay?

211
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,500
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

212
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,250
Enough for today. Go get some rest.

213
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,833
Let's go home.

214
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,750
Sorry.

215
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,583
What was that?

216
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,625
FACULTY ANNOUNCEMENT
SCHOLARSHIP FOR THIS YEAR

217
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,000
Suddenly there's one more scholarship?

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
Oh, I see.

219
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you, sir.

220
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,750
Tey.

221
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,916
The professor said that Master Kam

222
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,875
is giving funds
to an art and cultural student.

223
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,583
So there's another scholarship.

224
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,166
Wow, the princess is so magical.

225
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,208
We asked her yesterday
and today we got it.

226
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,875
Yesterday when we were rehearsing,

227
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,208
I saw a woman in an ancient Lanna costume.

228
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,333
You saw her too?

229
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,750
Shit.

230
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,625
I thought I was delusional.

231
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,208
Or she knows we're not a couple.

232
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,333
She knows we lied to her,

233
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,041
so she came to take our lives,
like you said.

234
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,875
Come on.

235
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,458
Koy.

236
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,291
That's a good horror story.

237
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,916
Rubbish. Taking our lives?

238
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,958
I think she came to let us know,
"Your wish has been granted."

239
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
You jerk.

240
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,041
Now let's go. What are you waiting for?

241
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,083
Come on.

242
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,958
- Hurry up.
- Fine.

243
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,208
I'd like to thank you

244
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,541
for giving a scholarship to our faculty.

245
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,916
These are my students.

246
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,958
Please come and watch our procession.

247
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,375
I will.

248
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,500
Did you bring a sample of the fabric?

249
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,833
Yes, sir.

250
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,583
- Here it is.
- Good.

251
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,833
Come with me.
I'll show you the sedan chairs.

252
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,958
Come.

253
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,416
Be careful.

254
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,333
My work is all over the place.

255
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,125
Watch out for nails on the ground.

256
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,375
As you can see, Professor,

257
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,583
the younger generation today
has no interest in wood carving.

258
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,291
It's great you brought your students here.

259
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,416
Maybe they will be interested in it.

260
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,833
Yes. Thank you for your time showing us…

261
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,000
Choose what you want.

262
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,375
See if any of them goes with your fabric.

263
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,666
Yes, sir.

264
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,041
Tey, where's Koy?

265
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh.

266
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,583
How would I know? I walked here with you.

267
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,791
I'll go find my friend. Please excuse me.

268
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,958
All right. You guys go take a look.

269
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,583
Koy!

270
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,000
Koy!

271
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,166
Koy! What happened?

272
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,666
Look at me, Koy!

273
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,333
Back off!

274
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,125
Koy!

275
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,416
Koy!

276
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,083
Tey!

277
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,166
Hey! Shit!

278
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,333
Shit!

279
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,125
- What's going on?
- Koy!

280
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,208
Cut the power!

281
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,416
It's not working!

282
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,958
Master!

283
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,375
Professor, we're sorry. We didn't mean it.

284
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,708
What have you done?

285
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,250
Are you okay?

286
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,416
And you?

287
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,958
Professor, I take full responsibility
for what happened.

288
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,250
Tey, why are you taking the blame for me?

289
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,083
Nonetheless, I have to
withdraw your scholarship.

290
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,458
I'll also find someone
to replace you as supervisor.

291
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,708
- I understand, sir.
- Good.

292
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,041
Professor, it was all my fault.

293
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,791
Don't withdraw his scholarship,
withdraw mine.

294
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,916
Koy.

295
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,166
No.

296
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,791
It's my fault.

297
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,416
Withdraw my scholarship.

298
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,666
Are you insane?

299
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,916
I'm busy writing a formal apology
to Master Kam.

300
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,750
He's an artist. His hands are his life.

301
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,000
It was an accident. You know that.

302
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,916
Tey has devoted himself
to building the sedan.

303
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,333
It's not fair to do that to him.

304
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,666
Both of you are responsible, right?

305
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,541
Koy.

306
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,000
Professor,

307
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,791
I'm telling you,

308
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,791
it's the princess.

309
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,916
Nonsense.

310
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,333
You may not believe me,
but I asked for her blessings.

311
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,666
Koy!

312
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,958
Stop it!

313
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,291
Professor, we're sorry.

314
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,375
Let's go. Enough. Koy!

315
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,000
Go.

316
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,666
Let… Let go of me! Let go.

317
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,500
Why did you make things worse?

318
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,833
I told you I was fine.

319
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,583
But it's not your fault.

320
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,375
I understand.

321
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,666
I didn't even know
if the princess story was real.

322
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,541
I wanted to calm you down
about the scholarship.

323
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,125
What do we do now?
What are we supposed to do?

324
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,833
Tey,

325
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,458
this may sound ridiculous,

326
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,250
but if she wants to kill us
because we're not a couple,

327
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,833
then…

328
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,833
shall we show her that we are? Huh?

329
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,541
Hold on.

330
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,458
You can't love someone

331
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,625
just because someone forces you to.

332
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,041
Then what will we do?

333
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,708
Huh? Let's…

334
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,916
Let's beg for her forgiveness.

335
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,458
- Or do something--
- Stop it.

336
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,833
Forget it.

337
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,500
The withdrawal of my scholarship
is obviously the punishment

338
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,458
that the princess has meted out on me.

339
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,333
Besides,

340
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,291
if you're safe, I'm good.

341
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,125
Don't go.

342
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,375
See you at the event.

343
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,125
Tey!

344
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,875
Princess, I'm here to take back my wish.

345
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,458
If you've heard us all along,

346
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,708
then you know that
I came to you because of him.

347
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,166
So, how is it going?

348
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,166
Phee,

349
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,041
the shrine I told you about,

350
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,458
it's real.

351
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,666
It's just a trick to get a girl.

352
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,875
You take a girl there to make a wish

353
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,833
and she'll fall for you.

354
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,916
Shit.

355
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,458
What do I have to do?

356
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,916
Won't you let us go?

357
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,541
You also said that

358
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,208
if the two people aren't a couple,

359
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,375
one of them will die.

360
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,083
It's just a tale
passed down in the campus.

361
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,625
It's all mumbo-jumbo.

362
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,791
Right.

363
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,750
I don't want Tey to lose everything.

364
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:35,833
All I want now is for things
to be the same as before.

365
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,708
TEY

366
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,541
Where are you, Koy?

367
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,291
- What the heck?
- Run!

368
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,916
Kua! Shit! Go!

369
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,916
- Shit!
- Hey!

370
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,833
Kua!

371
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:22,750
The princess!

372
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:23,750
Her procession!

373
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,458
- Easy.
- The princess!

374
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,083
Her procession is coming!

375
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,166
- Easy, man.
- It's her! She's here!

376
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,958
- It's true! I saw it.
- Believe me!

377
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,416
Get your shit together

378
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,416
The princess story isn't real.

379
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,708
Come out, if it is.

380
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,333
Where? I'll kick her ass!

381
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,708
- Come on!
- It's real.

382
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,500
- Yeah.
- I'm not kidding.

383
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,708
We just saw her there with our own eyes.

384
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,208
- Hey!
- Hey!

385
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,250
- What's that?
- Kua! Bos!

386
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,833
- Kua!
- Kua! Bos!

387
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,708
Bos! Kua!

388
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,625
Run!

389
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,958
Phee!

390
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,125
What happened to them?

391
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,250
They're dead!

392
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,583
Phee!

393
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:19,708
Phee!

394
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:22,625
Phee!

395
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,208
- Phee!
- Phee!

396
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,875
Tey! Hold on!
Tey!

397
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,583
Hey!

398
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,583
Tey!

399
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,666
Tey!

400
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,041
Princess,

401
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,791
all my life,
I've never been useful to anyone.

402
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,208
But Tey still stood beside me.

403
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,791
If you have to take someone's life,

404
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,500
I'm begging you,

405
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,833
please,

406
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,291
take my life, Princess.

407
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,458
Koy!

408
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,541
Koy!

409
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:39,625
Koy!

410
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,041
Koy!

411
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,791
Why did you do this?

412
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,125
Don't leave me!

413
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,208
Koy!

414
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,208
You're fucking dictators!

415
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,500
You're going to punish us anyway!

416
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,666
THE CARETAKER

417
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,083
You're fucking dictators!

418
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,416
Listen up.

419
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,750
Each slip of paper in this box
has a freshman's name on it.

420
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:41,500
Each of you will draw one from it.

421
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,958
Once you get the name,

422
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:48,000
you'll become
that freshman's secret caretaker.

423
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:53,291
Don't let them know who you are
until the reveal day.

424
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:59,500
Our seniors came up with this activity
to replace the brutal Sotus system.

425
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:03,458
Instead, we treat everyone equally.

426
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,625
Cool, right?

427
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,250
Even without the fraternity activity,

428
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:13,500
we can still get to know them
without playing this game.

429
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,083
Right?

430
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,791
Yeah.

431
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,458
Everyone must draw a slip.

432
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,375
No exceptions.

433
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,833
This year, we have
matching numbers of freshmen.

434
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:34,333
No freshman should be left
without a caretaker.

435
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,666
You know, if the freshmen could choose,

436
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,583
they wouldn't want you as a caretaker.

437
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,750
They should be your caretaker instead.

438
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,583
Take care of you and feed you.

439
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,541
Before you order us around,

440
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,666
you should've asked our consent first.

441
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,500
No one here is objecting, right?
Except you.

442
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:10,583
- Yes.
- Calm down.

443
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,666
You're not my mom.

444
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,958
Maybe I am!

445
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,125
Earth, chill. Come on.

446
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,333
- Chill.
- Bitch.

447
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:19,291
Everybody chill. Okay?

448
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:23,708
Fai.

449
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,416
- What?
- You're an inspiration.

450
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,875
I now want to be a better senior.

451
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,166
Earth, don't be an asshole.

452
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,416
Tell you what.

453
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:38,958
I'll take the box around myself,
so someone can have her peace of mind.

454
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,375
Thanks.

455
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,916
Let's be good caretakers to our freshmen.

456
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,750
Remember, you have to keep it a secret.

457
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,791
Don't throw the slip away.

458
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,875
SUN

459
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:14,291
Because on the reveal day,
your freshman will give you a present,

460
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:20,458
and you'll show the paper to them
to prove that you're their caretaker.

461
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,541
That's all for today.

462
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,041
She shouldn't be our class president.

463
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,166
- Excuse me!
- Why?

464
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,083
- She's annoying.
- She's fine.

465
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,708
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

466
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,875
I'm Noon, a freshman.

467
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:37,375
Please sign your name
on my name list book.

468
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,166
- Well… I will.
- Tong.

469
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll do it.

470
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,000
But you have to shout
"Tong is hot" three times.

471
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,208
- Then I'll sign it nicely.
- Sure.

472
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,416
- Tong is hot.
- Louder.

473
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,458
Tong is hot.

474
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,958
- Louder.
- Tong is hot.

475
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,791
All right. I'll sign it now.

476
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,291
- Can we go now?
- Hold on.

477
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,458
I drew you a heart too.

478
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,791
See you around, love.

479
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:10,000
Excuse me! Can you sign it too?

480
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,041
- I need one more.
- Do it for her.

481
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,708
Please.

482
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,958
You know what?

483
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:18,250
I didn't do it last year
and the world didn't end.

484
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:23,625
But I only need one more. Please.

485
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,916
- Only one.
- Only one to complete it.

486
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,333
Only one more.

487
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,000
Why is it such a big deal?

488
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:32,791
You want it that badly?

489
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,250
Go and shout "Tong is hot"
until I tell you to stop.

490
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,416
Stop it.

491
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,583
Enough already.

492
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:39,916
You want it badly, no?

493
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,333
Just sign it. Don't be a jerk.
She's cute. Enough.

494
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,666
What's your name?

495
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:49,916
Earth.

496
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,583
Earth is hot!

497
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,916
Earth is hot!

498
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,208
How was that?

499
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,375
Can you sign for me too?

500
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,500
An autograph hunter?

501
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,333
What's your name?

502
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,208
Sun.

503
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,291
Sun.

504
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,333
Sun?

505
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,125
Sun.

506
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,708
Sun, you had the nerve to butt in.

507
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,791
You're not a kid.

508
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,500
Why did you humiliate yourself?

509
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:03,000
I wouldn't have done it
if you hadn't given such weird order.

510
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:07,958
Well, thank you. We're leaving. Thank you.

511
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,750
More activities. Let's go.

512
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,958
You're such a pain in the ass.

513
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,208
What activities?

514
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,291
Last night I worked my ass off.

515
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,500
Hey. What's this?

516
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,875
There's voting.

517
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,500
THIS LIPSTICK IS PERFECT
FOR A BEAUTY LIKE YOU

518
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,208
- Noon, look at this.
- Yeah.

519
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,958
- What?
- From my caretaker.

520
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,208
"This lipstick is perfect
for a beauty like you."

521
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,875
- And the color!
- Shit.

522
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,708
You're lucky. You got an expensive gift.

523
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,958
Why?

524
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,083
Let me see.

525
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,541
See?

526
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,166
Amen.

527
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:32,250
Let's offer it to the monk this evening.
You can see it from miles away.

528
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,958
Your caretaker is such a troll.

529
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:37,333
True. I don't know what to do with it.

530
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,458
Sun, have you got anything?

531
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,916
Sun.

532
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:44,666
Look here.

533
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,625
Have you got anything from your caretaker?

534
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,166
We've all got something.

535
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,166
Nothing yet.

536
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,125
- Nothing?
- No.

537
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,458
Your caretaker probably doesn't like you.

538
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:59,000
Hey, don't tease him.

539
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,458
He's sulking.

540
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,666
He's sulking because of you.

541
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,208
Go make up with him.

542
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:23,833
Sun, it's just a game.
Don't take it personally.

543
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:43,625
Hi.

544
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:58,000
SUN, THIS ART HISTORY 101 IS NOW YOURS.

545
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:01,708
"Sun, this history 101 is now yours."

546
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,291
"Hope you like it."

547
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,541
"From Boonchu."

548
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,541
He must be your caretaker. Here he is.

549
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,625
Boonchu?

550
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,666
What an old-fashioned name.
Is he from our class?

551
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,208
I don't know.

552
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:28,333
What's with the red threads?

553
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,416
Maybe it's part of the theme.

554
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,791
They use red threads
in the welcoming ritual.

555
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,500
I've never seen a book tied with it.

556
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,666
- Yes, weird.
- Spooky.

557
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:44,000
He may be gay.
You know, these flashy gimmicks.

558
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:49,791
Tong, is it possible that
one caretaker has two freshmen?

559
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,083
No way. One is already a handful.

560
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,875
- Don't tell me you want two?
- No way.

561
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:57,375
I already feel sorry for your freshman.

562
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,000
Sure, I'm an asshole.

563
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,583
- You know it.
- That good?

564
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,625
You seem engrossed.

565
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:04,708
Right.

566
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,541
Look here.

567
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,916
"Boonchu" sounds familiar.

568
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,041
So beautiful.

569
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:19,250
- I've heard it somewhere.
- Don't know. No idea.

570
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:23,041
I have no idea. Forget it.

571
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,666
Sun, are you done? It's almost 9:00.

572
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,791
We have to go to the caretaker reveal.

573
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,666
Sun, did you hear us?

574
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,000
- Sun!
- What?

575
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,250
Are you coming to the reveal?

576
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,375
Yeah. let's go.

577
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,500
You go ahead. I'll stay a bit longer.

578
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,000
You sure?

579
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:54,791
All right.

580
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,291
We're off then.

581
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,416
- See you.
- Bye.

582
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:58,750
Let's go.

583
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,666
Coming. Catch up with us, Sun.

584
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:06,916
Wait for me.

585
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:44,750
I'd like

586
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,125
a "Gothic art" textbook.

587
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,125
WELCOMING RITUAL BY CARETAKERS

588
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:03,541
Turn off the lights. We're about to begin.

589
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,208
What the hell am I doing here?

590
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,875
What are you doing here?

591
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,833
Did you see someone come in just now?

592
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,750
Were you holding a candle?

593
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:32,333
What candle?

594
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,500
Did Boonchu give you this book?

595
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:58,541
Maybe. I just asked him for it.

596
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,083
When did he put it here?

597
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,500
How did he leave this room?

598
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,416
I was just…

599
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,333
You just what?

600
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:10,958
Sun,

601
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,833
I think there's something strange
about Boonchu.

602
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:14,916
Stay away from him.

603
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,791
Strange? How?

604
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,125
Creepy, actually.

605
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,375
Aren't you scared? How can you trust him?

606
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,375
Are you always so cynical?

607
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,416
Come on, Sun.

608
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,000
A super nice caretaker doesn't exist.

609
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:42,916
I don't know.

610
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,125
Maybe.

611
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,791
I don't mean to discredit Boonchu.

612
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,708
You don't know who he is.

613
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,250
And also I…

614
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,375
- Fuck you, Tong!
- Why are you here?

615
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,541
What are you doing?

616
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:02,708
Asshole.

617
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,416
- Huh?
- Why are you here?

618
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,083
To fetch you, of course.

619
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:11,791
It's the caretaker reveal day. Please.

620
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:15,291
- Don't "please" me.
- Took me forever to find you.

621
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:17,375
I'm going.

622
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,375
What the hell are you doing here?

623
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:24,791
None of your business.

624
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,875
Fine.

625
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:28,916
Suit yourself.

626
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:43,708
BOONCHU

627
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:48,166
BOONCHU SIWARATANA KILLS HIMSELF
TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY

628
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:51,916
SENIOR HANGS HIMSELF TO ESCAPE GUILT

629
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,416
SENIOR BEATS FRESHMAN TO DEATH
THEN KILLS HIMSELF TO ESCAPE GUILT

630
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,541
What the fuck?

631
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,833
"Senior beats freshman to death
during hazing."

632
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:04,875
BOONCHU SIWARATANA

633
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,875

UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS

Tenth year.

637
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:17,125
Boonchu was in charge
of the fraternity's hazing activities.

638
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:25,750
Hey!

639
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,000
Tong!

640
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,875
What the fuck are you playing at?

641
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,500
Tong, it isn't funny.

642
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,416
Tong!

643
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Tong!

644
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:15,500
Tong, I'm not playing with you.

645
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,291
I fucking hate freshmen like you.

646
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,041
Listen to me.

647
00:53:58,541 --> 00:53:59,791
What do you want?

648
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:04,833
Boonchu died 20 years ago.

649
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,958
I'm your caretaker.

650
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,208
Show me the slip with my name on it.

651
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,625
If you're really my caretaker,
you must have it.

652
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:24,500
It's just a piece of paper.

653
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:28,083
I threw it in the trash can.

654
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,333
You threw my name in the can?

655
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:35,083
Yes. Because I hate this stupid game.

656
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,083
Sorry, Sun. Let me ask you something.

657
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:46,000
Feelings of affection can't be forced.

658
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,916
I know you don't care about this.

659
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,666
At least you should care about
people's feelings.

660
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:00,166
Boonchu may be weird or even dead,

661
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,375
but he takes better care of me
than you do.

662
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,041
If it were up to me,

663
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,791
I wouldn't want you either.

664
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:15,583
Sun!

665
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,958
"Tonight, I'm going to bless you
at the welcoming ritual."

666
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,500
"Bring the red threads with you."

667
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,666
"See you at Sai Lom Apartments, room 404."

668
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,041
Sun!

669
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,375
SAI LOM APARTMENTS

670
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,250
Sun!

671
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:13,833
Sun!

672
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:28,458
Sun!

673
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,291

674
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,375
Sun!

675
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:39,500
Sun!

676
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,416
Sun!

677
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,083
Sun!

678
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:46,875
Sun!

679
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,583
Sun!

680
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:50,666
Sun!

681
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,791
Sun! Can you hear me? Sun!

682
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:54,958
Sun!

683
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,208
Sun!

684
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Sun!

685
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,208
Sun!

686
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,791
Nont, I've brought you the books.

687
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,666
Why are you doing this to me?

688
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,333
Nont, I've brought you the books.

689
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:52,333
Why are you doing this to me?

690
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:15,666
Sun!

691
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,500
Shit.

692
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,125
Sun!

693
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,750
Nont, I've brought you the books.

694
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,583
Why are you doing this to me?

695
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:14,833
Sun!

696
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,166
Sun!

697
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,375
Sun!

698
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:37,500
I told you I didn't want
any fucking caretaker.

699
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:41,875
Guys,

700
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,958
if you're with me on this,

701
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,208
come forward!

702
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,208
Come forward!

703
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:59,250
See? You're fucking dictators!

704
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,625
You're going to punish us anyway!

705
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,833
Fucking dictators!

706
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:21,041
Anyone who doesn't want a caretaker,
just leave.

707
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,500
If you agree with me, come forward!

708
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:33,958
See? You're fucking dictators!

709
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,375
You're going to punish us anyway!

710
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,083
You're fucking dictators!

711
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:48,583
Nont, get up. What's wrong?

712
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:49,666
Shit!

713
01:01:54,291 --> 01:02:00,250
Nont, get up. Such a light punishment.

714
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:07,833
Stay with me. Get up.

715
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,375
Sun? Are you Sun?

716
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:38,041
Sun, I've been waiting to bless you
with the welcoming ritual.

717
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,375
Come here.

718
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:58,750
Let me see the slip with my name on it.

719
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,708
I've been waiting
to perform this ritual with you.

720
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:13,166
Someone already told me he's my caretaker.

721
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,708
Not you.

722
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:20,875
Stop it!
You're ruining the welcoming ritual!

723
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,375
You can take it out on me!

724
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:29,083
Why are you telling them this?

725
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,833
Who are you talking to?

726
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:34,750
If you don't stop,

727
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,791
I'll have to punish you.

728
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:47,000
I won't let anyone ruin my ritual.

729
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:42,750
Sun!

730
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:49,916
Sun!

731
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:06,250
Sun is now mine.

732
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,208
Sun, what's wrong?

733
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,041
Sun!

734
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,416
Seniors and freshmen like you

735
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,125
are ruining the activity I started.

736
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:42,958
Sun!

737
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:01,916
Sun!

738
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:04,625
Sun!

739
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:06,625
Sun!

740
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:23,875
Sun.

741
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,291
Sun.

742
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,625
Sun is under my care.

743
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:08,583
Sorry.

744
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:10,625
Are you hurt?

745
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:12,916
Yes.

746
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:24,625
Hang in there.

747
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,208
Why did you help me?

748
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,500
Because I care about you.

749
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,541
Thanks for taking care of me.

750
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:56,166
I'm glad you're my caretaker.

751
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,083
It's yours.

752
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,875
Take it. I don't need it anymore.

753
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:09,416
Another hand-me-down.

754
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,541
What's so funny?

755
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:19,666
Nothing.

756
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,875
Don't laugh at your caretaker.

757
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:29,083
It's filthy. Throw it away.

758
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,375
I dug it out of the trash can.

759
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:39,000
- By the way, Sun.
- Yes?

760
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:42,500
Did you see the
"Sotus hazing is over" campaign?

761
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,208
Yes.

762
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:46,541
Turns out it's a landslide for "Yes."

763
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,958
So there will be no more hazing next year.

764
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:56,208
Not so fast.

765
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:02,041
We voted, but the college
won't do anything about it.

766
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:06,208
Nothing will ever change.

767
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:57,875
Hi, guys! Welcome to the 17th
Faculty of Fine Arts Country Music Night.

768
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:03,041
Our theme tonight is
"Halloween Country Music."

769
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:09,916
The centerpiece will be a singing contest
with a horror theme.

770
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:17,375
The contestant who receives
the highest number of garlands wins,

771
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:22,041
while those who receive the fewest or none

772
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:25,708
will face epic humiliation
for the next four years.

773
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:32,583
Another not-to-be-missed event
is our faculty tradition,

774
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:36,500
the horror storytelling of ghost tales

775
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:39,958
to finish off the night.

776
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,125
Want one?

777
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,875
Is 35 baht okay?

778
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:52,916
I don't have change.

779
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:54,666
Forty baht.

780
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,000
Okay.

781
01:16:57,916 --> 01:16:59,000
Need a bag?

782
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:00,666
No.

783
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,583
Sure you don't want a bag?

784
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:08,916
Yes.

785
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:17,833
THE INVISIBLE SHRINE

786
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,250
Wan, what do you think?

787
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,666
Wan!

788
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:42,500
- Oh, it's good. I like it.
- Really?

789
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:46,416
Yes. It made me feel suffocated.

790
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,666
What?

791
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:52,916
I like the way you interpret the song
through your vocal style.

792
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,708
Your eyes,

793
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:58,375
your voice and even your posture.

794
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,791
I feel that you're genuinely suffocating.

795
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:02,916
But…

796
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:04,750
That's not what I'm doing.

797
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:07,750
- No?
- No.

798
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,916
Forget it then.

799
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,875
Let's talk about tonight, Mint.
What do we do?

800
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:15,083
Where shall we go?

801
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:18,500
You want somewhere loud or chill?
I feel like loud.

802
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:22,708
Mint, what do you say?

803
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,041
Mint.

804
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,750
What's wrong? Are you seeing ghosts?

805
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,541
Shit!

806
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:38,333
Shit!

807
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:42,458
Damn it!

808
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:44,333
Oh, Gina!

809
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:45,541
Wan!

810
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:48,291
You look repulsive. Want to stand out?

811
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:53,333
Don't talk to me like that.
You should apologize to me.

812
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:56,875
Gina, you haven't gone on stage yet.

813
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,875
How come you have a garland?

814
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,083
Someone gave it to me.

815
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:03,083
All the singers have some.

816
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,833
Buy one, get one free.

817
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:09,625
Take it. Buy one, get one free.
We want to sell out.

818
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,041
We won't leave until it's sold out.

819
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:13,625
SOLD OUT

820
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,416
Tell you what. I'll go grab a bite.

821
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:19,791
I'll get you a garland.

822
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,541
Really?

823
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,958
Yes, I'll try but I can't promise.

824
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:26,166
Thank you.

825
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:31,250
You're the best.
I will forever be grateful. Amen.

826
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,125
Liar.

827
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,250
I'm leaving.

828
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:40,000
Harley, come drink with us.

829
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,666
Drink up.

830
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,791
I don't drink.

831
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:45,833
- Or I'll haze you.
- Drink up.

832
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,000
- Come on.
- No.

833
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,750
- Drink up! Asshole!
- Drink up!

834
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,083
- I told you no!
- Hey!

835
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,458
What the heck, asshole?

836
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,791
Asshole.

837
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:01,041
Harley, if you're such a killjoy,
buzz off. Go!

838
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,750
Take a hike!

839
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,458
- Go!
- Go!

840
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,458
Go!

841
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:06,666
I said go!

842
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,750
Dickhead.

843
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:29,250
Even an ugly ghost has a garland.

844
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:31,291
And him.

845
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,833
Gina's got more.

846
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,000
I'm not the only one.

847
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:44,041
Nava.

848
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,833
This is for you.

849
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,333
Oh, well…

850
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,791
Thank you, but I'm allergic to pollen.

851
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,625
- Just put it right here.
- Sure.

852
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:04,000
- Let's take a selfie.
- Sure.

853
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:06,833
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

854
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:08,791
Where the hell is Wan?

855
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,041
Is there any garland vendor nearby?

856
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,291
No, there isn't.

857
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,625
- How much?
- Eighty baht.

858
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,791
Wan, have you got a garland?

859
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:30,208
I'm looking, okay?
It's late. Where to find one?

860
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:34,208
Not my problem, just find one.
Steal one if you have to.

861
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:37,083
But I need garlands. Understand?

862
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:39,708
Number six, stand by.

863
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,375
I'm next.

864
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:45,208
I need garlands. Understand? Bye.

865
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,375
Bitchy. I'm not your hubby.

866
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,500
Where can I find one?

867
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,500
These fangs will be the death of me.

868
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:16,208
Excuse me.

869
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:20,750
Do you know
where I can buy garlands nearby?

870
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,125
Thank you.

871
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,708
Hey, I don't think…

872
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,333
That dude was messing with me.

873
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,125
Not a garland from a shrine.

874
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:20,666
I'M UP NEXT! CHOP CHOP!

875
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,000
She won't stop.

876
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:42,875
Please.

877
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,250
Consider it a swap.

878
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,916
Shit! What's going on?

879
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:02,125
Please.

880
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,541
I'm offering you all of this in exchange.

881
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:15,291
All of it for one garland. A real bargain.

882
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:25,958
I see.

883
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,458
You like the cup congee.

884
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:45,208
Thank you.

885
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:06,291
Mint, your hero's back.

886
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Mint!

887
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:27,916
Mint, are you okay?

888
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:30,041
Clean this up.

889
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,833
Almost killed someone.

890
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,791
- Are you okay?
- Mint.

891
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:34,958
I'm okay.

892
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:40,166
Shit! What happened to my voice?

893
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,458
Forget about your voice.

894
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:45,708
Did you see a grandma ghost
trying to strangle you?

895
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:49,333
Wan.

896
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,041
Shit!

897
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,416
Wan.

898
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:59,458
Where did you get the garland?

899
01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:09,583
I took it from a Grandpa-Grandma shrine.

900
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:16,041
When there is a misplaced object,

901
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,250
it can bring about a disaster.

902
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:24,208
Dickhead!
How could you steal from a shrine?

903
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:29,291
I thought I made a deal with them.

904
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,791
Listen to my voice.

905
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,625
It means you had no deal.

906
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,875
Where's the shrine? Take me there.

907
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:43,416
Nearby.

908
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:50,125
They say a red shrine
has been spotted at various locations.

909
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:56,541
Sometimes at the bus stop,
or at the footbridge.

910
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:59,208
That's the shrine.

911
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,125
At the pond outside the science faculty.
Students often see something at night.

912
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:10,833
The sixth floor hallway of the building.

913
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,500
The restroom at the painting faculty.

914
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:16,708
And

915
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:20,875
in the hall we are all in now.

916
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:24,416
People who have seen the shrine,

917
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,500
are the ones who don't know
about its secret.

918
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:34,833
It means those who have seen it
and are now hearing this story,

919
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:40,291
they will never see it again.

920
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:41,958
Shit.

921
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,750
That's why it's called…

922
01:28:47,041 --> 01:28:48,208
"The Invisible Shrine."

923
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:02,208
Where is it?

924
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:07,291
Maybe you saw The Invisible Shrine.

925
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:12,000
It was right here where I'm standing.

926
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:14,000
Right in this spot.

927
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,250
- Where?
- Here.

928
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:18,541
PRAYER OF CONTRITION

929
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,583
I humbly beg Lord Buddha and his disciples

930
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:29,208
for forgiveness, with my pristine soul…

931
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:32,375
Wan, stop! I'm reciting a prayer.

932
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:40,083
I humbly beg Lord Buddha and his disciples

933
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,958
for forgiveness, with my pristine soul…

934
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:03,708
I'm still croaking.

935
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:06,166
I won't be able to sing again.

936
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,000
Mint, don't freak out.

937
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:14,250
Let's check out the locations
where Peck said people have spotted it.

938
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:19,416
And? We already heard the story
so we can't see it.

939
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,583
Then we'll find someone who can.

940
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,250
Asshole! Like who?

941
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,958
The whole faculty heard the story.

942
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,166
Mint, was Harley in the hall?

943
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,458
No, he got kicked out.

944
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:00,250
Come here.

945
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:01,958
What?

946
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:03,916
Harley.

947
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:06,916
Do you see anything here?

948
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,625
Yes.

949
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:19,625
What do you see?

950
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,833
I see you standing here.

951
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:27,375
Let's try again.

952
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:34,208
Other than me, what do you see here?

953
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:40,833
The ground, the leaves, the tree.

954
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,166
If I look closer, I might see bugs too.

955
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,000
Are you winding me up?

956
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:48,166
Wan!

957
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:55,750
Harley, have you heard
our faculty's ghost story?

958
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,416
What's with your voice?

959
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,208
Forget about that. Just answer me.

960
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:04,625
No. I'm not interested
in unscientific ghost tales.

961
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:11,750
Right. Can you come with us now?

962
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,083
We need your help.

963
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:19,833
The faculty is having
a ghost hunting game.

964
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:23,833
Simple activity. We have to form a team

965
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:25,916
and try to find

966
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,916
a shrine hidden in this building.

967
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:31,250
The team that finds it wins.

968
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,500
So, you…

969
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,875
want me on your team?

970
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:40,333
You bet.

971
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:43,375
I want only the best on my team.

972
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:46,666
You seem like a resourceful guy.

973
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:50,833
And Mint will get over the mishap
in the contest if we win.

974
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:52,083
So simple.

975
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,750
You look for the shrine and let us know.
That's all.

976
01:32:56,833 --> 01:33:00,333
What shrine are we looking for?
House spirits or ancestral ghosts?

977
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:01,458
What are those?

978
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:06,750
House spirits are sacred beings.

979
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:10,416
Ancestral ghosts
are Grandpa-Grandma ghosts.

980
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:14,541
They're the most powerful,
judging from the position of the shrine.

981
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:20,000
A spirit house stands on one pillar.

982
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,416
While a Grandpa-Grandma shrine
has four to six pillars.

983
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:25,875
Got it?

984
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:29,541
What?

985
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:31,375
THE INVISIBLE SHRINE

986
01:33:35,333 --> 01:33:36,416
Hey!

987
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,958
Are you in or not?

988
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:46,916
Look at me. A man-to-man promise.

989
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,333
Don't look away.

990
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:52,458
Are you in?

991
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:57,875
That's my man.

992
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:00,333
- Mint, follow us.
- Okay.

993
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:19,541
Shit!

994
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:20,625
What?

995
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,166
Mint, throw that ghastly thing away.
It scares me.

996
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,041
It's expensive.

997
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:29,375
I'll buy you another one later.

998
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,083
Why did you open it?

999
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,125
For the traditional dancers.

1000
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:49,416
What dancers? I don't see anyone.

1001
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:52,625
There. They're coming towards us.

1002
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:59,416
What are you doing? Wait for them.

1003
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:01,750
Please hurry.

1004
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:03,833
Close it.

1005
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:10,208
Wan, don't be so mean.

1006
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:14,041
- Stop it.
- Knucklehead!

1007
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,750
Traditional dancers
in the middle of the night?

1008
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:17,916
Do the math!

1009
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,375
Halloween costume night.

1010
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:20,625
He's right.

1011
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:21,708
- Harley.
- No.

1012
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,708
Mint, help me.

1013
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:30,250
Harley, remove your hand.

1014
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,000
What did you do, Wan?

1015
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:40,958
Which floor?

1016
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,333
Oh.

1017
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:53,958
They're not saying.

1018
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,041
Ask them nicely.

1019
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:02,958
Wow, a synchronized head turn to Wan.
Impressive.

1020
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,208
You don't need to narrate everything.

1021
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:11,916
Your headdress flower is a bit skewed.

1022
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:15,583
You might want to give it a tweak.

1023
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,583
Shush.

1024
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,833
Mind your own business.

1025
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:24,041
Mind your own business.

1026
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,791
Wan.

1027
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:30,416
- Wan.
- What?

1028
01:36:40,291 --> 01:36:41,708
I'm out of here!

1029
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:44,750
What's wrong with him?

1030
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:48,500
Get your ass up and come!

1031
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:49,916
- Come on!
- Wan!

1032
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,833
Damn it!

1033
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:56,708
Wan!

1034
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,500
Shit!

1035
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:01,416
Help me, Wan!

1036
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,500
Mint!

1037
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:06,125
Ouch! My hair!
Help me! My head is coming off!

1038
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:08,041
- Shit! My leg is coming off!
- Help!

1039
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:10,666
- Mint!
- Harley, I can't hold it anymore!

1040
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:14,916
Me or her. Just pick one! Come on!

1041
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:16,666
- It hurts.
- Okay.

1042
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:19,625
- Asshole!
- Ouch! My head!

1043
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,958
Harley, asshole!

1044
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,125
Mint!

1045
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:27,916
My hair!

1046
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,916
Is this really the game, Mint?

1047
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,000
Forget it. Let's find Wan.

1048
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,041
Wan.

1049
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:48,416
Why are you stopping? Let's go.

1050
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:50,333
You don't see them?

1051
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:56,875
See what?

1052
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:03,958
Tell me what joke you're playing.

1053
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,250
No. Nothing.

1054
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:08,083
Let's go.

1055
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:10,041
You're working with them, no?

1056
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:15,333
No, I'm not.

1057
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:18,666
Mint.

1058
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,833
I thought you were different.

1059
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:26,625
Harley, come back. Harley!

1060
01:38:29,166 --> 01:38:32,083
Asshole, not here!

1061
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:35,916
Help me!

1062
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,125
Shit, there's only one way.

1063
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,833
Please let me through.

1064
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:54,916
Have I passed by them?

1065
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:01,458
Sure.

1066
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:03,000
Wan!

1067
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:04,458
Wan!

1068
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:06,875
Wan, nitwit!

1069
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,791
Wan!

1070
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:29,500
PAINTING FACULTY

1071
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:14,875
Holy shit.

1072
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:18,416
Shit!

1073
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,333
Shit!

1074
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:21,500
Shit!

1075
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:22,583
Shit!

1076
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:25,083
That's a one-two-three!

1077
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:30,291
Here it comes.

1078
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:33,041
Wan!

1079
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:35,375
Wan.

1080
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,791
It's me, Wan!

1081
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:39,666
It's me!

1082
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:40,791
Mint!

1083
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:48,083
Bitch, you almost made me shit my pants.

1084
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:50,916
You're in the toilet.
No need to shit your pants.

1085
01:41:52,291 --> 01:41:53,916
There's a ghost in here.

1086
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:55,791
In here?

1087
01:41:56,750 --> 01:42:00,875
What now? Mint, we need to run.
Come on, Mint.

1088
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,125
I don't want to do this anymore.

1089
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,708
Get up! Run! Go!

1090
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:09,958
Go!

1091
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:14,666
Shit! Mint, do something!

1092
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:20,416
Shit! That was close.

1093
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:25,291
The shrine is there.

1094
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:27,666
Where?

1095
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:35,000
I humbly beg Lord Buddha and his disciples
for forgiveness, with my pristine soul…

1096
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:36,541
Shit!

1097
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:37,750
What the fuck!

1098
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:43,666
What?

1099
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:46,666
What now? Let's run!

1100
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:51,208
What? The shrine is gone.

1101
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:53,000
Shit!

1102
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:57,625
- Let's run! Run! Harley!
- Run?

1103
01:42:58,375 --> 01:43:00,041
- Holy shit.
- What?

1104
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:01,666
What is it?

1105
01:43:03,458 --> 01:43:05,416
Harley, what is it?

1106
01:43:06,125 --> 01:43:07,250
What is it?

1107
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:10,291
What do you see?

1108
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,708
Harley, what's it?

1109
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:15,583
- Tell us what it is.
- What is it?

1110
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:18,416
We're surrounded.

1111
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:30,916
Surrounded? By who?
Shit! Let's get out of here.

1112
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,041
Watch out!

1113
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,666
Watch out for what?

1114
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:37,458
Huh?

1115
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:40,875
There was something unusual
when we saw the shrine.

1116
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:44,875
The Grandpa and Grandma figures
are on the porch.

1117
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,333
Something else is in control?

1118
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:54,875
The ghosts took us to the shrine
but it keeps vanishing.

1119
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:58,000
Or something doesn't want us
to see the shrine.

1120
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:05,875
Why do they want to hurt us?

1121
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,083
Right.

1122
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:13,250
They may not want to hurt us.

1123
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,708
They seem to need help.

1124
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:19,208
Need help?

1125
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,625
How?

1126
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:23,750
Why did they keep reappearing,

1127
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:26,541
throwing stuff around
and messing up her voice?

1128
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,250
That's not the way to ask for my help.

1129
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,208
Oh, no.

1130
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,750
Did a ghost just smack my head?

1131
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:44,125
They won't let us waltz out.

1132
01:44:44,916 --> 01:44:46,208
We have to help them.

1133
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:50,750
We have to find the shrine
and get rid of whatever is inside.

1134
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,875
What to do?
The shrine keeps vanishing from us.

1135
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:10,041
Mint, a ghost smacked my head.

1136
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:11,708
What's he doing?

1137
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:17,083
Take us to the shrine.
Do whatever you want to Wan.

1138
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,750
What are you saying?
I have a bad feeling about this.

1139
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:25,958
Fuck!

1140
01:45:26,791 --> 01:45:27,875
Wan!

1141
01:45:28,916 --> 01:45:30,750
- Why me?
- Wan!

1142
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,791
- Wan!
- Mint!

1143
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:34,625
Mint!

1144
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:45,375
Wait, Mint! Grandpa's using Wan
to lure the shrine out.

1145
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:49,750
Wait! Slow down!

1146
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:52,583
Whoa!

1147
01:45:59,625 --> 01:46:00,916
You follow him.

1148
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,291
I'll wait for the shrine
next to the building.

1149
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:05,750
Wait, Harley.

1150
01:46:11,833 --> 01:46:14,250
Mind my butt, please! Shit!

1151
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:20,083
Thank you.

1152
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:26,208
I'll fight you. Bring it on.

1153
01:46:37,208 --> 01:46:38,583
Where did it go?

1154
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,000
I shouldn't have dared him.

1155
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:54,375
Mint.

1156
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:56,458
Are you okay?

1157
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:58,125
- It was kind of fun.
- Fun?

1158
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:00,958
Fun, your ass! It hurts all over.

1159
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:04,541
My bones are probably snapped.
He kept dragging me.

1160
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:06,666
What do we do now?

1161
01:47:07,541 --> 01:47:10,500
I saw the shrine, but it vanished again.

1162
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:11,833
Yeah.

1163
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:13,750
It was still when I first saw it.

1164
01:47:14,458 --> 01:47:16,125
- It was still?
- Yes.

1165
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:20,875
After I took the garland,
it kept popping up everywhere.

1166
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:25,375
It's right there.

1167
01:47:29,208 --> 01:47:32,833
Maybe the garland is what placates it.

1168
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:35,250
Whatever. Just do it.

1169
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:55,833
Shit!

1170
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:57,833
Are you okay?

1171
01:47:57,916 --> 01:47:58,916
Harley.

1172
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,041
Shit!

1173
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:10,083
They say a red shrine
has been spotted at various locations…

1174
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,458
Mint, turn it off. Go!

1175
01:48:13,541 --> 01:48:14,541
You do it.

1176
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:16,833
I can't even get up. You go!

1177
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:21,541
It means those who have seen it
and now are hearing this story,

1178
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,083
they will never

1179
01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:29,583
- Mint!
- Mint!

1180
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:30,833
see it again.

1181
01:48:31,416 --> 01:48:33,375
That's why it's called…

1182
01:48:39,416 --> 01:48:40,625
"The Invisible Shrine."

1183
01:48:41,166 --> 01:48:42,416
The shrine doesn't exist?

1184
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,250
Shut your mouth.

1185
01:48:44,333 --> 01:48:46,333
Just put the garland on it. Go!

1186
01:49:25,416 --> 01:49:26,875
Mint.

1187
01:49:28,583 --> 01:49:30,500
Are you okay? Wait here.

1188
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,041
Wait here.

1189
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,791
What is it?

1190
01:49:47,791 --> 01:49:49,208
It's a sacrificial doll.

1191
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:52,166
This one is Khmer.

1192
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:55,958
In the past, bandits used it
to subdue guardian spirits.

1193
01:49:56,041 --> 01:49:57,500
How did it get in there?

1194
01:49:57,583 --> 01:49:58,791
Beats me.

1195
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:02,000
But you can't just place
this object anywhere.

1196
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:04,541
Shit.

1197
01:50:05,125 --> 01:50:09,333
Some idiot did it.
I'd kick their ass if I found out.

1198
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:16,125
We have to rearrange the figures.
Return the power to them.

1199
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:27,583
Done.

1200
01:50:29,833 --> 01:50:30,875
Shit!

1201
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,333
Thank you so much.

1202
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:16,041
They should thank you.

1203
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,458
I think they've just let us go.

1204
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:35,416
Really?

1205
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:42,333
What do we do with this doll?

1206
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:44,958
We have to handle it properly.

1207
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:47,750
The real troublemaker.

1208
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:54,291
Shit. We forgot about her.

1209
01:52:15,666 --> 01:52:17,375
Don't go where you don't belong.

1210
01:52:18,583 --> 01:52:21,875
Mint, if you want to join
a singing contest again,

1211
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:24,041
let me know beforehand.

1212
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:25,916
I will prepare the garlands for you.

1213
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:28,333
Someone wanted to give me one.

1214
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,291
But he came too late.

1215
01:52:40,583 --> 01:52:41,875
Is it still too late?

1216
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:54,416
Wait. Since when?

1217
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,750
You need a dad for your ghost-child.

1218
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,750
Shut up. You started it all.

1219
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:02,875
No. It was you!

1220
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:04,666
This shit happened because of you.

1221
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:08,833
If you weren't desperate for a garland,
I wouldn't have taken it from there.

1222
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:12,625
Shit.

1223
01:53:12,708 --> 01:53:14,625
I got smacked again, Mint!

1224
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,125
- Another one!
- That was me.

1225
01:53:19,666 --> 01:53:21,791
- You?
- Hey, don't fight.

1226
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:23,000
- Wan.
- You started it.

1227
01:53:23,125 --> 01:53:24,875
- Bring it on.
- Wan, calm down.

1228
01:53:37,208 --> 01:53:38,375
Mom!

1229
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:41,041
I found a doll.

1230
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:44,125
Where did you find it?

1231
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,833
You can't pick up random stuff.

1232
01:53:49,666 --> 01:53:50,791
Follow me.

1233
01:53:58,125 --> 01:53:59,583
Pay your respects.

1234
01:54:01,666 --> 01:54:03,500
Don't do it again, Harley.

1235
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:49,458
