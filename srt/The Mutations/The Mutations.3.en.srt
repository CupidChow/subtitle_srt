Chu.

5
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,600
Can you be honest with me now?

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,870
I really don't know her.

7
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,900
What I told you before

8
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,670
was all true.

9
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,350
I don't buy that.

10
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,630
She recognized you.

11
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,270
I saw it with my own eyes.

12
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,710
She called me by my surname,

13
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,560
not my first name.

14
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,190
Nonsense.

15
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,670
What's the difference?

16
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,390
If I'm right,

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,860
this girl has seen my younger brother before.

18
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,710
Your brother?

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,430
My twin brother.

20
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,670
He's also an Imperial Guard.

21
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,430
He went missing here two years ago.

[Lieutenant Chu Siyu]

23
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,270
The mission two years ago

24
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,560
was assigned to me.

25
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,150
But my brother went on it in my place.

26
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,510
Unfortunately…

27
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
Unfortunately,

28
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,850
you never get to see him again?

29
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,910
That year, soon after he went beyond Shanhai Pass,

30
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,140
Mr. Xiong Tingbi lost the war

31
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,300
and the whole Liaodong was in chaos.

32
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,770
The remnants of his army all escaped.

33
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,340
I found some soldiers

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,730
and asked about him.

35
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,220
They said he should've headed east

36
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,760
after leaving Shanhai Pass.

37
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,830
He was with two other Imperial Guards.

38
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,690
You mean

39
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,550
your brother met that girl?

40
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,310
It's just my guess.

41
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,790
After she wakes up,

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,140
I'll ask her about it.

43
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
On this island,

44
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,460
there's more than one enigma.

45
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,640
It's the Ming Army's arrow.

46
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,720
I found it in that village.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,010
It doesn't make sense.

48
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,030
I remember Xu Zongqi once said

49
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,220
no one in the Ming Army

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,490
is allowed to come to this island

51
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,140
without his permission.

52
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,170
He lied.

53
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,430
What should we do next?

54
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,880
Keep investigating.

55
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,630
The monster's leg

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
and this little girl

57
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,350
are both clues.

58
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,860
When we return to Ninghai Fortress,

59
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,190
I doubt Xu Zongqi can smooth it over again.

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,470
Chu.

61
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,340
Let me take that leg back.

62
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,159
There's too much at stake.

63
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,930
I'll keep it for now.

64
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,110
Chu.

65
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,600
Don't be silly.

66
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,340
If the rumor about monsters

67
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,590
spreads in Ningyuan,

68
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,790
Commander Sun's plan to fortify the fortress

69
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,150
will be affected.

70
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,290
This matter

71
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,780
concerns the whole Liaodong.

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,720
Do you understand?

73
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,830
Everything else doesn't matter.

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,390
For me,

75
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,590
what matters the most

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,070
is to find my brother.

77
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,100
Someone is coming.

78
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,870
It may be those men in black again.

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,080
Those men are mysterious.

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,590
Someone must've known about the monsters on the island.

81
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,990
So we have to look into it.

82
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,860
How about this?

83
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,300
Let's split up

84
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,330
so that they can't take down both of us at a time.

85
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,190
See you at Qingshikou.

86
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,750
Be careful.

87
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,100
Hey, do you have a boat?

88
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,630
Can't you hear me?

89
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,050
Sir.

90
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,500
Are you

91
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,820
leaving?

92
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,940
My superior is expecting me at Ninghai Fortress.

93
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,070
Where is that Imperial Guard?

94
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,390
He left before me.

95
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
I've been waiting for you here

96
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,960
since last night.

97
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,880
No one has left the island.

98
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,320
That must be tiring, Elder Qiu.

99
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,870
What?

100
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,720
You want to detain us?

101
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,789
Don't get me wrong.

102
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,070
You came from afar.

103
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,080
I haven't offered you hospitality.

104
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,750
I just want you two officers

105
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,950
to stay here for a few more days

106
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,870
to let me do my duty as a host.

107
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,750
Sir.

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,730
Forgive me.

109
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,870
This way, sir.

110
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,790
We can't save him.

111
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,630
There are too many of them.

112
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,600
Why is Elder Qiu taking Bo Yan?

113
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,060
They're afraid.

114
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,690
They're afraid what's happening on the island will get out.

115
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,060
Elder Qiu.

116
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,340
Why are you

117
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,050
holding me captive?

118
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,830
Sir, you've visited that village, haven't you?

119
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,110
Yes.

120
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,150
What did you see?

121
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,340
It's just a deserted village.

122
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,700
I didn't see anything.

123
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,030
Sir.

124
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,920
Stop playing dumb.

125
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,110
Elder Qiu.

126
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,340
Has it occurred to you

127
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,240
that if those at Ninghai Fortress send people here,

128
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,070
Ming's troops will get on this island?

129
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,430
The consequence can be disastrous.

130
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,980
Do you think this island has never seen troops before?

131
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,320
You idiot!

132
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,630
Listen.

133
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,140
I killed my way to where I am today.

134
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,500
I led troops in wartime.

135
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,680
Kill me if you dare.

136
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,030
Come on. Kill me.

137
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,230
Come on.

138
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,980
Don't get us wrong, sir.

139
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,070
We don't dare to hurt you.

140
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,920
But you

141
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,940
can't leave this island.

142
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,320
How long was I out?

143
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,050
You just fell asleep.

144
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,210
You seemed to be in a painful dream.

145
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,710
It's the first time you've got some sleep lately,

146
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,930
right?

147
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,540
What's your name?

148
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,590
Shen Cong.

149
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,070
Shen Cong.

150
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,740
Do you dream once you close your eyes?

151
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,000
How do you know?

152
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,350
It's the same for me.

153
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,110
What did you see in your dreams?

154
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,510
I saw him.

155
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,800
But I couldn't see him clearly.

156
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,410
Him?

157
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,360
There was no light.

158
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,200
Only shadows.

159
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,080
Endless shadows.

160
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,530
Did you dream of that too?

161
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,320
What's that?

162
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,700
You mean the pattern on my uniform?

163
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,020
It's a flying fish.

164
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,070
What is a flying fish?

165
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,750
The flying fish

166
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,340
is a very auspicious animal.

167
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,530
It can help us catch bad guys.

168
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,530
The man who looked like you

169
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,340
wore the same uniform.

170
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,110
The person you met

171
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,230
is my younger brother.

172
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,060
His name is Chu Siyu.

173
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,670
I'm looking for him.

174
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,030
Can you tell me

175
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,820
when and where

176
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,200
you saw him?

177
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,110
Two years ago,

178
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,700
my mom took him to see Wozhan.

179
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,780
Wozhan?

180
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,730
What is Wozhan?

181
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,790
We're all afraid of him.

182
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,810
Look.

183
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,490
Is Wozhan

184
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,640
the light these people are worshiping?

185
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,780
He's from the sky

186
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,410
and lives in the sea.

187
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,090
He doesn't like us.

188
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,830
You just said

189
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,990
your mom took my brother

190
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,860
to see Wozhan.

191
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,970
What does that mean?

192
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,380
I grew up here.

193
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,870
In the past,

194
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,790
my mom often brought me to this beach.

195
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,330
At that time,

196
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,110
there were many beautiful shells here.

197
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,150
I haven't seen her in a long time.

198
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,070
I miss her.

199
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,590
How about your father?

200
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,420
My father is a hero.

201
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,990
He's a border guard.

202
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,510
He protects us.

203
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,319
My brother is also a hero.

204
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,420
He's protecting me too.

205
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,020
I also miss him very much.

206
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,990
The boat is over there.

207
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,180
I can't remember

208
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,170
what happened two years ago.

209
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,150
But the place I dreamed of

210
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,050
again and again

211
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,260
is on the sea in the direction.

212
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,170
I think Wozhan and my mom

213
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,630
are both there.

214
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,500
I've always wanted to go there.

215
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,660
Can you take me there?

216
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,950
Cong.

217
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,110
Thank you for telling me these things.

218
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,150
But I can't put you at risk with me.

219
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,230
Wait for me here.

220
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,460
If I manage to come back,

221
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,770
I'll go to meet you.

222
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:33,890
Okay?

223
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,110
We'll wait for you here.

224
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,720
Get on the boat.

225
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,510
Get on the boat!

226
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,030
A monster is coming!

227
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,580
Get on the boat!

228
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,620
Get on the boat!

229
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,620
Leave!

230
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,760
Get on the boat!

231
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,350
Miss.

232
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:08,990
Get on the boat.

233
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,930
It won't hurt me.

234
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,060
Leave!

235
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,120
Get on the boat!

236
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,830
Miss.

237
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,580
Miss!

238
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,270
Shen Cong.

239
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,460
Shen Cong!

240
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,890
Chu.

241
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,740
Go!

242
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,530
Don't come back!

243
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,830
Go!

244
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,340
So beautiful.

245
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,700
So beautiful!

246
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
Since I came to Wumu Island,

247
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,290
weird things have happened one after another.

248
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,540
The people I've met are weird too.

249
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,010
He Liuhong.

250
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,430
I'm here.

251
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,470
I'm here.

252
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,150
You told me

253
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,110
there are monsters everywhere on this island.

254
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,230
Yes.

255
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,270
Monsters are everywhere.

256
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,390
Then tell me

257
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,790
where those monsters come from?

258
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,030
Monsters…

259
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,950
Monster…

260
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,230
Monsters are everywhere.

261
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,920
Everywhere.

262
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,250
Miss.

263
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,610
He Liuhong.

264
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,100
Why do you keep following me?

265
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,980
Are you really crazy or just pretending to be crazy?

266
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,560
I am.

267
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,860
Because I'm a hero.

268
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,310
Answer me!

269
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,900
I want to go home.

270
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,110
I want to go home.

271
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,630
I want to go home.

272
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,590
I want to go home.

273
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,270
I want to go home.

274
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,560
I want to go home.

275
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,730
So beautiful.

276
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,780
So big!

277
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,400
Thank you for saving us.

278
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,790
Why are you on the sea?

279
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,900
My brother and I are from Wumu Island.

280
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,560
We got lost because of the fog.

281
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,990
You're from Wumu Island?

282
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,630
I'm the captain of the Black Sea Dragon.

283
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,750
My name is Angelica.

284
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,940
By the etiquette of Ming,

285
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,940
you should call me Ms. An.

286
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,770
[Captain Angelica]

287
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,650
Ms. An.

288
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,130
Hurry up!

289
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,630
Captain, we're ready.

290
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,930
Let's go!

291
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,950
Let's go.

292
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,630
Keep moving. Keep moving.

293
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,470
Reinforce the shelf.

294
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,390
Keep up.

295
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,020
Close all the doors and windows.

296
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,310
Eunuch Yang.

297
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,030
The snow is heavy.

298
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,660
Why have you come out?

299
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,940
A friend of mine is coming.

300
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,650
Report.

301
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,160
Sir, a group of people have come ashore.

302
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,870
Who are they?

303
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,820
They're Portuguese.

304
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,250
They came with a huge warship.

305
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,030
They're friends who came to deliver weapons.

306
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,460
Ningyuan

307
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,330
needs firearms.

308
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,910
The last time I saw you,

309
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,480
you were a little girl.

310
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,340
You're the captain now?

311
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,590
Angelica,

312
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,300
you've changed a lot.

313
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,300
You haven't changed a bit, Eunuch Yang.

314
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,350
You still look sharp.

315
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,030
Eunuch Yang, your friend

316
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,840
speaks fluent Chinese.

317
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,250
Many Chinese live in Luzon.

318
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,400
I learned it there.

319
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,590
There's more on the ship.

320
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,640
Good.

321
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,430
My crew saved two men on the sea.

322
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,180
They're Chinese from Wumu Island.

323
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,170
One of them is an Imperial Guard.

324
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,290
Chu Sijing?

325
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,680
Take him down.

326
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,060
What's going on?

327
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,620
Nothing serious.

328
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,590
The snow is heavy.

329
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,860
This is no place for conversations.

330
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,640
Let's talk inside.

331
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,530
Please.

332
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,040
Mr. Lei.

333
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,390
What is this all about?

334
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,670
We've checked it with the Imperial Guards at Shanhai Pass.

335
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,830
The Investigation Bureau

336
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,550
has never sent anyone here to investigate the plague.

337
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,570
You sneaked out on your own.

338
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Mr. Chu.

339
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,720
November the 5th.

340
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,640
To my surprise, I've really seen monsters on the island.

341
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,130
There's more than one of them.

342
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,130
At this time, I ran into a Portuguese warship.

343
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,610
Ms. An,

344
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,820
what brought her

345
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,750
to Ninghai Fortress?

346
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,750
Sir, save your energy.

347
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,000
Wait, buddy.

348
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,150
Look.

349
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,390
You put it so far away. How can I reach it?

350
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,470
Besides,

351
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm a military officer of Ming.

352
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,790
Starving me to death

353
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,480
could have serious consequences.

354
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,910
Thank you.

355
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,830
Wait.

356
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,000
Wait.

357
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,730
Buddy.

358
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,160
Are you stupid?

359
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,450
You put it closer

360
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,500
but I still can't reach it.

361
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,770
He's such a…

362
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,430
Sir, you have good taste in wine.

363
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,020
I've never tasted wine

364
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,760
so rich and smooth before.

365
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,400
I brought it from Portugal for you.

366
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,420
Thank you, Ms. An.

367
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,140
When can we set off?

368
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,450
Tomorrow.

369
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,100
However,

370
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,900
this matter must be kept quiet.

371
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,080
After it's done,

372
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,840
please leave Ming immediately.

373
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,380
Don't worry.

374
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,470
Once it's done,

375
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,100
you'll have 100 hand cannons

376
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,160
and ten cannons.

377
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,120
We've made an agreement by letter

378
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,240
that I'll have a guide on the island.

379
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,320
Where is my guide?

380
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,220
I haven't decided

381
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,910
who's the best person for that job.

382
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,750
I'll tell you when I decide.

383
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,990
Be quick.

384
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,780
Get up.

385
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,490
Move.

386
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,990
You left the Capital without permission

387
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,830
and forged a warrant to steal military information.

388
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,590
Mr. Chu.

389
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,090
How do you plead?

390
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,080
Steal military information?

391
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,790
Mr. Lei, you're making wild accusations.

392
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,150
No matter what I did wrong,

393
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,910
I should be judged by the Investigation Bureau,

394
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,310
not by you guys.

395
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,220
Chu Sijing.

396
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,310
Why did you insist on going to Wumu Island?

397
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,570
You two care so much about Wumu Island.

398
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,480
Is there a secret about that place?

399
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,220
You both know

400
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
what's going on on that island.

401
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,150
You're a criminal. How dare you talk to us like that?

402
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,280
Kill him!

403
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,590
You two can't wait to kill me.

404
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,320
Is it just because I went to Wumu Island?

405
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,370
Stop.

406
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,240
Let him go.

407
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,370
Eunuch Yang.

408
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,050
I need to ask him something.

409
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,360
Let me ask my questions first.

410
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,360
What is there to ask?

411
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,170
Lei Sui.

412
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,920
Do as Eunuch Yang says.

413
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,630
You forged a warrant

414
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,820
to go beyond Shanhai Pass

415
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,690
and spread rumors

416
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,860
to demoralize the soldiers.

417
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,760
These are serious crimes.

418
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,440
Mr. Chu.

419
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,870
You came here against all odds.

420
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,050
There must be a reason.

421
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,390
Is it for your brother?

422
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,639
After my father passed away,

423
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,080
my family fell on hard times.

424
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,679
I and my brother could only rely on each other.

425
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,960
He went beyond Shanhai Pass on a mission.

426
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,920
I don't know if he's still alive.

427
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,030
Of course I have to find him.

428
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,000
Your brother went beyond Shanhai Pass

429
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,570
in your place.

430
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,480
And now you're risking your life

431
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,159
to find him.

432
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,750
I'm so touched.

433
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,290
Have you saved me

434
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,550
just to mock me?

435
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,940
I have a job for you.

436
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
If you finish it,

437
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,440
I'll keep you alive.

438
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,760
Are you familiar

439
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,600
with the terrain of Wumu Island?

440
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,380
I remember what's around the shore.

441
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,790
There are too many trees on the island.

442
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,110
I don't know the terrain there.

443
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,820
Okay.

444
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,440
Tomorrow,

445
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,080
you'll go to the island with those Portuguese.

446
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,350
Do what the captain says.

447
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,030
Portuguese?

448
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,230
Why are they going to the island?

449
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,510
Just do your job.

450
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,030
After going ashore,

451
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,230
stay close to the captain.

452
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,590
Keep in mind everyone she meets

453
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,910
and everything she says.

454
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,590
When they leave the island,

455
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,710
you'll leave with them

456
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,600
and come back to see me.

457
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,290
This is your only chance to stay alive.

458
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,770
Don't mess it up.

459
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
One more thing.

460
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,620
You're looking for your brother, aren't you?

461
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,070
Two years ago,

462
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,110
your brother

463
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,600
was seen with Major Shen Rang.

464
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Later,

465
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,270
both of them disappeared.

466
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,490
Naturally,

467
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,240
we sent people out to look for him.

468
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,490
However,

469
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,070
he was nowhere to be found.

470
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,710
So

471
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,250
take my advice.

472
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,100
Stop looking.

473
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,790
Chu.

474
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,470
Go!

475
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,290
Don't come back.

476
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,510
Lieutenant Chu.

477
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,880
Have you arranged your father's funeral?

478
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,940
Yes.

479
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,740
Either you or your brother will inherit your father's title

480
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,100
to become a captain.

481
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,390
I summoned you here

482
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,070
for something tricky.

483
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,390
We want you to go north,

484
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,600
beyond Shanhai Pass,

485
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,970
to investigate a strange case.

486
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,020
Go north?

487
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,240
Siyu.

488
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,210
Are you going out?

489
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,150
The mission to go north,

490
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,110
I'll go on it.

491
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,050
No.

492
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,890
It's my mission.

493
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:17,650
Brother.

494
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,270
I wouldn't be going if it wasn't your mission.

495
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,970
If the higher-ups blame you for the delay,

496
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,310
you may face severe punishment.

497
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,470
Alright, Brother.

498
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,420
Focus on recuperating.

499
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,620
Wait for me to come back.

500
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,280
Chu Siyu.

501
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,210
Do you know what kind of mission it is?

502
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,310
The situation beyond Shanhai Pass is unstable.

503
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,490
After you go out,

504
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,560
there's no telling if you can come back.

505
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,710
All the more reason for me to go.

506
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,190
Lieutenant Colonel.

507
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,570
My father is gone.

508
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,980
My brother is the only family I have.

509
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,980
The lieutenant colonel is here.

510
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,080
Chu Sijing.

511
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,170
Lieutenant Colonel, welcome.

512
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,550
Please have a seat.

513
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,120
Okay.

514
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,270
I'm here today

515
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,700
for two things.

516
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,160
The first thing is about the position of captain.

517
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,790
The higher-ups have decided

518
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,290
to give that position

519
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,480
to you.

520
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,250
Thank you, sir.

521
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,970
The second thing

522
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,780
is about Chu Siyu.

523
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,960
Your brother

524
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,880
is missing.

525
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,470
I need to find him.

526
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,020
You need a warrant to go north now.

527
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,590
Soldiers at Shanhai Pass

528
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,330
are already searching for him.

529
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,910
I believe they'll get a clue soon.

530
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,230
Mr. Chu.

531
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,870
Mr. Chu.

532
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,670
What's it?

533
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,860
You've been looking for your brother for two years.

534
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,960
There's finally a clue.

535
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,030
For the past two years,

536
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,410
those at Shanhai Pass have believed he's dead.

537
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,790
But a few days ago,

538
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,060
they found a letter left by your brother.

539
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,590
Siyu, where are you?
