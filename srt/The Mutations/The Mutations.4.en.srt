4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,860
Eunuch Yang.

5
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,110
Where is Chu Sijing?

6
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,750
Eunuch Yang.

7
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,870
He committed a crime in Ninghai Fortress.

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,470
Naturally, his punishment

9
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,140
is up to you.

10
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,300
But you could have

11
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,470
at least told us about your arrangements.

12
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,670
Otherwise, we won't be able to explain

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,340
if Commander Sun asks.

14
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,590
He

15
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,030
went back to Wumu Island.

16
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,050
What?

17
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,100
Eunuch Yang,

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,050
Chu Sijing is not a good person.

19
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,680
You can't trust him.

20
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,390
What about you, Mr. Xu?

21
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,000
Hurry up.

22
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,630
Get on the boat!

23
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,950
It won't hurt me.

24
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,990
Leave now!

25
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,930
Get on the boat!

26
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,830
Shen Cong!

27
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,630
Ms. An.

28
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,260
Mr. Yang sent you as my guide.

29
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm sure you

30
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,450
know Wumu Island very well.

31
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,630
My duty

32
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,300
is to guide you to the island.

33
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,740
But I don't know why you want to go there.

34
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,190
I will do my best to be a good guide.

35
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,040
But if I don't know why you're visiting the island,

36
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,390
how will I serve you well?

37
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,900
Mr. Chu, you have been to Wumu Island.

38
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,740
I'm sure you must have seen some unusual things.

39
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,860
Ms. An.

40
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,420
Are you going after the monster on the island?

41
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,790
We both know that

42
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,490
the dragon

43
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,720
is a myth people made up.

44
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,210
But some people still worship it.

45
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,790
We Portuguese are different.

46
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,390
We will catch it

47
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,710
and achieve our own glory.

48
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,030
I didn't expect that

49
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,000
you came all this way

50
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,310
to a small island of Ming

51
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,240
for a myth.

52
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,320
That's not a myth.

53
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,310
It's right here.

54
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,230
Monster!

55
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,610
One year ago,

56
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,430
the Klaf, a Portuguese ship, came here before.

57
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,760
Among all the members onboard,

58
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,720
only two sailors survived.

59
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,530
One became crazy

60
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,700
and the other died from his injuries.

61
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,510
Before he died, he mentioned

62
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,300
meeting a never-before-seen monster

63
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,290
in the island's vicinity.

64
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,549
The captain of the Klaf

65
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,350
was my brother.

66
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,600
So you're doing it for revenge.

67
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,210
That's not all.

68
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,690
No matter where a Portuguese fleet goes,

69
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,720
even if there's something unknown,

70
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,170
we will conquer it and understand it.

71
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,030
Mr. Chu, don't you want to know

72
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,890
how this monster came about?

73
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,890
I've told the truth.

74
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,280
I hope you don't keep anything from me.

75
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,890
I did see that monster.

76
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,150
I even fought it.

77
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,510
What's that sound?

78
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,390
Monster...

79
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,240
A monster!

80
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,500
Who is he?

81
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,470
He said he saw a monster too.

82
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,840
Back then, out of the 80 or so people,

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,400
only he survived.

84
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,870
Monster! Monster!

85
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,790
But he went crazy.

86
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,860
Monster! Monster!

87
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
I'm a hero!

88
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,480
Monster.

89
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,270
Why are you bringing along

90
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,150
a madman like him?

91
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,470
That's why I asked Mr. Yang for a guide.

92
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,710
Anyway, this island is foggy

93
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,290
and very dangerous.

94
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,420
Are you prepared, Ms. An?

95
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,350
I won't do anything unprepared.

96
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,440
What else do you know?

97
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,120
I only stayed on the island for a few days.

98
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,790
I don't know much.

99
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,050
I have a companion

100
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,200
called Bo Yan.

101
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,210
He stayed on the island.

102
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,390
Only when we get to the island

103
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,570
can we uncover the truth.

104
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,110
Monster! You're a monster!

105
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,380
On the sixth day of winter,

106
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,810
Angelica came to find the monster.

107
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,220
Why did Yang Zan send me here?

108
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,500
Where is Bo Yan?

109
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,000
I wonder if

110
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,700
Xu Zongqi and Lei Sui

111
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,540
know about matters on the island.

112
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,390
The hero has arrived! Come and welcome him!

113
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,430
The hero has arrived! Come and welcome him!

114
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,850
The hero has arrived! Come and welcome him!

115
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,270
The hero has arrived! Come and welcome him!

116
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,630
The hero has arrived! Come and welcome him!

117
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,040
The hero has arrived! Come and welcome him!

118
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,590
Follow Liuhong.

119
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,350
The hero has arrived!

120
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,590
Where did you see the monster?

121
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,320
I saw the monster twice on the island.

122
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,900
Both times, it was related to a little girl.

123
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,920
This is her bracelet.

124
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,250
This island is full of mysteries.

125
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,030
It's far more complicated than you think.

126
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,930
We must be more alert.

127
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,120
Monster! Monster!

128
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,310
Monster! It's coming!

129
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,640
It's coming.

130
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,910
It's coming!

131
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,950
The monster is here! It's right here!

132
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,310
Bird.

133
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,830
Bird.

134
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,640
There's a bird.

135
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,590
Don't make a fuss.

136
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,470
Monster!

137
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,590
Monster!

138
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,030
Sir, something is wrong at sea.

139
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,470
Someone heard

140
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,950
a strange sound coming from Wumu Island.

141
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,050
Have you informed Mr. Lei?

142
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,670
Mr. Lei is missing.

143
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,870
He's missing?

144
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,430
Did he leave any messages?

145
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,950
No.

146
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,760
Sir!

147
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,080
Sir!

148
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,900
The patient! The patient...

149
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,550
Something happened to him.

150
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,790
Where is he?

151
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,520
He disappeared.

152
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,660
I diagnosed him yesterday.

153
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,370
His pulse was abnormal and unheard of.

154
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,970
He kept mumbling to himself.

155
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,350
I leaned in to listen closely,

156
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,570
but all I heard was

157
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,290
"It's looking at us."

158
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,060
The cell door is locked.

159
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,440
There are no traces of tampering.

160
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,690
Did you hear any sound at all?

161
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,630
No.

162
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,110
I only noticed this strange disappearance

163
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,640
when I came to deliver the medicine.

164
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,330
Then, I immediately reported to you.

165
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,800
Be careful, Sir.

166
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,440
Don't tell anyone about this.

167
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,680
Yes.

168
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,940
You may leave.

169
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,060
Who did this?

170
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,540
This is an arrow from the military.

171
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,690
Someone is trying to stop us.

172
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,710
We're being targeted.

173
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,270
Kill them!

174
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,500
Let's go.

175
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,050
Let's catch up with the hunting dogs as soon as possible.

176
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,430
It's right here.

177
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,380
It's right here. It's nearby.

178
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,610
It's right here.

179
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,530
Catch up!

180
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,330
Antonio!

181
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,610
Antonio!

182
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,210
Antonio!

183
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,170
Antonio?

184
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,940
Who's there?

185
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,660
Who?

186
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,160
A monster?

187
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,560
I'm not sure.

188
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,780
We're being ambushed.

189
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,030
Keep quiet. It's here.

190
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,740
It's over there.

191
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,630
Sister.

192
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
My sister is here.

193
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,450
That's her?

194
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,630
Little girl.

195
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,090
Tell me.

196
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,690
Where is the monster?

197
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,000
I can protect you.

198
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,930
It's everywhere.

199
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,590
It's everywhere.

200
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,990
Tell me.

201
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,750
Where is the monster?

202
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,090
Tell me!

203
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,680
You should run.

204
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,780
Run!

205
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,320
Sister, let's go.

206
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,950
Sister, let's go.

207
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,120
It's here.

208
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,470
Capture it alive!

209
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,070
Chu!

210
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,410
Leave!

211
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,950
Don't come back!

212
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,900
Go!

213
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,910
Now!

214
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,710
Pull the net!

215
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,060
No!

216
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,310
No!

217
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,370
No!

218
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,060
No!

219
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,990
No!

220
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,550
No!

221
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,550
No!

222
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,590
No!

223
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,420
Sister.

224
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,090
Sister

225
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,600
Congratulations, Ms. An.

226
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,120
You caught the monster and achieved your goal.

227
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,710
I also fulfilled my promise.

228
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,960
But from now on,

229
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,360
I have to stay

230
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,830
to save someone.

231
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,910
You can stay.

232
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,080
But I want to take her away.

233
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:37,790
No.

234
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,740
Ms. An, don't you remember?

235
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,200
I said before that

236
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,540
this girl is very important to me.

237
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,640
She's also the only person who can help me.

238
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,870
Please understand, Ms. An.

239
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,860
She has an extraordinary relationship with the monster.

240
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,980
I'll take everything related to the monster.

241
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,770
Wait.

242
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,040
Ms. An.

243
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,260
This is Ming's territory.

244
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,150
If you take our islanders away without permission,

245
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,230
it is considered kidnapping.

246
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
If you hadn't saved my life,

247
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,650
I wouldn't be speaking nicely to you.

248
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,090
Don't push your luck.

249
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,780
Ms. An.

250
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,750
The monster you want has been caught.

251
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,750
Don't cause any more trouble.

252
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,510
Your hand cannon could kill me.

253
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,350
But once the hand cannon goes off,

254
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,210
it will likely attract more ambush.

255
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,190
I suggest

256
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,060
you'd better stop.

257
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,950
Birds.

258
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,010
Sister, birds.

259
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,450
So many birds.

260
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,790
Sister.

261
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,260
Birds.

262
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,280
So many birds.

263
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,250
Sister.

264
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,990
Birds.

265
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,310
Don't make any trouble. Let's go.

266
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,440
No! No!

267
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,440
No!

268
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,070
Do you want to die?

269
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,470
No.

270
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,690
They almost took you away too.

271
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,870
Let it go. Let it go. No.

272
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,430
No!

273
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,270
Shen Cong.

274
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,370
Why do you want to save such a monster?

275
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,030
A monster?

276
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,280
No. Not just one.

277
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,070
It's...

278
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,190
A whole bunch.

279
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:21,950
No...

280
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,630
They are everywhere.

281
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,720
Run!

282
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,150
Run! Monsters!

283
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,550
Monsters everywhere!

284
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,430
Save it, uncle.

285
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:27,890
Monster!

286
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,590
Save it, uncle.

287
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:30,830
Save it.

288
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,590
It's too dangerous here.

289
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,250
Come with me.

290
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,300
How many people are left?

291
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,350
We lost more than half our strength.

292
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,990
I'll take you home.

293
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,190
Where's the lunatic?

294
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
He's in the cabin. He hasn't come out.

295
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,460
Stop him!

296
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,430
Where is he?

297
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,950
He's gone.

298
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,670
Check the ship.

299
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,310
Okay.

300
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,240
Raise the anchor!

301
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,150
Check the ship.

302
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,060
Let me go back and save it.

303
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,830
You can save it.

304
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,010
I'm begging you.

305
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,570
Enough!

306
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,190
You kept mumbling nonsense.

307
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,330
If I hadn't dragged you along,

308
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,470
you would have been caught

309
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,490
with that monster.

310
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,950
Now I order you.

311
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,690
Shut up.

312
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,510
Follow me.

313
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,880
Please save it.

314
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,860
I want to save it!

315
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,370
Please let me save it.

316
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,230
It can't be taken away by others.

317
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,990
It's a monster.

318
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,660
Why must you save it?

319
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,380
It's not a monster.

320
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,550
It's my family.

321
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,270
Don't move.

322
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,910
He Liuhong.

323
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,800
Why are you on the island?

324
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,290
I thought you said I was no match for you.

325
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,350
That's all you've got?

326
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,880
Uncle Lei.

327
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,580
Uncle Lei.

328
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,700
Cong.

329
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,070
Step aside.

330
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,610
Uncle, he's a good man.

331
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,700
A good person?

332
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,890
He was the one who lured the Portuguese here.

333
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,340
He wants to harm Wumu Island.

334
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,860
He saved me.

335
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
He's really a good man.

336
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,480
Mr. Lei.

337
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,710
To be honest,

338
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,040
I came to the island this time

339
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,380
under Eunuch Yang's order.

340
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,960
If you don't believe me,

341
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
you can go back to Ninghai Fortress and ask him.

342
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,630
No matter who sent you,

343
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,760
the matters of the island

344
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,639
must not be known by outsiders.

345
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,340
Once you get on this island,

346
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,179
no one can leave.

347
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,020
The Portuguese ship has already left.

348
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,870
We can't hide this for long.

349
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,739
They can't leave.

350
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,540
Still kicking up a fuss?

351
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,310
