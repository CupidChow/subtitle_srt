4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
My compass isn't working.

5
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,830
We should have arrived.

6
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,170
You're here.

7
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,670
How lucky you are

8
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,750
to see the completion of the Blood Sacrifice.

9
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,190
Lord, Wozhan,

10
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,150
the followers are here.

11
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,760
Wozhan, Lord,

12
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,870
is finally appearing!

13
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,530
Come on.

14
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,290
Hurry up!

15
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,830
No trace at all.

16
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,630
It should be here.

17
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,470
It's okay.

18
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,510
Look.

19
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,830
I'm stepping on

20
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,950
the coral island.

21
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,470
It has never appeared above the water surface.

22
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,470
I asked the villagers of Wumu Island.

23
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,600
They said

24
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,480
there are no other islands

25
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,950
within hundred li radius of Wumu Island.

26
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,040
This coral island

27
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
must be related to that meteor.

28
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,070
Chu,

29
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,550
you're right.

30
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,260
The coral island under my feet

31
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,870
is a huge oceanic trench apart

32
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,740
from that meteorite.

33
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,390
If all these are connected,

34
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,270
that oceanic trench is the only entrance.

35
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,000
The sea is peaceful now.

36
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,909
I'll go down and seek the way.

37
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,270
A rope shake is a signal.

38
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,870
If the rope shakes three times,

39
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,580
go down with the rope.

40
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,830
If it shakes many times,

41
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,710
pull me up.

42
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,500
Chu! Pull him up!
Wait.

43
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,310
He's here.

44
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,510
Why am I finding it difficult to breathe?

45
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,620
What the hell is this place?

46
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,200
Siyu.

47
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,310
Chu.

48
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,800
Xiuchun Sword?

49
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,590
That's my brother's sword.

50
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,150
I told you my brother

51
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,380
is still alive.

52
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,430
Siyu.

53
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,950
Chu Siyu.

54
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,250
Chu Siyu!

55
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,970
Chu Siyu.

56
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,530
Wozhan.

57
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,410
Wozhan.

58
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,730
Come out!

59
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,800
Do you hear me?

60
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,510
Come out!

61
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,140
He's here. He's here.

62
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,630
Shen Yu? Shen Yu?

63
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,740
Shen Cong.

64
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,330
Chu!

65
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,670
Chu Sijing, stop moving forward.

66
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,880
Bo Yan.

67
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Angelica!

68
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,510
Brother.

69
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,130
Siyu.

70
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,220
You're still alive.

71
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,710
You're still alive.

72
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,530
I finally found you.

73
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,490
I've been looking for you.

74
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,060
I thought I would never see you again.

75
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,810
You feel very guilty.

76
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
Siyu.

77
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,090
I'm sorry.

78
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,360
You shouldn't have come here.

79
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,870
I wanted to be a captain.

80
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,190
I let you replace me.

81
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,290
It's my fault.

82
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,310
When I heard about your disappearance,

83
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,210
I couldn't sleep well at night.

84
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,970
I see you

85
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,290
in my every dream.

86
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,370
This time, it's finally not an illusion.

87
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,930
Of course not.

88
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,569
Although you can't distinguish

89
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,530
illusions and reality these few years,

90
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,020
what you see now

91
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,440
is real.

92
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,319
Siyu.

93
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,589
Let's go back.

94
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,880
Okay?

95
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,110
Tell me

96
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,960
How can we get out of here?

97
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,660
We can't.

98
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,510
I brought you here.

99
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,490
I'm trying

100
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,680
talk to you in your language.

101
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,590
You're not Siyu.

102
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,370
Who are you?

103
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,120
You can't understand my existence.

104
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,990
Monster.

105
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,090
Demon.

106
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
Chimei Wangliang.

107
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,000
Or, Wozhan.

108
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,750
That's how you call me.

109
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,080
I don't care at all.

110
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,590
Brother, don't talk to him.

111
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,440
He's trying to confuse you.

112
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,640
What did you do to my brother?

113
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,240
Your brother

114
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,780
is dead.

115
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,650
But his consciousness

116
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,610
integrated with me.

117
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,130
Because you're twins,

118
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,820
so only you can see me.

119
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,520
Watch out!

120
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,290
What are you trying to do?

121
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,610
We have no feuds.

122
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,530
Why did you kill him?

123
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,850
You monster!

124
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,010
What are you here

125
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,890
for?

126
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,330
Then why do you humans

127
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,820
keep fighting each other?

128
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,720
It's just for the more territory

129
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,370
and more people.

130
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,960
That's what I want too.

131
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,690
Bull crap.

132
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,450
Do you know

133
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,190
how many people

134
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,360
died because of you?

135
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,920
Isn't the survival of the fittest

136
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,370
an unchanging rule since ancient times?

137
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,290
What I brought you

138
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,850
is more powerful power.

139
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
And they

140
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,040
are just losers who are unable

141
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,810
to control my power.

142
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,000
Except you and Shen Cong,

143
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,330
you won't become my unconscious beasts.

144
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,130
Submit to me,

145
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,690
and I can help you surpass life and death.

146
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,010
Surpass life and death.

147
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,490
You're just making us turn into monsters

148
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,890
with contaminated seafood,

149
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,170
manipulating us as puppets.

150
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,930
Shen Cong.

151
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
Shen Rang.

152
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,290
It's all you.

153
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,090
You used He Zijiao

154
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,070
to attract Su Muran and the villagers,

155
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,480
and used methods we don't know

156
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,600
to turn men into monsters.

157
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,200
You've been controlling and using Shen Cong.

158
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,150
You deserve to die.

159
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,400
When I came here today

160
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,230
I didn't think of going back alive.

161
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,200
No matter what tricks you still have,

162
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,420
just use it.

163
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,080
We will pay with our lives.

164
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,910
I...

165
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,260
Bo Yan.

166
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,620
Shen Rang.

167
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,790
Angelica.

168
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,880
All of us.

169
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,030
Shen Cong.

170
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,500
Shen Cong!

171
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,930
Wake up!

172
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
Shen Cong!

173
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,460
Wake up, Shen Cong!

174
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,520
You are as stubborn as your brother.

175
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,010
I've crossed the dimension to get here.

176
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm in deep sleep under the sea.

177
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,840
I kept trying to merge with your bodies.

178
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,080
Because of your special body,

179
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,310
you were led here.

180
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,040
Shen Cong!

181
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,570
Wake up!

182
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
Wake up!

183
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,630
You...

184
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,990
You...

185
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,810
Shen Cong has escaped your control.

186
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,760
If I die,

187
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,270
no one will ever convey your consciousness.

188
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,730
You will be alone

189
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,290
a the bottom of the sea

190
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,790
forever and ever.

191
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,030
I'll give you two choices.

192
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
One.

193
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,200
I stay here

194
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,770
to replace Shen Cong.

195
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,010
You let them go.

196
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,120
Two.

197
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,450
Now,

198
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,420
I will end all these.

199
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,120
Shen Cong!

200
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,050
Shen Cong!

201
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,120
Don't be afraid.

202
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,330
Don't be afraid.

203
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,690
I know I hurt you.

204
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,740
But I'm here to protect you.

205
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,200
Mr. Chu brought me here.

206
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
I don't know where he is now.

207
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
But please trust me.

208
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,150
I want to go home.

209
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
I'll take you home.

210
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,130
Don't be afraid.

211
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,750
I won't hurt you.

212
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,250
Don't be afraid.

213
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,640
M-Mr. Chu is back.

214
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,850
It's over.

215
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,100
You're very brave.

216
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,800
Cong.

217
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,080
It's fine now.

218
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,930
You can go home now.

219
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,890
You defeated Wozhan with your strong will.

220
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,240
It can't hurt you anymore.

221
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,040
Cong will follow you from now on.

222
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,940
Okay?

223
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,720
You go first.

224
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,090
I'll be right there.

225
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,020
Leave this place.

226
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,210
Bo Yan.

227
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,280
Are you badly hurt?

228
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,750
I won't die.

229
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,570
Chu.

230
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Where have you been?

231
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,370
I saw my brother.

232
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,280
It's not easy for us

233
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,680
to come this far.

234
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,290
It's all thanks to you.

235
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,440
Thank you.

236
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,330
This matter

237
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,350
can finally be ended.

238
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,310
Take everyone and leave.

239
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,360
Chu.

240
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
I promised you.

241
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,440
If we are leaving,

242
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,160
we are leaving together.

243
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,280
Bo Yan.

244
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,520
I don't have time to explain.

245
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,340
I'll be back.

246
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
This is the only way.

247
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,280
Trust me.

248
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,320
Go.

249
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,740
Go!

250
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,520
Go.

251
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,800
Go!

252
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,850
Go!

253
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,030
Mr. Chu!

254
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,340
Chu!

255
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,040
Chu!

256
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,140
Bo Yan.

257
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,840
It's been seven days.

258
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,090
Without water, this fish

259
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,670
dies in just

260
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,370
half an hour.

261
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,700
You asked me to get a fish every day.

262
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,530
What are you trying to do?

263
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,080
Sir,

264
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,160
I remember when Chu and I

265
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,080
went to Wumu Island for the first time,

266
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,890
he caught this kind of fish.

267
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,990
That fish

268
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,870
lived a day and a night

269
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,370
after leaving the water.

270
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,120
Sir,

271
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,680
we left the cave seven days ago.

272
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,040
We found that

273
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,770
all the seafood are back to normal.

274
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,590
How are the 12 patients

275
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,260
on the island doing?

276
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,590
After he was transferred to Ninghai Fortress,,

277
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,410
the military doctor wrote up a prescription

278
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,680
according to Qian's diary

279
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,190
for everyone to take.

280
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,090
The previous prescription

281
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,350
was not suitable for everyone.

282
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,970
Someone died after taking it.

283
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,960
But the situation is different these days.

284
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,270
All 12 of them are getting better.

285
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,170
The scales on their bodies

286
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,250
seem to be fading away.

287
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,630
Eunuch Yang also asked the border guards to take them.

288
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,600
They had the same reaction.

289
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,700
I don't know why.

290
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,160
This matter

291
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,410
has basically come to an end.

292
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,480
I should go back to report.

293
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,200
Looks like

294
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,780
it's all thanks to Chu.

295
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,640
By the way,

296
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,130
I wonder what will you be writing in the report

297
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,690
when you return to the capital?

298
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,710
Of course, I can't report the truth.

299
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,130
But I did see

300
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,080
it hasn't been easy for the border guards here

301
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,290
to defend external enemies.

302
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,220
This has nothing to do with the building of the fortress.

303
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,190
Commander Sun is not wrong

304
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,110
for fixing the fortress.

305
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,250
Thank you, Sir.

306
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,050
Sir.

307
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,120
Could you also include

308
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,590
Chu's contributions in your report?

309
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,820
Thank you, Sir.

310
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,340
Eunuch Yang, everything is over.

311
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,370
Behead him!

312
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,860
For the past seven days,

313
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,970
You've seen what happened

314
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,870
to Ninghai Fortress and Wumu Island.

315
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,300
This strange disease lasted for two years.

316
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Why is it suddenly peaceful?

317
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,340
I really don't understand.

318
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,190
That day, you acted on your own

319
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,640
and entered the underwater cave.

320
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,200
What happened?

321
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,700
The three of us told you the truth.

322
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,890
We didn't hide anything.

323
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,600
It's just that this thing

324
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,810
is really unbelievable.

325
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,730
People like us

326
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,040
can never understand the reason.

327
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,310
As long as this prescription

328
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,220
can save these patients,

329
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,140
this matter is completely over.

330
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,190
And for us,

331
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,400
this is the best case scenario.

332
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,050
But after I return to the capital,

333
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,160
I have to ask Eunuch Yang,

334
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,020
to be extra careful.

335
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,890
Chu Sijing is missing.

336
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,950
What about Shen Cong?

337
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,370
I told you.

338
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,670
The both of them

339
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,590
are dead.

340
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,810
My other ship has arrived.

341
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,110
I'm leaving.

342
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,490
I've found some reliable sailors

343
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,720
to take Shen Cong to the boat first

344
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,070
to leave Wumu Island.

345
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,450
Mr. Chu must've made up his mind

346
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,840
when he gave me his notes.

347
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,810
Leave this in Ming.

348
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,120
This matter

349
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,090
can be ended.

350
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,250
Take everyone away.

351
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,620
I made a deal with Wozhan.

352
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,480
He will leave this place.

353
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,410
Chu,

354
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,200
I promised you.

355
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,600
If we are leaving,

356
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,280
we are leaving together.

357
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,040
Whether I go or leave,

358
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,220
I will eventually become a monster.

359
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,880
Then I'll kill you.

360
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,460
With your skills,

361
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,510
you can only protect Liaodong

362
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,860
if you continue to be alive.

363
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,800
This is the only way.

364
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,420
Keep it.

365
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,650
It's a souvenir.

366
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,970
Chu risked his life to save everyone.

367
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,370
Take care, Mr. Bo Yan.

368
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,050
Are you used to the ship?

369
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,690
It's much steadier than small boats.

370
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,390
It's fast too.

371
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,130
That's good.

372
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,820
I've been only been on the island since I was young.

373
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,440
Don't be afraid.

374
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,700
We'll be with you.

375
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,710
We'll come back together

376
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,720
when we have settled everything.

377
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,520
Mr Chu's notes?

378
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,560
[Notes]

379
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,740
Mr. Chu saved us.

380
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,450
What are you drawing?

381
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,100
Sister.

382
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,800
I can still feel it.

383
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,850
I can still feel Mr. Chu.

384
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,330
I think he's still alive.

385
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,980
I also believe that he is alive.

386
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,140
The plague has disappeared.

387
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,670
Because Mr. Chu is fighting Wozhan alone.

388
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:47,750
[Bo Yan insists on preotecting Ningyuan to fend off external enemies, helping Commander Sun recover the lost territories.]

389
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:47,750
[Angelica and Shen Cong returned to Ming two years later and continued to live together.]

390
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:47,750
[After Heng Masters were destroyed, Wumu Island resumed fishing and plantations, getting another chance at survival; The strange disease never appeared again.]
