[Episode 2]

4
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,710
November the 2nd.

5
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,509
The girl I've met before

6
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,259
actually knows my surname.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,090
She's from Wumu Island.

8
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,590
The source of the strange disease

9
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,380
should be on Wumu Island too.

10
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,100
These things must be connected.

11
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,510
Come here.

12
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,540
What are you doing here?

13
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,930
Looking for food.

14
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,780
What food can you find here?

15
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,550
Where is your village?

16
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,970
Take us there.

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,250
I'll go check over there.

18
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,400
You follow him.

19
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Be careful.

20
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,890
Stop.

21
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,909
Can't you hear me?

22
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,450
Stop!

23
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,420
Forgive me, sir.

24
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,710
Eat it.

25
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,270
Dad.

26
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,480
Mom is sweating again.

27
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,500
Sir, forgive me.

28
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,710
This is the rule on the island.

29
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,160
Who are you?

30
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,470
I'm He Zijiao,

31
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,750
[Chief He Zijiao]

32
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,870
the chief of the village.

33
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,170
Do you know

34
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,170
if someone breaks the law,

35
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,270
they shall be judged by the Great Ming Code.

36
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,250
How dare you

37
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,600
take the law into your own hands?

38
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,430
It's about the Sea God's taboo.

39
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,010
I'd better not talk about it.

40
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,300
What's he punished for?

41
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,370
He broke the taboo.

42
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,100
He ate fish.

43
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,520
Dear.

44
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,110
Eat this.

45
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,110
You need to eat to stay alive.

46
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,940
Take a bite.

47
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,840
Take a bite.

48
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,030
Dear.

49
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,659
Sir.

50
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,909
What are you doing here?

51
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,280
Stay back.

52
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,820
You found my aunt.

53
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
She'll die.

54
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,630
Stop!

55
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,770
What's going on?

56
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,330
Sir, my apologies.

57
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,070
These islanders are uncivil.

58
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,570
Please forgive them.

59
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,390
He's the chief of the village.

60
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,510
My name is He Zijiao.

61
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,020
Why is a sick woman hiding here?

62
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,490
Sir.

63
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,740
The old woman is suffering from typhoid fever.

64
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,060
To prevent others from catching it,

65
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,050
she's been moved here.

66
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,750
The Grand Elder has been waiting for a while.

67
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
I'll take you to meet him.

68

These two officers want to ask you something.

73
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm Qiu Zhi.

74
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,909
May I know who you are?

75
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm Chu Sijing, a captain at the Investigation Bureau.

76
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,140
I'm Bo Yan, a military officer from Ningyuan.

77
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,090
Elder, what's wrong?

78
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,180
Are you here

79
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,580
for the plague?

80
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,370
It seems

81
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,770
someone has made inquiries about it before us.

82
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,230
No.

83
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,490
Then tell us.

84
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,460
What's the cause of the strange disease on the island?

85
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,910
It's the dead of winter.

86
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,370
The patients just have typhoid fever.

87
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,460
Typhoid fever?

88
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,320
But the patients I've met

89
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,000
also have symptoms of grayscale.

90
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,200
Typhoid fever

91
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,990
doesn't cause those symptoms.

92
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,620
That has nothing to do with typhoid fever.

93
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,110
It's just a strange skin disease.

94
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,450
Similar cases have been reported at Ninghai Fortress.

95
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,020
I guess the source of the disease is here.

96
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,350
It's just an ailment.

97
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,450
It's not even epidemic on the island.

98
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,190
How come the source is here?

99
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,400
Then have any infected islanders

100
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,150
gone missing recently?

101
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,940
There's no such thing.

102
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,560
I have a question.

103
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,290
The taboo

104
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,020
of the Sea God,

105
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,750
where does it come from?

106
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,320
It's a rule set by our ancestors.

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,570
We can't fish or eat fish.

108
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,720
You live by the sea

109
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,490
but don't live off the sea?

110
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,650
That doesn't make sense.

111
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,790
Our ancestors got a divine revelation

112
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,360
that all the creatures in the sea are protected by the Sea God.

113
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,250
Eating them will incur the Sea God's wrath.

114
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,420
That's why they set the rule.

115
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,110
What a rule.

116
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,840
Elder Qiu.

117
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,170
Many people on the island are impoverished.

118
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,880
They're starving.

119
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,850
Elder Qiu.

120
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,310
Why don't you leave the island to make a living?

121
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,190
Wars are going on and on

122
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
outside the island.

123
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,380
We've been working the fields for generations.

124
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,460
Other than farming,

125
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,150
we don't know other ways to make a living.

126
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,900
You traveled a long way here.

127
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,250
Why don't you come with me to have a rest at my place?

128
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,080
Please.

129
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,000
Elder.

130
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,810
There's one more thing.

131
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,580
Please summon all the children on the island,

132
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,940
both girls and boys.

133
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,720
I'd like to meet everyone below 15.

134
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,670
Why?

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,610
Well,

136
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,030
there's a shortage of food on the island.

137
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,620
I want to do what I can to help.

138
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,570
After meeting those kids,

139
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,850
I'll know what to report to the higher-ups.

140
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,790
If I could get more food for people here,

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,330
it'd be great.

142
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,160
But…

143
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,130
Elder.

144
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,740
The two officers are doing this for our good.

145
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,030
It's not difficult.

146
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,710
Leave it to me.

147
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,200
How could you let him escape?

148
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,960
What were you two doing?

149
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,030
When did he disappear?

150
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,400
Last night, at about midnight.

151
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,000
The two of them failed to keep an eye on him.

152
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,930
Chu Sijing

153
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,110
is hard to deal with.

154
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,690
Get lost.

155
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,670
I'll write a letter

156
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,900
to report this.

157
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,470
The higher-ups in Ningyuan

158
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,080
have to look into that Imperial Guard.

159
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,980
Now that he's gone,

160
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm afraid some secrets

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,450
can't stay buried anymore.

162
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,920
Chu.

163
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,690
What are you doing?

164
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,240
Are you fishing?

165
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,890
You know fishing is banned here.

166
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,060
That's exactly why

167
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,700
I have to fish.

168
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,480
The kids have all gathered together.

169
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,020
Let's go.

170
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,550
Let's go.

171
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,940
Are all the children on the island here?

172
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,630
Yes.

173
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,760
There aren't many children on the island.

174
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,760
Give me the food.

175
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,970
Kids,

176
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,810
are you hungry?

177
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,130
I have food here.

178
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,310
Do you want some?

179
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,360
Come.

180
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,790
Come. Come here.

181
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,230
We've got food for you.

182
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,520
Easy, easy.

183
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,040
There's enough for everyone.

184
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,220
Go, go, go.

185
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,350
Be careful.

186
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,450
Sirs, thank you.

187
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,710
Why didn't you come to get some food?

188
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,330
I have food.

189
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,900
You ate it?

190
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,940
This is for birds.

191
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
[He Liuhong, a villager]

192
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,490
Delicious.

193
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Delicious.

194
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,800
Sir,

195
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,450
his name is He Liuhong.

196
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,970
His father died before he was born.

197
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,230
His mother died too.

198
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,910
His brain,

199
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,180
something is wrong with it.

200
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,730
I'm a hero.

201
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,470
Liuhong. Liuhong.

202
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,760
Liuhong?

203
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,950
Liuhong is his name.

204
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,060
In our language,

205
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,240
it means "hero."

206
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,740
Hero?

207
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,710
Fish!

208
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,780
Fish!

209
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,680
Stupid kid, you scared me.

210
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,370
What's so scary about a fish?

211
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,430
The fish don't die.

212
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,490
The fish don't die.

213
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,350
He's talking nonsense.

214
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:58,950
The fish don't die.

215
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,750
Please ignore him.

216
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,820
He's always like this,

217
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,940
mad as a hatter.

218
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,470
Monsters.

219
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,270
Would you like to…

220
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,590
The fish don't die.

221
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
They don't die. No.

222
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,700
What monster?

223
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,400
No.

224
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,330
There are monsters

225
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,750
on this island.

226
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,070
Monsters.

227
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,790
Monsters?

228
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,250
Where are they?

229
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,490
They're everywhere.

230
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,570
Everywhere.

231
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,740
Everywhere.

232
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,940
They come out at night

233
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,470
and eat people.

234
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,410
They eat people.

235
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,980
Monsters are everywhere.

236
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,230
Have you seen one?

237
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,270
No, no.

238
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,190
Those who did all died.

239
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,970
They all died.

240
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,589
He's in black.

241
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,550
You're in black.

242
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,230
Men in black are not afraid of monsters.

243
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,990
Men in black are not afraid of monsters.

244
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,680
Men in black are not afraid of monsters.

245
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,069
They're in black too.

246
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,700
Are you here

247
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,280
to kill the monsters for me?

248
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,950
They're also in black.

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,190
They also kill monsters.

250
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,650
They?

251
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,160
Who are they?

252
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,110
Birds.

253
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,490
Birds.

254
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,460
Birds, don't go.

255
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,450
Birds.

256
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,640
Birds.

257
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,910
He's nuts?

258
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,910
He's insane.

259
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,600
I've told you.

260
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,590
We don't have better rooms on the island.

261
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,790
I'm sorry you have to stay here, sirs.

262
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,010
Thank you.

263
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,880
Bo Yan.

264
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,270
Chu.

265
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,800
How long are you going to stay on this island?

266
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,850
We haven't found out the truth.

267
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,810
I don't know how long it'll take.

268
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,200
Are you here

269
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,190
to look for the truth

270
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,710
or look for someone?

271
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,900
This is my first time here.

272
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,130
Who can I possibly be looking for?

273
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,980
Chu.

274
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,910
Sorry.

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,250
Mr. Chu.

276
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,910
I

277
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,800
am your guide

278
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,170
and also your assistant.

279
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,960
Whatever you have in mind,

280
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,260
you can tell me honestly about it.

281
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,230
As long as it's not illegal,

282
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,840
I'll do everything I can to help you.

283
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,420
You shouldn't hold out on me.

284
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,130
You've seen the situation on the island.

285
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,880
It's really weird.

286
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,040
Why would I hold out on you?

287
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,510
It's just that the Imperial Guards

288
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,630
have a way of doing things.

289
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,730
I don't need to report everything to you.

290
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,630
Okay.

291
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,450
Well said, Mr. Chu.

292
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,230
You and I

293
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,870
are not friends.

294
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,090
I'm just here to investigate the plague with you

295
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,650
and expect honesty from you.

296
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,380
If you're here for personal reasons,

297
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,550
I'll leave now.

298
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,840
Go ahead.

299
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,750
It's actually still alive.

300
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,460
Sir,

301
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,170
four wounded soldiers were found in the forest.

302
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,220
According to them,

303
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,710
they were hurt by an Imperial Guard.

304
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,840
What?

305
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,230
Say it again.

306
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,380
Sir,

307
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,940
four soldiers were injured

308
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,200
by an Imperial Guard.

309
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,670
It must be Chu Sijing.

310
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,300
You may leave.

311
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,380
Yes.

312
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,240
Bo Yan?

313
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,540
Who's it?

314
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,110
What are you doing here?

315
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,040
I was hungry.

316
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,110
Now that I'm full,

317
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,280
I remember everything.

318
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,500
Monsters.

319
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,800
What do you remember?

320
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,100
The men who kill monsters.

321
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,980
Do you know where they are?

322
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,720
I can lead you to them.

323
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,310
Dad.

324
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,290
Are there really monsters that will take Mom away?

325
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,230
Over there.

326
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,080
The men who kill monsters are in there.

327
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,380
We have an appointment with Mr. Lei.

328
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,760
It's you.

329
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,780
Mr. Chu.

330
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,230
It's late at night.

331
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,150
Are you chasing a ghost or the ghost being chased?

332
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,900
Did you see anyone just now?

333
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,340
Yes.

334
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,500
Three men in black.

335
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,700
They abducted someone and left in that direction.

336
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,510
The whole monster thing

337
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,990
is totally made up.

338
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,670
The man I saw was in black too.

339
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,310
He ran away when he saw me.

340
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,970
I think they're on the same team.

341
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,510
Something must be off here.

342
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,970
I smell smoke.

343
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,170
Fighting in wars for years

344
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,340
has given me a keen sense of smell.

345
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,550
It's midnight.

346
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,520
Who would have started a fire here?

347
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,650
Chu.

348
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,720
Look.

349
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,910
This is a sign.

350
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,860
It's a patrol language

351
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,990
used for navigation

352
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,740
only by the army.

353
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,290
That way.

354
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,220
What's it?

355
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,650
Someone from Ningyuan is here.

356
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,210
So soon?

357
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,890
Chu Sijing.

358
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,230
Where is he now?

359
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,720
If we're right,

360
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,070
he's on Wumu Island.

361
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,740
Wumu Island?

362
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,560
Why has he gone there?

363
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,010
He went there without approval.

364
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,530
We don't know the reason.

365
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,160
You can't contain the epidemic,

366
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,340
and you can't keep a man in check?

367
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,270
Eunuch Yang.

368
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,290
He had a warrant.

369
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,440
We couldn't stop him.

370
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,250
You couldn't stop him?

371
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,000
Mr. Xu.

372
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,630
Outside Ningyuan City,

373
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,550
he hurt four mounted scouts.

374
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,520
With just a piece of paper,

375
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,620
he got to come and go as he pleased.

376
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,820
He's just an Imperial Guard.

377
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,110
If he were the enemy's spy,

378
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,310
would you still

379
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,400
let him do whatever he wanted?

380
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,330
No matter what,

381
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,800
we'll do our best to help you

382
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,290
arrest Chu Sijing.

383
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,640
Good.

384
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,150
Then, please,

385
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,580
arrange accommodations for us.

386
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,700
I'll stay here for a few days.

387
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,630
Chu.

388
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,310
What is this godforsaken place?

389
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,270
Look.

390
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,840
It seems to have been through a war.

391
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,570
Chu, look.

392
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,000
An arrow.

393
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,070
Why were arrows shot into the room?

394
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,800
I don't think it's a residence.

395
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,190
It looks more like a prison.

396
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,600
It's such a strange place.

397
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,420
Elder Qiu Zhi didn't mention it.

398
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,550
He Zijiao

399
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,260
didn't mention it either.

400
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,090
They must have kept it from us

401
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,070
for a reason.

402
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,860
This place is creepy.

403
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,520
Chu.

404
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
Don't you think it's weird

405
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,330
that when we walked in the woods,

406
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,750
we didn't hear any insects

407
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,920
or birds chirping,

408
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,960
or see any traces of animals?

409
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,850
It was terrifyingly quiet.

410
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,580
What are you doing here?

411
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:47,990
Someone

412
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,800
is here.

413
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,260
Enough.

414
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,030
Stop saying crazy things.

415
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,910
Chu.

416
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,520
This place is creepy.

417
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,630
We should leave now.

418
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,360
Let's go.

419
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,310
Who's that girl?

420
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,500
[Shen Cong, a villager]

421
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,130
It's you.

422
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,480
What's wrong?

423
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,390
Miss.

424
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,020
Let's hide. Hide.

425
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,260
Run!

426
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,850
Chu, it doesn't have eyes.

427
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,550
Let's go.

428
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,530
Are you okay?

429
00:36:59,390 --> 00:36:59,930
Miss.

430
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,120
What the hell is that?

431
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,230
The rumor about monsters

432
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,280
is actually true.

433
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,400
Chu.

434
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,930
Why did it suddenly run away?

435
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,270
Someone saved us.

436
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,870
Where are the two kids?

437
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,080
Why did you come here?

438
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,660
That village

439
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,170
is dangerous.

440
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,910
Chu.

441
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,630
This is the person you're looking for?

442
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,050
Miss.

443
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,430
You've met me before,

444
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,800
right?

445
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,560
Chu.

446
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,570
You shouldn't have come.
