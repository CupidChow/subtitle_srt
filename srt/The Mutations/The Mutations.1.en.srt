[Episode 1]

4
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,270
In the third year of Tianqi,

5
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,600
the soldiers and civilians of Liaodong cleared wasteland
and built a fortress to defend the border town of Ningyuan,

6
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,120
which was quite effective.

7
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,620
However, there were many voices of opposition in the court.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,979
Coincidentally, a rumor about a strange disease
in Ninghai Fortress started circulating.

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,220
Officials submitted one letter after another

10
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,450
saying that the construction of a fortress
in Liaodong violated God's will.

11
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,150
In a short time,

12
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,950
the relationship between the imperial court and Liaodong

13
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,840
became unpredictable.

14
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,190
The 29th day of the winter

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,710
was the first day I came here,

16
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,910
outside the Shanhai Pass in Liaodong.

17
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,950
I've to rush to the front garrison to deliver documents.

18
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,460
Are you heading the same way?

19
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
Delicious.

20
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,450
I have wine.

21
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,890
Have a sip.

22
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,950
So you're going to Ningyuan City.

23
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,670
Military Advisor Long ordered us to go to Shanhai Pass

24
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,820
to purchase medicinal herbs.

25
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,460
We have to hurry.

26
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,770
Sir.

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,100
Don't tell me you're transporting the medicinal herbs

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,640
for the strange disease in Ninghai Fortress

29
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,840
in the east of Ningyuan City?

30
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,050
Exactly.

31
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,560
I pray every day in hopes that

32
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,340
they won't make us deliver medicine to Ninghai Fortress.

33
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,700
If we really get infected, I will...

34
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,620
You talk too much.

35
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,510
I heard that Commander Sun

36
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,610
building a fortress in Ningyuan

37
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,920
provoked God's will

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,030
and the strange disease in Ninghai Fortress is a bad omen.

39
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,900
Bad omen?

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,150
That is, the strange disease in Ninghai Fortress

41
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,830
is caused by demons.

42
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,220
Do you believe it?

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,339
Of course not.

44
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,029
But

45
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,740
what is the truth?

46
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,750
It's true that there's a rumor about demons.

47
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,190
They also said

48
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,320
everyone who has this strange disease

49
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,590
is treated as prey by demons.

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,340
They will be eaten by demons.

51
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,360
They're treating us like we're three year olds,

52
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,000
aren't they?

53
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,220
Ridiculous.

54
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,260
Believe it.

55
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,550
I heard that some patients have disappeared.

56
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,190
Their whereabouts are unknown.

57
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,870
Patients have disappeared?

58
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,230

59
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,930
I have a hometown friend from Zhending

61

Well,

62

he works as a servant for Military Inspector Yan.

63
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,900
I wonder how he's doing.

64
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,230

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,380
It's been a while since we met.

174
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,430
Why are you here instead of
building the city wall in Ningyuan?

175
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,460
Are you a deserter?

176
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,380
You and your nonsense.

177
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,550
Who is a deserter?

178
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,590
You are the deserter.

179
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,930
Let me introduce you.

180
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,620
An Imperial Guard from the capital, Mr. Chu.

181
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,560
[Chiliarch, Xu Zongqi]

182
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,140
Please pardon my manners, Mr. Chu.

183
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm the captain of Northern Investigation Bureau, Chu Sijing.

184
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,070
I'm here on an order.

185
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,620
I'm Xu Zongqi, the chiliarch here.

186
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,910
This is

187
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,040
the deputy chiliarch, Lei Sui.

188
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,110
[Deputy chiliarch, Lei Sui]

189
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,590
Greetings, sirs.

190
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,850
The rumors of a plague here

191
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,700
are running rampant in the capital.

192
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,110
Mr. Xu.

193
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,510
I wonder what the truth is.

194
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,530
It's late.

195
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,590
Please take a rest.

196
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,850
You'll find out after you survey the place tomorrow.

197
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,220
Sir, this way please.

198
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,510
This place is not as nice as the capital.

199
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,710
The barracks are just like this.

200
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,740
Please make do with it.

201
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,030
Sir.

202
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,150
Where do you want to sleep?

203
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,800
Sirs.

204
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:18,990
Time to eat.

205
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,250
In recent days, there has been a shortage of food.

206
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,260
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,770
Please enjoy.

208
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,980
Wait.

209
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,750
Sir.

210
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,510
What kind of meat

211
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,310
is this?

212
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,270
Sir, it's bushmeat.

213
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,460
We all eat this here.

214
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,790
Thanks.

215
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
Don't be so particular. Eat up.

216
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,510
I once was trapped in the mountains during an investigation

217
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,660
and also had this kind of meat.

218
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,750
The meat is tough

219
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,110
and has a gamey taste.

220
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
What kind of meat is this?

221
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,230
This is wolf meat.

222
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,300
Follow me tomorrow and act accordingly.

223
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,050
It's too late.

224
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,130
It's too late.

225
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,910
Don't trust anyone.

226
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,910
No one!

227
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,540
You have to go the island.

228
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,470
Go to the island.

229
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,870
Wumu Island.

230
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,570
Thunder god vine?

231
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,140
This is the so-called plague.

232
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,720
The winter has arrived.

233
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,880
A typhoid fever outbreak in the barracks is typical.

234
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,190
Even this can be rumored to be a plague.

235
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,040
There's nothing I can do about it.

236
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,140
Mr. Chu, you even know how to practice medicine?

237
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,270
His pulse is weak

238
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,420
and thin.

239
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,170
It's indeed a symptom of typhoid fever.

240
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,069
See?

241
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
I'm right, aren't I?

242
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,250
Someone must be up to no good.

243
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,010
Mr. Chu.

244
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,480
Typhoid fever is infectious. We shouldn't stay here for long.

245
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,180
What is this?

246
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,810
This man has had a skin disease

247
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,920
for a long time.

248
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,870
Are all the patients here?

249
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,350
The typhoid fever is a common disease,

250
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,200
but it's troublesome when it spreads.

251
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,250
We are very cautious.

252
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,160
Anyone who has symptoms will be isolated here.

253
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,310
They can only leave after they've recovered.

254
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,190
Are there any deaths?

255
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,880
Yes.

256
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,360
But just a few people.

257
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,390
They were all wounded from the war.

258
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,100
This disease is not fatal.

259
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,990
I think the deaths were all caused by war injuries.

260
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,710
Xu is right.

261
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,790
There are many wars at the border.

262
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,110
It's normal to have a few casualties every once in a while.

263
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,490
Is the typhoid fever the only illness in the barracks?

264
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,950
Yes.

265
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,780
Sir.

266
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm here to accompany you

267
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,270
for the investigation.

268
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,830
If you find anything strange,

269
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,550
for example,

270
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,050
someone saying it's a disaster

271
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,620
caused by the construction of Ningyuan's defense line,

272
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,930
please be discerning.

273
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,320
We haven't found anything yet.

274
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,430
Why are you feeling guilty?

275
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,910
Sir, why would I be feeling guilty?

276
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,710
At this time,

277
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,320
you know better than me who in the court

278
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,110
is a patriot

279
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,830
and who is a traitor.

280
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,510
I don't care if you have an ulterior motive,

281
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,990
I'll say it again.

282
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,350
Building Ningyuan's defense line

283
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,740
is a national plan.

284
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,920
If someone deliberately sabotaged it,

285
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,430
they are a country traitor.

286
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,270
Don't worry, Bo Yan.

287
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,030
I'm here on a mission.

288
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,580
I won't interfere with your fortress building.

289
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,310
Thank you.

290
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,430
It's cold. Why do you go to the sea?

291
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,910
Do you usually see this kind of fish?

292
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,270
Fishes in this season are hard to catch,

293
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,550
but

294
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,950
there are still some of them.

295
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,150
It's just that we...

296
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,200
It's common.

297
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,790
It's common.

298
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,310
It's common.

299
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,690
Do you

300
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,270
have fish to eat normally?

301
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,760
No.

302
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,870
Why not?

303
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,250
Please don't mind, Sir.

304
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,030
Mr. Lei ordered

305
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,500
not to let us fish for fish to eat.

306
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,850
If it weren't for Mr. Bo Yan's order,

307
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,090
we wouldn't have touched this fish.

308
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,900
As for why,

309
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,150
we have no idea.

310
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,430
Don’t worry.

311
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,950
I won’t tell Mr. Bai about this.

312
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,210
One more question.

313
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,900
When the arrest warrant was issued?

314
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,750
Well...

315
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,590
I don't remember.

316
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,550
We're just following orders.

317
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,470
Sir,

318
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,560
all the army provisions are here.

319
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,090
Sir,

320
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,650
the army provisions here are the same as the provisions at Nine Garrisons.

321
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,590
There's nothing special.

322
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,870
Why don't I take you to investigate something else?

323
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,590
What's strange about it?

324
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,710
Mr. Bo Yan,

325
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,640
how frequent do you eat meat in Ningyuan City?

326
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,630
Every seven days.

327
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,910
Mr. Xu.

328
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,150
It's near the sea here.

329
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,430
They're even eating the gamy and tough wolf meat.

330
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,270
Yet why is there no seafood?

331
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,830
You're right.

332
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,150
Xu.

333
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,170
Don't you eat fish?

334
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,760
You often go fishing.

335
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,150
Where is the fish?

336
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,070
It's the cold winter now.

337
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,870
There are no fishes in the nearby seas.

338
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,750
There are only a few of them left.

339
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,790
There's no need to send people to catch them.

340
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,030
When the fishes were abundant, why didn't you fish and marinate them

341
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,550
in case of hunger in winter?

342
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,880
W-We did that before.

343
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,280
It's just there's a lack of reserve.

344
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,100
We ate it all.

345
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,980
Is it strange?

346
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
This fish is so fat.

347
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,580
[Ninghai Fortress outer forest]

348
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,000
Who are you?

349
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,670
Sir.

350
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,390
We are from Wumu Island.

351
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,290
The people of Wumu Island?

352
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,400
It's so late.

353
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,920
What are you doing here?

354
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,090
We have an appointment with Mr. Lei.

355
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,590
Chu...

356
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,930
Stop!

357
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,490
-Sir. -Sir.

358
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,310
Move.

359
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,430
These are fishermen.

360
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,950
We are officials.

361
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,230
We can't disturb the people.

362
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,790
How dare you?

363
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,350
If we fight with all our might,

364
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,130
you may not be my match.

365
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,240
Stop!

366
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,730
Lei Zui.

367
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,590
What's the matter?

368
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,200
Mr. Bo Yan.

369
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,580
It's just a misunderstanding.

370
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,700
Mr. Lei and I found

371
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,400
the walls outside the castle are not strong enough.

372
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,430
Especially...

373
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,510
You may leave now.

374
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,030
Mr. Chu.

375
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,290
Mr. Lei told me about the situation just now.

376
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,790
Those people were just local people.

377
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,930
You misunderstood.

378
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,230
Mr. Lei is impatient and doesn't speak much.

379
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,120
He didn't make it clear.

380
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,390
It's all his fault.

381
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,460
I apologise to you.

382
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,390
Mr. Lei.

383
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,680
Those who come from afar are all guests.

384
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,400
Is this how you treat guests?

385
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,650
Sirs,

386
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,270
do you have anything to tell me?

387
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,750
If you have any questions, just go ahead.

388
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,930
We'll tell you everything we know.

389
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,450
Okay.

390
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,690
Mr. Xu.

391
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,520
What kind of place is Wumu Island?

392
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,880
It was originally a deserted island.

393
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,280
More than a hundred years ago,

394
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,980
when Emperor Taizu took over Yuan,

395
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,340
a group of remnants from the north wandered to Liaodong

396
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,460
and obtained this region,

397
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,520
settling here

398
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,910
for many generations.

399
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,000
They became a group of outsiders.

400
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,030
To appease the people,

401
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,300
Commander Sun ordered our army to donate grain to the island regularly

402
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,900
to relieve the famine.

403
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,330
But...

404
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,800
But the people of Wumu Island

405
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,610
are still very wary of our army.

406
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,320
Thank you.

407
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,200
Mr. Bai,

408
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,680
The people of Wumu Island said they had an appointment with you.

409
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,410
What is it?

410
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,230
Mr. Qian said

411
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,750
the islanders are wary of us.

412
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,450
They won't let outsiders go to the island.

413
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,240
They are here to collect grain.

414
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,750
You look unfamiliar.

415
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,780
I was afraid that you'd scare the islanders.

416
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,270
If I had offended you,

417
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,710
please forgive me.

418
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,730
Who is the girl you've been protecting?

419
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,440
Why did she run away as soon as she saw me?

420
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,480
Who else could it be?

421
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,750
She's a child on the island.

422
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,150
She's shy.

423
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,240
Your official statements

424
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,810
are really well said.

425
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,960
In that case,

426
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,360
I'll investigate on my own.

427
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,470
I've already told you.

428
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,470
The people of Wumu Island do not allow outsiders to go onto the island.

429
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,380
You here to investigate the plague.

430
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,350
I think

431
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,470
we've completed our investigation.

432
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,050
Why won't you let go the people of Wumu Island?

433
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,230
I was assigned to investigate the case.

434
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,440
I just met a few patients with cold.

435
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,740
And here you are saying the investigation is completed?

436
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,950
How do I write the report?

437
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,080
Should I write with little care

438
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,910
or should I say the two of you didn't cooperate?

439
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,010
How powerful, Sir.

440
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,030
Not at all.

441
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,520
Mr. Lei.

442
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,880
We will do our best

443
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
to cooperate with the Imperial Guards' investigation.

444
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,990
You can investigate whatever you want.

445
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,030
But

446
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,030
you have no idea.

447
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,190
A few days ago, there was a hurricane.

448
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,220
All ships were damaged.

449
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,590
But don't worry.

450
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,210
I'll send someone to fix it right away.

451
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for a few more days.

452
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,420
I'll wait for your news.

453
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,180
Sir.

454
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,150
Stop thinking about it.

455
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,600
Although you're a capital official

456
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,950
and an Imperial Guard,

457
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,950
a strong dragon can't suppress the locals.

458
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,120
You don't believe me?

459
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,430
Even I can tell.

460
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,800
Look at the excuse Xu Zongqi

461
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,080
has come up with.

462
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,520
It's so well written.

463
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,060
They'll stall you for the next two days.

464
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,550
Then find a new way in a few days.

465
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,460
Anyway,

466
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,470
you can't go up to Wumu Island.

467
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,460
What's your relationship with Xu Zongqi?

468
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,430
We

469
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,870
came to Liaodong together.

470
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,510
We are comrades who has gone through

471
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,930
thick and thin together.

472
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,160
But he is

473
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,730
meticulous

474
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,550
and cunning.

475
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,050
All he wants to do is to climb up.

476
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,150
Unlike me,

477
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
who's so straightforward.

478
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,650
And this Lei Sui

479
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,790
is not a good guy.

480
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,830
I think

481
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,190
they are the same.

482
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,670
To investigate the plague,

483
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,830
we must go onto the island.

484
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,780
Sir,

485
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,390
I advise you to eat more.

486
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,170
How can you go to the island without strength?

487
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,570
Do you have a way to enter the island?

488
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,670
Sir.

489
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,870
You are going onto the island

490
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,190
to investigate the epidemic?

491
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,030
Of course.

492
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,380
You saw the warrant.

493
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,710
It's written clearly.

494
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,590
Bo Yan.

495
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,790
Don't worry.

496
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,400
I have nothing

497
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,460
against you.

498
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,570
Besides,

499
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,580
do you believe the rumors about the plague and demons?

500
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,590
Me?

501
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,110
I don't believe it.

502
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,470
Neither do I.

503
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,230
Let me go to the island and find out the truth.

504
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,500
Rumors

505
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,080
will unravel themselves.

506
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,300
At midnight,

507
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,980
I will bring you to the beach on the north.

508
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,080
The tide has the biggest difference today.

509
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,920
In the afternoon,

510
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,110
when I was walking by the beach alone

511
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,510
I found a shallow beach.

512
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,880
When the tide subsides,

513
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,990
the shallow beach shows itself.

514
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,940
We

515
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,240
can swim over there.

516
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,750
We should tie it tight.

517
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,270
Otherwise, when we get to the island,

518
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,350
we won't have any clean clothes.

519
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,470
Did you go to the island like this before?

520
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,950
No.

521
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,550
Why?

522
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,230
Are you afraid of water?

523
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,770
That's not true.

524
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,700
Mr. Chu.

525
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:54,980
Let's go!

526
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,500
Follow me closely.

527
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,040
Bo Yan!

528
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,570
Bo Yan!

529
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:30,570
Bo Yan!

530
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,110
Bo Yan.

531
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,060
Mr. Chu.

532
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,350
I thought you wouldn't be able to swim up.

533
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,270
If you hadn't sent me a signal,

534
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,200
I would have died in the sea.

535
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,670
Signal?

536
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,650
I didn't send you any signal.

537
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,280
You didn't send me any signal?

538
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,900
Then why did I see a light just now?

539
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,830
It's in the middle of the night. Don't be crazy.

540
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,690
Let's start the fire.

541
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,410
We will go to the island tomorrow morning.

542
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,420
