[Episode 6]

4
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,430
Elder Qiu.

5
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,900
The infected

6
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,390
will all become monsters in the end, right?

7
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,820
After all that's happened,

8
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,030
why are you still keeping it from me?

9
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,990
At Ninghai Fortress,

10
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,060
some people have been infected.

11
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,139
If things go haywire in the army,

12
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,190
the consequences will be unimaginable.

13
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,180
I've forewarned them.

14
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,670
I have to go back.

15
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,600
Only Black Ibises have boats.

16
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,570
They won't let you leave.

17
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,470
We'll see about that.

18
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,540
Mr. Bo Yan.

19
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,870
This whole thing started on Wumu Island.

20
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,640
But people here didn't do anything wrong.

21
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,010
After this secret gets out,

22
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,780
do you think

23
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,140
the people outside

24
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,840
will believe we're innocent?

25
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,320
By that time,

26
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,520
what will happen to us?

27
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,380
For two years,

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,150
I've been keeping this secret

29
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,350
so that Wumu Island

30
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,520
hasn't fallen yet.

31
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,430
Wumu Island

32
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,190
is a part of Ming too.

33
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,320
The islanders

34
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,360
are also the people of Ming.

35
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,150
But now,

36
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,050
my injury…

37
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,920
I, Qiu Zhi,

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,560
am begging you again.

39
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,660
Please…

40
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,300
Please,

41
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,650
save the people on Wumu Island.

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
A hero is meeting another hero.

43
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
Hello, hero.

44
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,090
Hero.

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,040
The hero is angry.

46
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,750
Please forgive me.

47
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,810
The hero is angry.

48
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,500
Please forgive me.

49
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,880
Please forgive me, hero.

50
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,180
Please forgive me.

51
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,620
The hero is angry.

52
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,470
This pattern

53
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,220
is exactly the same

54
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,600
as the one I saw on the bridge when I first came to this island.

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,130
The one here is more complete.

56
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,520
Let's go.

57
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,110
Follow me.

58
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:13,990
Liuhong.

59
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,080
Liuhong.

60
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,050
Who's it?

61
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,040
Goodbye, Mr. Lei.

62
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,810
You're awake, sir.

63
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,300
You

64
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,890
killed Lei Sui.

65
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,750
For two years,

66
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,710
he kept undermining the Lord.

67
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,370
I have to say

68
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,790
he deserved to die.

69
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,320
Mr. Chu.

70
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,750
You should not follow in his footsteps.

71
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,080
Where are Shen Cong and He Liuhong?

72
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,500
Don't worry, sir.

73
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,360
They're all right.

74
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,320
Here.

75
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,220
Have some water.

76
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,130
What are you doing?

77
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,960
What are you doing?

78
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,100
This is the essence of the sea.

79
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,830
A gift from the Lord.

80
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,440
It can help you

81
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,070
connect with the Lord better.

82
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,750
You're the Lord's envoy.

83
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,880
Among all the envoys,

84
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,790
you're the only one

85
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,550
who can go to where the Lord

86
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,750
resides.

87
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,700
Why?

88
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,710
Why me?

89
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,760
Mr. Chu.

90
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,480
Because your brother is with the Lord.

91
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,830
Since the Lord came here from beyond the stars,

92
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,360
he's blessed all the sea creatures around Wumu Island.

93
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,160
Wumu Island

94
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,400
was originally a deserted island.

95
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,340
All the creatures in the sea

96
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,350
are protected by the Sea God.

97
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,390
Eating them

98
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,790
will incur the Sea God's wrath.

99
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,400
People who eat the blessed creatures

100
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,390
will get the power of the Lord.

101
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,520
Mr. Chu.

102
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,670
The symptoms you saw are just temporary.

103
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,580
In the end, we'll abandon our physical bodies

104
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,970
to get close to the Lord

105
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,580
and gain wisdom.

106
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
By then,

107
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,790
endless wealth and power

108
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,940
will be within our grasp.

109
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,270
Feel it.

110
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,760
Tell me where the Lord is.

111
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,310
Brother, help me!

112
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,040
Sir, what do you see?

113
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,470
My brother.

114
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,840
Chu Siyu.

115
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,490
Go on.

116
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,680
Go on.

117
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,260
Who are you?

118
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,710
We know each other.

119
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,430
Mr. Chu.

120
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,440
I'm here to help you.

121
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,920
Grand Elder Qiu has colluded with Black Ibises

122
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,700
to kill all the people

123
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,260
on Wumu Island.

124
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,230
Who taught you

125
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,390
to say that?

126
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,300
I didn't believe what the villagers said,

127
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,090
but just now,

128
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,200
a demon saved Elder Qiu in front of everyone

129
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,520
after he was badly wounded.

130
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,150
Captain.

131
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,230
Find a boat and go home.

132
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,860
What about you?

133
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,390
There's something I need to do.

134
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,610
It turns out you work for Heng Masters.

135
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,030
You and he

136
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,690
look exactly the same.

137
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,490
You know my brother?

138
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,880
You know where my brother is?

139
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,400
Just like you,

140
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,410
I haven't seen him for two years.

141
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
If it weren't for him,

142
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,170
we'd have long achieved our noble goal.

143
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,360
But I don't blame him.

144
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,200
After all, you

145
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,420
are here now.

146
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,020
Me?

147
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,090
When I first met you,

148
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I realized

149
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,660
it was the Lord who sent you here.

150
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,130
Only you

151
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,990
can find Chu Siyu.

152
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,410
What do you mean?

153
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,590
Dreams.

154
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,330
Fragments.

155
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,830
Think hard.

156
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,190
Help me.

157
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,260
Shen Rang?

158
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,370
If I hadn't found you in time,

159
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,810
you would have

160
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,380
frozen to death on the beach.

161
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,050
Thank you.

162
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,830
I suddenly passed out on the beach,

163
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,990
perhaps because of something I saw.

164
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,190
Major Shen.

165
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,240
Get me a boat.

166
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,570
I need to go back to Ninghai Fortress.

167
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,390
Sir.

168
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,710
I know you're worried about the safety of Ninghai Fortress.

169
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,390
But even if you go back now,

170
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,170
what can you do?

171
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,230
With Heng Masters still around,

172
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,480
nothing we do can make a difference.

173
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,640
Why is it about Heng Masters again?

174
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,200
Are Heng Masters

175
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,490
islanders?

176
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,790
Some of them are.

177
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,340
They call themselves Heng Masters

178
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,710
and worship the monsters on the island.

179
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,980
They believe

180
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,500
those monsters are immortal

181
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,010
and can give them immortality and power.

182
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,350
Two years ago,

183
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,070
we engaged in a bloody battle with them.

184
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,780
I thought we eliminated them.

185
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,270
But unfortunately,

186
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,470
some of them survived

187
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,340
and blended in with normal islanders

188
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,840
to cloud people's minds

189
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,610
and wait for a chance to fight back.

190
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,480
I remember Chu once told me

191
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,790
his brother

192
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,430
disappeared here two years ago.

193
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,910
Could it be that

194
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,040
his brother

195
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,300
was also investigating Heng Masters?

196
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,940
Siyu.

197
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,510
I'm still alive.

198
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,720
I'm alive.

199
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,430
Brother.

200
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,440
It's all your fault.

201
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,590
Still alive.

202
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,950
Do you see him?

203
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,500
Where is he?

204
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,840
Still alive.

205
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,290
Alive.

206
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,720
Chu Siyu.

207
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,150
Where is he?

208
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,640
Sir.

209
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,890
Over the past two years,

210
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,760
I and my buddies

211
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,420
have been protecting the islanders.

212
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,350
Now the situation is urgent.

213
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,650
Cong

214
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,170
is still nowhere to be found.

215
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,160
Sir, please,

216
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,220
stay on the island for now.

217
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,740
After dealing with Heng Masters,

218
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,660
I'll escort you off the island myself.

219
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

220
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
I'll stay.

221
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,280
I can use the time to wait for Chu.

222
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,960
He Zijiao.

223
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,520
Ms. An.

224
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,920
You didn't tell me you were coming.

225
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,270
So many things are going on on the island now.

226
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
If you've caught a monster,

227
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,740
you can go back now.

228
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,540
Go back?

229
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,640
My ship and my crew

230
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,010
were all swallowed by the sea.

231
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,470
What's in the sea?

232
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,100
The Lord is in the sea.

233
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,180
Ms. An, you don't understand.

234
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,390
The power you saw

235
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,970
will help us.

236
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,450
The great cause

237
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,830
is about to succeed.

238
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,220
What is he doing?

239
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,530
Why is he locked up?

240
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,890
Mr. Chu is the Lord's envoy.

241
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,300
He's communicating with the Lord.

242
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,300
What did he say?

243
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,470
He kept saying,

244
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,330
"Southeast, southeast."

245
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,910
Southeast.

246
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,620
The map.

247
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,810
Ms. An, your ship

248
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,910
capsized here, right?

249
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,910
The truth you want is on the beach.

250
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,760
I'll wait for you there.

251
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,770
Ms. An.

252
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,220
The Elders have ordered us

253
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,850
to sacrifice you to the Lord.

254
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
He Zijiao!

255
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,250
When the Japanese soldiers come,

256
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,100
don't panic.

257
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,010
Master Qi Jiguang

258
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,930
will fight them back.

259
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,790
When a monster comes,

260
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,750
don't be afraid.

261
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,680
Black Ibises

262
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,270
will chase it away.

263
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,380
Mom told me

264
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,130
not to be afraid.

265
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,650
Mom.

266
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,850
Cong.

267
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,000
Come.

268
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,730
Don't be afraid.

269
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,530
Be careful.

270
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:55,800
Watch your step.

271
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,680
Mr. He.

272
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,330
I don't want to be here.

273
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,550
There are many bad guys here.

274
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,150
I want to see my father.

275
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,710
Cong.

276
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,890
The people who took you here are my friends

277
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,280
and also your mom's friends.

278
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,280
No one will hurt you.

279
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,500
My mom's friends?

280
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,770
Mr. Chu Sijing is also here.

281
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,910
Where is he?

282
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,480
Answer my questions first.

283
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,060
Then I'll take you to him, okay?

284
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,090
Let's go.

285
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,130
Cong.

286
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,130
I've been looking for you.

287
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,210
Why did you hide?

288
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,570
I live with my father.

289
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,190
He wouldn't let me make appearances.

290
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,900
He said someone wanted to hurt me.

291
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,320
No one will hurt you, Cong.

292
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,330
You're the Lord's child.

293
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,930
Your mom said so too, didn't she?

294
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,380
Mom is gone.

295
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,130
No.

296
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,180
We just can't find her.

297
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
Do you want to see her?

298
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,720
Mr. He, you know where she is?

299
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,110
I don't.

300
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,980
But I can make you

301
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,790
feel her.

302
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,040
After drinking the water,

303
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,160
you'll see your mom.

304
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
But Dad said

305
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,380
Mom did something wrong two years ago.

306
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,790
Your mom didn't do anything wrong.

307
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,040
She just wanted to be with you forever.

308
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,270
She wanted to lead everyone

309
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,960
to the Lord.

310
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,850
Trust me.

311
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,730
Drink it and you'll understand.

312
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,040
Come on.

313
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,480
Cong.

314
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,920
You dream a lot, don't you?

315
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,490
You often hear a voice

316
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,920
asking you to go to him, don't you?

317
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
Mr. Chu had those dreams too.

318
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,920
Chu Sijing.

319
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,350
He's also the Lord's envoy.

320
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,410
That's the Lord's voice.

321
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,880
He's calling you.

322
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,880
Cong laughs.

323
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,460
Cong jumps.

324
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Cong eats and sleeps.

325
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,000
Whose doll is it?

326
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,590
It's Cong's doll.

327
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,420
What are you looking at?

328
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,310
What's your dad making for you?

329
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,450
He's making a rocking horse for Cong.

330
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,590
Which one do you prefer, the doll or the rocking horse?

331
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,790
You see your mom, right?

332
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,490
Dad.

333
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,340
You've grown so tall.

334
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,790
You're back.

335
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,860
Trust me.

336
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,510
Follow my guidance

337
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,590
and you'll find your mom.

338
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,930
You can leave now.

339
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,100
But tomorrow,

340
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,760
when the sun rises,

341
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,380
come back to me.

342
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,010
I didn't lie to you, did I?

343
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,280
Why was I seeing those things?

344
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,470
Because you have the power the Lord gave you.

345
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,720
The Lord is behind a door.

346
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,780
And you

347
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,940
are the key.

348
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,780
Come.

349
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,430
Cong.

350
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,110
Look over there.

351
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,590
Don't be afraid.

352
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,410
Don't be afraid.

353
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,100
Keep looking.

354
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,270
Mr. He, please save him.

355
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,090
He's not a bad guy.

356
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,840
No.

357
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,470
I know he's not a bad guy.

358
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,710
But the only person who can help him

359
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,940
is you, Cong.

360
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,710
You're the Lord's child.

361
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,870
All the envoys answer to you.

362
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,480
Only you can save him.

363
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,630
Only after you wake up can you help him.

364
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:50,990
No.

365
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,460
I don't want to wake up.

366
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:56,810
Don't be afraid.

367
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,720
Don't be afraid.

368
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,630
Cong.

369
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,870
You need to hurry up.

370
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,800
What should I do?

371
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,420
Cong. Cong.

372
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,900
Close your eyes.

373
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,500
Feel him with your heart.

374
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,160
Close your eyes.

375
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,260
Yes.

376
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,310
Yes.

377
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,520
Cong, don't resist the Lord's will.

378
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,350
Accept it.

379
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,730
That monster is just your disciple.

380
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,030
You can control it.

381
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,050
You made it.

382
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,760
You made it.

383
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,850
The great cause is about to succeed!

384
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,140
Take a bite.

385
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,270
When did it happen?

386
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:51,900
Two hours ago.

387
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,739
How did it happen?

388
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,470
The medic wanted to check the cells,

389
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
so I let him in.

390
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,260
Not long after,

391
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,330
I heard screaming.

392
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,830
When I found him,

393
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,310
he was already dead.

394
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,120
Was there anyone else

395
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,470
in the cell where he died?

396
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,710
No.

397
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,970
Only the medic was there.

398
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,610
Bring some men.

399
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,670
Let's check it out.

400
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,240
Yes.

401
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,090
Why is the wall wet?

402
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,310
It wasn't wet just now.

403
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,070
Check every cell carefully.

404
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,330
Don't miss anything.

405
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,300
Yes.

406
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,160
Check every cell carefully.
