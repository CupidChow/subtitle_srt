4
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,670
Fire.

5
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,110
Back to the island!

6
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,230
Back to the island!

7
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,450
Oh my.

8
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,680
Hold onto something!

9
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,780
Hold the helm.

10
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,300
Hold the helm.

11
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,540
Monster.

12
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,390
Monster.

13
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,660
Come out. Come out.

14
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,960
Hold on tight.

15
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,030
Coming. It's coming.

16
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,470
Coming. It's coming.

17
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,340
Coming. It's coming.

18
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,940
Hold on tight.

19
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,740
Hold on tight.

20
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,800
It's saved.

21
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,350
That's the Portuguese ship.

22
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,470
You did that,

23
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,730
just to save that monster.

24
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,130
We didn't sink the ship.

25
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,010
He Liuhong told me

26
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,510
some people on this island are not afraid of monsters.

27
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,030
He must have been talking about you guys.

28
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,300
Mr. Lei.

29
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,060
I didn't expect you to be one of them.

30
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,870
Over the last two years,

31
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,150
the plague has ravaged the island and grown hard to control.

32
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,650
It's me and my buddies

33
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,780
who have been protecting Wumu Island.

34
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,800
So,

35
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,480
it was also you

36
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,350
who saved us in the village?

37
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,050
Eunuch Yang told me

38
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,419
my twin brother Chu Siyu

39
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,610
visited this island two years ago.

40
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,590
Then he went missing.

41
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,970
I didn't come here

42
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,310
with ulterior motives.

43
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,270
I just want to find my brother.

44
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,790
I

45
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,130
don't want to be your enemy.

46
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,520
This little girl

47
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,180
once met my brother

48
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,610
and has clues about where to find him.

49
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,870
I need your help.

50
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,740
Don't worry.

51
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,260
I'll never hurt her.

52
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,790
Chu Siyu

53
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,800
is a good man.

54
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,670
Cong.

55
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,090
Wait for me here.

56
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,670
I want to go home.

57
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,120
Where do you live?

58
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,170
What's the rush?

59
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,800
All the boys are on the rescue mission.

60
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,110
A patient is getting out of control.

61
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,310
Let's go. I'll go back with you.

62
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,180
The timing is perfect.

63
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,610
Do it.

64
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,720
So you live here.

65
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,970
No wonder I ran into you here.

66
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,040
Where are the other villagers?

67
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,770
Only patients live in the village.

68
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,770
My uncles forbid them to come out.

69
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,830
When I saw you in the village that night,

70
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,210
why were you with a monster?

71
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,650
That day, my uncles all went out

72
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,790
for something important.

73
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,230
I was left alone in the village.

74
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,150
I heard a strange noise

75
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,860
and followed it out.

76
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,950
Then I saw the monster.

77
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,280
There's no one in the village.

78
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,090
I need to prepare decoctions for the patients.

79
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,260
It's the border guard's sword.

80
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,180
Grand Elder Qiu banned the villagers from fishing

81
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,010
and eating seafood

82
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,840
for their own good.

83
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,550
Because since two years ago,

84
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,240
the villagers who ate seafood

85
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,020
have all been infected with the strange disease.

86
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,150
But there's not much food on the island.

87
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,430
So there are always hungry people

88
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,590
who eat fish in secret.

89
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,340
My dad said

90
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,320
the Elders and villagers can't cure this disease,

91
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,130
so they have to send the patients here.

92
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Do these herbs

93
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,750
work for the strange disease?

94
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,210
Qian selected these herbs.

95
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,470
Some patients get better

96
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,830
after taking them.

97
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,780
Some don't.

98
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,660
The girl called Qian,

99
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,820
where is she?

100
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,340
I don't know.

101
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,500
I haven't seen Qian for quite a while.

102
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,920
Dad won't tell me where she is.

103
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,830
Do you have other family

104
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,170
on this island?

105
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,160
Your dad

106
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,010
is Major Shen Rang, the commander of border guards, right?

107
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,800
Is he also infected with the strange disease?

108
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,500
What will happen

109
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,580
to the infected in the end?

110
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,510
They'll become monsters, won't they?

111
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,590
Hide.

112
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,360
Who's there?

113
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,740
Go after him.

114
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,600
She lost her mind

115
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,960
and started to kill innocent people.

116
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,130
Where is Cong?

117
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,330
In the village.

118
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,920
It's not safe in the village.

119
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,330
Sir.

120
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,680
Sir.

121
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,040
Sir.

122
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,390
Don't move.

123
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,180
Buddy.

124
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,200
Where is Elder Qiu?

125
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,600
Elder.

126
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,320
It's my wife.

127
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,630
My wife

128
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,590
was killed by those demons.

129
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,550
Calm down, sir.

130
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,310
Explain it to us.

131
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,960
What demons?

132
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,700
I saw it with my own eyes.

133
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,520
In the woods,

134
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,670
there are some cottages.

135
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,660
Those men in black

136
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,579
took my wife away

137
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,230
and killed her.

138
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,740
Eating fish means punishment.

139
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,339
Getting sick means getting taken away.

140
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,930
I never imagined

141
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,500
those who were taken away would be killed.

142
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,870
This is no way to live!

143
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,800
Those men in black entered Qiu Zhi's room.

144
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,670
At this point,

145
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,610
who will believe Qiu Zhi has nothing to do with the demons?

146
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,490
Yes.

147
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,700
Elder.

148
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,360
All creatures have the will to live.

149
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,240
If we keep staying quiet,

150
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,040
we'll all die.

151
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,740
Qiu Zhi must give us an explanation.

152
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,640
If we're wrong about him,

153
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,100
we're willing to take punishment.

154
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,260
If he's really colluded with those men in black,

155
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,650
he has to pay with his life!

156
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,200
Elder! Elder!

157
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,580
He must pay! He must pay!

158
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,360
Gather everyone.

159
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,230
Let's go.

160
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,690
Elder Qiu Zhi.

161
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,310
Sir.

162
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,340
I knew you'd eventually break free.

163
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't forget

164
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,680
I'm a military officer of Ming.

165
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,850
How can I let you take me down so easily?

166
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,700
Tell me.

167
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,750
What's going on on the island?

168
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,480
Be honest.

169
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,260
Otherwise,

170
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,800
I'll slit your throat.

171
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,390
Don't hurt him!

172
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,320
T-That's…

173
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,600
A monster.

174
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,000
I wish you hadn't seen that.

175
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,770
But you did.

176
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,050
He's not a monster.

177
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,980
He's my friend.

178
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,080
All these years,

179
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,920
he and his subordinates

180
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,040
have been living in the dark

181
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,080
to protect us.

182
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,540
They're our guardians.

183
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,380
They…

184
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,550
They once served in the army like you.

185
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,240
Now,

186
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,020
they call themselves Black Ibises.

187
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
Black Ibises?

188
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,240
They served in the Ming Army?

189
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,050
[Major Shen Rang]

190
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,770
With all these strange happenings on the island

191
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,540
and the attack from the Portuguese,

192
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,960
this secret

193
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
can't be kept anymore.

194
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,420
Sir.

195
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm Shen Rang.

196
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,090
Sorry for being rude.

197
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,960
I didn't mean

198
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,220
to lock you up.

199
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,100
I had no choice.

200
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,930
It's just that if this secret is out,

201
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,970
Wumu Island will fall.

202
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,160
Now that you know the truth,

203
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
please

204
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,390
help me protect the people of Wumu Island.

205
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,030
Come out. Come out.

206
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,550
Surrender the demons!

207
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,580
People are coming.

208
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,760
Lots of people.

209
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,840
You must stay hidden.

210
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,140
I'll deal with them.

211
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,060
I-I'll go with you.

212
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,980
Surrender them. Surrender them.

213
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,150
Surrender the demons!

214
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,710
Surrender the demons!

215
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,870
Surrender the demons!

216
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:31,350
Surrender the demons!

217
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,840
Surrender them!

218
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,520
Surrender them!

219
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,360
Surrender the demons!

220
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,460
Surrender the demons!

221
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,610
It's late at night,

222
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,810
yet you're here making a racket.

223
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,420
Do you know

224
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,570
you've broken the rule that's been followed on Wumu Island for over a century?

225
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,640
Grand Elder.

226
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,870
All these years,

227
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,820
the villagers have listened to you and believed you.

228
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,870
We're here

229
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,590
just for the truth!

230
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,490
Grand Elder.

231
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,160
You forbid us to eat fish,

232
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,550
so we don't eat fish.

233
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,050
You forbid us to leave the island,

234
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,800
so we don't leave the island.

235
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,840
But we're human.

236
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,590
We want to stay alive.

237
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,110
Those demons are taking people and killing them.

238
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,410
As the Grand Elder,

239
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,660
you colluded with the demons.

240
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,800
What are you up to?

241
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,510
Surrender the demons!

242
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,310
Surrender the demons!

243
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,000
Surrender the demons!

244
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,430
Surrender the demons!

245
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,990
Listen to me, guys.

246
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,270
The people you saw

247
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,870
are not demons.

248
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,850
They're called Black Ibises.

249
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,360
It's those people

250
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,320
who have been protecting us.

251
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,760
Do you remember

252
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,110
what happened two years ago?

253
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,920
Heng Masters were not eliminated.

254
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,440
They're still on this island.

255
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,790
You took all the sick people and killed them

256
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,810
but are shifting the blame to Heng Masters.

257
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,540
In the past two years,

258
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,590
we've never seen any Heng Masters.

259
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,420
Grand Elder Qiu has colluded with Black Ibises

260
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,720
to kill all the people

261
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,430
on Wumu Island!

262
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,630
Who taught you

263
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,900
to say that?

264
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,880
I want blood for blood!

265
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,160
Take down the demons!

266
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm Bo Yan, a military officer of Ming.

267
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,040
Behave, all of you!

268
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,110
Enough!

269
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,280
Major Shen.

270
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,980
It's Major Shen.

271
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,180
Don't

272
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,380
kill them.

273
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,410
He's a demon!

274
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,310
Kill him!

275
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,360
He's a demon!

276
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,340
Kill him!

277
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,770
Fight. Fight.

278
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,600
Shen Rang!

279
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,840
Take Qiu Zhi away.

280
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:30,950
Let's go.

281
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,310
It's all Qiu Zhi's fault.

282
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,610
Kill him!

283
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,430
Kill!

284
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,790
Go!

285
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,320
Don't be afraid. Come with me.

286
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,670
Search carefully.

287
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,410
Find all the demons.

288
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,670
Elder.

289
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,220
Are you all right?

290
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,010
You just mentioned Heng Masters.

291
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,570
Who are they?

292
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,000
They're the real demons.

293
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,950
They still exist.

294
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,590
And

295
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,500
they've been lurking in the dark.

296
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,180
It seems the riot tonight

297
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,700
is related to those people.

298
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,660
They…

299
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,180
They name themselves after Heng Master, a mythical figure,

300
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,710
and worship scary demons.

301
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,920
I don't know what they're after,

302
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,210
but I know

303
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,510
if they get what they want,

304
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,470
the consequence will be…

305
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,470
Check up ahead.

306
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,070
Let's go.

307
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,390
Can you hold on?

308
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,620
Shen Rang…

309
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,510
Shen Rang will help us out.

310
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,270
Grand Elder, how's your injury?

311
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,180
The villagers are already moving here.

312
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,180
Attend to Elder Qiu's wound now.

313
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:48,670
Yes.

314
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,040
-Grand Elder. 
-Grand Elder.

315
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,900
We've searched every corner of the woods.

316
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,050
He must have got into the village.

317
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,380
Something is wrong in the village.

318
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,200
We haven't met any villagers on the way.

319
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,790
You two can't show up.

320
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,780
Stay here and protect Cong.

321
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,980
I'll be back soon.

322
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,480
Wait for me here.

323
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,550
I'll go with you.

324
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,570
That monster did it.

325
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,560
What on earth is going on?

326
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,390
They're with the demons.

327
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,250
Kill them!

328
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,050
Stop!

329
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:33,890
Are you crazy?

330
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,030
They're the officials of Ming.

331
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,900
Leave.

332
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,950
Mr. Chu.

333
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,050
Mr. Lei.

334
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,850
What happened here?

335
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,470
Someone saw the demons kill a villager who was taken away

336
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,400
and came to question Elder Qiu.

337
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,670
They're not demons.

338
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,480
They're not afraid of monsters.

339
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,170
They're not afraid of monsters.

340
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,239
I didn't believe what the villagers said.

341
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,810
I thought they were just grumpy

342
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,489
because they couldn't get enough to eat.

343
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,920
But just now,

344
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,840
a demon saved Elder Qiu in front of everyone

345
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,280
after he was badly wounded.

346
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,560
Elder Qiu is injured?

347
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,110
Yes.

348
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,800
Who did it?

349
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,219
The villagers, of course.

350
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,150
Now that they've known the truth,

351
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,449
they're determined

352
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,510
to avenge their families.

353
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,760
Where is that monster now?

354
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,630
It ran away.

355
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:43,690
Bo Yan.

356
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,420
Where is he locked?

357
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,320
Grand Elder Qiu has been watching over him.

358
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,469
Someone

359
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,500
must be behind this.

360
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,739
We were set up.

361
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,440
No.

362
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,430
Heng Masters.

363
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,600
It turns out

364
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,590
that Heng Masters are behind this.

365
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,530
Heng Masters?

366
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,570
A cult on the island.

367
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,270
They've been looking for Shen Cong for two years.

368
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,160
We've been protecting Shen Cong,

369
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,910
so they couldn't get her.

370
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,270
Shen Cong is very important.

371
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,070
I remember

372
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,470
the pattern on the cloth.

373
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,030
Is there a temple

374
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,020
in the southeast of the island?

375
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:09,990
Yes.

376
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,060
It's empty.

377
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,010
Deserted.

378
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,880
That place is remote. No one goes there.

379
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,100
How do you know?

380
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,700
That temple

381
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,910
should be related to the cult you mentioned.

382
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,570
Do you know the way?

383
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,750
Yes.

384
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,670
Come with me.

385
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,650
Come with Liuhong.

386
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,530
It's over there.

387
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,480
It's over there.

388
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,230
I'm fine.

389
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,360
Go.

390
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,620
How is he?

391
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,670
The bleeding has stopped,

392
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,320
but

393
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,460
his organs are hurt.

394
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,660
I'm afraid…

395
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,110
I'll go prepare the decoction.

396
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,290
Qiu Zhi.

397
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,080
Have a good rest.

398
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,630
The villagers have all moved here.

399
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,030
Don't worry about Heng Masters.

400
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,960
I got it.

401
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,080
They chose to show up now.

402
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,740
Something terrible will happen.

403
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,080
The one I'm most worried about is Cong.

404
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,160
She's missing.

405
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,560
Then go find her.

406
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,630
Shen Rang.

407
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,600
You must not transform again.

408
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,780
You know,

409
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,030
if this goes on,

410
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,720
you can't turn back into human anymore.

411
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,500
Here we are. Here we are.

412
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,870
Every islander has been here.

413
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,730
November the 8th.

414
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,710
The temple of Heng Master.

415
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,900
Chu Siyu should've been here too.

416
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,110
This is Heng Masters' turf?

417
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,040
According to the clues my brother left me,

418
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,760
it should be here.

419
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,340
Back then, your brother found out

420
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,780
more than we know.

421
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,620
If Shen Cong has really been taken by Heng Masters,

422
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,000
she should be in there.

423
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,400
But Mr. Lei,

424
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,170
we found this place so easily.

425
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,760
I suspect that rag

426
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,590
was left by Heng Masters on purpose.

427
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,930
This may be a trap.

428
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,100
Liuhong.

429
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,760
Cong is not here.

430
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,100
What statue is that?

431
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,980
Maybe it was built by the islanders' ancestors.

432
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,440
The islanders used to worship Xuanming.

433
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,900
The God of the North Sea,

434
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,090
Xuanming.

435
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,230
You're a hero.

436
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,870
I'm a hero too.

437
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,590
A hero is meeting another hero.

438
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,630
Hero.

439
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:36,680
Hero.

440
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,950
Mr. Lei.

441
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,280
Come here.

442
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,460
Hero.

443
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,530
The temple has been deserted for a long time,

444
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,840
but no dust was stirred up when the door was opened.

445
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,040
And it doesn't smell musty or have cobwebs.

446
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,650
Someone must come here regularly.

447
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,150
A hero is meeting another hero.

448
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,300
Hello, hero.

449
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,290
Hero.

450
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,880
The hero is angry.

451
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,410
Please forgive me.

452
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,630
The hero is angry.

453
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,560
Please forgive me, hero.

454
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,990
Please forgive me.

455
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,640
The hero is angry.

456
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,030
Let's go.

457
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,780
Follow me.

458
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,590
Who's it?

459
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,620
Goodbye, Mr. Lei.
