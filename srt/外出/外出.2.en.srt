...that her second daughter graduated from
a good school and entered a nice company...

185
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,680
...and often praised by everyone.

186
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,680
She also said that she took
her granddaughter out last week...

187
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,280
...and bragged to us that both of them look very similar.

188
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,370
Please eat before you go.

189
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,850
[ May her soul rest in peace. ]

190
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,960
<i>My sister also works at a company in Seoul,</i>

191
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,340
<i>but she couldn't come to my mother's shop,
so my niece came instead.</i>

192
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,000
Thank you for coming here.

193
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,580
I'm sorry for what I've done before.

194
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,580
It's nothing, Ma'am.

195
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,580
You are right.

196
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,640
What I have said before was too much.

197
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,970
I'm really sorry.

198
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,220
It's just really okay.

199
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,930
I...

200
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,560
Oh?

201
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,340
Jung-eun.

202
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,540
The world is so good.

203
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,940
It would be better if I know it earlier.

204
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,760
Mi-sook.

205
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,780
Yes.

206
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,090
Please for a moment.

207
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,140
Coming.

208
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,720
Mom.

209
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,460
Say hello to them.

210
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,000
She's my daughter.

211
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,340
Hello. I'm Min-seo.

212
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,160
Hello.

213
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,400
Thank you so much for coming here.

214
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,160
Min-seo, you have to thank them, too.

215
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,200
Thank you so much.

216
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,380
Mother-in-law, shall we go in my car?

217
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,280
I guess it's just nothing for you and mom too.

218
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,180
But I'm about to go crazy here.

219
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,770
Tell me, mom.

220
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,840
On that night,

221
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,420
did you went outside?

222
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,370
I'm asking about that day, got it?

223
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,660
Say it properly.

224
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,540
On the day when Yoo-na died,

225
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,860
I'm asking you if you went outside.

226
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,780
No, right?

227
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,380
Huh?

228
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,440
Jung-eun.

229
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,580
Mom, come and tell me.

230
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,460
Tell me that it's not true.

231
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
Jung-eun, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

232
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,980
Did you know about it, too?

233
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,520
You know about it, too!?

234
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,680
Did both of you fooled me all this time!?

235
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,060
My daughter.

236
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,120
Listen to me first.

237
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Mom...

238
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,300
Didn't you fall asleep
as you've taken medicine for colds?

239
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,240
I have brought some medicine for colds to you.

240
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,420
As I was afraid that Yoo-na may get it too,
so I let you took medicine quickly.

241
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,920
So do you know how much I wanted to die?

242
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,160
That's what had happened to her.

243
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,560
Just all because I asked you to take some medicine.

244
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,100
But those were all just lies!

245
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,100
Why did you leave the child and
go out at home alone during that night?

246
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,960
When Yoo-na was all alone at home,

247
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,220
why did you go outside!?

248
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,340
To see my father-in-law.

249
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,400
What?

250
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,250
We went out to meet my father-in-law.

251
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,490
What did you say?

252
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,980
Go and see whom?

253
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,120
What does that mean?

254
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,160
Mom...

255
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,780
You have been in contact with dad?

256
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Mom...

257
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,530
Did you go out that day to see dad?

258
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,440
It's not true, isn't it?

259
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,650
It's not true, isn't it?

260
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,360
Jung-eun.

261
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,560
Why on earth did you have to meet with dad?

262
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,960
Why did you go to see dad on that day!?

263
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,120
<i>Anyways, just go to sleep first.</i>

264
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,860
<i>Okay. I got it.</i>

265
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,400
<i>Be sure to take your medicine.</i>

266
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,240
<i>Goodness. I said I got it.</i>

267
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,760
<i>I'm taking medicine right now.</i>

268
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,450
<i>Have you been well?</i>

269
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,560
<i>Your Grandma is going to go outside for a moment.</i>

270
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,160
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

271
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,580
<i>I'll be back soon,</i>

272
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,240
<i>so just sleep here.</i>

273
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,400
<i>Give me money.</i>

274
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,980
<i>Hurry up and give me.</i>

275
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,560
<i>If you just treated Jung-eun well...</i>

276
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,140
<i>Why? You won't let me contact her?</i>

277
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,320
<i>Why?</i>

278
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,960
<i>Why? Watching you scared...</i>

279
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,180
<i>Is it usually like this?</i>

280
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,040
<i>Hey, Soon-ok.</i>

281
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,520
<i>As I'm already old now, I have no strength.</i>

282
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,600
<i>Thanks for the money.</i>

283
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,660
I don't know how he got my phone number.

284
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,540
He keeps asking for money.

285
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
So...

286
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,600
As I was afraid that he'll contact you,

287
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,420
so I just gave him money.

288
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,140
On that night,

289
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,600
he suddenly called me on the phone.

290
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,000
To give him money right away.

291
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,920
He knows your home address.

292
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,360
He also knows my phone number.

293
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,340
That's why,

294
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,600
I planned to setlle it out once and for all.

295
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,240
When I met with him,

296
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,840
I asked him not to contact you.

297
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,800
When did you first know about this?

298
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,820
You've already known it from the start?

299
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,120
But why you haven't told me about it? Why!?

300
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Until when are you going to hide it from me?

301
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,970
My son-in-law has done nothing wrong.

302
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,580
I'm the one who's asked a favor from him.

303
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm afraid that I'll lost you too.

304
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,320
I...

305
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,220
I was really afraid.

306
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,480
<i>You see, sir.</i>

307
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,480
<i>Let me be the one to tell it to my daughter.</i>

308
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,720
<i>Please don't tell her now.</i>

309
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,370
<i>Being blown off twice is worse than...</i>

310
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,640
<i>Not right now!</i>

311
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,100
<i>Now... She lost her own child and was miserable.</i>

312
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
<i>In that case, my child may die.</i>

313
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,120
<i>It can't be.</i>

314
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,620
<i>It can't be!</i>

315
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,890
<i>Sir.</i>

316
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,160
<i>Ma'am, please get up. Okay?</i>

317
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,980
<i>I'm asking you a favor.</i>

318
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,020
<i>Please don't let the child's mother know about it,</i>

319
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,960
<i>whether today or later.</i>

320
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,770
<i>Even if you write the true information here,</i>

321
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,060
<i>please don't let the child's mother know it.</i>

322
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,480
<i>Please get up.</i>

323
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,460
<i>Please save us.</i>

324
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,290
<i>If you really told her, she will die too.</i>

325
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,580
<i>I'm asking you.</i>

326
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,020
<i>Please save people.</i>

327
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,940
<i>I'm begging you this way.</i>

328
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,920
It was me who begged him not to tell you.

329
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,660
It was all my fault.

330
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,730
I'm really sorry, Jung-eun.

331
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,420
Then, at the end, it's all for my sake.

332
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,200
That would just mean Yoo-na died because of me.

333
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,980
People like me should have been dead.

334
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,940
As long as Yoo-na will come back to me,

335
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,320
I'm willing to die for a hundred
or even a thousand times.

336
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,570
You're here.

337
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,610
Why do you want to meet in this place?

338
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,730
With lights that are still on.

339
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,080
You didn't contact me when you got married.

340
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
I was disappointed.

341
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,980
Well...

342
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
I heard the community where
you've been living will be redeveloped.

343
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,320
How nice that room prices will rise.

344
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,920
What does your husband do?

345
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,980
You're also at work.

346
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,460
The two of you must have an outstanding credit.

347
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,140
You're that curious about us?

348
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,900
Your mom never tells me about it.

349
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,060
She tried hard not to let me go and see you.

350
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,340
I heard... that you raise a daughter.

351
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,580
How old is her?

352
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,810
She died.

353
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,040
She died?

354
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,400
Because my mom has to meet with you,

355
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,360
my daughter was alone at home
and fell down from the balcony.

356
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,360
For giving me money,

357
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,800
someone got dead?

358
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,360
So what's your point?

359
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,200
Your daughter died for me.

360
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,820
Did you want to see me just to hear that?

361
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,220
So that I can take the blame for that, you wench!?

362
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,040
The fries you've ordered is ready.

363
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,300
Damn it!

364
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,280
Even so,

365
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,340
is your mother doing well?

366
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,580
She still sleep soundly
even if she has killed your child?

367
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,120
Put in your mother's contact number here.

368
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,770
I have lost my phone.

369
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,100
That damn woman, I shall just...

370
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,900
Don't speak like that to her.

371
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,530
What did I do?

372
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,320
Don't contact my mom ever again.

373
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,320
Otherwise, I won't let it go, until then.

374
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,820
Goodness.

375
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
What if I won't do that?

376
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,450
I have clearly told you.

377
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,780
Don't show up again in our lives.

378
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,840
I came here to say that.

379
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,370
Hey!

380
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,160
Jung-eun, why are you angry with me?

381
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,120
Your mother is the one
who made your daughter dead.

382
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,120
No.

383
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,320
It's you who made her dead.

384
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,560
We wanted to get out from you and live happily.

385
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,720
Do you know how hard we've been trying!?

386
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,260
It's you who messed up again.

387
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,780
If not because of you,

388
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,880
my daughter...

389
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,500
...wouldn't have died.

390
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,770
Hey, Jung-eun.

391
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,100
try to ask anyone in this world.

392
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,620
Why would it be my fault?

393
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,960
Your mother is the one
who made your daughter dead.

394
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,700
You wench.

395
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,740
<i>Yoo-na.</i>

396
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,200
<i>Have you done wrong or have not?</i>

397
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,240
<i>I was wrong.</i>

398
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,040
<i>Will you do that again or will not?</i>

399
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,040
<i>I won't do that again.</i>

400
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,340
<i>Grandma, my arm is getting painful.</i>

401
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,440
<i>I can't.</i>

402
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,820
<i>Goodness.</i>

403
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,000
<i>Who's the one who got angry
and tried to bully my daughter?</i>

404
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,260
<i>If my daughter got bullied, I'll get angry too.</i>

405
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,480
<i>Grandma's daughter?</i>

406
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,880
<i>Grandma, do you have a daughter?</i>

407
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,980
<i>Yoo-na.</i>

408
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,880
<i>Can't you speak properly?</i>

409
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,720
<i>I have a daughter.</i>

410
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,960
<i>Grandma, who is your daughter?</i>

411
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,100
<i>Your mom is my daughter.</i>

412
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,160
<i>My mom is your daughter?</i>

413
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,420
<i>Of course.</i>

414
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,520
<i>Then, your mom's mother is who?</i>

415
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,380
<i>Your mom's mother?</i>

416
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,880
<i>Grandma?</i>

417
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,780
<i>You're right!</i>

418
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
<i>Then,</i>

419
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,520
<i>Grandma is my mom's mother?</i>

420
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,040
<i>Mom's mother?</i>

421
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,750
<i>Grandma is my mom's mother.</i>

422
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,640
<i>My mom is my mother.</i>

423
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,860
<i>Mom!</i>

424
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:04,830
<i>- This girl.
- Mom.</i>

425
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,010
<i>- Mom.
- Oh my! My baby girl.</i>

426
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,330
<i>- Mom.
- Don't be like that in the future.</i>

427
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,130
<i>No way. You can't bully my daughter.</i>

428
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,970
Mom.

429
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,890
Mom.

430
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,520
Mom.

431
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,930
Mom.

432
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,740
You have much work?

433
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,290
Today is weekend, though.

434
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,940
Not that much.

435
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,830
Remember to eat your food
and take your medicine.

436
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,330
Then, I'll get going now.

437
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:33,960
Okay.

438
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,380
Mom.

439
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,190
Yes.

440
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,770
I'll come back soon.

441
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,060
<i>I've put some of Yoo-na's photos and videos here.</i>

442
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,760
<i>Just watch them if you want to.</i>

443
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,790
Thank you so much, Ma'am.

444
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:12,380
For real.

445
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,620
I...

446
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,720
I am in the process for filing a divorce.

447
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,390
We're now on the consideration period.

448
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,070
It's too tiring to raise a child,
so I planned to resign.

449
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,450
But finding a job again is more difficult.

450
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,000
Even so, I was able to enter through the program,

451
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,920
so I have to hand over my child to my mom.

452
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,570
That's why, I go back home
to my family every weekends.

453
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,870
Neither I quibbled...

454
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,520
...nor looked down on the company.

455
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,450
I wanted to resolve all misunderstandings.

456
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,130
I haven't misunderstand you.

457
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,940
I must have said too much at that time.

458
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,820
But you know what,

459
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,580
even if all has been corrected,

460
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,860
I don't know if I can still continue to work.

461
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,100
Although my sister can take care of my child,

462
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,340
I can't live with her all the time.

463
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,780
Anyways, I may go to where my sister lives,

464
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,030
and help her with the restaurant business.

465
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,210
It was really nice that I was able to enter the company.

466
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,790
The doctor said...

467
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,310
...that mom always had a headache.

468
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,620
I didn't even know my mom was sick.

469
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,810
I'm afraid my daughter will go that way, too.

470
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,350
When are you going back to work?

471
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,270
Tomorrow.

472
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,120
My three-month leave has already elapsed.

473
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,210
I still feel that it hasn't been three months.

474
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,380
That time passes so slowly.

475
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,550
What on earth I have thought that
I would be happy for 30 years?

476
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,420
30 years?

477
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,970
Isn't our house to be paid for 30 years?

478
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,900
What did you think from the start
while waiting for it to finish after 30 years?

479
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,340
It's strange that it makes me feel at ease.

480
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,020
With the long years that seem to be still,

481
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,740
I think our family will continue to be happy.

482
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,000
Did I complained too much?

483
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,180
Three months seems to be as long as forever.

484
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,830
Today,

485
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,990
I really did what I shouldn't do to you.

486
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,780
I did what I shouldn't do, too.

487
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:35,850
It's all because of me.

488
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,100
Jung-eun.

489
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,180
But do you know what's really scary?

490
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,300
When I lately found out that mom went outside,

491
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,660
do you know what I have thought first?

492
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,300
"Ah,"

493
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,740
"it's not because I asked my mother to take medicine."

494
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,460
That's what I have thought.

495
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,260
That my mother was the one who's at fault.

496
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,420
No matter what it is,

497
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,830
it's all because of what happened to me.

498
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:22,900
<i>We're now going up.</i>

499
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,160
<i>The elevator now closes.</i>

500
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,410
You're gorgeous.

501
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,250
Don't you think she's too gorgeous?

502
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,100
Congratulations on your marriage.

503
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,030
- She's beautiful.
- Shall we take another photo?

504
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,940
Oh my, good for you.

505
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,660
I want to go with you.

506
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,800
Okay.

507
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,460
Your sister-in-law?

508
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,790
Just have a seat.

509
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,100
You wear your wedding dress well.

510
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,220
Sister-in-law, you're gorgeous today.

511
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,870
Sister-in-law.

512
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,630
I'm really sorry for all this time.

513
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,780
What are you sorry for?

514
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,640
Don't cry. Your makeup will fall off.

515
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,280
The child in your womb won't like it if you cry.

516
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,800
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

517
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,590
I sincerely wish for your happiness...

518
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,980
...as you are married...

519
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,320
...and for your child.

520
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,230
- Ma'am and sir, congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

521
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,830
I heard there are  things
to be celebrated other than this.

522
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,820
Well, yes.

523
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,550
Everyone's wedding has been simple recently.

524
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,190
I was deeply sad that my first
granddaughter had passed away.

525
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,680
But God soothes us again and gave us a new life.

526
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,060
Of course.

527
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,310
Congratulations, anyways.

528
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,990
I couldn't do this without you,
so I told Woo-cheol about this.

529
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,110
But I felt that you must have felt uncomfortable.

530
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,660
Even so, since you came here,

531
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,810
I thought that I could express my gratitude to you.

532
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,410
But what's with that expression of yours?

533
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,220
If you're like that,
why did you have to come here?

534
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,690
It's not easy for me to say such things to you.

535
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,740
Do you think I'm really enjoying it today?

536
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,120
Anyways,

537
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,480
as long as my in-laws won't come
here today, that's enough.

538
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,190
What are you here for, son-in-law?

539
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,620
Son-in-law.

540
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I came here for my daughter-in-law.

541
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,920
Do you know about this?

542
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,490
I saw a wedding invitation of
my daughter-in-law from the table.

543
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,760
Mother-in-law, please let's go outside and talk for a bit.

544
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,030
Mom.

545
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,580
Why are you here?

546
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,740
Jung-eun, I'll send her home.

547
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,360
Why did you come here?

548
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:31,830
Just go back, mom.

549
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,750
Jung-eun.

550
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,830
Yoo-na.

551
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,780
Where's Yoo-na?

552
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,350
Mom.

553
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,810
Yoo-na?

554
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,100
Mom, wait a second.

555
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,980
My dear in-law, congratulations.

556
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,920
You're congratulating me?

557
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,860
Yes.

558
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,030
I sincerely congratulate you.

559
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,900
But, by chance, have you seen Yoo-na around here?

560
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,890
Mom!

561
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,820
Just now...

562
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,220
You were looking for Yoo-na?

563
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,710
Mom.

564
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,720
Have you just mentioned Yoo-na now!?

565
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,380
Let me take care of this.

566
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,730
How?

567
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:28,600
How?

568
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,920
How could you speak of Yoo-na's name?

569
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,900
I...

570
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,120
When I think of her,

571
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,560
I feel suffocated.

572
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,900
How can you?

573
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,960
How dare you speak out Yoo-na's name!?

574
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,620
Mom!

575
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,330
Don't hit her!

576
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,240
My Jung-eun.

577
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,940
Don't hit her.

578
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,340
Don't hit my child.

579
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,220
Just hit me instead.

580
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,160
Don't hit my dear Jung-eun.

581
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,180
Don't hurt Jung-eun.

582
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:19,480
Hey.

583
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,130
Hey.

584
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,230
Hurry up and send me home.

585
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,550
Before my granddaughter wakes up,

586
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,210
I have to go back home right now.

587
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,220
Hurry and send me back home.

588
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,980
I have to go back right now.

589
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,650
Can someone send me back home, please?

590
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,710
Please...

591
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,430
...send me back home.

592
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,560
I can't find my way back.

593
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,090
I have to go back early.

594
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,120
Excuse me.

595
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,030
Before my granddaughter wakes up,
I have to go back home right now.

596
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,410
Please send me back home.

597
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,060
Mom.

598
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,940
<i>Excuse me. Please help me send back home.</i>

599
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,010
<i>Excuse me. Please lead me the way.</i>

600
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,500
<i>My granddaughter is waiting for me.</i>

601
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,340
<i>She is waiting at home.</i>

602
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,900
<i>Please send me back home.</i>

603
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,850
My granddaughter is waiting for me.

604
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,190
I have to go back right now.

605
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,860
I can't find my way back.

606
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,400
You can't find your way back?

607
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,830
I can't remember.

608
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,550
Mom.

609
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,940
Mom.

610
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,020
When did that started?

611
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,500
I have to go back fast.

612
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,260
<i>Did she forgot about today's appointment?</i>

613
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,340
<i>I didn't even know my mom was sick.</i>

614
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,670
<i>I'm afraid my daughter will go that way, too.</i>

615
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,960
<i>So I was just worried.</i>

616
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,400
What's with all this fuss!?

617
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,210
That little child was killed by you!

618
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,980
Please don't do this.

619
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,020
Just stop this.

620
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,660
Let's just go.

621
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,020
You have killed that child,

622
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,420
so you should have died together with her, too.

623
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:31,300
Why?

624
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,180
Why would she?

625
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,220
Why does she have to die?

626
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,780
Why everyone thinks it's my mother's fault?

627
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,230
Why should my mom take care of my child?

628
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,100
Why it has to be like this?

629
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,490
Mom.

630
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,500
Let's go back home.

631
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:37,750
To our home.

632
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,900
[ Mentoring Evaluation ]

633
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,880
This is the mentoring evaluation for Shin So-hee.

634
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,900
Have you received her project report?

635
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,140
She sent it through email.

636
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,980
Oh yes. I have received it.

637
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:27,750
She completed the task even
when she attends her mother's wake.

638
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:31,430
This company like this kind of responsibility, right?

639
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,700
Prenatal and lactation leave will just
take only for three months.

640
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,700
Speaking of which,

641
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,670
don't three-month contract workers
have a sense of responsibility?

642
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,400
Do you think it's just done
with a unilateral medical leave?

643
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,980
You can leave now.

644
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,220
That's why, female workers won't do.

645
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,040
They should have just stay at home. Goodness.

646
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,800
It's somewhat strange.

647
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,670
Mothers with children get scolded and face cruelty.

648
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,000
If they don't work overtime,
they'll get scolded to go and do it.

649
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,260
Deputy director.

650
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,110
Team manager.

651
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,280
You said that hiring people who resigned
because of their children is a high risk, didn't you?

652
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,680
But you know what,

653
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,720
female staff working while taking care of their children...

654
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,590
...will only have greater-but-not-worse responsibilities.

655
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:31,110
It seems that you don't know that
this kind of staff resigned in the first place.

656
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,450
Our work life depends on our willingness to do it.

657
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,120
There are no people here who do it without that.

658
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,590
But with that willingness,

659
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:45,420
I often think that those mothers who have
children at home will become weak.

660
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,710
They felt sorry and guilty for themselves.

661
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,180
Ms. Han Jung-eun, what are you doing now!?

662
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,770
Why do mothers always be at fault?

663
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,260
Don't pretend that you don't know it.

664
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:57,960
That makes you more at fault.

665
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,810
And besides,

666
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,080
we're not ignorant people, you know?

667
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,900
Jung-eun.

668
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,260
I... planned to resign.

669
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,000
You'll resign?

670
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:46,860
Why?

671
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,010
I'm pregnant with my second child.

672
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,580
I sincerely congratulate you.

673
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,550
I'm serious.

674
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,540
I sincerely congratulate you.

675
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,910
I know that you're sincere about it.

676
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,060
When I found out that you've worked here too,

677
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,340
I was very happy.

678
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,540
You're in a lower position before,
and currently in a higher position than me.

679
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,260
Honestly speaking, it's actually embarrassing.

680
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,630
But I...

681
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,390
At that time, it was time for me
to return to work after giving birth.

682
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,370
I was having a difficult time.

683
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,090
But you have been doing well.

684
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,880
I have really admired you.

685
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,240
I was really depressed back then.

686
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,740
But suddenly you give birth to your child.

687
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:58,650
"Ah, we finally become working mothers
who'll face at the front line."

688
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,620
But your mother-in-law lived with you
and helped you take care of your child.

689
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,030
I have quite hated you for that.

690
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,470
Since my mom is not there,

691
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,560
I have a hard time, gets peevish,
and have no someone to rely on.

692
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,060
In case of emergency,
there's no one I can ask for help.

693
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,320
Letting our mothers take care of our children...

694
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,820
Could we feel comfortable about it?

695
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,180
This way, I thought of resigning here.

696
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,850
I don't know why I worked so hard during college...

697
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,620
...and make both ends meet.

698
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,240
My mom...

699
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,360
...have liked it...

700
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,550
...when I was first employed.

701
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,020
If she knows that I'm resigning now,

702
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,140
she could be sad.

703
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,850
But do you know what's the most ridiculous?

704
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,750
Even I think so, I still assume...

705
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,710
...that if my mother is still there,

706
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,070
maybe I don't have to resign now.

707
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,250
Even if I resign here, let's meet occasionally.

708
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,260
Let's do that.

709
01:06:59,180 --> 01:06:59,990
Min-joo.

710
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,900
Can I ask a favor from you?

711
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,900
What are you going to do now?

712
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:17,190
What?

713
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,380
Your mother is gone,

714
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,880
how can you take care of the child by yourself?

715
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,650
You're even a contract worker.

716
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,780
Plus, your superior ordered you
to work on time on the next day.

717
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,860
Will it be too harsh?

718
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,360
It's not that I was ordered.

719
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,540
I asked for it because I wanted to be hired.

720
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:34,760
I want to go to work so mom can take care of my child.

721
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,610
You were not such a ruthless person before.

722
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,180
I've been ruthless all this time.

723
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:46,260
You don't know how ruthless it is
to take care of my kids at home by myself.

724
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,260
Because you always think that when I'm
a full-time mother, I'll just stay at home all day.

725
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,660
This is how we became strangers.

726
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,100
[ In front of the family court ]

727
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:21,020
<i>So-hee, the employment results
will come out in a few days.</i>

728
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:24,250
<i>There will be a vacancy in the company's kindergarten.</i>

729
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,130
<i>Single parents are given priority.</i>

730
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,660
<i>Chief Min-joo of our team will help you,</i>

731
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,830
<i>so if you get the offer,
please contact her immediately.</i>

732
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,360
<i>You've worked hard all this time.</i>

733
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,340
<i>I'm sincere.</i>

734
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,470
<i>Mahler made a song with the poems
written by Ruckert after losing his children.</i>
[ Gustav Mahler; Friedrich Ruckert ]

735
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:01,760
<i>The lyrics of our fourth song is like this.</i>

736
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,060
<i>"I often think..."</i>

737
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,360
<i>"...that they have just stepped out."</i>

738
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,240
<i>"And that they will be coming home soon."</i>

739
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,530
<i>"The day is fine,"</i>

740
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,100
<i>"don't be worried."</i>

741
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,970
<i>"They've just gone for a long walk."</i>

742
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,880
<i>At the time Mahler was writing this song,</i>

743
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,650
<i>did he know that he will lose
her little daughter one day?</i>

744
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,370
<i>Our last song for today will be from Mahler's piece.</i>

745
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:40,100
<i>We will be playing "Songs on the Death of Children".</i>

<i>Please enter the passcode.</i>

747
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,390
Hello.

748
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,640
<i>The house is ready to be sold soon.</i>

749
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,240
<i>Why won't you sell it?</i>

750
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,630
<i>Is it because the list price is too cheap?</i>

751
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:57,730
No.

752
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,360
It's not like that.

753
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:06,130
I just can't stand the thought
of changing the house’s passcode.

754
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,640
I'm really sorry.

755
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,400
Mom.

756
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:37,640
Let's go...

757
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,800
...and see Yoo-na tomorrow.

758
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:46,660
She must had really missed you.

759
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,740
Where did she go?

760
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:02,840
Yoo-na...

761
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,350
...went outside to play for a little while.

762
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,410
Just for a little while.

763
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,980
[ Mom, thank you so much. ]
[ Dad, thank you so much ]

764

<i>Oh my. My little cutie.</i>

<i>Mom.</i>

769
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:05,600
<i>I'm going to go down over there.</i>

770
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,100
<i>- Okay.
- Mom, come and see me.</i>

771

<i>Here.</i>

<i>Wow, that's great!</i>

774
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,760
<i>Go there and see the flowers, Yoo-na.</i>

775
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,210
<i>Here we go.</i>

776
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,860
<i>Try to jump.</i>

777

<i>Let me see how high you jump.</i>

778

<i>V.</i>

779
