00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,540
Oh, mom.

3
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,380
Did Yoo-na already fell asleep?

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,280
Wait for a second.

5
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,030
Goodness.

6
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,560
She has just slept.

7
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,080
Yes.

8
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,550
She kept arguing that she would wait
until her mother comes back.

9
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,950
I had a hard time.

10
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,530
<i>Goodness.</i>

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,330
<i>Yoo-na is unbelievable.</i>

12
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,170
<i>Did she already eat?</i>

13
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,750
Yes, she did.

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,550
She had eaten a bowl of rice with spinach soup.

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,570
<i>Really?</i>

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,400
<i>What's going on her?</i>

17
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,630
She used her own small chopsticks
and take out all the spinach.

18
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,060
Those little hands of her are flexible.

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,110
<i>Mom.</i>

20
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,130
<i>Will Yoo-na be able to succeed
in the future, just like me?</i>

21
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,710
Who's daughter is she though, huh?

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,440
Why would she be different from you?

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,970
She's smart, you know.

24
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,880
Mom, you have colds?

25
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,150
<i>What? This is just nothing.</i>

26
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,120
Take medicine.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,340
<i>It's not colds. I'm just normally coughing.</i>

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,720
Yoo-na may get infected from you.

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,610
Hurry up and take the medicine.

30
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,450
There should it be in the drawer.

31
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,720
Seriously. I can take care of myself.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,010
Okay, fine.

33
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,810
But why had a company meal suddenly?

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,810
Well, someone from the company came in.

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,630
A new employee?

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,250
It's not the case.

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,670
There's just someone.

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,250
Anyways, I think I'll be late today.

39
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
Okay, I got it.

40
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,490
Hey, don't worry about Yoo-na.
Just stay there until the end.

41
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,880
I stayed here to make it easier for you to work.

42
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,210
If you have to leave early
because of your child,

43
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,320
your colleagues would be upset.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,900
Forget it,

45
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,380
I don't even intend to become the president.

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,340
You said before that you want to make money for me.

47
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,630
I said it?

48
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,050
I don't remember it.

49
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,720
I still want to live a normal life.

50
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,760
But I think it's not easy anymore.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,650
Anyways, just go to sleep first.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,780
Be sure to take your medicine.

53
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,210
You must.

54
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,320
Okay.

55
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm hanging up.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,500
Hey, this guy started it again.

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,780
Way back then,

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,300
he took a pineapple and put it there...

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
...and said, "I'm going to the military".

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,340
It's over just by saying it,

61
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,250
so I said, "What's that!?".

62
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,010
"I'm asking you what is this, punk?"

63
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,850
"Damn it! Are you possessed?"

64
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,830
"I don't think you're sentimental."

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Yes, honey.

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,280
Has the company dinner ended?

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,940
Why do I feel like I'm all alone?

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,650
What?

69
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,360
I remembered my period all by myself.

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,050
I take the injections by myself.

71
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,670
I have to ask for leave
every time I go to the hospital.

72
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,070
I'm an outcast in the company, too.

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,870
Then, I got pregnant,

74
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,780
and the child was born
after suffering 20 hours of pain.

75
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,920
But why do I still feel that I am alone?

76
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,620
Jung-eun, why are you like this?

77
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,340
<i>What is this?</i>

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,230
I also know that you have suffered a lot.

79
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,140
Don't just know how I suffered.
Know my mother's sufferings, too.

80
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,440
<i>Of course, I know that.</i>

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,140
When my mother-in-law's birthday comes,

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,700
shall we let her go for a trip overseas?

83
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,300
Or else, let's just wait for Yoo-na's
birthday and hang out together.

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,250
Mom's birthday is on Christmas, you know.

85
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,720
The travel fees are expensive,
how can we go overseas?

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,270
Besides,

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,160
if we want Mom to hang out with us,
would she want to go?

88
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,670
If she'll go, who will take care of Yoo-na?

89
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,320
Hey, it's not like she specializes
in taking care of two persons.

90
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,540
Honestly speaking, she came to Seoul because of you.

91
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't you remember it?

92
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,560
When you tried to get slot from the nursery.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,010
you didn't apply until you are six months pregnant.

94
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,850
As a result, your priority number was at 880.

95
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,500
I have never forget it.

96
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,530
Then, why did you say I shouldn't apply until then?

97
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,470
The child's condition is not too good
that I have to go to the hospital reguarly.

98
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,220
To be honest, you didn't want to have a baby before,

99
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,320
so you have waited until now
and that made you at fault.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,250
You have agreed to have a baby
after I become the section head.

101
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,050
<i>And now what?</i>

102
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,470
<i>I regard my mother as someone
who specializes in caring for both of us?</i>

103
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,120
It's you who thinks that way, isn't it?

104
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,430
As soon as my mom came in to our home,

105
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,030
you just tune in to the 9:00 evening program.

106
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,690
Do you find it nice that someone
will care for you after?

107
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,340
Hey, Han Jung-eun.

108
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,360
PD.

109
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,340
The program is about to begin.

110
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,560
We'll talk about it later.

111
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,940
If you want to say anything,
you must speak English.

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,160
Okay. All men have to...

113
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,030
Sir.

114
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,340
Oh, Han Jung-eun.

115
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,360
You didn't went home?

116
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,610
No. I just went outside to make a call.

117
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,250
Okay.

118
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,120
So you're going home now?

119
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,380
Your child is sick?

120
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,100
Yes. I'm really sorry.

121
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,760
We shouldn't have done
Shin So-hee's welcome pary today.

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,300
Within the next three months,

123
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,230
you are about to build a relationship with her.

124
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,360
It's not good to leave first, you know.

125
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,940
I'm really sorry.

126
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,100
Do you think no one else here has a child?

127
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,900
There are even women who haven't worked
for a while because of their children.

128
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,850
But if you want to have a good life,
you have to consider your situation.

134
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,870
Hey, have your own drinks.

- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,580
I went...

177
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,500
...to the pharmacy.

178
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,010
Why did you go there?

179
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,370
I had a company dinner today.

180
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,540
So I went home late.

181
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,760
I called my mom in advance.

182
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,430
My mom has a cough.

183
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,100
I let my mom...

184
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,340
...take care of Yoo-na.

185
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,180

My mom's home is not at Seoul.

188
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,850
But because of my work,

189
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,870
she has to move together with us at our home.

190
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,610
I told my mom about this.

191
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,670
Since she coughs so badly,

192
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,030
and I don't want Yoo-na to get caught from it,

193
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,010
I let her hurry up and take her medicine.

194
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,420
But I didn't remember if there
is any medicine at home.

And due to an unexpected situation,

201
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,580
she fell down into the flower bed outside
from the bedroom window.

202
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,120
Based from the analysis of collected fingerprints...

set from outside the bedroom,

will become regular employees?

214
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,430
I know.

215
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,250
Honestly speaking, this program...

216
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,450
...is something unfavorable from our point of view.

217
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,810
But the government required us
to do that so we abide on it.

218

Honestly speaking, those employees
who resign for their children's sake...

219

I mean, I'm not disparaging

once the birth certificate is completed,
go to nursery for registration...

271
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,700
...and wait for it to be registered
in public kindergartens and private day-cares.

272
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,100
Even so, entering at a public kindergarten
is also like winning a lottery ticket.

273
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,500
Since it's a family system,
and as long as your husband is Korean,

274
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,320
being a dual worker family
with many children won't help you at all.

Why not find someone
who can do household chores al day?

help me take care of them?

Pardon?

334
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,580
Well, yes.

335
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,560

It seems that he really likes classical music.

346
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,520
Well, of course.

347
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,340
Since childhood, he already liked it.

348
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,600
Can I request for a song next time?

349
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,250
I'm already on leave.

350
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,660
You're on leave?

351
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,380
What are you dissatisfied with?

352
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
Because of my children, I have to set a date.

353
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,580
It's just a meeting for today.

354
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,250
It's not even an ordinary meal.

355
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,050
I told you that I might not be able to come today.

356
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,520
And also,

357
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,370
when their family first heard
that Woo-kyung has children,

358
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,850
they didn't made a good expression.

359
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,740
And heard that your dad is a professor...

360
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,320
...and fell in love with me after I became a radio PD.

361
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,700
But...

362
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,960
Why should you say that you're on leave now?

363
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,650
Because it's the truth.

364
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,250
Even so.

365
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,980
Then, you should have resisted for not saying it.

366
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,450
Goodness. It's too embarrasing.

367
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,870
You feel ashamed?

368
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,880
Your daughter held a wedding
just three months after my child's death.

369
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,180
Don't you feel ashamed?

370
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,320
What?

371
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,270
What are you doing? Get in.

372
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,650
You think this is about getting married now?

373
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,570
What should I do if they have children, then?

374
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,610
Our in-laws said that they have
to work hard before they grow big.

375
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,230
What's wrong with you?

376
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,570
How come you don't understand what I've felt?

377
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,410
Then, do you understand what I've felt?

378
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,920
Or else, why don't you tie it up and compare it?

379
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,160
Who's someone's heart
do you think have gone rotten!?

380
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,520
I mean, why are you losing your temper on me?

381
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,410
Is that because of me?

382
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,670
Where are you going?

383
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,430
Get on the car.

384
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Just go first. I'll follow you soon.

385
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,040
<i>That's why, I told you to just stay at home
until Yoo-na starts to go to school.</i>

386
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,540
<i>I have begged you to just stay at home.</i>

387
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,520
<i>Are you still a mother in this way!?</i>

388
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,010
<i>What to do?</i>

389
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,120
<i>What should we do?</i>

390
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,210
You see, Ma'am.

391
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,870
I'm not sure how to say this to you.

392
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,610
I'm really sorry for that day.

393
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,560
Because of me, they have to held a company dinner.

394
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,630
So-hee.

395
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,680
I hope you will not say anything about that anymore.

396
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,670
<i>The elevator is going down.</i>

397
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,580
<i>The door is about to close.</i>

398
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,760
<i>I watched over the house and left.</i>

399
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
<i>It's very neat and I liked the place.</i>

400
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,980
<i>I'm reconsidering it at the moment.</i>

401
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,700
<i>I can adjust the selling price.</i>

402
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,140
<i>Help me sell it as soon as possible.</i>

403
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,380
Damn you! Why are you blocking my way?

404
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,120
Damn it! What the hell is this?

405
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,030
Damn it!

406
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,960
What a nuisance!

407
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,450
Goodness! What a nuisance!

408
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,900
Hey, are you ignoring me now!?

409
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,260
- Are you ignoring me, huh?
- Please just leave!

410
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,180
How dare the two of you team up together!?

411
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,760
Damn you!

412
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,650
[ Police ]

413
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,960
Thank you so much.

414
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,080
You see,

415
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,850
I thank you for what you did before, so...

416
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,520
No need. It's just fine.

417
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
Please just bring this with you.

418
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,500
Thank you.

419
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,610
Thank you.

[ Yoo-na's dad ]

421
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,340
<i>Hello.</i>

422
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,270
Jung-eun.

423
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,410
Yes.

424
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,630
Why?

425
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,250
<i>You're off from work?</i>

426
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,720
I am.

427
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,560
<i>Next week, my sister will give birth.</i>

428
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,920
<i>Let's go together this Sunday.</i>

429
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,340
<i>Jung-eun.</i>

430
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,610
Just go by yourself.

431
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,860
<i>We want to have a home full of children.</i>

432
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,430
<i>Jung-eun.</i>

433
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,630
<i>I guess it's a daughter.</i>

434
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,650
Yoo-na.

435
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,740
Mom...

436
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:41,420
I should have hold this tight and hug you.

437
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,830
I was wrong.

438
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,540
It's all my fault.

439
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm really sorry, my child.

440
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,980
I'm really sorry, Yoo-na!

441
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,120
Yoo-na!

442
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,230
It's really strange.

443
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,050
We get stuck from the traffic jam every day.

444
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,900
Every day?

445
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,430
What?

446
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,120
Do you often come this way?

447
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,270
Ever since Mom came to Seoul,

448
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,230
I've never went to her house.

449
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,870
I've been there a few times to see her recently.

450
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,250
And also... This one.

451
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,450
I didn't want to give it to you.

452
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,720
But you two are very close,

453
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,830
so I'm giving it to you.

454
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,580
Woo-kyung is pregnant.

455
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,230
Please convey my sincere wishes to her.

456
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,300
How months is her baby?

457
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,980
3 months or so.

458
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,430
It should have been the time when Yoo-na left us.

459
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,760
Call Mom and tell her...

460
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,500
...we'll be there 30 minutes later.

461
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,540
You just call her.

462
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,780
I'm driving the car right now.

463
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,500
<i>Dear user, the number you have dialed does not exist.</i>

464
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,010
<i>Please confirm and call again.</i>

465
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,250
Oh, right.

466
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,230
She changed her phone number.

467
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,630
Why?

468
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,270
When?

469
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,920
Well, she may have lost her phone.

470
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,100
Use my phone.

471
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,250
Let's just go.

472
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,030
Why aren't you getting out?

473
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,030
I just don't want to go outside.

474
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,250
I'm tired of listening to others' comfort.

475
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,900
Just go and come back.

476
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,980
I'll just stay here.

477
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Okay.

478
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,520
Mother-in law, this is me. Woo-cheol.

479
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,560
Mother-in-law, you're inside, right?

480
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,830
I've called you many times that I'll come here.

481
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,230
Have you forgotten it?

482
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,070
Well, yes.

483
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,830
Mother-in-law, haven't you eaten yet, right?

484
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,940
Then, please get ready and come out.

485
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,250
We'll be waiting here outside.

486
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,960
Well, mother-in-law.
Jung-eun is also joining with us.

487
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,430
Please hurry up and come out.

488
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,780
Did she forgot about today's appointment?

489
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,850
She'll come out soon.

490
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,540
Mother-in-law, eat this. It's already cooked.

491
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,430
Want me to grill some garlic?

492
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,940
Don't you like eating garlic, right?

493
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,610
Oh my, aren't you Choi Soon-ok?

494
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm Mi-sook, you know.

495
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,140
I opened a store at the central market
but you have moved.

496
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,690
You don't remember it?

497
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,180
My mom goes in the same church with you.

498
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,760
You're the one who persuaded her.

499
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,850
You have come to Seoul for a while?

500
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
My family also came here.

501
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,850
I see.

502
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,180
So this is your daughter and son-in-law.

503
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,120
- Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

504
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,070
Gosh. I'm envious of you.

505
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,610
My sister also works at a company in Seoul,

506
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,050
but she couldn't come to my mother's shop,
so my nephew came instead.

507
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,830
Huh? But what about the child?

508
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,700
You didn't bring her with you?

509
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,500
Oh my. Where did my senses go?
Please wait a second.

510
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,010
Mom! Choi Soon-ok is here.

511
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,430
She was the one who opened
a fruit stand and went to Seoul.

512
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,870
Huh?

513
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,870
What did you say?

514
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,410
I can't hear you.

515
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,580
What? I told you Choi Soon-ok is here.

516
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,120
What's wrong? Why?

517
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,670
Jung-eun.

518
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,560
Oh, what to do?

519
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,540
Really? I didn't know it.

520
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,230
Jung-eun.

521
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,580
- Choi Soon-ok.
- Choi Soon-ok.

522
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,290
I came to know the news later.
I couldn't even call you.

523
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
I'm sorry that I couldn't call you.

524
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,180
When did you come? You should have contacted me.

525
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,740
We beg your pardon.

526
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,980
Please wait a minute.

527
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,520
Choi Soon-ok.

528
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,410
At times like this, you need
to meet and talk with people...

529
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,540
Mother-in-law, didn't you remember it?

530
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,050
I remember it.

531
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,360
Have a seat.

532
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,500
I'll bring you coffee.

533
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,360
Have a seat, mother-in-law.

534
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,900
Would you like to watch a TV series?

535
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,070
Does this TV still work?

536
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,380
What are you looking for?

537
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,650
Where is the coffee beans placed?

538
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,580
Let me make it. Just go and take a rest.

539
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,960
Just let me be. I'll do it.

540
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,740
Mother-in-law, your TV is broken again.

541
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,850
It should be replaced with a new one.

542
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,480
It's okay. Why need to spend money?

543
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,100
Mother-in-law.

544
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,360
It won't be good for your eyesight.

545
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,520
I'll just buy a good one for you.

546
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,940
By the way, I just looked at the door
and door bell which were broken.

547
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,450
I just hit it with my shoulder and it opened after.

548
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,030
It doesn't matter.

549
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,180
No one will barge in.

550
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,410
I'll go and take a look at it.

551
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,380
Jung-eun.

552
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,210
I'm sorry.

553
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,940
I am...

554
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,980
...really sorry.

555
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,160
I'm sorry.

556
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,030
Why do you feel sorry for it?

557
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,120
You fell asleep after taking cold medicine, didn't you?

558
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,410
It's not like you did it on purpose.

559
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,630
That's why, let's...

560
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,830
...stop talking about it again.

561

Mother-in-law.

562
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,130

to repair your door and doorbell.

Let me be alone for a while.

567

568
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,630
Okay, then. Come inside after.

569
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,520
I'll go inside.

570
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,180
Why do you suddenly became good to my mom?

571
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,070
What?

572
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,340
It is because you feel sorry for her?

573
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,050
As soon as she arrived at Seoul,
I asked her to take care of my child...

574
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,810
...that I'm like an arm-flinging shopkeeper,
[ Somebody who asks others to work but does nothing himself ]

575
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,180
so I haven't done my duty as a mother, have I?

576
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,360
Jung-eun, it's not like that.

577
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,030
You don't hate my mother?

578
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,520
She's not on my side, but towards her son-in-law?

579
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,490
Was it because I was her daughter?

580
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,340
Jung-eun.

581
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,100
I acknowledge it now.

582
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,340
It's not my mother's fault.

583
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,850
I've thought about it hundreds, thousands...

584
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,070
...and millions of times.

585
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,120
Unexpected things can happen to anyone.

586
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,920
And that it only happened to me.

587
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:40,070
But when I saw my mom today,

588
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,470
I can't pretend that nothing happened
and laugh it off, just like you.

589
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,230
I won't be able to do that.

590
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,430
Everyone mutters about us.

591
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,700
You saw her just now, right?

592
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,410
But I can't blame her at all.

593
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,650
My mother sad she's sorry.

594
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,740
She said sorry to me.

595
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,850
But I couldn't say that I'm not fine.

596
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,780
Why you have able to cope up
with this as if nothing happens?

597
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,410
How did you do that?

598
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,830
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird?

599
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,960
I seriously...

600
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,570
...don't know what to do.

601
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,610
I know it, too.

602
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,940
My mom is not at fault.

603
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,290
She has to take care of Yoo-na for my sake.

604
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,100
Of course, I always knew in my head
that I shouldn't blame her.

605
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,700
But when I saw my mom today, I...

606
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,940
I...

607
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,720

608

609

<i>The call you made is not answered.

613

She won't answer her phone.

00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,830
Try calling her once again.

615
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,250
But since I'm calling your mother,

616
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,300
she won't usually pick it up at once.

617
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,810
It's just fine.

618
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:39,410
She won't be really surprised
if we just come out and go back.

619
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,270
You know the passcode?

620

621

If you're going to die, I'll kill myself, too.

[ Contacts; Son-in-law ]

656
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,810
My wife's maternity leave will elapse next week,

657
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,850
and last week, my mother-in-law arrived home.

658
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,100
Helping us to look after baby is grateful enough,

659
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,030
but I find it uncomfortable for her to live with us.

660
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,250
It would be better if we earn together, at least,
so we can repay our loan interest.

661
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,430
Indeed.

662
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,070
So even if you find it uncomfortable
to live with her, just bear with it.

663
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:22,270
It's not easy for women
to find a job again once they resign.

664
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,270
Didn't your sister-in-law work too?

665
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,770
But she said it was really boring
to be at home with the children.

666
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,030
But now that she rested for more than two years,
she occasionally contacts my family.

667
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,850
Even so, if she finds a job later,
you have to let her go.

668
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,100
Then, what about my child?

669
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,980
Your mother-in-law is there, isn't it?

670

You just said she's there.

671
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,530
At that time, you should make
good use of your mother-in-law.
