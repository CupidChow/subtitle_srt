- See you again.

184
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,323
Ah, tonight I will spend the night over at the reservoir.

185
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:31,403
If you don't want to go, I can take you back to the city.

186
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,260
How could I not want to go?

187
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,860
I will follow wherever you go.

188
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:41,360
I told you. You can't escape from me.

189
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,508
Toey!

190
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:46,655
Can I please be the driver on our way back?

191
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:49,094
If I sit in the back,

192
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:51,863
I get dizzy.

193
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,396
Up to you.

194
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,635
It's good for me too. Sitting is better than driving.

195
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,878
Just park here.

196
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:02,713
- Right here?
- Yeah.

197
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,736
Sun.

198
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,364
Let's go.

199
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,063
Let me.

200
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:07,503
This is the best it can hold.

201
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,738
Are you bleeding?

202
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:29,580
You should have been more careful. Let me see.

203
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,903
I'm fine.

204
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:33,103
Wipe with this.

205
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,553
Where are you going?

206
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,600
To take photos of the sunset.

207
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,240
Do you want me to go with you?

208
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,220
That's totally up to you.

209
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,180
You walk too fast. Do you want me to go with you?

210
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,060
- I don't care.
- You don't act normal.

211
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,940
Tell me if you want me to go with you or not.

212
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,760
I don't know. You're gonna fall.

213
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,260
Don't walk so fast. Walk slowly.

214
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,719
Want me to go together with you? Tell me.

215
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:39,484
- I don't want to say it.
- Don't want to say what?

216
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:09,960
♫ I can hear you asking many people ♫

217
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,740
♫ What must love be like? ♫

218
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,720
♫ Today, you said you couldn't answer ♫

219
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,560
♫ Deceptive words that everyone keeps adding to the true story of love ♫

220
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,560
♫ It might make your heart tremble ♫

221
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,280
♫ I ask you not to be afraid of what love is ♫

222
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,580
♫ When you feel it, it's a matter of the heart ♫

223
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,660
♫ Trust yourself for once ♫

224
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,020
♫ Like my love, it ordered me to have you ♫

225
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,083
♫ Like my love, it ordered me to have you ♫

226
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,120
♫ Let me have only you ♫

227
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,480
♫ Let me have only you ♫

228
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,920
♫ It's the only reason I want to confirm: I love you ♫

229
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,200
♫ It's the only reason I want to confirm: I love you ♫

230
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,610
Are you okay?

231
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,760
I'm fine.

232
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,821
Beautiful, isn't it?

233
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,783
This angle is better.

234
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,283
Hey, let me take it for you.

235
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,630
- No.
- It's fine.

236
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,190
- No, please.
- Don't be so stubborn. Hurry.

237
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,820
Be careful.

238
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm not gonna fall.

239
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,530
You're so stuffed.

240
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,900
Hurry up, it's so high.

241
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,340
Smile. 1, 2...

242
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,824
Wait.

243
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:54,664
Your hair.

244
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,071
Don't look at me like that, In.

245
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,761
Why can't I?

246
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,260
Hold on.

247
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,709
Can we talk nicely for a sec?

248
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,992
I miss that trip.

249
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,651
The trip we went on together.

250
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,645
We went there by train.

251
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:00,655
Our school trip when we were in Grade 11.

252
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,360
Hello.

253
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,113
My name is Akin Ruengtakul.

254
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:12,700
I'm a new student. This is my first day.

255
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,488
Please advise me.

256
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,559
Why did you enjoy bullying me?

257
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,837
I don't know.

258
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,863
You were too cute, I guess.

259
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,437
I already know that.

260
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,143
But you know something?

261
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:43,043
You are not a lovely person at all.

262
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,420
But you still like me.

263
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,860
That's true.

264
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,300
Actually, I should have hated you.

265
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,346
I know, right?

266
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,353
Then, why?

267
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,303
When you like someone, you don't need a reason.

268
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,043
If I could turn back time,

269
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,609
I would still bully you.

270
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,048
Because you are a bad person.

271
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,652
If we talked nicely back then,

272
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,440
it might not have turned out like this.

273
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,253
I miss you so much, Sun.

274
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,417
Yes, Toey?

275
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:20,823
Damn. We are up this high. How could there still be a signal?

276
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:23,723
What network does he use?

277
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:27,584
Yes, I'm here to take pictures. I'll get back shortly.

278
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,685
Okay.

279
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,060
Wait, Sun.

280
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,040
Can we stay here for a little while?

281
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,088
How did you find this place?

282
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,752
Do you know Google?

283
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,460
Don't bug me.

284
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,525
I don't know who I got it from.

285
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,400
♫ One day I walked into the woods ♫

286
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:44,940
♫ I met a bird and it asked me where I was going ♫

287
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,187
♫ So I answered, I want to go to a far away place ♫

288
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:55,427
♫ Further than I've ever been ♫

289
00:35:55,427 --> 00:36:01,000
♫ Oh, oh ♫

290
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,760
♫ If I am weary, I will go into the woods ♫

291
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:17,620
♫ At least I don't have to meet a mean person like you ♫

292
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:25,280
♫ A person who has no kindness or commitment for people to once love each other ♫

293
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,260
♫ A person who is cruel like you deserves to be left alone ♫

294
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:39,760
♫ In case you become lonely, we will come back to love each other ♫

295
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,640
How was it, Toey?

296
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,860
Nice choice of song.

297
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,100
Absolutely.

298
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,748
Toey,

299
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,843
you don't have a lover yet?

300
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:54,085
That's private. Why are you trying to pry?

301
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,019
Why?

302
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:59,618
I can't ask you?

303
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:03,187
Now... no.

304
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,300
But I'm waiting.

305
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,244
Maybe soon.

306
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,042
How did you become close with Sun?

307
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:15,087
We often traveled to take pictures together.

308
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,853
And we have a lot in common.

309
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:22,034
Like... about five or six times already right?

310
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,849
That many times?

311
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,460
Or was it more than that?

312
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,900
It's so often I lost count.

313
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,420
Sun, can I have your guitar?

314
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,530
You know how to play?

315
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,380
Yes.

316
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,991
♫ Honestly speaking, I'm upset ♫

317
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:59,342
♫ that you bring him here with you ♫

318
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:02,695
♫ Honestly speaking, I'm not happy ♫

319
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:06,080
♫ Honestly speaking, I'm not happy ♫

320
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:13,335
♫ Even though you say he's not important ♫

321
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:20,857
♫ but the look in your eyes says otherwise ♫

322
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:26,940
♫ I fear that you will get shaken as he is in your life ♫

323
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:35,080
♫ The more I see you talk to him, the more I know you love to be with him ♫

324
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:41,060
♫ I fear of what he might think of you ♫

325
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:49,380
♫ I fear of losing you to him. The more I think, the more I feel hurt ♫

326
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,060
♫ I don't want him to be there next to you ♫

327
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,520
♫ Every time I see you with him ♫

328
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,160
♫ I feel like I could die in front of you, so please ♫

329
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:09,773
♫ please don't make me paranoid any longer if you still care for me ♫

330
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:16,320
♫ Can you not see him ever again? ♫

331
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:58,933
Why give it to me if you are cold?

332
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,306
To keep you warm.

333
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:05,235
Or do you want me to hug you instead?

334
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,638
Don't talk nonsense.

335
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:14,588
You walked away from Toey because you wanted me to come after you. Right?

336
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,773
Why are you doing this, In?

337
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:33,019
Then, why are you avoiding me?

338
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:36,304
You intend to cut me out of your life.

339
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:38,384
But I can't seem to avoid you anyway.

340
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,507
Then, don't avoid me.

341
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:49,386
Can't we be like before?

342
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:52,371
I'm tired of being your love advisor.

343
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:58,192
I don't want to be involved in your relationship with any of your girlfriends.

344
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:02,500
I already told you

345
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,950
that I can't stand staying like this with you.

346
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:10,564
I want to know where I stand...

347
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,270
because I don't think of you as just a friend.

348
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,990
Don't you understand?

349
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:21,320
Sun, calm down first.

350
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,850
How many time have you been like this for the past three years, In?

351
00:41:29,057 --> 00:41:31,400
Try to be in my shoes.

352
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,505
Do you have to do this?

353
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,137
You are really a jerk.

354
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:42,920
If I'm a jerk, you might as well hate me.

355
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,683
If I could hate you, I would.

356
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:47,308
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

357
00:41:56,552 --> 00:41:58,432
Be my boyfriend.

358
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,600
But I'm not forcing you.

359
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,880
If you don't want to,

360
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
there is someone waiting for me.

361
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,872
You should bear that in mind.

362
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:04,298
Can you see the stars like this in Bangkok?

363
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,860
There are too many neon lights there, right?

364
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:18,632
So you can't see anything good there.

365
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:21,800
It's not the time to be cool, seriously.

366
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,640
I feel pity for you.

367
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:28,360
You can say anything because you won.

368
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,140
You came a long way...

369
00:43:34,022 --> 00:43:36,682
just to give up easily?

370
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:42,280
You know something?

371
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:48,584
It's really a wonderful thing when you realize who you love.

372
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:56,485
But someone chooses to deny it...

373
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,420
with some reason that has nothing to do with his own feelings.

374
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,100
Sun must really like you.

375
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,080
Love does make people stupid.

376
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,080
Think carefully.

377
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,400
Here you go. I brought you some warm water.

378
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,820
Thank you so much.

379
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,819
What is it this time?

380
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,800
Everything.

381
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,260
Sun,

382
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,550
certain people need to be stimulated

383
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,220
to make them see the valuable things they have.

384
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,080
But I'm not that valuable.

385
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,523
If In had thought the same as me,

386
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,100
he would have probably wanted to be together with me a long time ago.

387
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,800
But...

388
00:45:51,337 --> 00:45:52,740
Forget it.

389
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,050
He will go back tomorrow.

390
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,560
It will be the end.

391
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,244
Can you end your feeling with him?

392
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:08,824
No matter how hard you try to run from it, you can't.

393
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,400
It hurts so much.

394
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,467
I am sorry.

395
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,469
Come on.

396
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:57,980
I'm okay. You don't need to worry about me.

397
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,520
I knew from the start that, no matter how hard I try,

398
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,232
I can't make you not think of me as a big brother.

399
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,110
That's not true.

400
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:14,583
If I don't have In, I would probably be with you.

401
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,300
You don't like an uncle with a beard like me.

402
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,120
I think your type is a big bulky guy. Right?

403
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,320
Don't be ridiculous, Toey.

404
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,360
Don't worry.

405
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,300
With my handsome face, I won't be heartbroken for too long.

406
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,340
Thank you.

407
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,960
Enough, I might not be able to hold it in.

408
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,780
I am your little bother.

409
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,360
The person who gave you the scarf is probably cold to death.

410
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,620
Let's go and find him.

411
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,990
Go find him. Hurry.

412
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,853
Toey, In is not back yet.

413
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:33,612
Where could he be?

414
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,900
It's late now. What should we do?

415
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:49,160
He turned off the phone.

416
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,470
Let's split up to search for him.

417
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,510
It's getting colder.

418
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,080
Wait, Sun.

419
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,920
Take care of yourself.

420
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,420
Yes.

421
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,300
In.

422
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:17,400
In.

423
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,747
In, are you here?

424
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,527
In.

425
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,660
What prank are you playing?

426
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,640
In.

427
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,244
In.

428
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,326
In.

429
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,700
In.

430
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,680
What prank are you playing?

431
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,416
I...

432
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,060
I just wanted to see the stars clearer.

433
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:10,262
But look,

434
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,729
the batteries are dead.

435
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:15,449
I can't go back.

436
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,760
What a loser.

437
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,760
Yes.

438
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,380
I really am a loser.

439
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,240
I cannot get anything done.

440
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:37,319
I wanted to reconcile with you and I failed.

441
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:47,101
I wanted to cut ties with you and I failed, too.

442
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:55,789
I'm sorry.

443
00:50:57,678 --> 00:51:01,818
I didn't realize I had been really selfish with you.

444
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,213
Now you know.

445
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:10,129
Yes, I know.

446
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,960
Then, you must compensate me.

447
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,780
Compensate?

448
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:24,311
That is, you're going to let me steal you away from Toey?

449
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:27,540
You will never know if you don't try.

450
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,080
How am I supposed to steal you away?

451
00:51:34,102 --> 00:51:39,614
Whether you manage to steal me from Toey or not,

452
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:41,500
I'll be the one who decides.

453
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,279
Can you tell me now how you feel about me?

454
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:06,886
I...

455
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,700
I love you, Sun.

456
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,880
So?

457
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,620
I won't lose you to anyone again.

458
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,163
If people ask about our relationship, what will you say?

459
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,120
I will say that we are a couple.

460
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,854
Do you dare to admit that?

461
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,920
Up until now,

462
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,050
I didn't understand myself.

463
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:53,920
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of or what I'm waiting for.

464
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:58,231
You know what you want pretty late.

465
00:52:58,231 --> 00:52:59,960
I should just smack you...

466
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:02,280
Do you dare?

467
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,880
I do!

468
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,180
Are you cold?

469
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,966
We can stay warm together.

470
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,140
I...

471
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,594
I love you, In.

472
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,729
I have known that for a long time.

473
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,100
Long time?

474
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,240
A really long time.

475
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,120
For how long?

476
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,560
Toey.

477
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,520
Toey.

478
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,840
Toey.

479
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,960
Sun, all the pictures are saved in here.

480
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Submit them for the contest.

481
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,160
You can find your way back to the city. Right?

482
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,163
Have quality time with him.

483
00:54:56,163 --> 00:54:57,757
Bearded Uncle.

484
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,100
In, if you can't take care of Sun well enough, I will take him back.

485
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:30,857
He's In, the person I told you about.

486
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:32,997
This is him?

487
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,300
I'll help you.

488
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,040
- You sure?
- Yes.

489
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,087
Love each other as long as you can.

490
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,800
Don't worry about me, I can find a way back to where I was.

491
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,200
P.S. Sun is not as weak and gentle as you think he is.

492
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,520
Be careful. He's a badass.

493
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,120
Toey.

494
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Why does he say here that I should be careful of you?

495
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,255
You are a badass.

496
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,920
Don't be paranoid. I'm this cute.

497
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,049
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

498
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:28,220
Are you planning to pull my leg?

499
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,353
No, I'm not.

500
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,928
Come on. Let's pack our stuff.

501
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:35,628
- You are suspicious.
- Don't be ridiculous.

502
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:03,900
1... 2...

503
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,520
I miss my friends.

504
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,580
Oh, Pete and Ainam.

505
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,340
Ainam...

506
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,640
Yes, she sent a postcard to me.

507
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,920
She sent one to me, too.

508
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,760
She's really a wingwoman.

509
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,780
She's been trying to hook us up since high school.

510
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,520
"Hurry and end up together already. Don't waste time."

511
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,540
She doesn't know that we have done more than that.

512
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,920
You are really a badass.

513
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,085
Let me read your postcard too.

514
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:10,277
Give it to me.

515
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:12,152
Come on, let me see too.

516
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:15,160
It's personal stuff. It's a secret.

517
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,920
Hey, we are a couple. There should be no secrets.

518
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,566
Wait.

519
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:21,920
I haven't agreed to be your boyfriend.

520
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,360
It's all in your head.

521
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,360
It's all in your head, dude.

522
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,600
This is how you want to play?

523
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,040
Come back here, Sun.

524
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,400
- I can't hear you.
- No, you hear me. Sun!

525
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,020
I have changed my name. I should get going now.

526
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:41,353
So if you win the photo contest, who will you go with?

527
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,360
Of course, I will go with Toey.

528
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,320
Hey, what about me?

529
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,420
I don't know.

530
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,281
- How could you do that to me?
- I don't know.

531
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,660
- No, you must take me with you.
- No.

532
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,640
- You must take me with you.
- Beg me.

533
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,360
Please let me go with you.

534
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,700
Beg more.

535
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,543
- Please let me go with you.
- More.

536
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,080
What do you want to eat?

537
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,540
Pork BBQ, chicken rice, pad thai, mussel pancake.

538
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:16,360
You can eat all that when we are in the city.

539
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,620
Toey should not have left us.

540
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,823
- I hear the sound of a car.
- A car is coming.

541
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:28,440
Will we get hit?

542
00:59:34,597 --> 00:59:36,700
Where are you two going?

543
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,937
We want to go back to the city center. Are you going through there?

544
00:59:39,937 --> 00:59:42,360
Yes. Yes. Get in the car.

545
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,302
- Thank you so much.
- Wait a minute.

546
00:59:44,302 --> 00:59:47,782
What relationship do you two have?

547
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,720
He's my boyfriend. We are dating.

548
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
See? I told you.

549
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,920
Get in. We will drop you in the city.

550
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,440
I'm a fan of BL.

551
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,500
Thank you very much.

552
01:00:09,335 --> 01:00:10,795
They are nice.

553
01:00:57,557 --> 01:01:02,120
It's our 3rd anniversary. I want to do something special for him.

554
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,590
- Test his feelings?
- Yes. Let's test his feelings.

555
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,000
Trust me. This is the best way.

556
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,140
[True love needs to be tested]

557
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,651
On one condition, don't tell anyone.

558
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,227
Gosh, hug me too.

559
01:01:13,227 --> 01:01:16,840
Damn it. Don't tell anyone.

560
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,159
Mork!

561
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,702
- He didn't text me back. He replies to Nuknik only.
- Who's Nuknik?

562
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:24,720
A fake chat ID I created to test him.

563
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,260
[What a cute name.]
[Let me see your photos.]

564
01:01:28,403 --> 01:01:29,840
Woah, he's pretty chatty.

565
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,640
Mork, you fool!

566
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,000
[Stop testing or stop seeing each other for good?]

567
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,240
You want to test him and end up getting jealous?

568
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,200
Do you think I'm a kind person?

569
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,403
Are you sure? Don't let me find out that you took someone home.

570
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,483
Come on. No such thing.

571

01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:13,200
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

573
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:19,310
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

574
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:24,050
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

575
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,340
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

576
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:32,520
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

577
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,900
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

578
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:42,400
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

579
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,290
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫
