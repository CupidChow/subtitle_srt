00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,280
♪ We lock eyes when we're right next to each other ♪

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,740
♪ I want to kiss my star under the shadow of the moon ♪

184
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,400
♫ Where are you? Tell me where you came from.
Sink into the warmth of my heart ♫

185
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:57,400
♫ And you, tell me that my dreams will be bright ♫

186
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:04,470
♫ Love is not far from you ♫

187
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:13,190
♫ I'm singing to my heart that I have you ♫

188
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Hey, you.

189
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,750
Luckily, you called me this morning.

190
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,040
I nearly almost forgot about class today.

191
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,280
You promised to pick me up. And I ended up giving you a morning call.

192
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,880
Oh. If there is no Tee, I don't know where my life would go.

193
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,778
You forget everything.

194
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:38,583
So do you remember what next Saturday is?

195
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,103
What is it?

196
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,448
You really don't remember?

197
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:48,600
It's the day...

198
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,500
It's the day you're going to Hong Kong with Mama. Right?

199
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,003
- You are joking, right?
- It's not. I'm sorry.

200
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,880
Weekend!

201
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,840
You don't have class that day, right?

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,180
Weekend? No class?

203
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,283
Right.

204
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,723
See? I'm right again.

205
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,400
Let's go!

206
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,660
Bro.

207
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,340
About the anniversary... I've got a plan.

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,693
- Test him?
- Yes, test him.

209
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,709
Look at this clip.

210
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,300
The guy acts like he's cheating on the girl.

211
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,021
When the girl finds out, she gets mad and goes up to his apartment to confront him.

212
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,701
Then, she's in for a surprise as the guy proposes to her.

213
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,080
You have to do this.

214
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,800
It will work.

215
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,169
Trust me, this is the best way.

216
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,490
Good, I've got an idea.

217
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,116
N? Who added me?

218
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,716
Mhok.

219
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,025
Hey, Nair.

220
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,638
He's not replying. Good job.

221
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,409
Is it expensive? Not much, right?

222
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,092
No charge. You're my friend.

223
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,340
I've got to go. Let's chat more on Line.

224
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,640
Sure. I'll tell my friends.

225
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,763
You got it.

226
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,729
Hi, there.

227
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,060
Who's that?

228
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,667
A senior.

229
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,458
She's pretty.

230
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,279
Shall we get going?

231
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,820
Where to?

232
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,843
Seriously, is there anything in your memory?

233
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:26,397
To exercise.

234
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,520
Don't you remember what your dad said?

235
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,000
Even though you're not sick anymore, you need to exercise.

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,840
Fine, Mom.

237
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,340
- Take it.
- You're so sweet you brought these for me.

238
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,680
How many laps should we run?

239
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,000
How many laps?

240
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,420
- 1,000 laps.
- No.

241
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,800
I'll have tutoring after class.

242
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,260
A senior has offered to tutor me.

243
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,680
I won't have a lot of free time as I used to.

244
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,860
It's good that you're studying hard. My mom likes a hardworking student.

245
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,820
That's what I am.

246
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,030
Don't wait for me when I have tutoring.

247
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,020
I'll let you know once I'm home.

248
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,520
You gave that excuse pretty quickly.

249
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,800
- I know I have a jealous boyfriend.
- It's good that you know it.

250
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,163
Who's the tutor? Is it a boy or a girl?

251
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,830
You wanna know, huh? You gotta catch me first.

252
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,040
Are you gonna tell me?

253
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,840
No!

254
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:43,975
I'm going to bed. Sweet dreams.

255
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:54,144
Sweet dreams.

256
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,117
Why did he read it?

257
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,803
Great! I'm in!

258
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,168
You don't have to be so loud.

259
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,281
I'm just so excited.

260
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:15,211
You can't tell anyone about this, especially Morn.

261
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,200
But he's your brother.

262
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,400
He's got a big mouth, and he's nosey.

263
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,140
If he knows, the world knows.

264
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,280
Don't say anything bad about Morn.

265
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,880
You're so sweet.

266
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,980
It makes me sick.

267
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,900
The plan is that... Morn comes to the campus a lot these days.

268
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,260
I don't know why he comes here, but I want you to help me keep him away.

269
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,500
Sure thing, Bro.

270
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,600
He's my boy. I can manage him.

271
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,540
That's why I asked you.

272
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,283
You put the right man on the right job.

273
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:50,623
Let's go.

274
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,320
I don't know why he's so clingy to me.

275
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,020
Take care of it.

276
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,980
Hello.

277
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,440
Hey, Gord. What brings you here?

278
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm here to see you.

279
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,980
I know that you followed Mhok here, so I followed you.

280
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:15,217
Is something wrong?

281
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:17,880
I just wanted to ask you to grab something to eat.

282
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,600
You? Asking me to grab something to eat?

283
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:22,800
What's got into you?

284
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,280
I'm just in a good mood.

285
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,283
Let's go. My treat.

286
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:30,311
Hold on. Let's wait for Mhok.

287
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:32,680
We can go now. He can catch up with us later.

288
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,305
Come on, let's go.

289
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,320
You gotta come with me. I'm buying.

290
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,697
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

291
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:43,040
Are you all right?

292
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,880
I am fine.

293
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:49,360
- Extravagant.
- Can you add one more?

294
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,000
- Who?
- Me.

295
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
Make it two.

296
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,043
It's time. Let's go.

297
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,243
- Okay.
- Let's go.

298
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,531
- Is it expensive?
- Three times the standard price.

299
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:02,320
What?

300
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,845
[Mom]

301
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,960
Hello?

302
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,550
Mom.

303
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,780
I know.

304
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,080
Mhok?

305
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:45,680
He's not coming. He has tutoring.

306
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,760
Okay, Mom. See you.

307
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,820
Follow me.

308
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:13,713
Everyone, let me introduce Mhok.

309
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:16,840
- Hello.
- Hi.

310
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,160
He wants to ask us to do him a favor.

311
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,570
About that...

312
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,220
You tell them.

313
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,480
So cute.

314
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,104
Mhok and Tee are so cute together.

315
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,189
Shall we do a clip to go up against them?

316
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,504
Let's do it.

317
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:56,992
What should be the name of our clip?

318
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:59,951
Gord Morn or Morn Gord.

319
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,923
I don't know.

320
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:05,063
I get to hug you either way.

321
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Hello, Muad.

322
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Oh, yeah?

323
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, I'll catch up with you soon.

324
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,780
Okay, bye.

325
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,440
I have to go.

326
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,460
I'll see you later.

327
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:41,460
That's fine. You don't need to come with me. I'm good going by myself.

328
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,640
Okay, see you.

329
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
See you.

330
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,140
Bro, Morn is gone.

331
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,880
Mhok!

332
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,780
This is cool. I want to play, too.

333
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:25,630
Guys, this is my friend, Gord.

334
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,440
He'll give us a hand.

335
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,596
- Hello.
- Hello.

336
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:33,560
- This is Nair.
- Hi.

337
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,700
What will you help us with?

338
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,440
Is there anything cool that I can play?

339
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,083
- Something cool?
- Yes.

340
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,820
Sarun, give him the cymbals.

341
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
Awesome!

342
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,400
Give him the equipment, too.

343
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,320
Polish the symbols until they shine.

344
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,280
You won't do anything else until they do.

345
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,040
Take these. This is so cool.

346
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,440
Mhok, you can practice over there.

347
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,040
Okay. Thanks.

348
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,500
Try to look cool when you polish them.

349
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,320
[N sent you a sticker]

350
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,800
Bro!

351
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,140
- Bro!
- What?

352
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,580
Someone sent you a Line message.

353
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,140
Who is it?

354
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,897
I don't know. The name is N.

355
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:41,120
I don't know that person. You reply.

356
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,000
What should I say?

357
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,483
He said he was busy with tutoring. How can he find the time to reply?

358
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,640
Mhok, what are you doing?

359
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,540
Bro!

360
00:25:18,154 --> 00:25:20,440
- Brother Mhok!
- What?

361
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,457
Tee sent you a message.

362
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,780
Don't reply to anything.

363
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,340
I don't want him to catch on to us. Let me take care of it.

364
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,280
[My name is Nuknik.]

365
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,580
[What a cute name!]

366
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,840
[Let me see your photos.]

367
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,400
[Why are you silent?]

368
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,320
Damn it, Mhok!

369
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:09,791
Tee.

370
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,000
Where did you go? What's up with you?

371
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
Nothing.

372
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Just tell me what's wrong.

373
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,640
I told you it's nothing.

374
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,940
If there's nothing, why are you frustrated with me?

375
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:28,300
I am smiling.

376
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,393
You have been looking busy with studying recently?

377
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,899
Very much so.

378
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,900
Mhok.

379
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,407
Mhok, do you think I am kind?

380
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,800
My boyfriend has the kindest heart.

381
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,160
Sometimes, I think I am too kind.

382
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,800
Don't you think?

383
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Take it easy.

384
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,397
What's up with you?

385
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:09,960
Nothing.

386
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,640
Hey, Mhok.

387
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,217
I'm going home.

388
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:23,800
Hey, Tee.

389
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,760
Hey, Tee.

390
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,090
Hold on, Tee.

391
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,260
That was Tee. You almost blew it.

392
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,220
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,560
So you learned them?

394
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,566
Not yet.

395
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,120
Bro, why do you look sad?

396
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,481
Mhok...

397
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,600
What happen to Mhok? Need my help?

398
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,680
He didn't reply to my message but texted Nuknik.

399
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,640
Nuknik who?

400
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,820
It's my fake account.

401
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,280
I created it to test Mhok.

402
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,743
You test him, and you end up getting jealous.

403
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,760
Tee, I don't think he's that type of person.

404
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,360
Let me have a look.

405
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh, there're a lot of messages.

406
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,140
Can I send him something?

407
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,980
What are you doing?

408
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,160
[Keeping myself from missing you.]

409
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,663
"Keeping myself from missing you."

410
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
I think you should quit. This is not fun anymore.

411
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,900
No.

412
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,072
I need to see this through.

413
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:16,432
I want to know if Mhok is thinking of cheating on me.

414
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,761
Please calm down. Don't overthink this.

415
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,860
Mhok loves you more than he loves me.

416
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,546
I'm sure he's just playing around.

417
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:31,046
Right?

418
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,820
[Mhok sent a sticker]

419
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:47,963
It'll be fine.

423
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,890
Can you eat shrimp now?

424
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,847
I guess I have to try it to find out.

425
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:10,372
What's wrong?

426
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:12,772
I'm just trying out new things.

427
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:17,384
It must be boring staying with the same old thing.

428
00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:23,820
What's the matter?

429
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,639
Since when do you care?

430
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,701
Hey...

[Nair]

432
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:51,264
Answer it.

433
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,420
Hello.

434
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,520
Yes.

435
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay.

436
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,480
Yes.

437
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,563
- I have to...
- Just go.

438
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,280
One, two, one.

439
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,466
There are still problems in the woodwind group.

440
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,540
Let's play again. Concentrate.

441
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,546
Yes.

442
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,100
One, two, one.

443
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Mhok, are you up for this?

444
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm fine.

445
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,570
You don't seem to be able to focus.

446
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,700
You're way off key.

447
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,300
If your mind is not on the notes,

449
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,596
it's no use practicing.

450
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,936
You're wasting everyone's time.

451
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,680
This is it for today. You all can go home.

452
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,840
Thank you.

453
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,173

Here's a key card to my dorm.

457
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:12,400
Now you can come in without calling me.

458
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,137
That's not the right hole.

459
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:26,070
Move it here.

460
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,740
Keep calm.

461
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,340
Why is your tongue so stiff?

462
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,040
Use your mouth.

463
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,860

♫ I can only accept the pain ♫

469
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:46,920
♫ And I’ll endure it, even though it’s nearly killing me ♫

470
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:54,600

Not long.

478
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,360
What is it that you want to tell me?

479
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,980
Do you remember what today is?

480
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,329
- It's...
- We should break up.

481
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,360

482

Do you realize what you just said?

485
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,800
I do. That's why I wanted to be civil when I spoke to you.

486
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,340
I don't understand. Why?

487
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,160
You're seeing someone else. Just admit it.

488
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,683
Man up! Are you a pussy?

489
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:36,740

490
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,060
We've come this far. Are you not going to admit it?

491
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,240
Tee, listen to me.

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,980
I have no one else.

497
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,763

500
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,790

My Tee.

544
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,800
What are you doing?

545
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,457
We're not breaking up, are we?

546
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,480
Tee, don't do this again.

547
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,520
I promise.

548
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,520
Promise.

549
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,640
No more tests. No more surprises.

550
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,420
No more Nuknik.

551
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,440
Nuknik. What kind of person is jealous of himself?

552
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,363
- Don't tease me.
- Don't tease me.

553
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:13,363
Don't tease me.

554
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,720
What should we do now?

555
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,420
What?

556
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,800
It's hot outside. Let's go inside.

557
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,520
I don't want to.

558
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,460
I don't want to.

559
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,120
Don't drag me.

560
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,500
Come on.

561
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,720
[Our Skyy❤️]

562
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,567
You will break up with your boyfriend.

563
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:45,967
You have to get rid of the bad luck before it's too late.

564
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,860
I told you we would have bad luck.

565
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,683
My right eye twitched.

566
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:55,743
That's a sign of bad luck.

567
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,020
But you like to talk back at me.

568
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,840
- Look who's talking.
- You are talking back at me.

569
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,153
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

570
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:12,493
This is annoying. We both are.

571
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:16,310
I just want this day to be special.

572
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:20,670
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

573
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,210
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

574
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:29,460
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

575
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,520
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

576
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,020
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

577
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:43,500
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

578
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,300
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

579
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:59,050
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫
