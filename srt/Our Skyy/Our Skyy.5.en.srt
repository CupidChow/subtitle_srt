"Regret" - 5 U

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,990
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,050
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,710
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,110
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,260
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,490
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,100
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,680
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:52,300
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,120
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,750
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,470
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,470
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:19,990
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫
[Our Skyy❤️]

16
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,420
Wake up!

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,040
What time is it now?

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,160
It's 6:00-ish.

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,180
Just 6:00.

20
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,590
Why did you wake up so early?

21
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,280
Usually, you wake up at 7:00.

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,980
Today is the announcement date of your scholarship result.

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,938
Aren't you excited to know?

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,085
The result won't come out until 12:00 p.m.

25
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:26,597
It's still hours away.

26
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,780
You seem to be more excited than I am.

27
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,220
I'm your tutor.

28
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,760
I want... to know the outcome of my tutoring.

29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,587
You are excited because you have no confidence in your teaching?

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Just kidding.

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Arthit.

32
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:05,400
Thank you for everything.

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Hey!

34
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,660
Your eyebrows are knitted together.

35
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:16,707
Kongpob, have some rest if you are tired.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,800
Arthit, if I get the scholarship, will you be happy?

37
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,820
Sure. You know why?

38
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,440
Because I will get the whole bed to myself.

39
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,440
Have I been making you feel uncomfortable?

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,780
Come on. I was just kidding.

41
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,200
Why so serious?

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,720
I will definitely be happy for you because it's your dream.

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,800
But if it makes you miss me, I won't go.

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,820
Are you out of your mind? You want to give up your dream because of me?

45
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,420
I'm not okay.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,280
Come to think of it, I will be away for two years.

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,060
I'm sure you will miss me so badly by just the first year.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,160
I don't think the person who suffers from missing someone is me.

49
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,340
It's you.

50
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,580
Why do you know me so well?

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,717
How long have we been together? How can I not know?

52
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,400
Let me tell you something.

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,280
If you do get the scholarship,

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,020
I will be the last person who sees you off at the terminal's entrance gate.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's get going.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,040
- Can I consider that a promise?
- Yes.

57
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,823
I didn't do anything much. You don't need to thank me.

58
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,980
I should take a shower now.

59
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,920
You can stay in bed. It's yours.

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
Wait a minute, Arthit.

61
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,220
You must be responsible for waking me up this early.

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,238
We have one hour till the usual time I wake up.

63
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:12,120
Just leave it there. I'll clear it for you.

64
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,834
You better hurry to work.

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,860
Okay, thank you.

66
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,440
Kongpob, once you hear the result, you must tell me right away.

67
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,960
I won't tell you.

68
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,856
Will you tell me or not?

69
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,640
Okay, I'll tell you.

70
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,600
Good. I'll get going now.

71
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,000
- Don't forget your stuff.
- Okay.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,700
See you.

73
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
Hello, Dad.

74
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,660
Is today your scholarship result day?

75
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,100
How is it going, son?

76
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,540
It's not out yet, Dad.

77
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,320
It should be available to check around noon.

78
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't be sad if you don't get the scholarship.

79
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,049
You can further your studies in the US like we discussed.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
What's up, Arthit?

82
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,520
Yong, hello.

83
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,643
Taking a break?

84
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,640
Yes, I'm here to buy coffee.

85
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,653
I'll be back with you soon.

86
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,500
[Kongpob]
Excuse me, can I have an iced coffee?

87
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,200
- Hello, Kongpob?
- Arthit, about the result...

88
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,780
You got it, right? You got the scholarship, right?

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Yes, I got it.

90
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,800
That's really awesome, Kongpob!

91
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,980
I'm happy for you. I'm really happy for you.

92
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,460
Thank you so much, Arthit.

93
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,300
So...

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,760
do you want to eat anything special tonight?

95
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Well, anything is fine.

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,940
Whatever you make, I'll just have it.

97
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,587
Okay.

98
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:22,287
Well then, see you tonight.

99
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,300
Okay, see you.

100
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,450
[Congratulation. Your application has been successfully submitted.]

101
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,120
Kongpob, come up to the rooftop.

102
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,120
Surprise!

103
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,180
What is this, Arthit?

104
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,070
Just like what you see. A surprise from me. Do you like it?

105
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,180
Anything good happened to you? Why do you look so happy?

106
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,894
Ah, it's Kongpob. He just got a scholarship to study in China.

107
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,120
Really?

108
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,720
I knew it. I always knew that he was something.

109
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,400
Tell Kongpob that I'm really happy for him.

110
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,800
Sure, I'll tell him.

111
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,960
Sorry, I've got to go now. I'll talk to you later.

112
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,640
Yong, wait.

113
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,463
I want to have a surprise for Kongpob.

114
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:02,557
Do you have any ideas?

115
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,400
I can't think of one, right now.

116
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,840
I'll text you if I have an idea.

117
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,123
Thank you.

118
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,964
See you.

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
Thank you for the tea.

121
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:40,163
Hey, Prem. Are you free this evening? I need a favor.

122
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,017
I'll take care of the rest.

123
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,717
See you, pal.

124
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:14,213
Time really flies.

125
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,100
Many of us have separated to their own ways.

126
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,963
Now, Kong is going to China to study too.

127
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,926
M has just gone and now Kong.

128
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:25,289
Kong will be studying economics like he has always dreamed of.

129
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,320
I heard it is difficult to get this scholarship.

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,540
Yes.

131
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm jealous of you. He's not only handsome but smart.

132
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,460
- Why are you jealous of me?
- He's smart and handsome.

133
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,100
Hey, Kong. I heard that the full scholarship is very hard to get.

134
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,720
Do you have any tips to share?

135
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, how did you do it? I want to apply it to my study.

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,460
Well, I have a good tutor.

137
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,860
I'm thirsty all of a sudden.

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,960
Hey, Kong.

139
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,523
When will you go? I may be able to see you off.

140
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,260
Come on, Oak.

141
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,480
You sound so cold.

142
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
Are you that busy?

143
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,338
Yes, I'm quite busy.

144
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:08,591
But I can always make time for friends.

145
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,991
So, when are you leaving for China?

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,026
At the end of this month.

147
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,080
What?

148
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,577
- Why is it so soon?
- Yes, so soon.

149
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:26,600
Anyway, let's celebrate for Kongpob today.

150
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,480
Come on. Another round of toast.

151
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,960
For the 75th time!

152
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,240
Cheers!

153
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,080
You will be gone for a long time.

154
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:55,120
You just found out about that too, didn't you?

155
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,916
That Kongpob is leaving at the end of this month.

156
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,760
Yeah.

157
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,592
I think he was trying to find a way to tell me too.

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,888
What will you do?

159
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't know.

160
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,280
It's too sudden.

161
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Hey, Prem.

162
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,920
If you really love someone,

163
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,640
and you know that you have to break up with that person one day,

164
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,740
what will you do?

165
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,443
I guess I just have to break up.

166
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,460
We have to end it anyway, right?

167
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,380
It's a waste of time. Don't you think?

168
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,580
Don't tell me you are going to break up with Kongpob?

169
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,420
No.

170
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,120
I'm just curious.

171
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,430
♫ And for things to be the same once again ♫

172
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,780
Arthit.

173
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,820
About the traveling date, I'm sorry for not telling you in advance.

174
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,802
Hey, it's all right. I understand.

175
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,665
You just knew about it too, didn't you?

176
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:36,125
It was too fast for me, too.

177
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:41,641
Even it was just a few hours ago. Everything seems to be in a rush.

178
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,160
It's going to be fine. Trust me.

179
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,340
Thank you.

180
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,040
You're thanking me again.

181
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,649
Well, I want to thank you...

182
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,802
for understanding me and also planning this surprise party.

183
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,060
Stop.

184
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,320
Once you start, you can't stop, huh?

185
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,360
Come on, Arthit.

186
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm taking these down first.

187
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,368
Take those bottles down.

188
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:13,853
You also prepared a surprise for me?

189
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:17,137
At first, it was just dinner.

190
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:21,598
Then, I felt like I wanted to do something a bit more special.

191
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:24,984
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

192
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:26,527
I asked those people to come.

193
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,350
You don't need to say sorry.

194
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,527
What I did for you today is far from what you had done for me.

195
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:36,015
You always know what I want.

196
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,334
You brought my friends to see me. Thank you so much.

197
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:47,020
Seriously, I heard a lot of "thank you" from you.

198
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,654
Enough of that. I want to take a shower now.

199
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,028
[Thank you for everything]

200
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,647
Arthit.

201
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,537
There's one more thing.

202
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:39,740
I have to go home to prepare my documents.

203
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,812
Tonight will be my last night here.

204
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:44,320
Okay.

205
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,406
I'm sure we will see each other again.

206
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:52,080
Are you going to sleep yet?

207
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,826
I want to sleep now.

208
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,515
I'll go turn off the light, then.

209
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Goodnight, Arthit.

210
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,140
Goodnight, Kongpob.

211
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,220
I didn't hear the alarm clock.

212
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,061
What time is it now?

213
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:14,948
Not 7:00 yet.

214
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,320
Why did you wake up so early?

215
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:23,144
Why don't you go back to sleep?

216
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,144
I need to pack. I haven't started yet.

217
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,139
Do you need a hand?

218
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,739
Thank you.

219
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,700
I can finish the rest.

220
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,480
You should rather take a shower and get yourself ready for work.

221
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,080
I'll make you breakfast.

222
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,098
Okay.

223
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,956
Wow, what did you make? Smells so good.

224
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,930
Stir-fried basil, clear soup, and steamed egg.

225
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,499
Why don't you sit down and eat with me?

226
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:16,179
Let me get you a soy milk first.

227
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,020
Kongpob, I have to go to work now.

228
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:44,086
I spent too much time eating. I should have helped you pack.

229
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:47,580
It's okay. You can go to work.

230
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,480
Well, I'm heading out, then.

231
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:00,943
Kongpob,

232
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:04,638
if there's anything, don't forget to call me.

233
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,970
Okay.

234
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,043
Arthit.

235
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,670
What? I'll be late for work.

236
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,510
I will take it out on you if I'm late.

237
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,575
I read this somewhere...

238
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:42,063
that you never know when it will be the last hug with someone.

239
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:47,646
So you should always make the most of your time together.

240
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:59,453
Hey, don't make it too emotional.

241
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,137
I'm going now.

242
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:24,358
What are you thinking of?

243
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,917
Nothing.

244
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:26,960
Get up.

245
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,220
Break time is nearly over. Let's get back to work.

246
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,935
Don't forget to see me off at the airport.

247
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,480
Have you woken up yet?

248
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,200
I have.

249
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
What about you?

250
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,240
I have been up for a while now.

251
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,700
I need to go out and hand over the documents today.

252
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,660
Don't forget to eat something before going to work.

253
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,720
Got it, sir.

254
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,283
Listen, I can take care of myself.

255
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,229
I'm not a child, you know?

256
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,660
Arthit.

257
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,360
Yes?

258
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,700
Can you come and see me tonight?

259
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
Arthit.

260
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,803
Arthit. You totally zoned out.

261
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,140
- Hey, Prem.
- What's up?

262
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:27,320
Why do you think Namwan and Jane broke up?

263
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,220
Namwan went to study in the US.

264
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,100
Didn't you say long distance is not the problem in a relationship?

265
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,040
Why do many couples break up because of this?

266
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,083
There could be other reasons too.

267
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,523
What else could it be?

268
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,320
Well, it's true many couples have broken up because of this.

269
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,430
But between you and Kongpob,

270
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,760
is this a reason for you both to break up?

271
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,400
Distance is important,

272
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,480
but it depends on you and him.

273
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,874
How much can you stay true to your love?

274
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,500
Do you really think like that?

275
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,100
My thinking does not matter.

276
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,320
It's solely up to you and Kongpob.

277
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,560
If we stay in different time zones, it's hard to find time to talk to each other.

278
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,020
Most couples break up because of the long distance.

279
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,360
Some couples can make it work, some can't.

280
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,600
In my case, I had to break up with him because he went to study abroad.

281
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,580
Many couples I know also broke up because of the long distance.

282
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,720
What they had built together came to an end

283
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,080
as well as all the good moments they had together.

284
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,320
When I knew that my boyfriend had to work in a faraway city,

285
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,120
I told him we should take a break in the relationship.

286
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,360
We didn't know what would happen in the future.

287
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,020
I think this is better to protect both of us from getting hurt.

288
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,600
Sorry, I'm late. Have I kept you waiting long?

289
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,020
No.

290
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,020
I thought I had kept you waiting.

291
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,000
You look exhausted.

292
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
A bit.

293
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,080
I had to meet my relatives today and it was hard to excuse myself and get out of there.

294
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,180
It's been hectic lately, I didn't even have time to think.

295
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,380
And the travel date is coming near.

296
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,940
I was afraid I couldn't see you before I left.

297
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,740
Do you know why I asked you to meet me here?

298
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,305
Whenever I think of it,

299
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,160
this place is full of good memories of us.

300
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,780
Our journey from the beginning until now...

301
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,800
So I want to spend one more time with you here before I go.

302
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,700
And in the next two years,

303
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,240
let's come back here and revive the memories of us together.

304
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:21,709
I love you.

305
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,860
Kongpob, I think...

306
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,940
Are you okay, Arthit?

307
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,960
I think...

308
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,860
we should take a break in our relationship.

309
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,820
Why?

310
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,880
What happened? You can tell me.

311
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,020
When we are apart,

312
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,906
we won't be able to talk as much as before.

313
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,780
Our love...

314
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,500
will fade away bit by bit.

315
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,684
We will begin to pick fights.

316
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,080
The memories we had together...

317
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,640
are really good.

318
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,040
Really, really good.

319
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,660
I don't want to fight with you.

320
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,897
I want to keep all the good memories of us.

321
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,601
Would it be better...

322
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,833
if we pause our relationship here?

323
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,100
One more thing.

324
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,940
You are over there.

325
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,912
If you are sick...

326
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
or go through any hardship,

327
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,300
I can't be there.

328
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:23,007
I can't be there with you.

329
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,163
Would it be better if we...

330
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:29,803
Have you thought this through?

331
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,180
What do you think?

332
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,980
If you knew that we would have to end our relationship one day anyway,

333
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,540
wouldn't it be better to end it here?

334
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,523
If I think that we will break up one day,

335
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:53,160
I will make every second between us count.

336
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,600
I will cook for you until our last day together.

337
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,080
I will do everything...

338
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,615
I will do everything to show you how much I love you.

339
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,941
So that on the last day I won't feel regret.

340
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,380
If that day has to come,

341
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,620
I will just smile at you and go.

342
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,970
No matter what happens,

343
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,840
I will always love you.

344
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,000
Tomorrow, I will go through the entrance gate at 7:00.

345
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,867
I will wait for you.

346
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:02,450
♫ How good it is that we can love each other, are connected ♫

347
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:08,610
♫ and have been through so many stories together? ♫

348
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,530
♫ It's a love that doesn't expect anyone to understand ♫

349
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:21,840
♫ There's only us, holding hands by each other's side ♫

350
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,250
♫ I don't know if you're afraid of or what you're worried about ♫

351
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:34,710
♫ Even though we don't dare to say what we are ♫

352
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:40,300
♫ The answer is right here, it lies in our hearts ♫

353
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:46,720
♫ Close your eyes and think of the old days, about how good our love was ♫

354
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,220
Kong, your flight is early in the morning tomorrow. Right?

355
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,760
Well, I don't think I can go see you off now.

356
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,483
So sorry, but I just realized I have to go to the countryside tomorrow.

357
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:26,763
And none of us seems to be available to see you off.

358
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,120
It's okay. No need to say sorry.

359
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,850
Anyway, May, can I ask something?

360
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,608
Sure.

361
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,160
When M told you he would go abroad to further his studies,

362
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,294
how did you feel?

363
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Well... I, actually, didn't want him to go, but I didn't say what I felt to him.

364
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,840
All I could do was just support him and be happy with him.

365
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,500
How are you and M now?

366
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
We don't get to talk much.

367
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,600
M is busy with his studies and adjusting himself there.

368
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
But we talked and we thought if we are meant to be with each other,

369
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,000
we will finally be with each other.

370
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,260
So we don't worry too much.

371
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay... thanks.

372
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,800
No worries.

373
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,660
Kongpob, it's time to go inside.

374
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,400
Then, I should get going now.

375
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,450
Goodbye, Dad, Mom.

376
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,240
Bye, Gift.

377
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,300
Have a safe trip, dear.

378
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,400
Can I hug you, Dad?

379
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,643
Good luck, son. Have a safe trip.

380
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,480
Have a safe flight.

381
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,020
Good luck.

382
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,000
- What did you just say?
- I'll just make you my wife.

383
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,300
Kongpob! Run around the field 54 times.

384
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,860
Go!

385
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,680
Next time if you want to cry, tell me.

386
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,040
I will wipe off the tears for you.

387
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,440
Kongpob!

388
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,820
You study and work really hard.

389
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,380
Don't forget to look after yourself.

390
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,140
From now on, the gear doesn't represent my heart only

391
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,420
because it means two connected hearts between us.

392
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,280
Ai-oon,

393
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,320
I love you.

394
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,040
No matter what happens to our love in the future,

395
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
but right now,

396
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm happy.

397
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
Kongpob and I...

398
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,280
we are dating.

399
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,820
Kongpob, I have a question for you.

400
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,080
Are you ready for our future?

401
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,760
You never know when it will be the last hug with someone.

402
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,560
Are you crying?

403
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,760
What a cry baby!

404
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,660
Arthit.

405
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,200
Well, Kongpob. I'm sorry for being late.

406
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,060
You know well that this bad habit of mine is hard to break.

407
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,480
You come here to see me off. This makes me happy enough.

408
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,840
Kongpob,

409
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,320
I'm sorry that I wasn't sure of our relationship earlier.

410
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,860
But from this moment on, I will believe in what you said to me.

411
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,840
I will make every second of us count.

412
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,941
Kongpob, we are at the airport. Enough.

413
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:01,320
Stop it.

414
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,400
I thought I wouldn't get to see you again.

415
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,160
Arthit, I have something for you.

416
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,520
What is it? When did you get it?

417
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,240
I had it with me because I was sure you would come to see me off.

418
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,960
But you cried. Do you want me to believe that?

419
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,763
So how did you know that I would be here?

420
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:33,780
You told me you would be the last person to see me off.

421
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,040
You have a good memory.

422
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,960
Give me your hand.

423
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,480
Hey, Kongpob. I think it's weird to...

424
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,340
How is it?

425
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,760
This "Sun" is mine. I have reserved it.

426
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You are incredible.

427
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,380
Come over here.

428
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,600
Do you think you are the only person who has prepared something?

429
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,860
I have prepared something too.

430
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,220
Here.

431
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Is this real?

432
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,120
You are not kidding me, right?

433
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,760
Why would I do that? It's what you see.

434
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,300
Let's get going now.

435
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,550
Do you know before I could get this ticket,

436
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,440
I had to clear all of my work in a short time?

437
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,280
Hello, how are you doing?

438
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,040
You must have been missing me.

439
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,140
I miss you, Arthit.

440
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,640
Arthit, I have an exam today. I need your support.

441
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,890
Do your best. Come back fast,

442
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,240
I'll have a reward for you.

Arthit,

450
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,020
wake up or you'll be late for work.

451
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,790
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

452
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:56,000
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

453
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,530
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

454
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,960
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

455
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,740
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

456
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,460
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

457
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,040
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

458
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,480
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

459
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:33,200
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

460
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,010
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

461
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:43,180
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫
