"Regret" - 5 U

00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,850
♫ I want to see that day's sky (I hope) ♫

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:16,080
♫ Everything will be like that day ♫

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,450
♫ An overcast sky, the sky is like this ♫

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,050
♫ It's lonely every time I look at it ♫

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,420
♫ (My heart has disappeared) The thunder rolls, raindrops fall, it's late ♫

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,530
♫ The more anxious I am, the more confused I get ♫

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,060
♫ Thinking of that person, the person who used to be right here ♫

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,650
♫ Thinking of every moment that I saw the vast sky ♫

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:52,280
♫ Thinking of that person who used to reciprocate my love,
who just left me ♫

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,120
♫ I'm regretting that I don't have you today ♫

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,610
♫ I want to do everything, I want to do it all ♫

13
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,430
♫ If it's just enough to have that hope that I can have those days back ♫

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,360
♫ Those good days, I want you by my side ♫

Pick, why is there water here?

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,620
Great, my neighbors are washing themselves in their front yard.

28
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,640
What showoffs!

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,210
Gosh!

30
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,340
What the hell?

31
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,020
Take it back.

32
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,660
I told you we would have bad luck.

33
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,361
That's nonsense. Give it to me.

34
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:09,360
That shoe was thrown at us.

35
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,007
Gosh, use this.

36
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,840
See? We are having bad luck.

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,540
What does sneezing have anything to do with the luck?

38
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,301
I sneezed because I took a shower out here.

39
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,821
[1. Taking a shower outdoor]

40
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,460
Come here.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,860
What are you doing?

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,521
To make you stop sneezing and whining.

43
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:34,421
See? You have stopped.

44
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,620
Hey, Kao.

45
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,180
It's nonsense.

46
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
Look at you. Why can't you believe in this kind of thing?

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,940
It's called "warmth". Don't you know?

48
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,640
This is warmth. Come here.

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,260
Hey, don't be absurd.

50
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,561
You are so into this luck thing. I sneezed by a force of nature.

51
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:02,280
Kao!

52
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,060
Told you, it was the force of nature.

53
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,560
No, you just want to irritate me.

54
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,607
[2. Wearing red shirts]

55
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,607
Come on, we could be late.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,300
Do I really have to wear red?

57
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Are you going to follow them all?

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Yes.

59
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,660
Who told you to do all these to remove bad luck?

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,741
It started with an old lady

61
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,540
whom I met on my way back from shopping.

62
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,440
Hey.

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,400
You.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,500
Yes, I'm talking to you.

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,360
Listen! You are down on your luck, you know?

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,680
Your health will get worse.

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,640
Your work will become an obstacle.

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,720
Your money will fall short.

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,001
Especially, your love.

70
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:17,701
It has come to a dead end.

71
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,340
You will break up with your lover.

72
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,260
You need to remove your bad luck before it's too late.

73
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,740
You want me to remove my bad luck?

74
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,780
What? What did you just say?

75
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm saying that you want me to remove my bad luck?

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
Remove my shirt?

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,560
Okay.

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,800
No, I said remove my bad luck.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,060
Oh, yes yes. I thought you wanted me to remove my top.

80
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,650
I actually don't mind doing that.

81
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,180
What do I have to do to remove my bad luck?

82
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,140
Where do I have to go?

83
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,940
- Do you have a note and a pen?
- No.

84
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,261
I do, write down what I say.

85
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,260
And I must complete everything by midnight.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
And you believe her?

87
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,720
You must experience it yourself.

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,660
From that day on, I have come across a lot of bad fortune.

89
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,780
I got bad luck.

90
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,340
The total is 129 baht.

91
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm short of money.

92
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,320
Can I pay you with these stamps?

93
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,762
When I went to the toilet, the paper ran out.

94
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,440
Excuse me.

95
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,240
Can you spare some toilet paper for me?

96
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,660
The fortune teller nowadays even knew you would run out of toilet paper?

97
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,020
Shouldn't you focus on the part she said about us breaking up?

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,160
You could make that up.

99
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,440
Do you think I'm that free?

100
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,860
All right, how many things do we have to do?

101
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,960
A lot!

102
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,560
All right. I'm free today. I'll help you.

103
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,160
What is it?

104
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,120
To remove the bad luck.

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,380
By holding hands?

106
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,398
[3. Hold each other's hands]

107
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:14,312
Every hour.

108

Have you gone nuts?

109
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,740
If you don't believe it, don't disrespect it.

110
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,780
Hurry up. I don't want to be late.

111
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,700
Okay.

112
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,680
Shit, I forgot.

113
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,400
What now?

114
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,440
She said we shouldn't drive.
[4. No driving]

115
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,680
Then, how should we go?

116
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,720
What's wrong?

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,080
I don't like riding the bus. I prefer driving my own car.

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,660
Let someone else drive for a change, so we can spend time together longer.

119
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,840
Why do you need more time together?

120
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,920
Don't tease me.

121
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,840
Like this.

122
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,100
You can't look at me like this when you drive. Right?

123
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,380
Stop bugging me.

124
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,300
Aren't you shy now?

125
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,460
Why should I be?

126
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,980
So many people are in the back.

127
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,749
[5. Grow a plant]

128
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,600
What kind of tree are you looking for?

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,240
Orange tree.

130
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,940
She said an orange tree doesn't only help foster love but also saves money.

131
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,360
Are you sure?

132
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,560
How come orange farmers don't become wealthier than Bill Gates?

133
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,788
Shogun orange. Shogun orange.

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,420
Let me see.

135
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,540
That is a tangerine.

Shogun orange.

Shogun orange.

139
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,860
Why is it hard for you to believe me? It's definitely a tangerine.

140
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,059
Let's ask the seller here.

141
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,705
- Fine.
- Fine.

142
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,679
Excuse me, what kind of orange is this?

Tangerine.

149
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,300
How should I know?

150
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,760
I don't own an orange farm.

151
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,860
That's a cow-face flower.
(Flamingo flower)

152
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,490
It's called crown of thorns.

153
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,950
No, I'm talking about you.

154
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,980
You think you're funny.

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,943
Are you bugging me?

156
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,460
Do I really have to grow this at home?

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,400
I guess I'm going to be richer now.

158
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,741
What's wrong? Does your eyes hurt?

159
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,780
No.

160
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,100
My right eye twitched.

161
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,420
That's a sign of bad luck.

162
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,930
Your left eye just twitched too.

163
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,000
They are even now.

164
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,400
Look again. Do we need to get anything else?

165
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,500
No.

166
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,050
Then why did we get the tree so early?

167
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,460
We should have bought it at the end of the day.

168
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,720
The shop may close early.

169
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,206
Don't be ridiculous. It's open all day.

170
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,647
But the traffic is worse in the evening.

171
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,547
We could go there by sky train.

172
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,440
Hey! You scumbag! You sick pervert!

173
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
Pete, don't!

174
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,840
Thank you. Thank you so much.

175
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,180
He took photos up her skirt.

176
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,260
Let him go.

177
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
That was close.

178
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,531
Here.

179
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,160
So what is next on the list?

180
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,680
I know.

181
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,540
I saw on the list that we have to kiss.

182
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,480
Did the old lady really say that?

183
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,440
What do you think?

184
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
Follow me when you are done.

185
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,339
What are you smiling at? Hurry up.

186
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,360
Here's a shroud.

187
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
What did you bring me to do here?

188
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,140
You are not doing it alone.

189
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,840
I have to do it too.

190
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,627
Being wrapped in a shroud is an ancient strategy.
[6. Pretend to be dead]

191
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:42,899
This is to deceive the bad luck that follows you,

192
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,319
to pretend that you have been dead and born again.

193
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,860
Has this shroud been used?

194
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,680
Yes, it has.

195
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,780
But don't worry.

196
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,720
I've already washed all body fluid stains.

197
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,240
Thank you.

198
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,470
Damn it, Kao. I'm not gonna do this.

199
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,190
It's gross.

200
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,991
Come on.

201
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,181
It's clear that she is kidding.

202
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,461
This is no kidding. There's a smell from it.

203
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,190
Trust me.

204
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,360
She is just kidding.

205
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,422
You are kidding, right?

206
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,544
Shall we start?

207
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,302
- Start with him.
- Damn it, Kao.

208
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,520
Give me a sec.

209
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,920
- Please lie down. We don't have all day.
- Go lie down.

210
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,161
You do it first. You want to do this, not me.

211
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,961
Go ahead.

212
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,580
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

213
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,879
You asshole.

214
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Kao.

215
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:58,208
Kao!

216
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,499
Kao!

217
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,740
What's up?

218
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,550
Are you still there?

219
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:06,958
I'm talking to you.

220
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,239
How long do you have to stay in here?

221
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:11,070
I didn't know. I forgot to ask.

222
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,450
What?

223
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,314
Did you trick me to do this for your pleasure?

224
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,525
Give me a break. I'm being tied too.

225
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
Kao.

226
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Kao.

227
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,618
Just stay quiet and pretend to be like a dead man for a while.

228
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:30,218
She will untie us soon.

229
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:33,680
So gross.

230
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,720
Pete!

231
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,891
Why? Do you like to pretend to be dead that much?

232
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,480
Why don't you just go die for real?

233
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,620
Pucker your lips.

234
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,800
Do you want to reborn yet?

235
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,381
Get up now.

236
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:53,241
Are you going to be here for a whole week and get cremated?

237
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,311
Get up!

238
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,211
Hey, Pete!

239
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:03,025
Shit!

240
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:05,108
I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,088
I did!

242
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,080
Hurry up.

243
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,980
You should know that I don't like to be confined.

244
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,560
I just knew.

245
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,040
And I just knew that you like to flick people's dicks, too.

246
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,740
How the hell would I know?

247
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,200
Come on.

248
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,500
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

249
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,160
Stop talking or I'll flick yours now.

250
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,780
Flick what? Go ahead. Go ahead. Do it!

251
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,640
I'll flick your forehead!

252
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,880
You forgot your thing.

253
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,370
Thank you.

254
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,120
Give it to me.

255
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,079
You are forgetful again.

256
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,520
What about you?

257
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,480
You forgot this and that since morning.

258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,620
What did I forget?

259
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,540
You want me to name them?

260
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,633
What? I'm not going to hold your hand.

261
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,220
This is absurd.

262
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,460
Let's get going.

263
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,560

Let's take a break here. I'm exhausted.

273
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,742
Come on. We almost made it.

274
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,580
Made what?

275
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,298
999 meters.
[7. Take a stroll for 999 meters]

276
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,638
We have already walked way more than that since we left home.

277
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,200
We need to restart the counter.

278
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,595
No, I'm done.

279
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,216
I have to carry this orange tree and it's heavy.

280
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,566
And my shirt is dirty.

281
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,780
Then leave it here. We can come back for it later.

282
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,000
Someone could take it?

283
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,120
- The orange tree?
- Hell yeah.

284
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,240
Didn't you say it could make us richer?

285
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,280
If you leave it here, don't you think someone might want to steal it?

286
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,117
The thief can buy this himself. It's not that expensive.

287
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:59,700
Get up.

288
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,410
Let's continue walking.

289
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,499

290
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,420

00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,420
Why are we here?

292
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,060
To watch a movie.
[8. Watch a movie]

293
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,003
Watching a movie can remove bad luck?

294
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Let's find something to eat, too. I'm hungry.

00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,660
Hey, Kao.

296
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:16,098
Let me ask you something.

297
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:20,660
On the list, I didn't see anything that normal people do.

298
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
I think it's strange.

299
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
Strange?

300
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,277
I don't think it is strange?

301
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:30,878
Don't you agree?

302
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:35,878
Normally people go and make merits and wishes in a temple to remove bad luck.

303
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:39,363
Yes.

304
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,120
Why don't we do it like that, too?

305
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,840
It's not a good time to do that today.

306
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,180
Are you serious?

307
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,260
Then, do you also believe that we must not tap the plate while eating?

308
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,889
No nail cutting at night?

309
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:59,684
No hair washing on Thursday?

310
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,880
Thursday rhymes with "not good to wash hair".

311
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,680
Not good my butt!

312
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,640
Shush, focus on the screen.

Hey, Kao.

314
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:27,199
You are walking to that black cat. Aren't you afraid of it?

315
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,238
Oh, the black cat.

316
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:34,498
A superstitious person like you should be afraid of a black cat.

317
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:39,580
Yes, you got a point.

318
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,500
What should we do now?

319
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:44,683
Just step back. That's not hard.

320
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:47,232
- Just step back.
- Yeah!

321
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,800

322
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,999
- Are we 999 meters yet?
- Not yet.

00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,740
You want to be a hero?

324
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,630
Calm down, Pete.

325
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,880
No, Pete.

326
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,320
Stop it.

327
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,680
Calm down.

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,361
- He hit me first.
- Just calm down.

329
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,232
What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you stop me?

330
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:27,403
If I didn't and things got out of hand,

331
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,598
you may have ended up with more injuries.

00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,319
We are down on luck at the moment.

333
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,920
If you didn't butt in, it would be their bad luck.

334
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,601
Yes, I butt in to stop you because I care!

335
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,080
So, what's next?

336
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,120
You are so concerned about removing bad luck. What's next on the list?

337
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,220
Say it now.

338
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:02,995

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,730
What the hell is the truth? I've nothing to lie about.

340
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:16,401
Just say what you have on your mind.

341
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,782
- Come on. Say it.
- Okay, I'm lying.

00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,480
What do you mean?

345
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,687
I'm lying about everything.

There is no removing-bad-luck thingy.

00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,425
Listen up. I will bring you to a Chinese temple with me.

350
00:25:56,425 --> 00:26:00,765
I help you remove your bad luck, so you can get a husband of your own.

351
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:05,625
Push me gently. How many times do I have to tell you?

[To-do List]

353
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:34,964
Why did you trick me into believing it?

354
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:36,745
I was involved in a fight.

355
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,306
You looked for trouble on your own. That was not on the list.

356
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,478
Didn't you care to tell me first?

357
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:43,760
I thought if we could go out and do some crazy things together,

358
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,656
you would be very surprised to know the truth later.

359
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:51,337
Yes, I was fucking surprised.

360
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,440

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,960
♫ Can we please not fight? ♫

363
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,360
I have been trying to tell you.

364
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,040
♫ When we both love each other and are both jealous ♫

365
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,540
But I don't dare to.

366
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
♫ When the final result is us both regretting it ♫

367
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,780
♫ When it's not going anywhere, why must we suffer? ♫

368
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:41,120
♫ Let us love each other better ♫

369
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:13,240
♫ I don’t want this anymore, can we please not fight? ♫

370
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,530
Pete.

371
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,840
Hey, Pete.

372
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,348
Don't be mad at me.

373
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,780
I really tried to tell you, but I dared not.

374
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,287
I'm so freaking pissed off at you, you know?

375
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,440
♫ Let us love each other better ♫

376
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,040
I'm sorry.

377
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,460
♫ With the remaining time from now on ♫

378
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,130
♫ Let us love each other better ♫

379
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,068
Why the hell did I bring it with me?

380
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,534
Here.

381
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,755
- What?
- Let me see.

382
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:44,100
It hurts!

383
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:55,169
I just wanted today to be special.

385
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:03,557
It was my fault. I forgot that my boyfriend likes to pick fights when he's outside.

386
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,905
I almost stopped being mad at you, but I'm still a bit.

387
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:09,906
A bit of what?

388
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:11,506
It hurts!

389
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,300
Don't pretend you don't know.

390
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,718
You are not mad at me now.

391
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:19,518
No, I am still mad at you. Get the hell out of my face.

392
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,680
Look, you are smiling.

393
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,581
I'm not.

394
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:26,581
- You are smiling.
- Who is smiling?

395
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,443
What?

396
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:32,630
There's still one more thing to do.

397
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,240
Remember?

398
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,938
You are not going to stop?

399
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,860
Let's do it. I remember too.

400
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,300
Don't just talk the talk...

401
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:04,946
How were my lips?

402
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,240
So-so.

403
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,900
I need to do it one more time.

404
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,960
Enough.

405
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,200
- Why? You are the one who wants to do it.
- You are so naughty.

406
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,563
You even wrote it down on the list.

407
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:19,041
Stop being shy. It's not our first kiss.

408
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:23,881
- Should we write more?
- What are you talking about?

409
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,920
How to remove bad luck.

410
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,782
We don't have bad luck now.

411
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,340
Stop your nonsense.

412
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,020
What?

413
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,700
You're heavy.

414
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,380
Just one kiss and you forgot to bring it with you.

415
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:30,140
It's good that I didn't throw it away in the middle of the road.

416
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,057
Sit down.

417
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:34,073
Don't order me.

418
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:53,920
How is it today? Is it as special as you wish?

419
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:59,519
Well...

420
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,720
Well... I guess.

421
00:33:05,474 --> 00:33:07,698
Why are you smiling? Do you want me to punch you?

422
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,298
If you punch me, I will kiss you back.

423
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:13,609
You're so going to get it.

424
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Hey, Kao.

425
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,360
I have something to tell you.

426
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,860
What is it?

427
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,580
I knew from the beginning that you were fooling me about the old lady.

428
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,960
From the beginning?

429
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,680
From the time you held my face to look at you on the bus.

430
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,800
You were strange then.

431
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,200
You can't look at me like this when you drive. Right?

432
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:03,340
Stop bugging me.

433
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,320
Aren't you shy now?

434
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,820
- Why should I be?
- So many people in the back.

435
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,240
Here. Now your left eye twitched too.

436
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,102
They are even now.

437
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,120
Why did you bother to lie?

438
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,120
If you told me the truth at the start, you wouldn't need to make all those things up.

439
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,240
If I told you directly, would you want to go out with me?

440
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,220
How do you know that I wouldn't?

441
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,700
If I want to hold your hand every hour like today,

442
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,160
you will keep finding excuses and I won't get to do it.

443
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,080
So I had to make that up in order to hold your hand.

444
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,860
I never find excuses to avoid holding your hand, but you like to talk back at me.

445
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,420
Look who's talking. You are talking back at me.

446
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,000
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

447
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,840
This is annoying. What do you get from making things up?

448
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,620
I get to be with you.

449
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,340
Fine.

450
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,000
You can tell me directly from now on.

451
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,700
I will try not to talk back to you.

452
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,610
Okay?

453
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,900
Listen, my dear audience.

454
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,520
It's common for couples to fight and bicker.

455
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,260
I have seen so many couples who fight a lot.

456
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,460
Next thing you know, you see them have two babies.

457
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,920
It makes me realize no matter how many fights they have,

458
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,600
it's really obvious that they love and care about each other.

459
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,340
Lastly, I would like to give this song to all loving couples who fight and make up.

460
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,260
I hope your love lasts for a long time,

461
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,600
fight with your hands, never use as a weapon.
