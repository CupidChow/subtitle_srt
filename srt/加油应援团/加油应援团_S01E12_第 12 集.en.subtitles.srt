1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,866
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,642
We're here.

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,811
I guess we are.

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,649
I'll see you.

6
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,743
Wait.

7
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,329
What is it?

8
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,582
We'll have to date in secret, right?

9
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,876
We don't have to if you're uncomfortable.

10
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,754
It's fine. Let's keep it a secret for now.

11
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,882
But I'll need to tell Seon-ja.

12
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,593
I always tell her everything.

13
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,594
Okay.

14
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,555
By the way, how about we…

15
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,225
drop the honorifics?

16
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,522
Shall we?

17
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,483
Yes.

18
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,486
Goodbye. I mean, see you.

19
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,587
I'll get going.

20
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,486
That was quite a sight.

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,700
How long have you been watching?

22
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,827
Tell me.

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,373
Gosh, I'm so tired.
I can't stop pouting for some reason.

24
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,377
Now I've really seen everything.

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,754
He was blushing as he ran off.

26
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,673
He was running so awkwardly.

27
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,969
-Did you see?
-Why would you hide

28
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,637
and watch like some pervert?

29
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,222
I wasn't hiding.

30
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,599
You were out in the street going…

31
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,937
Isn't that right?

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,022
When did we go…

33
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,234
We didn't do that.
It was just a light peck.

34
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,029
Oh, so now you're calling yourselves "we."

35
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,864
I guess you solved
your love triangle problem.

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,575
You see, love affairs

37
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:25,204
are supposed to be
a whole passionate mess like this.

38
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm so sad to see it end.

39
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,293
You were so upset
that you wouldn't even talk to me.

40
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,920
I guess you solved
that problem of yours too.

41
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,381
Listen.

42
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,717
What this is, you see,

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,428
is me being the bigger person
and letting it slide.

44
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,182
Anyway, all we did was peck lightly.

45
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,683
I'm just as sad it was only a peck.

46
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,561
She just has to have the last word.

47
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,482
-Ms. Kissy Lips.
-Be quiet!

48
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,486
What?

49
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,446
You're going out with Jeong-woo?

50
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,367
No way. This is crazy.

51
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,493
This quickly?

52
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,246
What happened yesterday?

53
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,665
Come on. Tell me.

54
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,501
Gosh, you…

55
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,840
I still can't believe he's decided
to date you despite the rules.

56
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,842
I know, right?

57
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,804
Maybe it's because…

58
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,764
he's in love.

59
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,976
How sweet.

60
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,395
You're so annoying.

61
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,108
I can't let you get ahead of me.
I'm going to date someone too.

62
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,281
Hey, when did you get here?

63
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,453
Hey.

64
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,959
Was he listening?

65
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,562
SUMMER TRAINING

66
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,857
With the school holidays beginning,

67
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,192
the summer training will start today!

68
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,333
With Yu-min gone, Jin-il will now be
the head of the planning team.

69
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,460
He offered to help
with the summer training

70
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,045
since we're so short-staffed,

71
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,838
so let's give him a warm welcome.

72
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,844
I'm Kim Jin-il, Theia's 49th recruit.
Pleased to work with you.

73
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,637
-Let's give it up for him!
-Thank you.

74
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,183
What you're looking at now

75
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,936
is the training schedule
for the summer holidays.

76
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,356
SUMMER TRAINING CAMP

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,485
Wait, so we have to train every day
from morning to afternoon,

78
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,820
study the rules
for the Yonhee-Hokyung match,

79
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,988
and make a new song?

80
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,365
What are we?
Some national cheering representative?

81
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,787
I'll do nothing but train all summer.

82
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,663
That's it for today then!

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,048
Thanks for offering to help.

84
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,551
Weren't you friends with Soo-il?

85
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,261
I get it.

86
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,388
He must've sent you
to mess with our training.

87
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,099
What?

88
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,350
It's not like that.

89
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,770
I just wanted to help out.

90
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,982
We really need your help
since we're so short-staffed this year.

91
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,860
-Thank you.
-Sure.

92
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,700
Why would you bring up Soo-il?

93
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,954
It's just odd
that he suddenly offered to help us.

94
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,165
I guess we'll see

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,086
whether he's our friend or foe.

96
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,155
So?

97
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,991
What's your answer?

98
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,292
I'm sorry, Seon-ho.

99
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,419
No.

100
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,337
Say what I want to hear

101
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,132
and you won't have to be sorry.

102
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,550
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,844
But I--

104
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,387
We even kissed.

105
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,308
So you were just drunk then?

106
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,271
And you're sure
you didn't have any feelings for me?

107
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,941
I was confused then.

108
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,109
Exactly.

109
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,323
That means you had feelings for me too.

110
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,995
I like Jeong-woo.

111
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,752
When you told me how you felt
the night of the festival,

112
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,964
you made my heart skip a beat.

113
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,384
I'll admit I was swayed then.

114
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,764
But at some point,

115
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,893
it just came to me naturally

116
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:45,149
that it's him that I like.

117
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,280
Maybe you're just still confused.

118
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,617
Just like you were with me.

119
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,202
Not anymore.

120
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,545
I know you're upset and hurt
because of my actions.

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,880
You can curse me out

122
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,635
or you can even decide
to ignore me altogether.

123
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,180
No.

124
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,101
I'll just keep confusing you.

125
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,937
And…

126
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,983
I'll make you realize
it's me that you want.

127
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,651
Don't.

128
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,363
I'll just have to keep refusing you.

129
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,411
So you're not talking to Seon-ho
anymore then?

130
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,456
I guess it'll be a little awkward
seeing him around.

131
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,498
I know.

132
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,752
My mom made some food for you.
Come pick them up after your shift.

133
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,088
What is it? Do you have a date to go on?

134
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,132
Yes.

135
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,344
The kimchi could go bad,
so I'll take them to your place myself.

136
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,763
-I love you, Seon-ja!
-Get lost.

137
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,931
Okay. I'll be off to work then.

138
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,476
You're the best. Thank you.

139
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,400
-I'll see you.
-Good work today.

140
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,869
I guess this vacation
will be just as hectic as any other.

141
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,332
How come you don't…

142
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,210
correct my pronunciation anymore?

143
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,630
What? Oh, that.

144
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,049
You didn't seem to like it, so…

145
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,468
Have you forgotten
I'm an attention-seeker myself?

146
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,429
Any reaction is better than none.

147
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,099
"Vacation."

148
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,685
It starts with a V, not a B.

149
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,730
"Vacation"?

150
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,778
"Vacation."

151
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,201
-Hello.
-Hi.

152
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,619
Oh, wait.

153
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,832
I was on my way out.
Want to walk together to the gate?

154
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,292
I see.

155
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,837
Right.

156
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
Sure. Let's go.

157
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,685
How are you doing in the cheering squad?

158
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,770
The squad?

159
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,313
It's good. It's a lot of fun.

160
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,150
Don't you find all the rules
difficult to follow?

161
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,111
-Like the one about dating.
-No, not at all.

162
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,239
I'm a total conformist.

163
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,701
Rules are there to be followed.

164
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,369
Rules are valuable, right?

165
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,664
-Right.
-I'm sorry?

166
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,876
They say you're similar to Yu-min.

167
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,711
I get that a lot.

168
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,423
But I don't get how we're similar.

169
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,008
Yu-min was a lot like you.

170
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,218
She always stood out.

171
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,305
You do too.

172
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,308
You always stand out.

173
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:51,061
I don't think we're alike at all,

174
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,813
our personalities and everything.

175
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,774
You're right. You aren't.

176
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:58,986
I'm sorry?

177
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,741
I meant you're different.

178
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,658
Oh…

179
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,327
right.

180
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,206
I have to cross.
I'll get going then. I'm--

181
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
Oh, no! Sorry!

182
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,713
You're even worse.

183
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,845
I heard it was you.

184
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,013
Yes.

185
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,309
-I'm sorry.
-Why did you do it?

186
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,103
Was it out of anger at being kicked out?

187
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,772
Or was it something against me?

188
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,357
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,192
But it's all in the past now.

190
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,402
I must've been crazy.

191
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,821
Let's forget it.

192
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,784
Why Hae-yi?

193
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,912
-What?
-You could've come after me.

194
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,205
Why did you go after her?

195
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,706
Well…

196
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,337
It just happened that way.

197
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,214
I'm truly sorry.

198
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,549
I'll keep an eye on you.

199
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,759
I'll keep watching you.

200
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,344
All right.

201
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,098
Like that'll do you any good.

202
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,869
-Let's drink. Cheers!
-Cheers!

203
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,330
Hey, you're here.

204
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,583
Come on in.

205
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,584
Welcome…

206
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,670
-Hey.
-Over here. I saved a seat for you.

207
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,338
Busy night today?

208
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,882
I'm going to send them all home.

209
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,466
Shall we begin?

210
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,095
-A glass of whisky.
-What whisky do bunnies drink?

211
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,346
You don't know?

212
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,223
Bunnies drink hopscotch.

213
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,267
A hopscotch.

214
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,607
I thought of something great.

215
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,151
-What?
-You.

216
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,820
You and your jokes, huh?

217
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,573
They're amazing.

218
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,919
Is this what I think it is?

219
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,836
Yes.

220
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,379
We're dating.

221
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,173
You're dating the deputy director?

222
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,802
Look, I'm not entirely against
the notion of physical violence.

223
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm sorry?

224
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,932
You know what I mean, right?

225
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,561
Yes, of course. I'll keep that in mind.

226
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,940
Well, I'll leave you to it then.

227
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,484
-Goodbye. See you later.
-Good work today.

228
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,154
Tell me more of your jokes.

229
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,323
Gosh, you're so cool.

230
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,867
HAN RIVER MANGWON BRANCH 2

231
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,535
Hey, come on.

232
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,621
Be careful.

233
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,500
Wait for me.

234
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,335
Wait up.

235
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,045
Hurry.

236
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,675
Right here?

237
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,759
Yeah, right here.

238
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,766
Here's your beer.

239
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,060
Here's mine.

240
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,146
Is there anything
you'd like to do together?

241
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,648
We're already doing it.

242
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,192
I mean…

243
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,444
we are, aren't we?

244
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,698
Having ramyeon with beer

245
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,158
with my boyfriend by the Han River.

246
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,328
It's something I've
dreamed of doing in college.

247
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,247
Anything else?

248
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,709
-I want to show off.
-Show off?

249
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,711
I was leaving work…

250
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,508
I mean, I saw this couple at work

251
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,261
and they were just
rubbing it in for all to see.

252
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,140
The old man was doing his best
despite his old age.

253
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,851
We can't fall behind
when we're much younger.

254
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,186
Doing his best?

255
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,939
Jeong-woo!

256
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,734
You've broken the Labor Standards Act.

257
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,652
How so?

258
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,780
Because your handsome face
has been working 24/7 nonstop.

259
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,745
Oh, so that's what you mean. I see.

260
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,373
Hurry and do one too.

261
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,382
You must be made of copper and tellurium.

262
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,383
Because you're cute.

263
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,012
-What?
-So the symbol for copper is "Cu"

264
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,138
and tellurium is "Te."

265
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,641
Put them together and it spells "cute."

266
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,770
"Cute."

267
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567
I see.

268
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,238
Right. I guess we could fall behind.

269
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,034
They say that people get wiser with age.

270
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,203
Let's just eat.

271
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,834
I'm so sad.

272
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,300
Hae-yi. There's something on your face.

273
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,218
Look.

274
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,845
-Really?
-Here.

275
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,266
There's pretty on your face.

276
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,314
Why are you so good at it?

277
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,697
-Are you embarrassed?
-No.

278
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,076
It looks like you are.

279
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,702
No. Stop making fun of me.

280
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,414
You're too cute.

281
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,220
What was that?

282
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,514
You're too pretty.

283
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,900
Cheers.

284
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,613
How about we link arms… Never mind.

285
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,204
Doesn't that count as showing off?

286
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,097
-Do you want to watch it?
-Not now.

287
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,769
You see, it's my dream

288
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:53,150
to afford such expensive musicals
without a moment of hesitation.

289
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,152
I want to be free of worrying about money.

290
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,699
Just wait. I'll make it happen soon.

291
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,329
I'll keep going at it until I do.

292
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,503
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,423
I'm so busy with work

294
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,426
that we only get to
see each other late at night.

295
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,679
We see each other at training.

296
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,264
Still.

297
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,393
Plus, I'm just as busy as you are.

298
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,649
-Thanks.
-Come here.

299
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,195
You don't need to
worry about things like that.

300
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,114
I just wish you could cut back
on the training.

301
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,032
No way.

302
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,284
That's fine too.

303
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,543
Why are we working so hard?

304
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,004
If you don't build your stamina now,

305
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,506
you won't last six hours
at the Yonhee-Hokyung match.

306
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,218
I think we'll all be dead
by the match anyway.

307
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,763
Hey. Are you sleepy?

308
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,724
Do you know what you need right now?

309
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,442
Better than coffee.

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,986
Nice.

311
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,654
And another thing.

312
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,240
The long-awaited
training camp will begin tomorrow.

313
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,450
Gather at the front gate by nine o'clock.

314
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,912
You're not going to tell us
where we're going until we get there?

315
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,913
Nope.

316
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,999
It's to keep you anticipating.
Coming soon!

317
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,877
Seeing how they're working us so hard,

318
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,505
I'm sure they'll let us
enjoy ourselves by taking us

319
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,299
to some holiday resort as a surprise.

320
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,635
One with a lobby
with a full view of the ocean…

321
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,221
I'll enjoy myself some piña coladas.

322
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,639
What's that?

323
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,724
It's a cocktail.

324
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,205
-Are you off to work again?
-Yeah.

325
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,751
Sleepyhead. You know how I feel?

326
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,878
I feel like we're an old married couple

327
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,213
who never talk to each other.

328
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,509
Just wait, honey.

329
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,553
We'll spend a steamy night
at camp tomorrow.

330
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,140
Darling. I'm not one of those girls.

331
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,226
I'll see you tomorrow, honey.

332
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:34,936
I'll get going.

333
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,699
You were rejected?

334
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,661
Mr. Jin Seon-ho was rejected.

335
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,205
Goodness.

336
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:57,084
What a tragedy it is, isn't it?

337
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,420
Will you please keep it down?

338
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,421
It's okay.

339
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,423
I was rejected too.

340
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,092
You too?

341
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,803
So we're comrades then.

342
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,887
That's right, we are.

343
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,224
Here. Have another glass.

344
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,559
I'm so drunk.

345
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,395
Time sure flew by.

346
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,856
It really did. Be careful.

347
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,778
-See you tomorrow. Get home safe.
-All right.

348
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,196
-You'll be fine, right?
-Yes.

349
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
Bye.

350
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,369
So is Cho-hui coming or not?

351
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,787
Yeah, is she coming?

352
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,456
-She is.
-Nice.

353
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,751
I'll finally get to see
the legendary Tae Cho-hui.

354
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,421
Is she really that amazing in bed?

355
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,048
Come on, tell us.

356
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,800
Who was that?

357
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,260
-Thanks.
-My boyfriend.

358
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,220
Don't get me wrong.

359
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,223
She's been with a lot of sports majors.

360
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,183
I'm sure you get performance anxiety, no?

361
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,310
I know about the rumors, man.

362
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,354
I knew all that
before I started dating her.

363
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,982
Just enjoy your time with her
and dump her when you can.

364
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,943
Come on. I've invested so much.

365
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,820
I need to get my money's worth.

366
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,572
No one told you to do that.

367
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,160
-Hey! Who the hell are you?
-What's he doing?

368
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,620
-What's going on?
-Go on. Break up with her.

369
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,999
Cho-hui is too good
for some jerk like you.

370
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,334
-You crazy bastard.
-Hey, come on.

371
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,420
-You punk.
-Grab him!

372
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,089
-Damn it.
-Keep him still.

373
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,883
-Hey!
-What do you think you're doing?

374
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,137
Cho-hui.

375
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,556
What kind of business
do you have with this bastard?

376
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,600
Hey!

377
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,351
Speak for yourself.

378
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,731
What business do you jerks have
talking about me like that?

379
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,357
You're no better than them.

380
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,279
I was only dating you for a fling
since you were so clingy.

381
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,201
We're over.

382
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,540
You've crossed the line.

383
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,559
Gosh, I'm so jealous of you.

384
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,810
Where are you going?

385
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,728
No idea.

386
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,148
But I have a feeling it'll be
a holiday resort with an ocean view.

387
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,441
The ocean?

388
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,402
-Gosh, lucky you.
-Right?

389
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,654
Have you packed--

390
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,155
Hae-yi.

391
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,491
What's that noise?

392
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,412
Hae-yi. Please open the door.

393
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,914
Are you expecting someone?

394
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,332
Hae-yi, are you there?

395
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,086
-Me?
-I think so.

396
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,879
Please open up, Hae-yi.

397
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,466
-Do Hae-yi.
-Just open it slightly.

398
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,385
Please open--

399
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:54,970
Huh?

400
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,056
Isn't that Jin-hee's son?

401
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,183
-It is.
-What's he--

402
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,769
Open the door.

403
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,437
Hey, Seon-ho.

404
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,191
Bro. I missed you!

405
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,694
He reeks.

406
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,362
-Hey, let me… Goodness.
-Watch your step.

407
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:13,989
Gosh.

408
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,662
I'm so sorry for bothering you this late.

409
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,624
So why did you come
knocking at our door at this hour?

410
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,917
Ma'am.

411
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,505
You see, my heart…

412
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,717
I've been heartbroken.

413
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,928
I came because I was so heartbroken.

414
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,847
Gosh.

415
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,100
I thought maybe
I'd feel better if I saw Hae-yi.

416
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,643
Her?

417
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,939
I wanted to have you as my mother-in-law.

418
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,325
Seon-ho, stop crying.

419
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,244
-There, there.
-What's wrong with you?

420
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,747
My bro.

421
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,915
You were right.

422
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,209
It's because I'm so full of myself

423
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,462
that Hae-yi doesn't like me.

424
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,631
What are you saying?
Let's get you up first.

425
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,674
-Let's do that.
-Gosh.

426
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,885
There we go.

427
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,219
-But bro…
-Yes?

428
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,680
Can I keep calling you my bro?

429
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,353
He seems to be beside himself right now.
I'll take him to my room.

430
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,564
-You two go inside and sleep.
-Right. Get some sleep.

431
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,401
My bro. Where's Hae-yi?

432
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:35,945
Is she out?

433
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,117
What on earth did you do to him
to mess him up like that?

434
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,287
Beats me. What did I do to him?

435
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,622
Hey!

436
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,793
Be honest with me.
How far did you go with him?

437
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,754
-You can't say?
-No.

438
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,755
Not even to me?

439
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,133
You must have lost your mind!

440
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,980
Come out and eat, guys.

441
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,122
Gosh, it's so good.

442
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,542
How are these crabs so good?

443
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
I'm sorry, ma'am.

444
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,675
So?

445
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,886
Has your broken heart mended?

446
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,096
I'm sorry?

447
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,014
You said you were so heartbroken.

448
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,475
Watching you made my heart…

449
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,564
It made my heart ache so much.

450
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,024
-Goodness.
-Mom!

451
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,618
That's just how life is.

452
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,121
We don't always have control
over how others feel.

453
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:13,126
So just accept it instead of fighting it
if you stand no chance.

454
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,544
That's self-preservation.

455
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,506
Just think of her as some poop
you stepped on by mistake,

456
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,925
and time will solve everything.

457
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,510
Don't worry too much.

458
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,137
"Poop"? That's going too far.

459
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,390
Behave yourself
before you speak, you brat.

460
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,523
We're going to training camp soon.
Did you pack your things?

461
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,526
Are you dropping by your place?

462
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,362
You aren't taking anything?

463
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,118
You guys eat. I'll go get it.

464
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,496
-Did you buy something--
-No, it's not that.

465
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,455
You're here.

466
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,999
Come in. Gosh.

467
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,752
This is enough to travel abroad.

468
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,836
Come inside.

469
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,676
Mom, how did you know I was here?

470
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,722
There's your luggage.

471
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,809
Leave the house while you're at it.

472
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,893
Here.

473
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,522
Take your things
and experience for yourself

474
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:20,235
how cruel the world can be,
doing whatever it is that you want.

475
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,488
You're a grown-up after all, right?

476
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,450
I thought she'd stay up all night
waiting for him, so I called her.

477
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,744
Maybe I shouldn't have.

478
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,330
I told her to bring his things
if she was coming anyway.

479
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,833
Why'd you have to throw it?

480
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,419
You can take this to camp, right?
You're all set now.

481
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,463
Camp? What camp?

482
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,674
They're going to training camp today.
You didn't know?

483
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,384
Seon-ho, you…

484
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,345
-Why you…
-See you when I get back.

485
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,265
-You…
-Come on.

486
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,599
Hey, wait.

487
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,519
-Just leave him be.
-My goodness.

488
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,355
He's heartbroken right now.

489
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,606
Why?

490
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:03,486
He's in a lot of pain right now

491
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,073
-because of my daughter.
-Damn it.

492
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,910
They call it
the "law of conservation of absurdities."

493
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,955
You should be glad he's
going through it while he's still young.

494
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,415
Thanks for last night, bro.

495
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,336
I guess I shouldn't call you that anymore.

496
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,504
I don't mind it.

497
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,591
I don't mind if you call me that.

498
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,261
There's no knowing who will end up
being my brother-in-law

499
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,639
until the day of my sister's wedding.

500
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,106
You've got more grit than I thought.

501
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,822
My bro.

502
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,289
How will we get there?

503
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,042
Us? We'll take the bus.

504
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,002
-The bus?
-Yes.

505
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,176
Get in.

506
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,639
Get in.

507
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,730
Seon-ho.

508
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,817
Haven't you rebelled enough?

509
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,444
How much longer

510
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,155
must you disappoint me?

511
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,700
I'm not rebelling.
I'm just doing it because I want to.

512
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,495
Are you really doing this
for Chun-yang's daughter--

513
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,004
Is it really because of her?

514
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,924
Being in the cheering squad is hard,
but it's fun.

515
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,425
I made great friends there too.

516
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,471
This is the first time I actually
want to do something for myself.

517
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,350
That's why I want to keep going at it.

518
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,143
Listen, Seon-ho.

519
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:03,147
This is a very crucial time in your life.

520
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,983
As with everything, the first step--

521
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,484
I've accepted it, and so should you.

522
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,821
You need to see that we don't
always have a say in how others feel.

523
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,242
Fine…

524
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,619
if you say so.

525
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,207
I get it, so I'll let you go for now.

526
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,751
We'll talk after you get back.

527
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,213
I'll let you go today.

528
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,645
Seon-ho…

529
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,650
-It's so light.
-Give it back.

530
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,280
-Thank you for the ride.
-Sure.

531
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,449
Sure. Bye.

532
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,464
What's this? Why'd you two come together?

533
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,340
-I'll tell you later.
-What?

534
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,592
I said I'll tell you later.

535
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,093
-What was that?
-I'll tell you later!

536
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,555
-Why'd you pack so much?
-One of us is going to carry all the bags.

537
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,724
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

538
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,809
Gosh. Unbelievable.

539
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,738
SUMMER TRAINING CAMP

540
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,950
-Wow.
-It's been paid for by Yeong-woong.

541
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,703
Nice.

542
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,588
Theia's 51st recruits!

543
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,466
Go to your rooms
on the first floor, get changed,

544
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,926
and gather at the parking lot.

545
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,844
I'll give you exactly 15 minutes.

546
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,179
-What?
-I'm sorry?

547
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,474
Why aren't you answering?

548
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,602
I don't hear you. Answer loudly!

549
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,187
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

550
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,941
It'll be an extra ten minutes of training
for every minute you're late.

551
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,236
Wait. Where are our rooms?

552
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,741
That way. Go!

553
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,248
Run, Seon-ho!

554
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,136
Get a move on!

555
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,345
-Safe!
-Safe!

556
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,265
Late by 1 minute and 22 seconds.

557
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,684
That's an extra 20 minutes of training.

558
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,019
-What's with your boyfriend?
-Right then,

559
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,856
we'll now begin our summer training camp.

560
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,360
Let me hear you shout
loud and clear for ten seconds.

561
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,823
Is that all you've got?

562
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,663
Shout loud and clear,
or it'll be another 20 laps.

563
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,040
One more time!

564
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,046
Fifteen!

565
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,680
-You can do it.
-I'm beat.

566
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,725
Why am I even doing all of this?

567
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,560
What happened to my piña colada?

568
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,353
Don't talk to me.
I need to save up my energy.

569
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,025
After the ten-minute break,
we'll go over the choreography.

570
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,068
Your break starts now!

571
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,198
I've rolled around so much
I can taste the dirt in my mouth.

572
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,407
I need to go wash up.

573
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,867
Me too.

574
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,747
Hey, do something.
Can't you do something as his girlfriend?

575
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,582
Have you seen my boyfriend?

576
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,876
I lost my boyfriend today,

577
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,128
and I still haven't found him yet.

578
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,756
Seriously. Where'd he go?

579
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,718
I'm so angry right now.
I'll have it out with him later.

580
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,600
MS. LEE SUN-JA

581
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,187
Hello?

582
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,814
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

583
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,275
-Happy birthday, dear Seon-ja
-Happy birthday, dear Seon-ja

584
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,526
Seon-ja!

585
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,695
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

586
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,531
-Happy birthday!
-It's tomorrow.

587
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,658
Don't get too excited yet.

588
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,578
But we may not be the first ones
to congratulate you tomorrow.

589
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,248
Are you celebrating with everyone at camp?

590
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,832
Of course.

591
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,834
We're going to party it out

592
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,964
at a luxurious pool-side villa
drinking piña coladas, so don't worry.

593
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,465
Sure, sure.

594
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,969
Hae-yi's there too, so I'm sure
they have something prepared.

595
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,387
I love you, Seon-ja!

596
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,764
-Take care of yourself.
-Fine.

597
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,307
-Be careful out there.
-I get it.

598
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,268
-Of cars, boys, alcohol, and everything.
-I'll be home safe.

599
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,769
-We'll hang up now.
-That's enough now.

600
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,980
-Don't trust anyone besides me!
-Oh, gosh.

601
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,695
There you are, Sleepyhead!

602
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,366
Sleepyhead.

603
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,373
-Sleepyhead.
-What is it?

604
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,917
What's the date tomorrow?

605
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:15,835
Tomorrow?

606
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,923
August…

607
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,509
27th. Why?

608
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,555
"August 27th."

609
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,682
It's a great day, isn't it?

610
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,269
-Right.
-Yes.

611
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,772
But we'll be working like dogs
on a good day like that.

612
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,110
We have training to get to. Get ready.

613
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,576
Six, seven, eight!

614
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,872
-Sit, stand, and stop
-Sit, stand, and stop

615
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,666
-Run, run, and pull
-Run, run, and pull

616
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,460
-And sit
-Louder.

617
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,962
-Stand and stop
-Stand and stop

618
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,130
With more power.

619
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,798
-Run, run, and pull
-Pull harder!

620
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,469
-Shout out loud
-Shout out loud

621
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,971
-Let's get up again
-Let's get up again

622
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,723
-And jump
-And jump

623
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,231
I just want to go home.

624
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,816
How much would a cab cost?

625
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,194
How could they do this today, of all days?

626
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,699
-What's so special about today?
-It's a very special day. Isn't it?

627
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,540
Next, we have swimming.

628
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,503
Get into your swimsuits
and gather by the pool in ten minutes.

629
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,505
Okay.

630
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,425
Why do we need to swim
when we're a cheering squad?

631
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,719
It's not like we cheer underwater.

632
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,141
Let's start training
since everyone's here.

633
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,102
-Okay.
-Okay.

634
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,436
Ready.

635
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,232
The last schedule we have
for summer training camp…

636
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,985
is having fun at the pool!

637
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,409
Good work, everyone.

638
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,454
The final training is to have
all the fun without any injuries.

639
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,914
-Okay!
-Okay!

640
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,919
Jeong-woo.

641
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,047
-You see…
-Grab him!

642
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,591
-What's this? Wait!
-I didn't put them up to it.

643
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,803
-One, two…
-Throw him!

644
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,054
-three!
-Three!

645
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,728
-Hey, Jeong-woo!
-Jeong-woo!

646
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,148
-Jeong-woo!
-Is he okay?

647
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,925
What was that? You startled me!

648
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,594
Come with me.

649
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,816
Come sit.

650
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,864
What is it?

651
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,742
This was the only way
we could spend time together.

652
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,328
Why would you want to do that?

653
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,121
Huh?

654
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,582
Do I know you?

655
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,168
You see, it's been a few days
since I lost my boyfriend.

656
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,586
I'm sorry.

657
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,548
I've gone overboard
with training, haven't I?

658
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,760
Don't.

659
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,262
Why are you going easy on yourself?

660
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,805
-What?
-Hit yourself harder.

661
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,516
Darn you.

662
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,769
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

663
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,063
I'm sorry.

664
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm sorry. Come closer.

665
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,926
Do you not like me?

666
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,720
-I like you.
-Come closer then.

667
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,393
Give me your hand.

668
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,280
-What a punk.
-This is…

669
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,322
How am I a punk?

670
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,200
It's going to fall on her.

671
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,290
Oops.

672
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,711
You're it then.

673
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,630
-You're it
-You're it

674
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,842
Let's play again. One more game.

675
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,469
Let's go again then.

676
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,398
Where's Hae-yi?

677
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,692
I haven't seen her for a while now.

678
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,862
Why are you looking for her
all of a sudden?

679
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,783
Gosh, he's unbelievable.

680
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,455
And where on earth is Hae-yi?

681
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,167
We'll need to keep this up for a while.
Will you be okay with it?

682
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,714
This is a little too much, honestly.
It's like we're in the military.

683
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,634
That's how I really feel,

684
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,552
but what else can I do?

685
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,554
I knew what I was getting myself into.

686
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,725
I promise to treat you twice as well
when we're alone together.

687
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,936
Do you mean it?

688
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,648
No. I'll treat you ten times better.

689
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,110
I'd be fine with a hundred times.

690
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,467
Is this it? This place is amazing.

691
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,636
Grab our stuff.

692
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,553
Run.

693
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,350
Wait for me!

694
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,894
-To the bus!
-To the bus!

695
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,360
-We almost got caught.
-I thought no one was there.

696
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,695
-Let's get in.
-I think we're safe.

697
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,742
Should I get in first?

698
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,962
Anyone want another one?

699
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,840
-Me!
-Hey, come on.

700
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,633
You can quench your thirst with that.

701
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,468
Come here, you…

702
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,076
What's this?

703
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,121
It's your birthday.

704
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,748
How did you know?

705
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,628
I saw the huge memo
on the calendar at your place.

706
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,713
SEON-JA'S BIRTHDAY

707
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,089
It said "Seon-ja's birthday."

708
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,510
Thanks.

709
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,387
It's nothing.

710
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,097
It's a big deal.

711
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,141
This is my first birthday gift this year.

712
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,938
This would've been the worst birthday ever
if it wasn't for you.

713
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,691
I'm sure Hae-yi hasn't forgotten.

714
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,362
I doubt it. She's been mixing
business with leisure these days.

715
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,158
Right. Birthdays aren't a big deal.

716
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,993
People can forget when they're busy.

717
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,829
Right.

718
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,335
There you are, Seon-ja.

719
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,586
When did you get back?

720
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,505
I need to go get some playing cards.
Come with me.

721
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,635
Let's go.

722
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:50,349
The weather is great
And it makes me feel so good

723
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,022
Hold on.

724
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,362
They found my wallet on the bus.
Let's stop by.

725
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,322
Go and bring it. I'll head back.

726
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,409
Come with me. I'm bored.

727
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,328
Come on.

728
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,082
Hey, can you go a little slower?

729
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,416
You go ahead.

730
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,960
No, let's go together.

731
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,218
Hey, are you all right?

732
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:28,845
I'm bleeding.

733
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,599
I told you to go alone.

734
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,227
Wait, but…

735
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,564
Why do I always have to
go along with what you want?

736
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,774
You go off on your own
then come back to me

737
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,734
only when you're bored.

738
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,027
Am I a sidekick to you?

739
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,282
You didn't see
how down I was today, did you?

740
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,284
Of course you didn't.

741
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,328
You were too busy
hanging out with Jeong-woo to notice.

742
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,706
I was always the one to look after you.

743
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,418
I'm sick of always having to
play along with you.

744
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,924
-What's going on?
-Don't open it now!

745
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,979
Surprise!

746
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,147
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SEON-JA

747
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,733
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday.

748
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,067
Happy birthday.

749
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,779
Wait…

750
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,031
Isn't today her birthday?

751
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,430
Are Jeong-woo and Hae-yi actually…

752
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,613
MIJIN HOSPITAL

753
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,749
VOICE RECORDINGS

754
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,049
"Capture the leaders"?

755
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,261
The leader, vice leader, and the head
of the planning team are hiding inside.

756
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:34,930
LEADER

757
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,015
VICE LEADER, LEADER, HEAD OF PLANNING TEAM

758
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,268
They'll be wearing this name tag,

759
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,145
so find them and retrieve it from them.

760
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,730
All right then.

761
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,483
Take your flashlights and head inside.

762
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,401
-Okay.
-Okay.

763
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,112
-I call this one.
-Let's go.

764
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,217
It really doesn't seem like
the best time for this.

765
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,157
Right. Let's give them some alone time.

766
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,787
I'm not scared.

767
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,457
I'm not scared at all.

768
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,184
Don't worry about Seon-ja.

769
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,686
You two will make up in no time.

770
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,856
Just give it some time.

771
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,943
Listen.

772
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,655
I think everyone already knows, but…

773
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,493
-Jeong-woo and I--
-Don't say it.

774
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,370
I'll just pretend not to know, so don't.

775
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,832
We decided to forget about
our kiss in Busan too.

776
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,586
And we'll forget you ever rejected me.

777
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,464
Let's just stay as friends.

778
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,845
I get that I don't have a say
in how you feel,

779
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,183
but the problem is that
I don't have control over mine either.

780
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,230
So I've been thinking…

781
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,861
I'll just leave it as is
and do what my heart tells me to.

782
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,867
If you're more comfortable
having me as a friend, do as you wish.

783
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,494
But to me,

784
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,373
you're more than just that.

785
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,256
You can do what your heart tells you
and I'll do the same.

786
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,800
How about it?

787
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,094
Why don't you just curse me out?

788
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,430
I don't want to.

789
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,810
I'll take a look over there.

790
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,603
Let's find Jeong-woo and win the prize.

791
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,017
Hae-yi.

792
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:11,813
Jeong-woo?

793
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,232
Hae-yi.

794
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,078
Hae-yi.

795
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:36,922
Jeong-woo.

796
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,548
Is that you?

797
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,511
Hae-yi.

798
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,442
Jeong-woo?

799
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,792
Jeong-woo.

800
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,507
Jeong-woo.

801
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,052
What the heck?

802
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,265
Is this supposed to be funny?

803
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,487
Excuse me.

804
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,156
Guys!

805
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,704
Guys!

806
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,375
What's going on?

807
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:14,853
Guys!

808
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:16,688
Sleepyhead?

809
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,156
Jeong-woo.

810
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,951
Anyone?

811
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:33,913
Jeong-woo!

812
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,799
Mom!

813
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,011
Mom. Open the door!

814
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,679
Mom!

815
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:07,947
Sleepyhead?

816
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,283
Sleepyhead!

817
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,782
I got you.

818
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,202
Fine.

819
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:55,829
You win.

820
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,498
I'll admit defeat like a man.

821
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,130
Jeong-woo!

822
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,548
Jeong-woo!

823
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,885
Jeong-woo, a fire broke out!

824
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,731
It's a fire. Fire!

825
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,816
What should I do?

826
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:26,901
Seon-ja…

827
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,071
Seon-ja…

828
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,701
Is someone in there?

829
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,498
Hello?

830
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:50,091
Sleepyhead! Are you all right? Hey!

831
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,260
-Sleepyhead!
-I can't…

832
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,304
Stay awake, Hae-yi!

833
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,431
Open your eyes, Hae-yi!

834
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,601
Is anyone there?

835
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,811
Hae-yi!

836
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,606
Stay awake, Hae-yi!

837
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,815
Open your eyes!

838
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,151
Hae-yi!

839
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,070
-Hae-yi! No!
-Seon-ja…

840
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,156
Is anyone there?

841
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,240
No…

842
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,618
Stay awake, Sleepyhead!

843
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,119
Open your eyes!

844
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,830
Hey!

845
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,628
Come on, Hae-yi!

846
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,005
Is anyone there?

847
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,549
Help! Sleepyhead!

848
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:47,941
Help!

849
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,860
Hae-yi's trapped inside.

850
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,789
Seon-ja said the door was locked.

851
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,333
Why that door, of all of them?

852
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,002
Should we quit the cheering squad?

853
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,170
What if there's another accident?

854
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,965
It was too suspicious
to just call it an accident.

855
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,384
Are you saying
someone did it intentionally?

856
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,844
Just what is your goal?

857
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,221
You were the ones who ruined it,
and I'm the one who protected it.

858
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,681
You know who it is, don't you?

859
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,974
You know who the real culprit is.

860
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:07,437
