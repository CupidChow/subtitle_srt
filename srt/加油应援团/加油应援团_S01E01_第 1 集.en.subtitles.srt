THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,665
I am precious.

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,629
I deserve happiness and success.

5
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,715
REMINDER
PAY RENT, 750,000 WON

6
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:53,136

8
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,098
I am rich.

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,602
I love money,

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,022
and money loves me.

11
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,484
All the wealth of the universe…

12
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,818
YOUR STOCKS HAVE DROPPED BY 5%

13
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,447
…is flowing into me.

14
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,201
REMINDER
START OF THE NEW SEMESTER

15
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,410
Cheer up.

16
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,609
That spring,

17
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,612
the cherry blossoms
were exceptionally pretty.

18
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,783
The entire world seemed to be
rooting for my new beginning.

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,330
At the turning point of my life
when I turned twenty,

20
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:06,459
I was so certain that everything
was going as I had planned.

21
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,714
That is until I met you.

22
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,504
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,009
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR COLLEGE ENTRANCE

24
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,846
-Let's soar into the sky
-Let's soar into the sky

25
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,475
-We are one
-We are one

26
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,187
-Let's soar into the sky
-Let's soar into the sky

27
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,024
-We are one
-We are one

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,198
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

29
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,717
ABOLISH THE CORRUPT CHEERING SQUAD THEIA

30
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,897
That was amazing!

31
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,860
Damn it.

32
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,946
Thank you.

33
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,322
Woon-chan.

34
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,120
There are three types
of people in this world.

35
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,705
First, people who do things properly.

36
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,331
Second, people who try.

37
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,375
Third, people who
don't do things properly.

38
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,711
Which do you think you are?

39
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,337
Number…

40
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,048
-two?
-That's right.

41
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,510
You should be
in the second group at the least,

42
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,305
so why are you in the third group?

43
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,142
We need to perform
for the orientation today.

44
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,685
Is this what you'll do on stage?

45
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,645
I was a little confused.

46
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:15,982
A little.

47
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,859
You stay behind
and practice 50 more times.

48
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,776
Jeong-woo!

49
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,653
I'll dislocate my shoulder.

50
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,613
-A hundred times then.
-Come on!

51
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,578
It's because of the new choreography
he added last minute.

52
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,289
I know a nice hospital
if you do dislocate your shoulder.

53
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,750
Have fun with your practice.

54
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,295
I have to return the ice box.

55
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,296
Damn it.

56
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,006
Get in position.

57
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,093
One, two, three, one!

58
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,888
-One, two, three…
-It's just the four of them

59
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,015
trying to fill the entire stage.

60
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,267
What do they expect?

61
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,206
I'm sorry,
but could you take a photo for me?

62
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,248
Thank you.

63
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,669
-How do I look?
-Take a look.

64
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,587
Thank you.

65
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,840
So pretty.

66
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,677
They're so pretty!

67
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,641
Hello there, kitty.

68
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,730
This place is huge.

69
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,287
"2019 Freshman."

70
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,375
"Do Hae-yi."

71
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,961
"2019 Freshman. Do Hae-yi."

72
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,805
What are you doing?

73
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,182
Well…

74
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,351
It's like a time capsule.

75
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,646
This is public property.

76
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,481
You shouldn't be vandalizing it.

77
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,233
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,902
Wipe it off or I'll report you.

79
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,945
Okay.

80
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,866
Who is that?

81
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,702
Is he the maintenance guy?

82
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,787
He's too young to be one.

83
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,622
What do I do with this?

84
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,167
This is bad.

85
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,839
Hey, the vandal is getting away.

86
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,048
You, stop there!

87
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,136
She's gone.

88
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,667
What are you doing?

89
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,794
They say it's good for blood circulation.

90
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,087
"Circulation."

91
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,297
"Circulation."

92
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,424
-Come on.
-Blood circulation?

93
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,718
Right. That's important.

94
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,722
Your shoulders are stiff.

95
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,724
Hey, that hurts.

96
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
Who stretches like that?

97
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,395
Stretch your legs out.

98
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,232
I'll give you a good stretch.

99
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,819
Breathe.

100
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,072
Jeong-woo, help!

101
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,993
-Let's get changed.
-Okay.

102
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,456
Jeez, you were hurting me.

103
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,340
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD
LEADER PARK JEONG-WOO

104
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,808
There he goes again.

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,042
I look pretty good.

106
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,345
I'll do my best, Yu-min.

107
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,401
Sleepyhead!

108
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,698
I managed to get it for you.

109
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,284
You're amazing!

110
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,138
Jeez.

111
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,683
You still eat like a pig, Sleepyhead.

112
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,312
You're in college now.
Can't you act more cultured?

113
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,232
Where did you get the school jacket?

114
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,486
Entering class of '10? It's ancient.

115
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,029
It was 3,000 won online.

116
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,364
I don't know who's worse,

117
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,866
someone who sold such an ancient jacket
or the one who bought it.

118
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,994
The owner of Panda Snacks
noticed my jacket and gave me free eggs,

119
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,246
asking if I was a student here.

120
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,165
Nice of you to get free eggs.

121
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,958
Well, it's not bad.

122
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,251
You know what?

123
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,921
It's amazing how you
never cease to embarrass me.

124
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,674
I may have barely made the cut,

125
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,343
but I'm going to make it big

126
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,097
and turn my life around
with the connections I'll make here.

127
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,848
That's my master plan.

128
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,308
Here's what my mom said.

129
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,852
No one hardly makes it
from the bottom to the top these days.

130
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,063
So you should stop dreaming

131
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,981
and party like a freshman should.

132
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,358
You'll end up the same either way.

133
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,194
I'm not like the others.

134
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,071
I was made to rise to the top.

135
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,114
Sure.

136
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,242
All you have is your spirit.
You should at least have a lot of that.

137
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,911
-Good for you.
-Thanks.

138
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,288
-You're amazing.
-I'm cool, aren't I?

139
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,216
What are you doing here?

140
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,843
I was looking.

141
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,970
-Looking for what?
-My future girlfriend.

142
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,472
Didn't you say you had one
during the orientation?

143
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,682
We broke up.

144
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,226
How long has it been? Two weeks?

145
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,605
You're a piece of work.

146
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,442
Seoul sure is full of ladykillers.

147
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,370
Where are you off to?

149
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,506
Isn't that… Jae-hyeok?

150
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,845
Have you not told him yet?

151
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,888
I will soon.

152
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,249
BUTLER CHOI

153
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,054
Your cupcakes are here.

154

-Thank you.
-Here's your dry cleaning.

155
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,892
-I'm here for pest control.
-Please catch the roach.

156
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,477
-Where is it?
-In the kitchen.

157
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,270
How big is it? Gosh, I can do this.

158
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,859
-Thank you.
-Have a good night.

159
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,656
-Butler service.
-Please throw this out for me.

160
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,033
-Sure. Have a good day.
-Thanks.

I'll pay you 100,000 won.

166
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,341
100,000 won?

167
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,303
Of course.

168

ACCEPT MISSION

169
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,182
BUTLER DO HAE-YI
YOUR MISSION IS IN PROGRESS

170
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,123
It's nothing big.

171
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,626
-Happy birthday!
-Congratulations!

172
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,503
-What's this?
-Congratulations.

173
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,671
Are you serious?

174
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,798
-Try it on.
-Go ahead.

175
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,300
Drink up.

176
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,219
Come on.

177
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,099
Are you Mr. Jin Seon-ho?

178
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,475
-Who is she?
-Yes.

179
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,110
SON OF A BITCH

180
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,280
What the hell is this?

181
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,783
"It will be over for us
after you blow this candle out."

182
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,203
"I hope we never meet again.
I can't stand the sight of you."

183
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,080
This is a message from Ms. Han Seol-a.

184
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,207
-How can you get dumped on your birthday?
-You got dumped?

185
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,751
-You don't have to do that.
-Come on.

186
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,003
I guess we'll celebrate
that I'm single again.

187
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,047
-Let's party.
-Let's go.

188
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,549
Excuse me. May I take a photo?

189
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,259
I need to prove to her that I did my job.

190
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,969
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Thanks.

191
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,013
-Make yourself look good.
-Strike a pose.

192
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,931
Come on.

193
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,352
Thank you.

194
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,978
-Well done.
-Bottoms up.

195
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,190
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

196
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm really sorry,

197
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,027
but would it be okay
if I took another photo?

198
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,612
You're smiling too much.

199
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,950
I think it'd be better
if you looked a little sad.

200
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,952
Would this work?

201
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,663
-Shed some tears.
-That's good.

202
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,708
Thank you.

203
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,460
Wait.

204
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,301
Do you have a boyfriend?

205
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,011
As you can see, I'm single now.

206
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,683
I was joking.

207
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,686
What a nutjob.

208
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,106
Come here, Seon-ho. Let's drink.

209
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,149
-Take a seat.
-Come on.

210
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,110
I've completed the job.

211
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,115
JAE-HYEOK

212
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,996
Hey, baby. I just got off work.

213
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,330
Where are you?

214
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,082
I don't think we can meet today.

215
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,750
My mom said I need to come home.

216
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,130
Home?

217
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,257
She asked me to come home early today.

218
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,510
You must be tired. Go home and rest.

219
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,013
I'll be home, so I can't talk.
I'll message you later.

220
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,185
Okay.

221
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,272
This is why you shouldn't date anyone.

222
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,406
This place is crowded. I'm so excited.

223
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,449
Do we have to dance?

224
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,452
-I'm excited.
-Dance? We'll be busy kissing girls.

225
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,249
You're breaking up with her? Why?

226
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,460
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

227
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,088
She works all the time, so we hardly meet.

228
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,256
But she's pretty.

229
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,341
That's when we were in high school.

230
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,012
I'm just going to
call it quits and start anew.

231
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,432
I need to find someone
from a similar background.

232
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,852
I guess couples are common in med school.

233
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,730
But why does Do Hae-yi work so much?

234
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,814
Is she that poor?

235
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,859
She's just…

236
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,487
too much for me to handle.

237
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,116
Let's go.

238
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,002
I'm sorry. You can go now.

239
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,351
Sleepyhead.

240
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,268
Sleepyhead!

241
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,895
Yes?

242
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,147
Let's go.
I'll buy you a meal at the dining hall.

243
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,401
-All right.
-Let's go.

244
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,862
Hurry before my mood's ruined.

245
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,698
I want some tteokbokki.

246
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,456
The freshman Do Hae-yi?

247
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,426
I'm bleeding.

248
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,136
What's this?

249
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,057
I thought I'd help cover you up.

250
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,516
Who even are you?

251
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,228
I'm Park Jeong-woo.

252
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,648
Well…

253
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,276
People walking by
were staring at you sprawled out.

254
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,404
I thought it'd help to protect
your identity if I covered your face.

255
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,618
Oh, my outfit?

256
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,994
You see, this is…

257
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,121
This is a uniform for the cheering squad.

258
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,164
Pervert!

259
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,041
Help me!

260
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,212
This was hand-tailored
by André Kim himself.

261
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,631
This is…

262
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,431
2018 CSAT PRACTICE EXAM
ENGLISH SECTION, SCORE: 89

263
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,724
Seon-ja.

264
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,518
I saw a crazy man just now.

265
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,604
-What?
-He was a lunatic.

266
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,356
He covered me up with newspapers.

267
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,441
He must think he's Prince Charming.

268
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,111
He was wearing these tacky clothes
that no one would ever dream of wearing.

269
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,445
-He approached me and--
-Excuse me.

270
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,614
-Oh, my goodness!
-You startled me.

271
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,949
Look. That's what I mean.

272
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,951
Are you always like this?

273
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,996
What do you mean?

274
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,498
Criticizing others when you don't know
anything about them.

275
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,833
Are you always like that?

276
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,294
Well, that's--

277
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,088
This is a long-lived
cheer uniform of the school.

278
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,090
I have it on
because of the freshman orientation,

279
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,967
not because I'm crazy.

280
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,677
Okay.

281
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,470
And I was trying to help cover your face

282
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,514
since people were staring at you.

283
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,936
You vandalized the amphitheater too.

284
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,981
Did you ever stop to think
maybe you're the one with problems?

285
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,985
-I'm sorry?
-Yet you call me the crazy one?

286
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,902
What about you?

287
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,739
You were sleeping out in public.
Doesn't that make you a…

288
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,781
Make me what?

289
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,453
A crazy woman?

290
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,913
Well…

291
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,125
You should try to compose yourself better.

292
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,128
Listen. How dare you--

293
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,547
I can't believe this.
Who do you think you are--

294
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,798
You can go on your way.

295
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,344
I must have left this behind. Thank you.

296
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,971
But, still--

297
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,890
-Goodbye.
-Are you serious right now?

298
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,683
Is it so strange
to be sleeping out in public?

299
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,310
This is so frustrating and unfair.

300
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:34,936
Go ahead.

301
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,730
-Talk to him.
-Don't stop me.

302
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,190
I'm not stopping you.

303
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:46,948
What is it?

304
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,076
Listen.

305
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,453
Say you were sleeping
and a stranger covered you up with this.

306
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,496
How would you feel?

307
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,667
I shouldn't have done that.

308
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,963
Our uniform doesn't look
that tacky, don't you think?

309
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,132
What's he on about?

310
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,344
Hey.

311
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,264
Don't tell me you seriously think
that our uniform looks cool.

312
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,351
What?

313
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,604
Why don't you go on a blind date
wearing that then?

314
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,691
Jeong-woo, shall we go?

315
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh, gosh.

316
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,252
What? "Compose myself better"?

317
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,129
Is he on the student council or something?

318
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,797
He has no idea what he's done.

319
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,216
He wasn't entirely wrong.

320
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,177
You always have to be right, don't you?

321
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,180
I also feel the need
to cover you up when you're sleeping.

322
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,515
What did I do?

323
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,934
Do I look that bad?

324
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,105
I'm so pretty.

325
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,818
You're so annoying.

326
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,655
By the way, I think he was
wearing the cheering squad uniform.

327
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,698
The cheering squad?

328
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,657
Come.

329
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,496
The campus is huge.

330
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,960
What is it? Where are you going?

331
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,101
Come on.

332
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,578
Thank you!

333
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,207
-They should be up next.
-Who?

334
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,791
The cheering squad.

335
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,502
The Vultures have
put on a great show for us.

336
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,837
Next up,

337
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,216
we have the traditional pride
of our school.

338
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,135
Please welcome Theia
with a big round of applause.

339
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,518
-Let's leave.
-Come on, let's go.

340
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,479
What? Why is everyone leaving?

341
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,951
He must be the leader.

342
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,007
We are Theia,
Yonhee University's cheering squad.

343
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,468
Look at his ego. Why is he so serious?

344
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,512
He must think the stage is theirs.

345
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,943
We will be your ray of light
in the darkness!

346
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,279
Get ready, everyone!

347
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,339
Akaraka!

348
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,425
Akaraka!

349
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,801
-Let's fight!
-Let's fight!

350
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,803
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

351
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,472
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

352
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,563
-Everyone in Yonhee, scream!
-Everyone in Yonhee, scream!

353
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,448
Right, left!

354
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,283
Right, left!

355
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,285
Right, left!

356
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,705
-Akaraka!
-Akaraka!

357
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,375
-Akaraka!
-Akaraka!

358
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,254
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

359
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,050
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

360
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,012
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

361
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,849
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

362
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,355
Welcome to the school, everyone.

363
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,732
Everyone in Yonhee,

364
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,650
scream!

365
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,618
-Akaraka!
-Akaraka!

366
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,122
-Akaraka!
-Akaraka!

367
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,294
-Let's go while we sing our song
-Let's go while we sing our song

368
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,256
-Let's soar into the sky
-Let's soar into the sky

369
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,841
-Yonhee
-Yonhee!

370
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,843
-We are one
-We are one

371
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:03,014
Let's shout Yonhee
Off the top of our lungs

372
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,730
They're awesome!

373
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,578
Seon-ja.

374
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,831
I need to poop.

375
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,165
Go ahead, then.

376
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,485
That was awesome.

377
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,959
Yonhee
We are one

378
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:17,005
Let's shout Yonhee
Off the top of our lungs

379
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,060
Are you a freshman? I'm a freshman too.

380
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,854
I see.

381
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,856
We're both freshmen,
so I can talk casually, right?

382
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,484
Well, we only just met.

383
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,194
That's not true.

384
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,570
You even took a photo of me.

385
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,783
Do you have a boyfriend?

386
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,992
You're that nut…

387
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,412
What a coincidence. What major are you?

388
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,039
Theology?

389
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,999
Entering class of '10?

390
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,879
Are you hitting on me?

391
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,173
-Yes.
-Right.

392
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,674
Well, I'm not interested.

393
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,551
I could change that.

394
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,264
As you can see, I'm quite the pretty type.

395
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,600
Meaning this isn't
the first time I've been hit on.

396
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,853
People like you never seem to get it
unless I make myself clear,

397
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,688
so here it goes.

398
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,898
I'm not interested in you.

399
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,567
I'm not interested now
and I never will be.

400
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,610
Bye now.

401
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,572
What do you mean by "people like you"?

402
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,991
People who think
I'll fall for them when they hit on me.

403
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,785
So that's the kind of person I am.

404
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,912
We only just met
but you seem to know me well.

405
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,832
You see,

406
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,542
I'm real fucking poor.

407
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,837
Do you know what
someone poor like me has to do

408
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,797
to pay for the tuition
of five million won?

409
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,423
I have to work my ass off.

410
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,175
And what does that mean?

411
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,511
I won't have time
to hang out with you, will I?

412
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,224
I'll scream if you keep following me.

413
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,106
She's unbelievable.

414
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:15,248
2019 YONHEE UNIVERSITY
FRESHMAN ORIENTATION

415
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,916
Please help us abolish Theia.

416
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,712
Let's abolish Theia
for not doing their jobs.

417
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,755
Let's show them our resolution

418
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,883
by boycotting their joint cheering event.

419
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,552
Your tuition fees are going to waste.

420
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,597
Let's get together
to normalize our school festival.

421
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,766
We should no longer
allow them to run a bad festival.

422
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:38,646
-Sign the petition to abolish Theia…
-"Abolish Theia."

423
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,190
Do your job right, will you?

424
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,069
I guess you can't,
seeing how there's only four of you.

425
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,157
-Are you trying to pick a fight?
-I'm just worried.

426
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,909
You saw people leave earlier, didn't you?

427
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,994
You're making everyone look bad.

428
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,203
You know, I guess…

429
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,665
you could try to act all cute

430
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,043
-to turn the public in your favor.
-You bastard.

431
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,128
You fucking bastard.

432
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,173
Let go, Woon-chan.

433
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,175
-But this bastard--
-I said let go.

434
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,263
You should have brought it up with me.

435
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,433
You won't get anywhere
talking to one of our members.

436
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,770
I was just upset, that's all.

437
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,606
We should all be careful.

438
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,609
Let's not cause any trouble.

439
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,611
What is it?

440
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,115
They seemed to have been in an argument.

441
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,784
It's sorted.

442
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,330
It's been a tough year, hasn't it?

443
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,291
Everyone left because of the incident
last year and the three prophecies.

444
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,545
You'll need some new members.
I'm sure you have a lot on your mind.

445
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,464
I'll have to keep trying.

446
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,383
I swear, it still baffles me

447
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,010
some people actually believe
such nonsense enough to run away.

448
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,137
Jeez.

449
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,431
How are there already mosquitos out…

450
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,726
buzzing around and getting on my nerves?

451
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,651
We'll get going then.

452
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,072
Damn it.

453
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,034
Even the honor guards are trying
to take over the cheering squad.

454
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,245
It's as if we're fried chicken to them.

455
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,872
They're trying to gobble us up.

456
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,582
Let them.

457
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,584
We'll put them all in their places.

458
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,296
"Chicken."

459
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,966
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF STUDENT AFFAIRS
SHIN JI-YOUNG

460
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,927
Hello?

461
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,847
What was that about?

462
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,807
What's that about the three prophecies?

463
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,518
Don't you know?
The three prophecies about Theia?

464
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,273
They're looking at a shitty year to come.

465
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,404
One of their seniors became a shaman.

466
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,786
When he became a shaman 20 years ago,

467
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,956
he visited during homecoming
and made three prophecies as a gift.

468
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,501
20 YEARS AGO

469
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,757
1999 ALUMNI'S NIGHT
THEIA

470
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,189
First.

471
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,152
When the nation is swept up
by the red wave in 2002,

472
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,236
the cheering squad…

473
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,239
will also be swept up in the red wave.

474
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,908
-What does that mean?
-Seriously?

475
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,493
It's nonsense.

476
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,120
PROPHECIES IN 1999
2002 RED

477
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:45,792
RED

478
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,505
On the day of the semi-finals
of the 2002 World Cup…

479
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,672
-Korea
-Korea

480
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,509
-Korea
-Korea

481
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,428
-Korea
-Korea

482
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,388
Isn't that smoke?

483
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,599
It really is smoke. Take a look.

484
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,060
-Why is there smoke at the school?
-Take a look!

485
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,228
Let's take a look.

486
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,270
What's this smell?

487
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,607
ENTRY RESTRICTED
THEIA MEMBERS ONLY

488
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,736
Oh, gosh! Fire!

489
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,530
…a fire broke out
in the cheering squad room.

490
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,865
Thankfully, no one was injured…

491
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,492
Put it out! Quick!

492
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,704
…but they never found out
what caused the fire.

493
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,956
Second.

494
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,584
Four legs in the cheering squad
will break in 2011.

495
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,336
YEAR 2011
FOUR LEGS WILL BREAK

496
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,380
BREAK

497
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,464
One!

498
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,926
Two!

499
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,885
Three!

500
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,762
Four!

501
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,974
You see that?

502
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,518
That's all the legs
we'll see broken this year.

503
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,936
Don't even bring up that prophecy.

504
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,653
-Hey, are you all right?
-What happened?

505
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,910
-Hey, are you all right?
-What happened?

506
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,540
That year, four legs broke
due to that accident on stage.

507
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,920
The most important is the third prophecy.

508
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,882
It's said to happen this year.

509
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,217
What's it about?

510
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,098
What?

511
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,310
You're cutting back on our funds again?

512
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,812
It's unfortunate, I know.

513
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:34,108
It's a huge dent in the 50-year history
of our cheering squad.

514
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,111
And it breaks my heart to tell you this.

515
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,659
But it was too big of a mistake
to sweep under the rug.

516
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,037
YONHEE UNIVERSITY'S FESTIVAL
WAS AN EPIC FAIL

517
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,663
THERE'S HARDLY ANYONE THERE LOL

518
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,498
It was the worst.

519
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,917
Don't ever come.

520
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,294
-It was the worst.
-The absolute worst.

521
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,545
I ENVY HOKYUNG UNIVERSITY
THANK GOODNESS I DIDN'T GO LOL

522
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
I KNEW THE CHEERING SQUAD
WOULD SCREW IT UP LOL

523
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,548
POST

524
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,469
I want to make it clear
that it was all a misunderstanding.

525
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,971
-Won't you reveal the accounting books?
-Well, that's…

526
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,099
A public hearing was held
for alleged fund embezzlement.

527
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,936
The students were in an uproar
to abolish the cheering squad.

528
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,356
The only solution
is to abolish Theia for doing a bad job.

529
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,607
Please sign our petition.

530
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,984
WE DEMAND ANSWERS
FROM THE CORRUPT CHEERING SQUAD

531
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,445
We were in an extremely tight spot.

532
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,740
You even had to submit
a written apology, didn't you?

533
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,658
Yes, sir.

534
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,454
We should be thankful that we managed
not to shut down the cheering squad.

535
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,289
Don't you think this is
the best for everyone?

536
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,834
Everyone's busy
making ends meet these days.

537
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,381
Festivals and stuff like that
are only held as a formality.

538
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,883
The times have changed, right?

539
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,513
Ma'am. This doesn't make sense.

540
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,931
How could they cut back on our funds?

541
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,517
So why did you have to cause
such a huge commotion?

542
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
Our former leader
was responsible for that.

543
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,437
They've been held responsible
and replaced already.

544
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,898
Haven't you heard of joint liability?

545
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,693
The funds go to the cheering squad,
not to you guys individually.

546
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,696
We have enough people
asking us for money as it is.

547
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,740
We've already forwarded
this year's budget plans, so stop already.

548
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,242
Please don't do this.

549
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,369
Can't you talk to the director
one more time--

550
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,329
I told you to stop.

551
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,623
Ma'am.

552
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,835
Please.

553
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,753
Could you please think it over?

554
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,631
Do you think kneeling
is going to earn you any money?

555
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,050
Don't tell me he's serious.

556
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,554
My legs just went weak briefly
from all the practice.

557
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,556
I'm busy, so get out…

558
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,350
That nutjob.

559
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,518
Get lost.

560
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,944
Have you chosen a club to join?

561
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,487
I'm thinking of joining
the med school band.

562
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,074
I won't be able to keep up
in any other club once I finish pre-med.

563
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,118
I'll be better off joining
a club for med students.

564
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,578
I'll also get to befriend our seniors.

565
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,872
I hear the band is difficult to get into.

566
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,749
-Is that so?
-What about you?

567
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,293
The band will probably
take you in just for your looks.

568
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,003
I don't know.

569
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,963
Joining a med school club
might be too much.

570
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,214
I've already decided.

571
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,216
-Where?
-The cheering squad.

572
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,635
The cheering squad?
Aren't they close to closing down?

573
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,553
Not at all.

574
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,903
Shall we eat something before that?

575
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,159
Hae-yi. What happened?
I couldn't get a hold of you.

576
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,912
Who is she? Your girlfriend?

577
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,625
Jae-hyeok. Let's break up.

578
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,753
-What?
-I tried my best to understand,

579
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,506
but it's too small for me.

580
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,343
I mean your capacity.

581
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,555
Apparently, he's small.

582
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,807
And to be honest,

583
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm too much for you to handle,
don't you think?

584
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,111
So you have a small one.

585
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,195
-That's not true.
-Are you small?

586
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,279
I'm not!

587
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,989
-It's really cute.
-Cute like your shirt.

588
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,366
I think it's cute.

589
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,326
Mom, I'll call you back.

590
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,776
We'll take some photos here
before we move on.

591
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,153
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay.

592
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,658
One, two, three.

593
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,250
Are you really going to break up with her?

594
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,379
I'm just going to
call it quits and start anew.

595
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,887
Thanks.

596
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,054
She's just…

597
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,557
too much for me to handle.

598
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,208
That son of a bitch!

599
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,721
That bastard.

600
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,585
Do you have springs in your legs?

601
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,754
Why did you kneel back there?

602
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,216
You know how heartless Ms. Shin is.

603
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,968
I was grasping at straws.

604
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,221
I pity you.

605
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,807
I guess we'll be cleaning up
after the mess they made last year.

606
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,809
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

607
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,061
Since things are looking bad for us,

608
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,188
you should do your best
to get us back on track.

609
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,274
I don't want to be
cleaning this mess up next year.

610
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,900
You're only worried about yourself.

611
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,403
It's your job this year,
but it will be mine the next.

612
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:56,240
Sure. You're being selfish as usual.

613
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,868
And we even have
that prophecy to deal with.

614
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,998
Do we have to hold a rite or something?

615
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,124
Since last year, we…

616
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,430
Yu-min?

617
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,268
You're here.

618
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,249
No!

619
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,351
Who is it?

620
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,942
The blank spaces
deal with the topic, so find what it is.

621
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,859
Do it again.

622
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,945
Ms. Do.

623
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,324
You look prettier today.
It's just me, right?

624
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,828
Listen, I'm in a bad mood today.

625
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,080
If you make another comment
about my appearance,

626
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,374
I'll report you to the police
for sexual harassment.

627
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,835
-He has a crush on you.
-Shut up, you bastard!

628
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,795
Just pipe down and solve the question.

629
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,506
Should we go to a net café?

630
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,134
Don't go to a net café. Just go home.

631
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,517
VIP CUSTOMER

632
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,561
Yes, ma'am.

633
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,896
Ms. Do. How did the class go?

634
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,023
It went very well.

635
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,859
I'm sorry to tell you this,

636
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,153
but this will have to be
Seong-cheol's last month with you.

637
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,279
Pardon?

638
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,448
But his grades have improved.

639
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,951
I really wanted him to take your lessons,

640
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,496
but Gi-tae's mom told me
that Seong-cheol has a crush on you.

641
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,040
It's an important time for the kids.

642
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,750
Come on, ma'am.

643
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,253
He's just curious about that stuff.

644
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,547
I know. I really do,

645
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,467
but I'm afraid I have to do this.

646
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,636
Okay. I guess you'll have to
pull him out then.

647
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,139
I'm so sorry about this.

648
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,640
It's fine.

649
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,143
-Goodbye then.
-Okay. Have a good night.

650
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,312
Bye.

651
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,064
GROUP TUTORING 750,000 WON

652
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,691
INCOME, EXPENDITURE, TOTAL

653
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,526
Damn it!

654
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,579
Damn it.

655
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,080
Hey!

656
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,666
Do your hormones control you guys?

657
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,338
-Hey.
-That hurts!

658
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,964
Your brother isn't a punching bag.

659
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,841
What's gotten into her now?

660
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,136
The doenjang stew smells great.

661
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,390
May I have some too, son?

662
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,228
So why did you have to look so pretty?

663
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,687
You just had to take after me.

664
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,315
I need to work on my grades
starting April,

665
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,942
so I need to earn while I can.

666
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,653
How am I supposed to
fill in the 750,000 won?

667
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,071
Take it easy.

668
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,032
Didn't you make some money with stocks?
You have a backup.

669
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,496
Mom, do you know why
being poor sucks so much?

670
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,583
We don't have a future.
We only have the present.

671
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,794
We need money to plan for our future,

672
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,630
but we can't since we're too busy
living in the present.

673
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,131
That's why it sucks to be poor.

674
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,345
We need a lump sum of money
to break the poverty cycle.

675
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,848
We can't be stuck in this cycle forever.

676
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,476
Keep going.

677
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,354
-What?
-That big talk.

678
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,065
I get excited every time
I hear you talk big.

679
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,859
It hits me that you're a student
at a prestigious university.

680
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,987
It makes me feel great.

681
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,029
Really?

682
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,866
I'll chip in a little this month.

683
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,827
I'll be working part-time
marking exam papers.

684
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,496
Didn't you hear me?

685
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,457
There will be no future for us
if we keep living in the present.

686
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,750
Never mind your part-time job.

687
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,962
Just stick to your studies.
I'll take care of everything.

688
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,922
You feel like the mom sometimes.

689
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,258
-Mom!
-Open up.

690
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,262
Hey, let go of my chopsticks.

691
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,222
BUTLER CHOI
YOU HAVE A NEW MISSION!

692
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,683
I'm off to work.

693
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,560
Have some more.

694
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,395
I'm late. I'm off.

695
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,856
Sure. Keep up the good work!

696
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,274
See you.

697
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,401
Hey.

698
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,571
Your sister won't ignore us
once she makes it big, will she?

699
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,573
I'd understand it if she did.

00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,920
I heard there's a rumor going around

707
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,090
about being outcasted
if they join the cheering squad.

708
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,552
Others might think

709
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,180
that Yeong-woong owns the cheering squad.

710
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,516
Maybe he has too much money
and time on his hands.

711
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,562
What will you do with that?

712
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,149
-The cheering squad?
-Yes.

713
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,735
Isn't that place full of weirdos?

714
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,238
Their leader looks like some dictator.

715
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,573
I'm thinking of dancing the year away.

716
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,535
You should join too.
Enjoy the campus life.

717
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:01,498
I have no time
for such unproductive things.

718
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,711
Well, I know how pragmatic you are.

719
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,588
"Respect the part-timers."
You should be the one in those ads.

720
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,092
You need time to enjoy life

721
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,261
in this wretched capitalist society.

722
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,555
I'm joining a club too.

723
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,932
-A different one though.
-Which one?

724
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,393
YONHEE UNIVERSITY STOCK EXCHANGE CLUB
APPLICATION FORM

725
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,811
NAME, DO HAE-YI

726
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,604
Here you go.

727
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,149
You're done. We'll call you back.

728
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,191
Okay. Thank you.

729
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,569
Thank you very much.

730
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,533
Theia is holding its 51st recruitment.

731
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,701
Come and apply if you're interested.

732
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,119
Thank you.

733
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,456
Are you a freshman?

734
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,259
Hae-yi.

735
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,137
-Hello.
-Hi.

736
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,598
Who's that?

737
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,516
-Who is it?
-Who is that girl?

738
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,393
-Who is she?
-Tell us.

739
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,023
So it's you.

740
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,192
The Pied Piper of Yonhee.

741
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,155
"The Pied Piper of Yonhee"?

742
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,573
I looked into it,

743
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,450
and most kids these days
don't have any backbone.

744
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,036
They join clubs because their friends do.

745
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:26,333
Then who do you think
will bring us the most new members?

746
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,835
It'll be the most popular kid.

747
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,212
And who's that?

748
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,216
I asked which freshman
was the most popular,

749
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,675
and they said it was Jin Seon-ho.

750
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,638
But Seon-ho happens to be
interested in Do Hae-yi.

751
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,056
What does this mean?

752
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,433
If we manage to get Do Hae-yi onboard,

753
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:47,813
we'll have all the freshmen
lining up to join us.

754
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,397
So?

755
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,654
We need to recruit her,
the Pied Piper of Yonhee.

756
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,076
How are there no half-time job listings?

757
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,411
HIRING PART-TIMERS
HIRING EMPLOYEES

758
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,914
They have better food
in the other dining hall.

759
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,085
I know how strange I must seem to you.

760
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,711
You're right, I am.

761
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,799
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

762
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,925
It's fine.

763
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,718
Do you believe in money?

764
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:32,357
So you're offering to pay me
if I join the cheering squad for a month?

765
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,444
You? Why?

766
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,571
Does it matter?

767
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,781
It's fishy. Who are you supposed to be?

768
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,699
Me?

769
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,118
I was one of Theia's 34th recruits.

770
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,787
No way.

771
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,081
Are you still a student here?

772
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,457
Never mind if you're not interested.

773
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,585
Hold on a second.

774
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,838
All I have to do
is join the cheering squad?

775
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,172
Without further conditions?

776
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,010
How much are you willing to pay me?

777
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,012
-800,000 won.
-A million.

778
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,515
I'm sure this isn't a small sum.

779
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,058
I'm highly valued in the workforce.

780
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:11,146
-Never mind if it doesn't work.
-Come on. We can work this out.

781
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,982
-900,000.
-950,000.

782
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,192
930,000.

783
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,945
Don't be so cheap. 950, simple and neat.

784
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,572
Fine. 950,000.

785
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,868
Are you sure about this?

786
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,579
But you need to keep this a secret.

787
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,418
I'll think about it.

788
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,962
Come on.
I took up your offer, simple and neat.

789
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,424
Yes. Where?

790
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,384
Okay. I'll be on my way.

791
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,678
I'll call you back
after I give it some thought.

792
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,065
Could he be a con man?

793
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,864
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

794
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,201
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

795
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,912
-You are my love
-You are my love

796
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,916
-In my heart forever…
-In my heart forever…

797
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,006
The cheering squad?

798
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,551
Don't sneak up on me like that.

799
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,346
Are you thinking of
joining the cheering squad?

800
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,098
Seon-ja sent it to me to watch.

801
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,599
I don't have time for things like this.

802
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,976
You should do it.

803
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,394
You're a great dancer.

804
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,105
Go and tear the roof off the stage.

805
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,690
Where did you learn to talk like that?

806
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,566
It will be great, don't you think?

807
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,027
You'll dance and sing.

808
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,738
You'll party like there's no tomorrow.

809
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,907
Look here. My goodness.

810
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,076
I wish I could join.

811
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,912
-Look.
-This isn't some game.

812
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:54,290
When else will you
ever get to do something like this?

813
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,959
You should do it while you can.

814
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,336
I'd never be able to do it
even if I wanted to.

815
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,549
Look at me now.

816
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,022
CHEERING SQUAD UNDER FIRE,
"IS ABOLISHING THE ANSWER?"

817
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,023
CHEERING SQUAD ACCUSED
OF RUINING THE FESTIVAL

818
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,608
I see it now.

819
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,445
They don't have any applicants,
so they're paying people to join.

820
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,572
I don't need to trust those people.
I'll trust their money instead.

821
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,823
Money never lies.

822
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,784
I'm Park Jeong-woo.

823
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,956
But that annoying prick is the leader.

824
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,793
I've found you! My goodness.

825
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,340
Why haven't you called me back?

826
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,177
So?

827
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,721
Did you think about it?

828
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,891
-Well…
-Fine. I'll make it a million.

829
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,768
A million won for one month.

830
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,688
2019 MEMBER APPLICATION FORM
NAME: DO HAE-YI

831
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,325
Will you be okay
with a crazy man like myself?

832
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,911
I'll be fine. I'm a crazy woman myself.

833
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,332
I look forward to our time together.

834
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:30,220
I guess Do Hae-yi
is joining the cheering squad.

835
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,265
Theia is recruiting new members.

836
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,850
Hey there, everyone.

837
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,269
Excuse me. Theia is recruiting right now.

838
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,604
Can you…

839
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:42,982
There's the pen.

840
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,947
NAME, JIN SEON-HO

841
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:51,950
Is this all?

842
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,451
Yes. We'll let you know.

843
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,833
Theia is recruiting new members.

844
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,209
REASON FOR APPLYING
DO HAE-YI

845
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,920
Excuse me.
Theia is recruiting new members.

846
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,421
We…

847
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,927
Are you joining the cheering squad?

848
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,180
They're done for.

849
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,224
Why don't you join
the honor guards instead?

850
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,350
I'll treat you well.

851
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,188
There are nasty rumors
going around about the cheering squad.

852
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,943
What kind of rumors?

853
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,781
You see, they're cursed
with three prophecies.

854
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,623
CHEERING SQUAD AUDITIONS

855
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,501
Hello. I'm freshman Joo Seon-ja.
I'm a clothing and textiles major.

856
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,920
JOO SEON-JA
CLOTHING AND TEXTILES MAJOR

857
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,970
Okay. Thank you.

858
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,141
I'm not done yet.

859
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,438
Hello.

860
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,940
I'm a freshman
pre-med student, Im Yong-il.

861
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,901
Your specialty is

862
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,110
studying?

863
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,820
-That's right.
-Nothing else?

864
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,280
I can do a handstand.

865
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,620
I'll perform
the national physical exercise.

866
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,012
Everyone in Hokyung,

867
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,722
scream!

868
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,934
I'll do my best to perform
at the Hokyung-Yonhee sports competition.

869
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,811
You put their name in front.
You should be at Hokyung.

870
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,938
Why are you even here?

871
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,689
Because my mom told me to.

872
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,774
Are you a returning student?

873
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,486
No. I'm a freshman.

874
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,661
Does that mean I've made it?

875
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:04,958
Hello.

876
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,418
I'm Kim Min-jae, a freshman
and a mechanical engineering major.

877
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:11,839
It says here you wanted to join
the cheering squad since high school.

878
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,550
-Yes.
-Come on.

879
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,593
You didn't re-sit the entrance exam
just to join us, did you?

880
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,470
-I did.
-What?

881
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,975
I see.

882
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,146
I'm Jin Seon-ho. A freshman in pre-med.

883
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,649
The reason for your application is

884
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,150
"Do Hae-yi"?

885
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,987
Did you apply because Do Hae-yi did?

886
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,364
-Yes.
-What if we don't take her in?

887
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,199
I'll be sad.

888
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,329
We practice a lot
and you won't have much personal time.

889
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,039
Curiosity alone won't be
enough to help you last.

890
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,208
I think my persistence
will outlast my motivation.

891
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,669
I'm confident I'll do well.

892
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,505
I'm healthy and more agile than I seem.

893
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,799
Can you show us?

894
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,498
-Right.
-I see.

895
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,464
DO HAE-YI
THEOLOGY MAJOR

896
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,594
Hello.

897
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,597
I'm a freshman majoring in theology.
My name is Do Hae-yi.

898
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,600
Why do you want to join
the cheering squad?

899
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:49,562
I applied because I thought it'd be
a valuable experience to have in college.

900
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,858
How is your stamina?

901
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,569
Our training can be quite strenuous.

902
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,721
I'm above average
when it comes to stamina.

903
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,728
I can see that.

904
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,063
Thank you.

905
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,775
We auditioned them as a formality,

906
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,652
but there were only twelve applicants.

907
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,737
We'll have to let them all in.

908
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,782
None of them
would've made it back in my days.

909
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,787
Even with 20 new members,
over half of them end up quitting.

910
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,081
Looks like we'll have to do
our best to keep them around.

911
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,333
This doesn't look good.

912
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:55,336
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE

913
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,588
The nerve cell's body

914
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:01,426
is made up of the nucleus
and the perikaryon.

915
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,760
Let's look at the nucleus.

916
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,137
CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING
A THEIA MEMBER

917
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,599
What is it?

918
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,517
It's nothing, sir.

919
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,145
We'll carry on.

920
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:23,239
Congratulations on becoming
a Theia member.

921
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,553
YONHEE UNIVERSITY
CHEERING SQUAD

922
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,471
Kim Min-jae.

923
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,725
Yeom Mi-jeong.

924
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,479
Kim Jeong-mi.

925
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,065
Jang Jun-yeong.

926
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,109
-Just call me Hyeok, please.
-All right, Hyeok.

927
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,487
-Kang Hyeok-jun.
-Thank you.

928
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,740
Put on the jacket if you've received one.

929
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,535
-Kang Ju-eun.
-Here.

930
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:11,913
Thank you. I'll do my best.

931
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,873
-Im Yong-il.
-Here.

932
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,210
Joo Seon-ja.

933
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,588
Do Hae-yi.

934
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,299
Jin Seon-ho.

935
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,762
Choi U-seon.

936
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,902
Theia's 51st recruits.
I'm the leader, Park Jeong-woo.

937
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,574
I'm sure you all had different reasons
for joining the cheering squad.

938
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,786
Some for a memorable experience
for your college years.

939
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,996
Some just to be on stage.

940
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,540
Some simply out of curiosity.

941
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,752
There's no telling whether we'll
live up to your expectations or not.

942
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,088
But there's one thing we can promise you.

943
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,506
After your time with us is over,

944
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,343
you will feel that your time with us
has been worthwhile.

945
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,306
I hope that you'll be able to
experience that moment with us.

946
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:16,936
Congratulations on making it
as Theia's 51st recruits.

947
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,783
The third prophecy…

948
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,288
is that one of the cheering squad members…

949
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,629
I heard a rumor that a member
will end up dying this year.

950
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,630
Is this true?

951
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,965
…will end up dying.

952
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,140
DEATH

01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:35,139
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

954
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,690
SPECIAL THANKS TO YOON BYUNG-HEE
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

955
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,863
CHEERING SQUAD AUDITIONS

956
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,915
Aren't you worried? One of us might die.

957
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,751
Could Seon-ho have brought it up
knowing what happened before?

958
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:04,752
That anonymous accident…

959
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,922
We'll choose two new members
to join us on stage this year.

960
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,841
I'll pay you an extra 10%
if you go on stage.

961
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,760
-We are…
-We are…

962
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,220
-Theia.
-Theia.

963
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,514
At this rate, I'll end up dying
before I enjoy anything.

964
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,849
Do Hae-yi looks like a major nutcase.

965
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,601
Why did you join the cheering squad?

966
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,020
Are you perhaps asking me to quit?

967
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,272
You should quit
if your priorities lie elsewhere…

968
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,273
so we don't waste each other's time.

969
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,317
I'm going to quit no matter the money.

970
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,407
DO HAE-YI

971
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,161
"Do Hae-yi"?

972
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,540
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

973
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,126
I need to find someone
from a similar background.

974
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,463
I guess couples are common in med school.

975
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,425
But why does Do Hae-yi work so much?

976
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,551
Is she that poor?

977
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:55,761
She's just…

978
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,305
too much for me to handle.

979
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,227
I'm sorry. You can go now.

980
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,916
So she's a student here.

981
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:33,632
DO HAE-YI

982
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:38,721
