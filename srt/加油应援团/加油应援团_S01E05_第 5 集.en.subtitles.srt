00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,824
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,326
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,852
Are you all right?

4
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,699
What happened?

5
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,242
What was that?

6
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,752
I'll give you a call.

7
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,843
Why did an accident like this
have to happen?

8
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,345
Was it really

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,764
an accident?

10
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,477
That incident in the storage…

11
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,146
Was that an accident too?

12
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,898
I'm trapped in here!

13
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,358
Stop messing with me!

14
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,443
Let me out!

15
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,617
Are you sure it was an accident?

16
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,653
The fixture was broken.

17
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,408
It was fine when I checked in the morning.

18
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,701
Maybe it was too rusty.

19
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,953
This isn't something
that can drop so easily.

20
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,830
Could it be possible

21
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,000
that someone did this intentionally?

22
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,918
Come on.

23
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,920
Who would do such a thing?

24
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,591
What are you thinking?

25
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,727
Everyone in Hokyung,

26
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,437
scream!

27
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,400
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

28
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,739
-Fold your finger if you're a man.
-Jeez.

29
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,158
-Hey!
-That includes you.

30
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm not a man.

31
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,578
Come on, Woon-chan.

32
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,164
You can't give up on being a man

33
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,291
just to avoid drinking.

34
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,250
Hey.

35
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,006
-Drink up.
-Drink up.

36
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,009
-Drink up.
-I'll drink in your place.

37
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,604
Gosh, that's bitter. But it's still good.

38
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,440
You seem to be doing great
for someone who almost died.

39
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,526
I'm just drinking my worries away.

40
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,320
There.

41
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,660
It was an accident.

42
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,663
You heard what the technician said.

43
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,333
Let it go and drink up.

44
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,760
You drink quite well, don't you?

45
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,595
You look so cute!

46
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,069
So-yoon. Mom says to answer the phone.

47
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,989
Mother? Your mom?

48
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,284
She's making all this fuss
for one missed call.

49
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,244
I swear, she can be so overprotective.

50
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,456
Who are you?
And why do you share a mom with So-yoon?

51
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,292
I'm So-yoon's older sister.

52
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,087
Really?

53
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,046
Ji-yoon.

54
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,341
Twins?

55
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,222
-Okay.
-Drink up.

56
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,599
-Come on.
-You two look exactly alike.

57
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,150
What are you doing here?

58
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,110
Hey, look who it is.

59
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,486
It's my fellow freshman.

60
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,447
You must've had a lot to drink.

61
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,282
That's right.

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,455
Look who it is. It's our leader.

63
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,582
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

64
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,916
You should take it easy.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,835
You came close to an accident.
You should be careful.

66
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,382
Here.

67
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,638
I picked up the kindness
you were spilling everywhere.

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,185
No!

69
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,693
He's angry.

70
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,321
Goodbye, then. Theia!

71
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,157
She's nuts.

72
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,035
-I like her though.
-I like you too.

73
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,415
Where are you going?

74
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,917
To take a dump!

75
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,483
I'm back.

76
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,610
Welcome back.

77
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,199
Add that to our contract.

78
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,160
I will if you actually make it.

79
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,918
Guys.

80
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's drink up!

81
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,507
Pour yourselves a glass.

82
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,759
Wait!

83
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,761
That's not how you do it.

84
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,513
Let me show you how.

85
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,806
This is how you open it.

86
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,434
Just watch.
You guys must have had a lot to drink.

87
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,810
TEMPORARY LABOR AGREEMENT

88
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,938
You see, before you drink this,
you need to know the history…

89
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,114
You're all having a great time,
aren't you?

90
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,371
Aren't you going to say hello
to your seniors?

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,415
What happened to their discipline?

92
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,583
Right, the freshman.

93
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,835
You almost got injured today.
Are you okay?

94
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,253
-Me?
-You seem drunk.

95
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,088
You better be careful.

96
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,467
We have that prophecy to worry about.
You better take care of yourselves.

97
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,969
Someone almost died
two years ago from an accident.

98
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,642
It happened to Yu-min,
who you were obsessed with.

99
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,602
Don't you remember?

100
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,353
It was just like today.

101
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,397
Why do things like this keep happening?

102
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,191
What if something serious happens?

103
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,318
Take your drunken ranting elsewhere.

104
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,904
Don't tell me you were behind it all then.

105
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,698
Maybe you were getting back at her
for rejecting you.

106
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,576
What? Are you going to hit me?

107
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,620
Just go.
I don't want to cause a commotion.

108
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,206
-Why should I? You should be--
-I hear barking.

109
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,874
Wait, it's a real dog.

110
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,168
-Get out, you guys.
-Let go of me.

111
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,045
-This dog is quite strong.
-Let go.

112
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,338
This way.

113
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,589
Sir.

114
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,675
-Let me just talk to him.
-Come on.

115
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,552
Come over here. Damn it.

116
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,766
Bye.

117
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,814
Okay. Cheers, everyone.

118
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,651
All bars have a couple of drunkards, no?

119
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,528
Come on. Cheers!

120
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,072
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

121
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,114
I've wanted to ask.

122
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,492
Who's Yu-min?

123
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,786
Yu-min.

124
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,038
Jeong-woo's first…

125
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,209
and last love.

126
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,419
At least until now.

127
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,799
He's quite persistent.

128
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,012
He rarely changes his tune
once he gets into something.

129
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,639
He goes at it until someone gets hurt.

130
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,857
Are you all right?

131
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,111
-We should take care of her.
-She's so drunk.

132
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,863
-Can you call a cab for me?
-I'm off, everyone!

133
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,535
Come on, call a cab for me.

134
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,958
I might be able to help you
later down the line.

135
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,961
They say to know yourself and your enemy.

136
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,630
Right.

137
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,347
My cab is here.

138
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,566
That's our dad's number.

139
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,483
What?

140
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,204
Hello, sir!

141
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,206
Theia!

142
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,501
I'll be going home, then.

143
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,003
See you.

144
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,630
-You'll be fine, right?
-Of course.

145
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,257
Bye.

146
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,345
I'm home.

147
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
No, you're not.

148
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,101
What? No, this is my home.

149
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,186
This isn't your home.

150
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,604
It is.

151
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,358
Mom, my legs are killing me.

152
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,652
And my arms too. My entire body aches.

153
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,736
Seon-ja.

154
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,572
Yes! Theia's Joo Seon-ja reporting!

155
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,823
Did you ask for me?

156
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,325
Gosh, let go.

157
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,372
I'll text you Hae-yi's address,
so make sure she gets home safely.

158
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,832
Love your peers, love your country. Right?

159
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,335
I'll do it. She's in bad shape,
so it won't be easy.

160
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,544
Gosh.

161
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,129
I'll take her home.

162
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,298
"Love your peers, love your country."

163
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,218
Let's go together then.

164
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,095
Sure.

165
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,016
They're mine.

166
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,352
Sure, they're all yours.
We aren't taking them.

167
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,396
They're mine!

168
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,023
She's a handful when she's drunk.

169
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,400
I could've taken her home by myself.

170
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,568
I'm responsible for the whole team anyway.

171
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,153
Of course. You feel responsible.

172
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,376
Just relax and get some sleep.

173
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,219
"Love your peers, love your country."

174
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,015
-Hey.
-Yonhee!

175
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,225
-What's she doing?
-Hey.

176
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,893
Everybody, stand up!

177
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
Get a hold of yourself.

178
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,481
-Hold it.
-I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,400
Hey, Hae-yi.

180
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,031
My shoe!

181
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,366
Are you students at Yonhee?

182
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,118
Yes.

183
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,328
Yes!

184
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,165
I'm a Yonhee University student!

185
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,292
Keep quiet, will you?

186
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,433
Hey, get out.

187
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,518
Careful.

188
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,644
Get out, Hae-yi.

189
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,562
Hey!

190
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,608
Hae-yi, what's wrong with you?

191
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,525
-Wake up.
-Goodness.

192
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,569
-Mom?
-Get a hold of yourself, you brat.

193
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,487
Goodness' sake.

194
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,530
-Hey.
-Goodness.

195
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,324
Gosh. How much have you had to drink?

196
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,159
Grab her for me, Jae-yi.

197
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,619
That brat.

198
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,037
Goodness.

199
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,457
I'm sorry she drank so much.
We should have looked after her.

200
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,750
Save your apology.

201
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,920
It's not like
I don't know my own daughter.

202
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,839
She's to blame for everything, not you.

203
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,299
I'm terribly sorry.

204
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,135
-No, I am.
-I'm so sorry and thank you.

205
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,390
You look strangely familiar.

206
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,768
-Who are you?
-Just think of me as your son-in-law.

207
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,685
What?

208
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,313
I doubt you'll be able to handle her.

209
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,815
I'm Park Jeong-woo, the leader of Theia.

210
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,443
"Theia"? What's that?

211
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,905
-Come on, Hae-yi.
-Hey.

212
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,866
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

213
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,743
Let me invite you over next time.

214
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,246
-Get home safely.
-Thank you. Take care.

215
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,914
Hey.

216
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,416
Snap out of it.

217
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,459
Take care!

218
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,629
Thank you for everything today.
Come over again.

219
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,465
Turn around and head inside.

220
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,383
Watch out for the stairs.

221
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,926
-The door.
-Goodness!

222
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,969
Keep going.

223
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,387
Goodbye!

224
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,472
See you!

225
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,058
Wow, so they're really poor.

226
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,311
She mentioned before that she was poor,

227
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,022
but I didn't think she meant it.

228
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,649
I don't think you should…

229
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,984
I'm not badmouthing her.

230
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,069
It's not like I'm wrong.

231
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,657
She'll have a nasty hangover tomorrow.

232
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,678
I'm not human
if I drink like that ever again.

233
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,681
Go ahead. It's too late for you.

234
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,731
Gosh, please.

235
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,190
HANGOVER DRINK

236
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,735
What? Where's mine?

237
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,695
You were here too?

238
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,367
You must be really healthy.

239
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
Thank you.

240
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,331
-Hello.
-Hello.

241
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,338
Someone almost died
two years ago from an accident.

242
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:35,100
LIGHTS

243
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,606
2 YEARS AGO

244
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,025
Gather around so we can set up the lights.

245
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,151
-Okay.
-Okay.

246
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,614
TAE CHO-HUI

247
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,296
LEE YU-MIN

248
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,965
Park Jeong-woo.

249
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,928
-Park Jeong-woo?
-Yes, ma'am.

250
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,389
Yes, I'm Park Jeong-woo.

251
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,434
Right. I know that.

252
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,811
You're partners with Do Hae-yi.

253
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,193
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA OF AN IDEAL MARRIAGE?

254
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,740
"What is the kind of spouse
you want to avoid the most?"

255
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,793
"What do you think
is the most important in family life?"

256
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,711
Money.

257
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,298
What about you?

258
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,011
Love.

259
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,141
What?

260
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,685
Love is really important.

261
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,481
You're quite the romantic, aren't you?

262
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,608
And you're just as
materialistic as expected.

263
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,905
"What is the kind of spouse
you want to avoid the most?"

264
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,282
One that only cares about money.

265
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,576
One that keeps going on about love.

266
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,079
"What is your ideal spouse?"

267
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,372
One that knows how valuable love is.

268
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,957
One that knows how valuable money is.

269
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,502
I guess there's no way
we're getting married.

270
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,422
Of course not.

271
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,970
She has no idea how important love is.

272
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,389
He's living in a fantasy land.

273
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,475
It's because you've never been in love.

274
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,518
How can you be in love when you're broke?

275
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,644
You can't afford to go on dates.

276
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,773
Then that isn't love.

277
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,275
You can be in love even when you're broke.

278
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,071
You can't eat when you don't have money.

279
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,993
I said, "What is your ideal spouse?"

280
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,204
Someone who loves money.

281
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,006
FREE SAMPLES

282
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,562
I was thinking of
having these ordered daily.

283
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,942
See? These aren't that sour
and go down smoothly.

284
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,235
Do you happen to be constipated?

285
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,070
These are great for constipation.

286
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,947
You've seen the ads, right?

287
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,532
The application form, please.

288
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,203
I love how you get
right down to the point.

289
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,626
You need to give us your address
and your signature here.

290
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,379
We'll also need your bank account details.

291
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,005
About the whiskey that day…

292
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,383
I'm sorry?

293
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,678
What did you do with the bottle
I gave you in the elevator?

294
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,096
Oh, the one you threw out?

295
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,139
I wasn't throwing it out.

296
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,933
Ma'am.

297
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,435
I just wanted you to hold onto it.

298
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,979
You did? All of a sudden?

299
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,606
Well, you come here all the time.

300
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,858
Speaking of which,

301
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,069
I would like to have it back.

302
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,821
Sure. You can have it back.

303
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,823
I'll put it in the bag
with the delivery tomorrow.

304
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,741
No, you can't… ma'am.

305
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,871
I'd like to receive it in person.

306
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,331
Sure. I can do that.

307
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,834
Thank you.

308
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,006
So when does she want it back?

309
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,843
Does she expect me
to lug it around with me every day?

310
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,182
Are you feeling all right?

311
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,058
You're not sick, are you?

312
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,393
I'm fine. Why do you ask?

313
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,562
You were in that accident yesterday.

314
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,606
And my mom went to see a fortune teller

315
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,067
who told her that there would be
a huge accident around me.

316
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,445
My mom asked if everything was fine.

317
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,573
She's so worried
that she'll send me a talisman.

318
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,491
Why would anyone pay for such a thing?

319
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,081
Why don't you tell her
that you'll buy one yourself?

320
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,250
If you pay me 5,000 won,
I'll draw you one myself.

321
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,293
I'm good at it.

322
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,170
-It's fine.
-She really is good.

323
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,797
That's right.
It will look like the real thing.

324
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,882
I'm fine.

325
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,842
What's this?

326
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,470
RSVP for the squad retreat.

327
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,430
Please let us know by today.

328
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,640
APRIL 13, FRESHMEN RETREAT RSVP

329
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,600
Should we go to the retreat?

330
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,310
I have work, so…

331
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,686
How about quitting the squad?

332
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,067
Isn't it tough with work and everything?
There was that accident too.

333
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,904
Why would you bother her
when she's doing just fine?

334
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,156
Don't. We'll do it together.

335
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,533
Weren't you going to do it
for only about a month anyway?

336
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,412
I thought that was why you told me
we'd talk again in a month.

337
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,248
Talk about what?

338
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,250
Well, what happened was…

339
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,210
Hold on.

340
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,045
EMPLOYER

341
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,673
I should get going.

342
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,882
-All of a sudden?
-Where?

343
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,425
Something came up.

344
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,469
-What?
-I'm off.

345
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,514
See you later. Bye.

346
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,598
Bye.

347
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,726
Sleepyhead--

348
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,172
Cho-hui!

349
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,720
We need to talk.

350
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,890
-I've got nothing to say to you.
-Well, I do.

351
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,352
Excuse me for a second. You go ahead.

352
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,654
Let go of me.

353
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,823
Hey, it's our seniors.

354
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,456
Where are you going?

355
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,374
She seems to be in trouble.

356
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,626
Isn't that punk harassing Cho-hui?

357
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,212
That's her ex-boyfriend.

358
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,048
You shouldn't involve yourself
in their business.

359
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,508
-What?
-Just come and watch with us.

360
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,101
TEMPORARY LABOR AGREEMENT

361
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,521
I can just quit now?

362
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,149
But I still have some time left.

363
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,401
The joint cheer is over

364
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,653
and I doubt you'll stay
until the festival.

365
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,697
So I don't see why you should keep going,

366
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,450
though I never did get
the result I wanted.

367
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,869
I'll pay you as promised.

368
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,246
Well,

369
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,625
one of the lessons I've learned in life

370
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,336
is that nothing in life
ever comes for free.

371
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,631
What if you change your mind later?

372
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,299
Let's just follow the contract.

373
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,427
What is it?

374
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,347
It's nothing. Sure, you do that then.

375
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,895
By the way,
where do you get all the money from?

376
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,188
Did you inherit it?

377
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,440
The only thing I ever inherited

378
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,234
was the food they fed me.

379
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,695
You must have made it on your own.

380
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,447
How?

381
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,283
Investment? Business? What did you do?

382
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,284
For free?

383
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,495
It's the rich who are stingier.

384
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,792
I'm sure your family had some money
for you to succeed on your own.

385
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,670
Let's bet on whose life
is more unfortunate.

386
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,760
Have any items in your house
been seized from debt?

387
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,345
You need to have money to owe money.

388
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,222
We don't have anything worth seizing.

389
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,808
After the seizure,

390
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,477
my father was diagnosed
with stomach cancer.

391
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,273
-Is your father all right?
-Thankfully, yes.

392
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,859
I don't have a dad.

393
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,906
I took a break from school for two years
so that I could work

394
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,116
to pay for my father's treatment.

395
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,659
My mom…

396
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,084
Damn it.

397
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,684
And yet you still joined
the cheering squad?

398
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,897
Because I had a crush on someone.

399
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,650
Gosh, what a romantic you are.

400
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,905
But it was the cheering squad
that kept me going.

401
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,462
APRIL 13, FRESHMEN RETREAT RSVP

402
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,430
But it was the cheering squad
that kept me going.

403
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,101
ATTEND
CANNOT ATTEND

404
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,688
ATTEND

405
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,409
LET'S GO ON A RETREAT!

406
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,496
And at eight o'clock,
we'll be holding the drinking party

407
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,831
that you've all been waiting for!

408
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,585
I have the snacks!

409
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,838
-Oh, this is my seat.
-Yes!

410
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,842
These look delicious.

411
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,135
You'll get diabetes from all that.

412
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,305
We'll party all night, so we need to
charge ourselves up on sugar.

413
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,516
-All night?
-Here. Have these.

414
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,601
You too.

415
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,395
-When's Hae-yi coming?
-Hae-yi?

416
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,814
She'll be coming over with Jeong-woo
after her work shift.

417
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,815
With Jeong-woo?

418
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,073
Is that something to be so startled about?

419
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,287
Can I have one too?

420
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,749
Thanks.

421
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,963
-Let's go.
-Is this the right way?

422
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,010
These look delicious.

423
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,555
WILL YOU DRINK WITH US?
DANCE WITH US? PARTY WITH US?

424
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,682
Surprise!

425
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,187
Listen up, freshmen!

426
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,065
Everything is on us,

427
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,568
so just enjoy yourselves!

428
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,378
-Let's go, everybody!
-Let's go!

429
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,634
How did they know?

430
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,888
-You told them, didn't you?
-I didn't.

431
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,438
What's the deputy director
of student affairs doing here?

432
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,356
I know.

433
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,201
TO DO HAE-YI:
WHEN ARE YOU COMING?

434
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,101
It's so cold.

435
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,229
She's unbelievable.

436
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,562
What's wrong with me?

437
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,481
Is something wrong with my heart?

438
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,369
We have snacks and drinks.

439
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,544
What are you doing with your jacket?

440
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,172
Well, I…

441
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,175
It's hot.

442
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,636
What do you want? Eggs?

443
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,930
You go ahead. Gosh, it's hot.

444
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,564
Why did you have to leave late?

445
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,193
Can't you finish eating first?
That's disgusting.

446
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,163
I said, why did you have to leave late?

447
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,498
Because I had business.

448
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,999
What business?

449
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,252
CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION GUIDE BOOK

450
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,796
You're preparing for
the civil service exam?

451
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,133
Are you ditching astronomy then?

452
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,180
I'll admit it. You really are smart.

453
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,973
Outer space is too far away.

454
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,433
Becoming a civil servant
is way more realistic.

455
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,897
But isn't it really hard to pass?

456
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,982
How can you find time
for the cheering squad?

457
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,111
I know, right?

458
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,988
How many years does it usually take?

459
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,366
Do some people make it in just a year?

460
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,076
Why?

461
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,786
Are you interested?

462
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,331
No. I can never study for an exam.

463
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,999
It's too costly.

464
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,168
And there's no knowing if you'll pass.

465
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,004
How would I deal with the costs?

466
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,468
I'll join an investment company,
make lots of money,

467
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,804
and make a billion won
by the time I hit 30.

468
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,097
That's my goal.

469
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,723
Sure.

470
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,060
Good on you for having a solid goal.

471
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,521
Don't you have a goal as well?

472
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,357
Finding love.

473
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,025
Just forget about it.

474
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,950
You need to have a goal
to keep yourself going.

475
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,704
There's no time for us
to get lost on our way.

476
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,543
Well, you really do have a goal.

477
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,919
Becoming a civil servant.

478
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,772
Is it going to rain?

479
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,234
Huh? The sky looks clear.

480
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,530
Are you a fortune teller?

481
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,785
The clouds are moving fast,
so it's hard to see the Summer Triangle.

482
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,455
The Summer Triangle?

483
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,166
Like a big triangle?

484
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,794
The three constellations
that are most noticeable in the summer.

485
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,423
That's Vega,

486
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,176
Deneb,

487
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,845
and Altair.

488
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,430
Altari?

489
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,767
So that's what it is.

490
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,030
Altair.

491
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:30,949
Right there.

492
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,213
What? Was I showing off again?

493
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,382
No, I…

494
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,055
WE WON'T LEAVE YOU ANY
IF YOU DON'T ARRIVE IN 5 MINUTES

495
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,932
There's no time for this.

496
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,475
They'll eat everything. Run!

497
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,235
I'm bleeding.

498
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,070
Are you all right?

499
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,156
You shouldn't have run.

500
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,742
Let me see. I'll treat it for you.

501
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,453
-Don't touch it.
-It hurts!

502
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,872
That's why I said not to touch it.

503
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,880
Let me see.

504
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,258
Come on.

505
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,428
Let me. We need to do this.

506
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,640
It stings!

507
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,476
Hold still. We need to do this.

508
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,896
It stings!

509
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,107
Jeez.

510
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,530
Why do you carry
something like that around?

511
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,782
Because there's always at least one person

512
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,576
who falls after drinking.

513
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,204
But I've never seen
someone sober fall before.

514
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,212
Be careful.

515
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,714
I'm afraid you might get seriously hurt.

516
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,843
There you go being flirty again.

517
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,442
Hae-yi.

518
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,171
Let's go.

519
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,134
It's cold!

520
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,351
Thanks to you I won't get so wet.

521
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,853
It's a little small for three to share.

522
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,064
I don't think
it's big enough for two either.

523
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,774
Your brother is studying
for med school, right?

524
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:10,900
Yes.

525
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,360
Tell him to ask me anything.

526
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,278
Really?

527
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,404
Nice.

528
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,864
So you have a brother.

529
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,866
Do you have any siblings?

530
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,409
I'm an only child.

531
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,787
I see. You seem like it.

532
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,665
That didn't sound like a compliment.

533
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,043
Didn't you ever want siblings?

534
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,295
You would have loved it
if you had a sister like me.

535
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,880
It would have been bothersome.

536
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,174
You would have been ecstatic
since she's so adorable.

537
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,384
How can you say that about yourself?

538
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,593
Why wouldn't I?

539
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,595
-But it's not true.
-It is.

540
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,351
I'll see you inside.

541
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,436
But it's raining--

542
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,938
What's gotten into him?

543
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,566
Let's go.

544
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,529
-Stop hogging it.
-I'm not!

545
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,197
You only care about yourself.

546
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,574
What are you talking about?

547
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:00,950
Jeez.

548
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,252
He's an old man now.

549
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,550
Hey!

550
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,720
I was flapping my arms about
and they said, "Hey, that's an eagle."

551
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,097
-Right.
-That's how I got the nickname "Eagle."

552
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,225
Hey, Yong-il.

553
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,019
I'll just elbow you…

554
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,898
-Hi.
-You're here.

555
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,233
-Hey.
-Welcome.

556
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,318
Dig in.

557
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,322
-Here.
-It's fine.

558
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,621
-Hey.
-Hello.

559
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,081
-Hello.
-Hello.

560
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,875
Welcome.

561
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,171
Have this.

562
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,797
I asked him to come.

563
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,550
You two seemed to have a misunderstanding,
so I wanted you guys to resolve that.

564
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,185
To keep the night going,

565
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,145
next up, we have…

566
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,399
How about you take the stage, freshman?

567
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,154
-Let's go!
-Show us what you've got!

568
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,865
-I…
-What?

569
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,370
We'll do it.

570
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,664
Hey, let's go.

571
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,957
Yong-il. You too.

572
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,166
What?

573
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,793
Great! A round of applause!

574
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,661
-One, two, three, four!
-One, two, three, four!

575
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,178
JUNG EUN-A: WHAT'S UP, SEON-HO?
GO-EUN: LET'S HANG OUT THIS WEEKEND

576
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,888
CHOI JI-YEONG: WHAT'S UP? LET'S HANG OUT!
YOO HYE-RIM: WANT TO GO SEE THE MOVIE?

577
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,598
SEO EUN-JIN: WANNA COME TO MY B-DAY PARTY?
LEE U-JU: I'M HUNGRY AND BORED

578
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,147
-What about tomorrow?
-Yes!

579
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,607
It will be fine.

580
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,610
-Drink up.
-Cheers!

581
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,489
Sleepyhead--

582
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,908
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY SURVEY

583
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:35,122
WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL SPOUSE?
SOMEONE WHO IS KIND AND IS A LEADER

584
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,721
You still drink
until you throw up, don't you?

585
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,475
You drink so you can get drunk.

586
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,477
You don't even know anything.

587
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,437
-Fine.
-Over here.

588
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,689
If you have any complaints
against your seniors,

589
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,316
feel free to air them out tonight.

590
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,444
We'll take care of them for you.

591
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,948
Who's going to tell you anything
in front of everyone?

592
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,449
You should make it anonymous.

593
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,118
Is that right?

594
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,878
There's a freshman
who is receiving special treatment.

595
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,172
Who…

596
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,676
Do Hae-yi.

597
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,518
Who's Do Hae-yi?

598
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,563
It's me.

599
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,314
What kind of special treatment?

600
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,401
Even though
she lied to get out of training

601
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,446
and trespassed into Hokyung University,

602
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,948
she was made a freshman rep
and we rescheduled training for her.

603
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,741
Isn't that special treatment?

604
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,078
The leaders shouldn't have done that.

605
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,413
They were wrong to do that.

606
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,498
Your seniors were wrong.

607
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,333
They should be careful
with things like that.

608
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,418
They should.

609
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,752
-Quiet, will you?
-Okay then.

610
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,256
We should make sure
this doesn't happen again.

611
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,591
Drink up.

612
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,801
-We're all here, right?
-Yes.

613
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,887
You guys better drink up this time.

614
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,514
Jeong-woo. Aren't they
from the broadcasting club?

615
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,350
Look who it is.

616
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,935
I didn't expect to run into
the cheering squad here.

617
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,520
What are you doing here?

618
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,939
We came on a retreat too.

619
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,860
Have fun.

620
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,157
Where did Ho-min go?

621
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,911
He's the one who wanted to go
where the cheering squad went.

622
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,622
-I haven't seen him in a while.
-Jeez.

623
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,965
-I'll go grab some more marshmallows.
-Sure.

624
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,220
Jeong-woo.

625
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,597
About earlier…

626
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,600
We'll talk later.

627
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
Jeong-woo.

628
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,196
Well…

629
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,449
Sorry for acting out of line last time.

630
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,160
But you were too, to be honest.

631
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,870
So let's not fight anymore.

632
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,956
Accidents keep happening,

633
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,667
so it would be better
that we don't cause any more trouble.

634
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,418
That'd be best for the squad, right?

635
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,212
Were there any accidents

636
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,881
other than the light falling?

637
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,135
No. I just meant
how things kept happening around us.

638
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,276
What are you--

639
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,077
What do you think of her?
Do you think she's normal?

640
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,164
Yes. At least more than you.

641
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,959
Exactly!

642
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:11,589
So why would she date a bastard like him
when there's nothing wrong with her?

643
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,257
Who is that "bastard"?

644
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,883
My damn ex-husband.

645
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,305
Damn it.

646
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,723
Oh, shit!

647
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,767
Wait. No!

648
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,227
I'm screwed.

649
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,607
He must have seen it, right?

650
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,401
He must know that I'm spying
on his account now.

651
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,654
Why the hell is this happening to me?

652
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,080
Do you think they'd know

653
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,334
that life is just
a continuous pile of shit?

654
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,501
They wouldn't, right?

655
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:55,174
They must believe that life
will get better and better, right?

656
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,717
Should I spoil it for them

657
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,720
and tell them
that it'll only get shittier and shittier?

658
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,225
I think they'll know
even if you don't tell them.

659
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,687
I should have found someone first!

660
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,163
You can find someone great too.

661
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:30,167
There won't be anyone left
by the time it's my turn.

662
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,629
I'm sure there will be

663
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,882
because you're a great person too.

664
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,057
Thanks, friend.

665
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,352
I thought you were pathetic,

666
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,980
but I guess you do have an eye for people.

667
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,408
Do you want to kiss?

668
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,743
-All of a sudden?
-Yes.

669
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,787
I suddenly feel like it.

670
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,080
Do you want to or not?

671
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,958
Well, I…

672
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,794
I think I want to…

673
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,146
-Is something there?
-No.

674
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,482
It's nothing. Nothing at all.

675
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,907
There must be
an empty room somewhere, right?

676
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:44,950
Come with me.

677
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:50,372
-Here we go
-Here we go

678
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,041
-Let's start the game
-Let's start the game

679
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,627
-Let's introduce ourselves
-Let's introduce ourselves

680
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,837
Up next is Wall

681
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,172
-Up next is Wall
-Up next is Wall

682
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,423
Up next is Cutie Pie

683
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,716
-Up next is Cutie Pie
-Up next is Cutie Pie

684
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,050
Up next is Theia

685
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,427
-Up next is Theia
-Up next is Theia

686
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,636
Up next is Cupid

687
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,929
-Up next is Cupid
-Up next is Cupid

688
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,181
Up next is Soulless

689
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,599
-Up next is Soulless
-Up next is Soulless

690
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,683
-Up next is…
-Up next is…

691
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,934
You're it

692
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,311
-You're it
-You're it

693
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,437
Go buy some more drinks

694
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,856
-Buy some more drinks
-Buy some more drinks

695
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,734
-Go buy some drinks.
-There he goes.

696
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,943
But…

697
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,114
I'll go help him.

698
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,999
-Where--
-Where are you going?

699
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,045
-Hey.
-Yes?

700
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,299
Did you hear the rumor about Cho-hui?

701
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,467
What is it?

702
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,469
What's the rumor, zoomer?

703
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,721
That's so lame.

704
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,431
Jeez.

705
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,768
-Apparently her nickname…
-What?

706
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,521
is cheering squad slut.

707
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,564
-What?
-You didn't know, right?

708
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,566
Be careful, man.

709
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,243
Do you even know what that means?

710
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,079
-Of course, I do.
-And you're still calling someone that?

711
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,083
Do you really have no problem
calling someone that?

712
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,629
You should stop.

713
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,591
I was just relaying something I heard…

714
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,719
I told you to stop.

715
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,346
Sure.

716
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,356
What's gotten into him?

717
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,607
It's your fault.

718
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,609
That's such a nasty rumor to be spreading.

719
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,823
Seon-ho!

720
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,952
Wait for me.

721
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,496
It'll be too heavy for you alone.

722
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,045
Call me again

723
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,965
and I'll get a restraining order on you.

724
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,092
You're going to report me?
You want to hear what I'll do then?

725
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,137
I was going through your pictures
on my phone today.

726
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,805
You damn bastard.

727
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,890
You think I won't show them to anyone?

728
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,392
Do what you want.

729
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,313
If you do that,
I'll kill you and then kill myself.

730
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,647
Hey--

731
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,659
I came to get more snacks.

732
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,374
Did you take care of that thing?

733
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,418
What?

734
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,588
With the captain of the rugby team…

735
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,797
It's private.

736
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,508
-Keep your nose out of it.
-Okay.

737
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,262
I think we've got enough. Let's go.

738
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,807
You're too good for him.

739
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:03,148
Someone like him
doesn't deserve someone like you.

740
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:06,860
Yong-il.

741
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,946
Don't get feelings for me.

742
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,201
I'm too much of a bitch

743
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,913
for you to handle.

744
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,587
What can I do?

745
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,382
I'm already head over heels for you.

746
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,636
Are you upset by any chance?

747
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,598
No, not exactly.

748
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,809
I just decided to give up.

749
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,604
It doesn't feel good
to keep trying at something

750
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,064
that I don't have a chance at.

751
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,275
-What?
-You're busy with part-time jobs, right?

752
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,361
Yes.

753
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,238
Then I guess you won't
date anyone for the time being.

754
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,365
Probably.

755
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,450
That's good to hear.

756
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,536
Just don't date anyone.

757
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,905
-Who the hell are you? Are you a stalker?
-No.

758
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,825
-What did you film?
-You're mistaken. Please.

759
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,202
-What are you doing?
-Hey.

760
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:40,996
Do you know him?

761
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,585
He's my partner in one of my classes.

762
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,463
He goes to our school?

763
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,714
I even have his number.

764
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,969
Hey, are you hurt--

765
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,264
Damn it. I got scratched up.

766
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,288
YONHEE BROADCASTING SYSTEM
THE CHEERING SQUAD, WILL ONE OF THEM DIE?

767
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,541
UPLOADING VIDEO

768
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,422
Why are they so late?

769
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,382
So the light fell right in front of them.

770
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,717
Who is Yu-min?

771
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,053
Sleepyhead.

772
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,641
In Yonhee's cheering squad, Theia,

773
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,644
there are 3 prophecies that have been
passed down for 20 years.

774
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,813
Two of the prophecies already came true.

775
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,189
We will look at the last prophecy

776
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,483
and the shocking incident surrounding it.

777
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,943
A NEW MEMBER, MS. D, IN AN ACCIDENT
DURING THE JOINT CHEER

778
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,780
One of the lights fell as if it was
aimed at Ms. D during the joint cheer.

779
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,950
But this isn't the first time
such an accident happened.

780
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,661
Two years ago,
during the rehearsal for the festival,

781
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,955
Ms. E was struck by a falling light
and seriously injured.

782
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,500
The strange thing is that she disappeared
without a trace after the incident.

783
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,837
While people suspect
that she might have died,

784
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,423
Ms. D had recently received
a warning message that read "Repeat."

785
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,759
It means that it will happen again.

786
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,054
The two incidents are strikingly similar.

787
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,599
Could someone be working in the shadows
to make the prophecy come true?

788
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,603
Shouldn't the cheering squad stop
before something serious happens?

789
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,651
Let's talk.

793
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,080
You didn't get any other messages?

794
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,462
But what happened two years ago?

795
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,089
Soo-il mentioned it before--

796
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,966
Tell me if you receive another message.

797
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,635
Okay.

798
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,140
Who's Ms. E?

799
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,101
Is she really dead?

800
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,479
Two years ago, Yu-min…

801
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,033
was the star of the cheering squad.

802
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,040
Everyone loved her.

803
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,918
That was before it was revealed

804
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,421
that she had been secretly dating
a freshman that year.

805
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,598
Word spread that she gave
that freshman special treatment.

806
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,476
-Let's go.
-What was today's menu again?

807
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,607
That's when Yu-min began to get bullied.

808
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,944
It only got worse as time passed.

809
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,697
It eventually got too serious,

810
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,782
and Yu-min…

811
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:09,079
decided to quit the cheering squad.

812
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,121
But…

813
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,999
an accident happened

814
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,211
during rehearsal
of her last time on stage.

815
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,768
Since then, Yu-min took a leave

816
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,853
and disappeared.

817
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,689
She disappeared?

818
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,233
No one's seen her since then.

819
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,818
No one can reach her.

820
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,571
Then could someone perhaps have made
the light fall on her on purpose?

821
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,116
It was revealed that the accident

822
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:50,453
was due to aging stage equipment.

823
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,788
It really was an accident.

824
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,718
Who's Yu-min?

825
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,261
Jeong-woo's first…

826
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,723
and last love.

827
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,685
I'm going to get some air.

828
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,520
-Should I go with you?
-I'm fine.

829
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,406
Go away.

830
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,409
Go away.

831
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,084
Go away.

832
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,397
There's a puppy.

833
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,234
-Look. It's so cute!
-How much did you drink?

834
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,361
It's running toward us. It's adorable.

835
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,489
-Okay.
-Look at it run.

836
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,199
-How cute.
-My goodness.

837
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,202
Goodbye, puppy.

838
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,788
How can I live without you?

839
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,125
-Quiet down, will you?
-Goodbye, puppy.
