1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,324
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,785
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,675
Stop hiding like a coward
and show yourself!

4
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,423
-Jeong-woo!
-Jeong-woo!

5
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,637
Are you all right?

6
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,181
What's going on?

7
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,207
SHOW PROFILE

8
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,502
They deleted their profile.

9
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,673
They never intended
to show up in the first place.

10
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,341
If they had the guts to show up,

11
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,802
they never would've
sent those messages in secret.

12
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,512
Then why do something like this?

13
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,013
It's just…

14
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,683
all a game to them.

15
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,936
That's why you should disregard them too.

16
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,733
People like that move on
when you stop giving them attention.

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,074
Come on, Seon-ho.

18
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,620
Where has he gone?
He won't even answer my calls.

19
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,165
I think we did really well.

20
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,250
That's that, but here's what I think.

21
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,502
Seon-ho.

22
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,590
Mom.

23
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,843
-Hello.
-Hello.

24
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,013
-How did you come here?
-Well…

25
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,599
I found the tickets in your room.

26
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,311
You looked great today.

27
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,937
Is this Theia?

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,608
Go home. Let's talk at home.

29
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,192
It's fine.

30
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,404
I came all the way here.
I should say hello to them.

31
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,240
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

32
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,742
I'm Seon-ho's mom.

33
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,952
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

34
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,788
You all did a great job today.

35
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,541
Use this to pay for your afterparty.

36
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,044
Wow.

37
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,795
It's fine, ma'am.

38
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,298
We appreciate it though.

39
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,466
Jeong-woo.

40
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,967
Are you the leader?

41
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,595
Why would you refuse?

42
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,430
It's a token of my gratitude.

43
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,434
It's fine with me,
so go on and enjoy yourselves a feast.

44
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,562
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

45
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,272
By the way, who's Do Hae-yi?

46
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,357
It's me.

47
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,361
Wait.

48
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,113
Haven't we met before?

49
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,200
I know. I've been thinking the same thing.

50
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,952
Mom. Why don't you go home now?

51
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,703
Are you dating my son?

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,875
-I'm sorry?
-Mom.

53
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,086
I heard someone say
that you two were dating.

54
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,463
They saw you two hugging.

55
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,589
Hugging?

56
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,093
No, we're not dating.

57
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,596
You're not? Then why the hug?

58
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,058
It was a show of camaraderie.

59
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,685
I see.

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,647
You must have fallen
head over heels for Seon-ho.

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,983
But then again, I guess all girls do.

62
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,360
No, it's actually not--

63
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,486
That's not it.

64
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,241
It's me who has a crush on her.

65
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,329
You? On her?

66
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,792
I'd get it if she was the one
who had a crush on you,

67
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,335
but it's the other way around?

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,088
Tell me, why don't you like my son?

69
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,425
Anyone would agree that Seon-ho
is a million times better than you.

70
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,052
Anyone would say
that my daughter is way better.

71
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,141
-Mom?
-"Mom"? What? Who?

72
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,521
Why are you here?

73
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
Because I have a good reason to be.

74
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,402
He must be the one
chasing after my daughter.

75
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,029
It happens all the time.

76
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,533
You have no idea how bothersome it is
to be so popular like Hae-yi.

77
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,874
Isn't that right, sweetie?

78
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,553
I guess they aren't dating after all.

79
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,097
Should we be relieved?

80
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,019
Hey, Jae-yi.

81
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,897
-Hi.
-Did you see me on stage?

82
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,192
-Yes, I did.
-What did you think?

83
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,486
I liked it, I guess.

84
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,697
Really? You did?

85
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,533
I guess you really liked it.

86
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,328
What's this? Some messed-up romance show?

87
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,166
Did you get this for me?

88
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,252
This your daughter?

89
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,171
That your son?

90
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,839
-Let's go.
-Mom.

91
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,132
What for? Let go.

92
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,927
Wait, did you do your makeup
just to come here?

93
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,137
-What about it?
-Come on.

94
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,015
It's nighttime. Take off the shades.

95
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,309
You and that tongue of yours.

96
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:37,480
Right, your daughter can have
all the popularity she wants.

97
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,608
Mom. Just go home for now.

98
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,485
We'll talk tomorrow at home.

99
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,569
Seon-ho.

100
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,239
I'm so disappointed.

101
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,865
Mom, please.

102
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,909
If you keep going, I'll…

103
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,123
Fine then.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,001
I'll go.

105
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,885
She thinks she's all that
because she's rich now.

106
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,262
Gosh, Mom!

107
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,596
Do you know each other?

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,307
Don't you ever date him.

109
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,436
Your life will be hell if you end up
having her as a mother-in-law.

110
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,812
Stop overreacting.

111
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,939
Why would you picture her
as my mother-in-law?

112
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,899
Because you never know, you brat.

113
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,029
By the way,
you didn't have to get us drinks.

114
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,699
I bet it cost you to get one for everyone.

115
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,369
I may not be able to offer my card,
but I can do this much.

116
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,873
Thanks.

117
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,545
It's not like you to say that.

118
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,714
What's gotten into you?

119
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,425
Anyway, I'm against you dating him!

120
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,593
Please be quiet!

121
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,679
I'm just looking out for you, all right?

122
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,223
Hey.

123
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,434
Good job.

124
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,060
You're here.

125
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,147
Right. Hey.

126
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,273
Go, then.

127
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,025
You looked cool.

128
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,697
Just today, I mean.

129
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,575
You think so?
I was the star of the show, wasn't I?

130
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,329
I must truly be a natural-born star.

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,956
There you go again.

132
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,168
Thanks for coming.

133
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,547
You adorable little brat.

134
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
By the way, how do you know Seon-ho?

135
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,186
Why won't it open?

136
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,521
Give it here.

137
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,153
All right, let's drink up!

138
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,990
Great work today, everyone.

139
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,077
Let's enjoy ourselves
to celebrate our hard work.

140
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,079
Theia!

141
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,830
-Theia!
-Theia!

142
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,791
Bottoms up!

143
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,674
That's so cool.

144
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,467
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

145
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,222
Here's the beef courtesy of Seon-ho's mom.

146
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,890
-Wow!
-Wow!

147
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,602
Thanks, Seon-ho.

148
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,145
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

149
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,063
Here.

150
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
I heard you were the one
who helped Jae-yi.

151
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,277
I happened to know their family.

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,444
Thanks.

153
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,613
I keep getting indebted to you.

154
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,076
I'll pay you back
double for this, plus interest.

155
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,661
You don't have to.

156
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,955
I just did it because I wanted to.

157
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,832
I didn't want you to suffer.

158
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,298
Seon-ho, were you
officially asking her out earlier?

159
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,934
I didn't mean to, but I guess so.

160
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,354
I've decided to have a crush on someone

161
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,150
for the first time in my life.

162
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,072
Then what will she choose to do?

163
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,533
Stop it.

164
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,039
It's a private matter.

165
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,542
What's with the uncertain answer?

166
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,669
-My heart just skipped a beat.
-Why would you?

167
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,715
What was our third rule again?

168
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,593
No dating other members.

169
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,303
And if you break it?

170
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,679
You have to leave.

171
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,558
Then should you be making
a commotion out of this or not?

172
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,851
They shouldn't.

173
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,860
-Keep that in mind, all right?
-Yes.

174
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,946
We need to talk.

175
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,619
But he started it.

176
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,537
He's going to get an earful.

177
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,538
Let's just drink.

178
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,382
Yong-il, I need you
to keep an eye on the freshmen.

179
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,884
-I'm sorry?
-I mean Hae-yi and Seon-ho.

180
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,845
Report to me if anything happens
between the two of them.

181
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,931
Right.

182
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,265
You can trust me.

183
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,101
I'm quick to notice things like that.

184
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,603
Okay. Sure.

185
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,321
-A rabbit came down from the spaceship
-A rabbit came down from the spaceship

186
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,572
-And said…
-And said…

187
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,782
Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny!

188
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
-Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny!
-Carrot, carrot!

189
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,951
-Bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny!
-Carrot, carrot!

190
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,787
-Bunny, bunny…
-You two are it!

191
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,664
You two have to link arms
and take your shots.

192
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,291
-Drink together!
-Drink together!

193
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,835
-Let me drink instead!
-What?

194
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,045
-But it's mine!
-Not you. I'll drink Seon-ho's.

195
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,301
-Drink together!
-Drink together!

196
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,304
-Yong-il's favorite random game!
-Random game!

197
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,222
-One!
-Two!

198
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,473
-Three!
-Four!

199
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,435
Drink together!

200
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,436
Let me drink again!

201
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,398
-Damn it.
-Let's turn the heat up a notch!

202
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,442
Yong-il's favorite random…

203
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,361
-Drink together!
-Drink together!

204
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,779
Drink up…

205
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,030
You can't do that.

206
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,574
I'll drink instead.

207
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,993
Yong-il must have been aching to drink.

208
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,911
Why would you steal my drink?

209
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,996
The graveyard game.

210
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,456
-The corpse rises!
-The corpse rises!

211
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,748
-Apartment, apartment!
-Apartment, apartment!

212
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,460
-Drink up!
-Drink up!

213
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,587
Oops, we lost.

214
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,464
-Drink together!
-I have no choice.

215
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,549
Let me drink instead!

216
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,930
This is so much fun…

217
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,348
Hae-yi?

218
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,643
It's you.

219
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,857
I upset you earlier, didn't I?

220
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,442
Yes.

221
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,653
But I really didn't mean to.

222
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,241
You disappeared,
but the bad guy was out there.

223
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,784
So I went to look for you,

224
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,787
but you wouldn't answer your phone.

225
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,291
Never mind.

226
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,711
I'm to blame.

227
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,047
It's all my fault.

228
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,217
-It's my fault.
-Stop!

229
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,845
How dare you?

230
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,142
You keep acting flirty with me
and even hugged me.

231
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,562
You even rejected me when I asked you out.

232
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,610
That's right. You rejected me.

233
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,197
Did you think I'd fall for that again?

234
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,907
Did you?

235
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,451
Forget it. I don't need you.

236
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:54,583
I'll date someone way better than you

237
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,001
and devastate you.

238
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,920
Get lost!

239
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,091
Gosh, my stomach hurts…

240
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,428
I must've really hurt her.

241
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,015
You think I'd still fall for you?

242
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,686
No way. I'm way smarter than that.

243
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,105
Get lost, Jeong-woo.

244
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,445
What are you doing
in the women's bathroom?

245
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,573
This is the men's bathroom.

246
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,119
Right, so it is.

247
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,538
I'm so sorry.

248
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,082
Did something happen…

249
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,960
between you and Jeong-woo?

250
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,920
What?

251
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,047
You told Jeong-woo to get lost just now.

252
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,674
Right.

253
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,178
You know what Jeong-woo's like.

254
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,972
He's authoritative and stuck-up.

255
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,641
He's so full of himself.

256
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
I thought you two were close.

257
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,147
Me and him?

258
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,401
No, not even the tiniest bit.

259
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,737
I see.

260
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,448
Well then, I'll leave you to it.

261
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,243
I'm so sorry.

262
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,369
You can do it!

263
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,925
You're so adorable.

264
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,302
-Let me join too.
-What are you doing?

265
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,137
-I said you're adorable.
-Me? Adorable?

266
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,598
-Jeong-woo.
-I'm Jeong-woo, you punk.

267
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,016
You punk.

268
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,484
Are you all right?
You've already had a lot to drink.

269
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,694
No, I'm perfectly fine.

270
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,887
Huh?

271
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,057
It's the sea.

272
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,938
The sea?

273
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,116
Wake up.

274
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
Wake up, everyone. It's the sea.

275
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,005
It's the ocean!

276
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:03,981
Oh, gosh.

277
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,819
It's the sea!

278
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,661
What happened?

279
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,389
It's the sea.

280
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,099
I know.

281
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,229
Hey!

282
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:45,981
Oh, goodness.

283
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,614
Mom.

284
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,659
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,538
I don't want to hear it.
I'm so sick of it.

286
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,002
Mom, I'm sorry!

287
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,755
-I really am.
-Please.

288
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,049
-I really didn't mean to.
-Don't cry.

289
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,886
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't cry.

290
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,888
-Why is he apologizing?
-I'm sorry.

291
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,808
What can I do to make it up to you?

292
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,143
I'm so sorry. I'll do better.

293
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,978
-We're so sorry.
-We're sorry, ma'am.

294
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,231
We're terribly sorry!

295
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,607
-We're sorry.
-Please, ma'am.

296
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,194
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,531
Tell them to come inside and eat.

298
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,448
Okay.

299
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,002
Thank you, ma'am.

300
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,213
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

301
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:56,969
That hits the spot.

302
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,306
It's good.

303
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,312
So you're saying…

304
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,149
that this is your house?

305
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,651
If this is your house, are we in Busan?

306
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,238
How did we end up here?

307
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,869
So…

308
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,499
what happened was…

309
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,501
Mom.

310
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

311
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,799
Why did you do that?

312
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,926
You must know what it's like.

313
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,595
You know how I'm feeling.

314
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,722
No, I don't.

315
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,390
Why don't you?

316
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,019
Let's go!

317
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,190
To apologize to Jeong-woo's mom!

318
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
Let's go apologize to her!

319
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,028
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

320
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,157
The cab is on me. Let's go!

321
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,659
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

322
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,288
Then Yeong-woong called for a cab and…

323
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,790
-Hae-yi, your shoes.
-Let's go!

324
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,043
-I'm not going. I'm scared.
-We should.

325
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,920
-I'm so sorry, Mom!
-Just get on.

326
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,838
-I don't want to go!
-Get on.

327
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,715
Let's go!

328
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,052
-But Jeong-woo's house is in Busan.
-We're going.

329
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,553
Hey, lady!

330
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,430
Are you getting in or not?

331
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,766
Hop on! You only live once!

332
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,850
Get on.

333
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,898
Let's go.

334
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,025
When else are we
ever going to visit Busan?

335
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,945
Yu-min!

336
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,616
I'll get in.

337
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,830
-Here we go!
-Let's go!

338
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,876
That's what happened.

339
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,133
The older members
should've kept their heads straight.

340
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,555
Finish your meals quickly.

341
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,434
Yes, ma'am.

342
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,354
Let's finish our meals quickly
and get back.

343
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,983
I'll need something in return
for the bed and food I provided you.

344
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,988
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,033
Yes. Okay.

346
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,371
Since we're already here in Busan,

347
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,666
how about we visit Haeundae
and have a bowl of cold raw fish--

348
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,584
I have to get back to Seoul for work.

349
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,045
But it's the weekend.

350
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,464
I have a report to make on Monday,

351
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,425
but some information seems to be missing.

352
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,260
Can't you have someone else do it?

353
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,513
It's my report, so how could I?

354
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:50,183
Then how about you do it tomorrow?

355
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,893
We're in Busan after all.

356
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,730
The report is going to
keep coming to my mind.

357
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,525
-Sorry.
-Come on, don't be so stuffy.

358
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,782
I just thought you could do it tomorrow.

359
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,827
Fine. I'm stuffy.

360
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,956
But I bet most people who work
live a stuffy life like me.

361
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,541
You just have it too easy.

362
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,585
Did I upset you?

363
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,296
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,090
I've been meaning to bring this up.

365
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,759
When will you grow up?

366
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,718
What?

367
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,261
The others told me

368
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,722
that you earned some money
with your startup company.

369
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,309
I don't know how much you made,
but money isn't the problem here.

370
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,935
You're not in your youth anymore.

371
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,022
You can't keep hanging around
the squad for the rest of your life.

372
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,483
Is that so bad?

373
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,736
-Well, it's not good.
-What's your definition of good then?

374
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,948
Would you prefer that I work
at a decent company like the others?

375
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,203
I'm not saying this
to keep up appearances right now.

376
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,121
You're not?

377
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,039
Damn it.

378
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,333
You're making me sound so lame.

379
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,044
Never mind.

380
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,421
I crossed the line.

381
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,800
We're not serious enough to be meddling
in each other's lives, right?

382
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,967
My apologies.

383
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,556
Damn it.

384
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,812
GIJANG TRADITIONAL MARKET
2019 BUSAN SEAGULL SINGING CONTEST

385
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,231
We also have seagulls in Daegu.

386
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,358
There are seagulls in Daegu?

387
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,152
-That must be them.
-Let's take a look.

388
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,071
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

389
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,033
-You all look so handsome.
-You're all fine-looking.

390
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,409
Are you strong?

391
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,162
-You're so pretty!
-Why are you hiding back there?

392
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,498
Mom. Even so, this is too much.

393
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,209
I fed you and let you sleep over
after you barged in like that.

394
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,836
I deserve something in return.

395
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,880
My gosh. Look at you, Jeong-woo!

396
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,968
-Jeong-woo's here.
-You look more handsome than before.

397
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,553
Seoul must be treating you well.

398
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,846
What do you mean?

399
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,514
-It isn't just Seoul.
-Let's go.

400
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,142
-He's a student at a prestigious college.
-Go where?

401
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:59,729
When he got into college,
we made a whole banner just for him.

402
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,856
GIJANG'S PRIDE, PARK JEONG-WOO
ACCEPTED INTO PRESTIGIOUS YONHEE UNIV.

403
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,482
Right over there.

404
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,608
That's right.

405
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,111
You have no idea how big of a deal it was.

406
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,030
When he came to the market,

407
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,825
-he was treated like a celebrity.
-That's right.

408
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,785
Ever since he was young,

409
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,954
we called him the Jagalchi Prince.

410
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,670
So this is where
he began his reign as a prince.

411
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,963
That's right.

412
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,381
Please stop that.

413
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,592
He was so little,

414
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,261
but he would stand
in the middle of the market

415
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,097
and shake his booty
like there was no tomorrow.

416
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,099
He'd dance his little booty off.

417
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,519
He was so adorable.

418
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,480
-When did you grow up so big?
-Come here.

419
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,608
Come on, my friends are watching!

420
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,651
Everyone treats Jeong-woo like a kid here.

421
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,071
That's enough. Just take them to work.

422
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,159
I've fed you plenty of food,

423
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,452
so make it pay off.

424
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,494
-Okay.
-Gosh.

425
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,372
-Let's see who looks the strongest.
-Let's see.

426
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,957
Let's go.

427
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,751
-Come on, Mom. I'm their leader.
-Let's go.

428
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,336
Come with us.

429
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,921
-Let's go.
-Go on now.

430
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,298
-This way.
-Should you wear gloves?

431
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,092
-Let's go.
-I don't want to do this.

432
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:20,060
Gosh, they took all the energetic ones.

433
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,978
What use do I have with him?

434
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,272
How can I help you?

435
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,235
Miss.

436
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,945
I'm sorry?

437
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,531
Try the seaweed here.
We have the most delicious ones.

438
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,742
I'm not a "miss" though.

439
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,494
What? Really?

440
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,538
You looked so young
that I thought you were one.

441
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,457
I'm sorry. Please pardon me.

442
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,210
There's no need to apologize.

443
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,211
Are you from Seoul?

444
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,088
Yes. I'm helping out here.

445
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,590
You know how good
seaweed is for you, right?

446
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,344
It's packed with vitamins and minerals.

447
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,097
But I guess you won't need them.

448
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,932
Your skin is glowing as is.

449
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,893
If you glow up any more,
your friends will be jealous of you.

450
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,228
Gosh.

451
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,899
You have such a great sense of humor.

452
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,526
So? Would you like some?

453
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,610
Sure.

454
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,821
Thank you.

455
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,947
I'll see you again.

456
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,535
You could probably sell them
the seawater from Haeundae Beach.

457
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,996
This comes from years of experience.

458
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,622
Gosh.

459
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,335
What is it?

460
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,549
I think my girlfriend thinks I'm pathetic.

461
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,804
You have a girlfriend?

462
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,017
It's not like I didn't put any thought
into how I live my life right now.

463
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,185
Gosh, a girlfriend?

464
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,104
What kind of person is she?

465
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,480
She is a person, right?

466
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,318
I'm opening up to you.
Can't you be a little more serious?

467
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,904
This world never ceases to amaze me.

468
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,990
I feel hopeful.

469
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,909
Never mind.
I don't know what I expected from you.

470
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,994
That's right.

471
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,789
Why would you talk to me about that?
Go talk to your girlfriend.

472
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,669
You said you didn't end up
where you are without thinking.

473
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,755
Go explain that to your girlfriend then.

474
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,343
I've cooked some seaweed
for the customers to sample.

475
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,928
You guys should try some too.
It tastes amazing.

476
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,889
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

477
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,640
You have a silver tongue.

478
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,184
Thank you.

479
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,353
It's great with the sauce.

480
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,063
You know how to eat it.

481
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,576
I can smell the ocean in the wind.

482
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,702
Hae-yi!

483
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,081
Hae-yi.

484
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,632
-My goodness!
-You startled me!

485
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,925
Is it that good?

486
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,599
-So I grab them with my hand?
-Yes, just like this.

487
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,642
Hey.

488
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,311
What did I do last night?

489
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,199
Hey, get up. Mom says to eat.

490
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:28,957
"Mom"?

491
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,874
Yes.

492
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,127
My mom.

493
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,633
Why isn't anyone here?

494
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,055
What's he doing?

495
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,602
Hey, get up. Get up, will you?

496
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,646
Answer me. Open your eyes.

497
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,778
Welcome. Take a seat.

498
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,697
-Okay. Take a seat here.
-Hello.

499
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:08,121
I never thought I'd end up
making hangover soup for my daughter.

500
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,831
Thank you, Ms. Lee Sun-ja.

501
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,999
You're welcome.

502
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,042
How do you know Seon-ja?

503
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,586
Dad.

504
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,255
He's just a friend from school.

505
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,632
He was so drunk last night

506
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,676
that I had no choice
but to bring him home.

507
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,261
Are you sure you're just friends?

508
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,054
Yes, sir. We're just friends.

509
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,264
I'm relieved then.

510
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,891
Relieved, my foot.

511
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,603
You told me you'd date twelve men
every year when you got into college.

512
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,146
You've got to be kidding me.

513
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:37,066
If you're unlucky, you'll end up
marrying your first boyfriend like me.

514
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,777
Don't worry, Mom.

515
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,655
I'm going to enjoy my life to the fullest
just as you wished.

516
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,656
As if.

517
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,118
You've been head over heels
for Jae-yi for years to no avail.

518
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:51,581
I've saved Jae-yi for last,

519
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,958
so I'm holding myself back.

520
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,503
Gosh. Sure thing.

521
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,130
Listen.

522
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,133
Have some fruit after the meal

523
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,385
-and spend some time here.
-Nonsense.

524
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,471
-He needs to go right away.
-Yes, ma'am.

525
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,689
-What?
-Honey?

526
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,280
There.

527
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,866
I need to open the restaurant for lunch,

528
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,869
so finish preparing everything here.

529
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,789
Goodness, Mom.

530
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,753
She seems to make more kimchi than us
when we run a bossam restaurant.

531
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,380
Her restaurant must be popular.

532
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,466
Let's get it done and rest.

533
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,346
If we have to do all this,
we'll be here all night.

534
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,558
Are you all right?

535
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,643
You drank a lot last night.

536
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,229
You should be more worried about yourself.

537
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,585
What?

538
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,502
Do you want one?

539
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,967
Thanks.

540
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,931
About yesterday…

541
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,601
I need to take this.

542
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,104
Sure.

543
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,233
Son, where are you?
Why aren't you home yet?

544
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,527
I'm in Busan.

545
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,570
Busan?

546
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,072
What for?

547
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,199
I somehow ended up coming here.

548
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,035
I'll be back tonight.

549
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,620
I'll tell you everything at home.

550
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,413
Seon-ho…

551
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,331
Goodness.

552
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,666
He hung up.

553
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,710
What's gotten into him?

554
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,255
What is wrong with him?

555
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,800
So you blacked out,

556
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,969
and you think
you might have kissed someone,

557
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,846
but you don't know who it was?

558
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,473
Wow.

559
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,727
Maybe it was a dream.
Perhaps you've been lonely as of late.

560
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,811
Could that be it?

561
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,358
My dreams have just gotten more realistic
because I've been lonely, right?

562
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,361
Why don't I buy you
a pillow to hug in bed?

563
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,612
Forget it.

564
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,406
So who do you wish it was?

565
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,867
What do you mean?

566
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,954
Who do you wish you kissed?

567
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,594
I don't know.

568
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,721
I'm ruined!

569
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,642
Excuse me. We have rice cakes…

570
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,644
-Gosh.
-The rice cakes here…

571
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,941
-Buy some rice cakes.
-Goodness.

572
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,484
What did you say?

573
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,194
Buy some rice cakes.

574
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,948
We just steamed them,
so they're delicious and soft.

575
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:16,077
The red bean this season
is said to be especially sweet.

576
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:21,624
Are you trying to sell me rice cakes
by making me curious?

577
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,626
Give me one.

578
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,628
-One mung bean and one powder-coated.
-Yes, ma'am.

579
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,047
That will be 6,000 won.

580
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,633
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

581
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,970
Hey, well done!

582
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,434
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

583
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,436
We need some glutinous rice flour
for making kimchi.

584
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,813
Right. I have them ready. Hold on.

585
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,482
Keep up the good work.

586
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,234
-Thank you.
-Sure. See you.

587
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,405
Hello there.

588
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,161
Why did he say hello to me?

589
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,288
Take a pick.

590
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,916
It's 10,000 won for 2 items.
Buy 4 and get 1 free.

591
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,669
The oriental melons are in season!

592
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,131
If you buy one basket,
we'll give three more baskets for free.

593
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,716
-We have the latest items.
-Ma'am!

594
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,176
-Check out these melons.
-Miss.

595
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,095
Can you help me move some boxes?

596
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,305
-Can you?
-Yes.

597
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,516
But there are quite a lot.

598
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,477
Right. Miss!

599
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,271
Could you help me for a moment?

600
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,774
-Of course.
-Right. Come with me.

601
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,817
You put in so much effort.

602
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,403
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

603
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,905
-Go on and try it.
-Okay.

604
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,573
-Thank you.
-No worries.

605
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,616
Honey.

606
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,954
Come on, honey.

607
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,918
My gosh!

608
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,087
Let's keep the door open.

609
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,507
-Have fun.
-Bye.

610
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,883
Get out of here.

611
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,512
You're more sociable than I thought.

612
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,647
I should be in Busan right now.

613
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,024
Why did I have to be in the restroom then?

614
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,866
Were you and Hae-yi friends
since you were young?

615
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,119
Yes. We're childhood friends.

616
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,621
That's why you're close with her brother.

617
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,290
Yes. Whenever Hae-yi's mom was busy,

618
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,085
Jae-yi and Hae-yi used to come over
to eat at my place.

619
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,629
Do you like Hae-yi's brother?

620
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,339
Why do you ask?

621
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,092
You seem to be kind of clingy.

622
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:37,885
Me?

623
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,305
That's because you don't know Jae-yi.

624
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,683
He's just shy.

625
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,102
Well, if that's what you think.

626
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,230
I have a question.

627
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,733
Why are you so curious about everything?
I was starting to grow fond of you.

628
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,111
What's up between Jeong-woo and Hae-yi?

629
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,238
What? Did you know?

630
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,491
I always thought you were a bit slow
with these things,

631
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,993
but I guess I was wrong.

632
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,093
Then who could have taken those photos?

633
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,648
-Dad.
-Don't mind me.

634
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,235
Mom!

635
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,865
What's all this?

636
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,367
Hae-yi!

637
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,454
Hae-yi.

638
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,299
I think…

639
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,260
I may have drunk too much last night.

640
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,554
I don't remember a thing.

641
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,681
Yes. It seemed that way.

642
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,645
By the way,

643
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,190
did I make any mistakes last night?

644
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,068
Why?

645
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,611
Are you anxious?

646
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,405
Because you blacked out?

647
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,991
What is it?

648
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,663
Did I do something last night?

649
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,375
No. You didn't do anything.

650
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,292
Really?

651
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,133
Jeong-woo.

652
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,013
I drank too much last night

653
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,140
and seem to have blacked out.

654
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,811
Did I make any mistakes last night?

655
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,229
What kind of mistake?

656
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,772
Well…

657
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,942
Anything…

658
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,905
in particular?

659
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:09,912
What the heck?

660
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,414
Was it really a dream?

661
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,126
Am I that lonely?

662
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,253
No way.

663
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,088
I think I was with someone.

664
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,382
That's enough.

665
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,801
You can stop and come help me out.

666
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,969
Yes, ma'am!

667
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,103
I'll have them washed in no time.

668
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,187
Thanks.

669
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:36,772
Gosh.

670
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,859
Why is she so scatterbrained?

671
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,697
She's not usually like that.

672
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,408
She's just in a hurry.

673
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,502
Isn't it heavy?

674
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,963
Watch out!

675
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,600
Thanks.

676
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,562
Hey, stop right there!

677
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,481
She almost got hurt!

678
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,066
It's okay. I'm fine.

679
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,153
If it was a motorcycle, I'd have memorized
the license plate and reported him.

680
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,656
You haven't changed.

681
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,909
What do you mean?

682
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,294
You're still…

683
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,672
very brave.

684
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,136
When I was bullied by everyone,

685
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,598
you fought on my side.

686
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,854
-Let's go.
-Come on.

687
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,567
Why don't you just be straightforward?

688
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,072
You leave the room when she comes
like some high school kids.

689
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,783
It's so immature.

690
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,746
If you've got a problem, just tell her.

691
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,165
Why do you have to be such a prick?

692
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,208
-Let's go.
-Come on.

693
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,128
-She's so annoying.
-Look at the way she talks.

694
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,048
Thanks.

695
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,680
I wasn't siding with you.

696
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,641
I just couldn't stand them.

697
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,310
Thank you…

698
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,690
for both then and now.

699
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,201
What should we do?

700
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,078
Do you have to ask?

701
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,540
We'll just pay for it
and have it ourselves.

702
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,750
Right?

703
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,128
I worry too much, don't I?

704
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,854
I need to tell you something.

705
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,855
Let's meet up.

706
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,940
LEE YU-MIN: I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
LET'S MEET UP.

707
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,114
What was this urgent business
you mentioned?

708
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,283
I wanted to ask you something.

709
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,661
I saw it on the day of the festival.

710
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,541
LEE YU-MIN
ARE YOU AFTER HAE-YI THIS TIME?

711
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,921
I thought it was mine.

712
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,053
You're the one who sent them
those messages, aren't you?

713
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,225
Jin-il, you dog.

714
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,688
I didn't realize that you had
the guts for something like that.

715
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,232
The squad thinks it was me.

716
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,193
But you know what?

717
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,154
Yu-min suddenly asked to see me.

718
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,075
I wonder how she'll react
when she learns that it was you.

719
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,795
You got some on your face.

720
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,464
That stings!

721
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,889
Did I do that?

722
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,975
That hurts!

723
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,895
-Are you all right?
-My eyes hurt!

724
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,022
This won't do. Hold on.

725
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:47,940
It stings.

726
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,527
Hold on a little.

727
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,745
I thought my precious little eyes
were going to go blind.

728
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,748
Sorry. I was only trying to wipe it away.

729
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,543
You shouldn't have done anything.

730
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,170
You're not helping.

731
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,299
I'm sorry. I keep making mistakes.

732
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,220
Here.

733
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,525
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

734
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,990
What are you doing? I called dibs on that.

735
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,575
Hae-yi hurt her eye.

736
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,827
Use this.

737
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,412
Okay.

738
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,999
Fine, you take it.

739
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,709
Thanks.

740
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,803
Come over again.

741
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,972
Goodbye.

742
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,390
Hurry home.

743
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,648
Gosh, he's so upright.
He'd make a great son-in-law.

744
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,067
We'll see.

745
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,943
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

746
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,404
That's not a possibility.

747
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,282
How many son-in-laws
do you have in mind already?

748
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,952
Where should I put this?

749
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,621
Here.

750
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,143
They're stars.

751
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,354
Did Jeong-woo stick them here?

752
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,688
That's right.

753
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,317
Jeong-woo put those there
when he was seven.

754
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,655
He must have loved stars
since he was young.

755
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,906
He's even majoring in it.

756
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,575
He's more romantic than I thought.

757
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,788
Goodness, I'm just sick of those stars.

758
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,001
Whenever I came home late from work,

759
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,046
I'd find him sitting outside the door

760
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,091
watching the skies, waiting for me.

761
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,011
He must have been
so lonely that he decided

762
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,305
to be friends with the stars.

763
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,770
I was so adamantly against him
majoring in astronomy,

764
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,730
but he was so stubborn.

765
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,983
That's why I hate them even more now.

766
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,780
You see,

767
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,824
Jeong-woo is just like his dad.

768
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,037
No one can stop him
once he sets his mind on something.

769
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,884
Seon-hye!

770
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,052
Are you home, Seon-hye?

771
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,929
Seon-hye. It's an emergency!

772
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,431
You should come out right now.

773
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,599
Goodness.

774
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,686
What business does she have
at our market singing contest

775
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,231
when she's in charge of the restaurants?

776
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,275
Has that hag gone nuts?

777
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,777
Why would she come all the way here
and ruin our fun?

778
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,654
What should we do?

779
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,741
Everyone's siding with her now.

780
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,869
They have such great prizes this time.

781
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,287
-Goodness.
-It's not fair.

782
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,749
Are we supposed to let her steal them
when she doesn't belong here?

783
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:34,833
Excuse me.

784
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,589
I think I have an idea.

785
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,514
-What is it?
-Goodness.

786
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,098
Hurry and tell us.

787
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,740
Three, four.

788
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:23,340
-Cross the starry bridge
-Let's go!

789
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,967
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

790
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,970
Cross the windy field of reeds

791
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,931
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

792
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:36,562
Whenever I come around

793
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,899
Your apartment is waiting for me

794
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,989
Like the flowing river

795
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,077
Like the drifting clouds

796
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,205
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

797
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,000
You had to leave

798
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,378
Because you couldn't stay

799
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,506
And I can't forget you

800
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,676
Everyone, scream!

801
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,554
Because I couldn't forget you like a fool

802
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,307
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

803
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,643
I came back to see you today

804
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,521
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

805
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,566
But no one is there

806
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,777
Not a single soul is there

807
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,823
In your lonely apartment

808
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,249
You're the best, Park Jeong-woo!

809
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,256
Here's some meat for you. Enjoy.

810
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,050
It looks delicious.

811
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,552
-Meat!
-It looks amazing!

812
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,262
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

813
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,722
Eat to your heart's content.

814
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,725
You really helped out
the people at the market today.

815
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,185
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

816
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,896
-You have a glass too.
-Okay.

817
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,564
You're the best.

818
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,360
Don't drink tonight.

819
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,320
Don't be a party pooper.

820
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,823
Drink up and eat up.
We have plenty of meat.

821
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,908
-There.
-Let's drink.

822
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,785
You did great today.

823
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:19,081
-I won't. Really.
-Then have lots of meat.

824
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,090
We'll head back after we eat.

825
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,884
I left some food with the security.
Make sure to pick it up.

826
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,512
I packed some for your friends too,

827
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,138
so take them with you when you go.

828
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,223
Thank you.

829
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,355
I was going to tell you that I'll quit

830
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,608
just to put your mind at ease,

831
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,695
but that would make me a liar again.

832
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,533
Can I be in the cheering squad
until the end of this year?

833
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,951
Just this year.

834
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,329
I'll start studying hard next year

835
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,165
and become a civil servant.

836
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,084
You know how smart I am,

837
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,086
don't you?

838
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,130
Do you like the cheering squad that much?

839
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,467
I can't leave just yet.

840
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,022
I used to love it

841
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,234
when your dad

842
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,778
used to sing.

843
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,532
I was too busy making ends meet,

844
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,119
so I never had the time to enjoy music,

845
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,580
but your dad

846
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,000
always said that to sing was to dream

847
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,086
and sang a song every now and then.

848
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:54,092
That made him glow in my eyes.

849
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,304
After we got married,

850
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,016
I was sick of him darting
from place to place living like a hippie,

851
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,811
but I still liked

852
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,897
seeing your dad sing.

853
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,565
I'm not like Dad.

854
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,318
I won't live like that.

855
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,447
Of course.

856
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,157
You're nothing like him.

857
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,704
You're right. You're different.

858
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,001
You can do that if you like.

859
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,801
You seemed to shine brightly

860
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:40,597
while I watched you yesterday and today.

861
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,098
BRILLIANCE

862
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,522
This might be you at your brightest.

863
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,237
You can do whatever you like.

864
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,697
I won't be able to stop you anyway.

865
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,368
Is that really okay?

866
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,411
Your dad told me

867
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,082
that it's a blessing

868
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,210
to be able to find

869
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,171
something that you like so much.

870
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,803
Many people don't even get to find
just one thing that they like.

871
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,142
Goodness.

872
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,438
I guess you were born blessed.

873
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:33,984
Thank you.

874
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,572
And I'm sorry.

875
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,704
Goodness,

876
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,622
raising a child is so difficult.

877
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:11,164
Are you upset that you didn't get to
drink any makgeolli?

878
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,625
It's not that.

879
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,628
I was just being sentimental.

880
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,339
About what?

881
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,096
I was just…

882
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,431
reminded of my dad.

883
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,227
My mom told me

884
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,190
that my dad never got to see the ocean
since he was too busy working.

885
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,986
I felt bad enjoying this great view
when he couldn't.

886
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:43,947
Your dad must be proud of you

887
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,118
since you thought of him first
when you experienced something this good.

888
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,457
Are you feeling all right?

889
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,210
You seemed a little down earlier.

890
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,128
I'm fine.

891
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,841
I feel better than I ever did.

892
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,015
It's altari!

893
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,767
Sure.

894
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,894
Let's just call it altari.

895
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,356
I know what it's called. It's "Altair."

896
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,735
It's just easier to call it altari.

897
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,778
I'm really smart.

898
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,863
Altari.

899
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,115
Deneb. Vega.

900
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,959
Is this the spot?

901
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,252
What do you mean?

902
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,713
Is this where you used to sit
and look up at the sky?

903
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,259
Your mother told me.

904
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,555
Yes, this is it.

905
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,726
Were you lonely?

906
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,439
I mean,

907
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,817
I was a little less lonely
since I had Jae-yi.

908
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,653
But I thought you could have been lonely

909
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,406
since you were all alone.

910
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,332
It was okay.

911
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,710
When I sat here like this…

912
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,881
time flew by.

913
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,733
It's a blessing

914
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,903
to be able to find

915
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,781
something that you like so much.

916
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,915
About yesterday…

917
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,168
What about yesterday?

918
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,504
You told me to stop flirting with you.

919
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,174
Oh, that.

920
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:13,179
I think I remember up to that point.

921
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,100
You're right.

922
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,853
I've been that way.

923
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,397
It's fine.

924
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,066
I don't think apologies are necessary now.

925
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,902
So I've decided to stop that.

926
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,825
I'll stop being flirty…

927
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,580
and be more straightforward.

928
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:47,881
I like you.

929
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,843
I like you, Hae-yi.

930
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:26,920
Hae-yi!

931
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,173
Come join us.

932
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,513
Hae-yi!

933
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,891
SPECIAL THANKS
TO KIM SOO-JIN AND KIM DO-HYUN

934
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,994
So you're a lady of two hearts, Hae-yi?

935
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,037
Do Hae-yi, you must have lost it!

936
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,664
I hate triangles. I can't stand them.

937
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,750
The end-of-semester assignment will be
to go on a date with your partner

938
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,003
-and submit a report on that.
-I don't know.

939
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,088
I don't know what it is that I want!

940
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,965
You'll find out soon.

941
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,717
It'll come to you naturally.

942
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,760
Let's forget all that
and just relax today.

943
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,929
That way, you'll see
how great of a guy I am.

944
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,306
I'm sorry for confusing you.

945
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,517
But could you give me another chance?

946
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,602
It's too late.

947
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:10,231
