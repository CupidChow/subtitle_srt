1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,824
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,326
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,998
A travel package to Jeju is finally here,
just as many of you wanted.

4
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,208
It includes a three-night stay at a hotel
and round-trip flights,

5
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,544
as well as a tour
of the 14 main tourist spots in Jeju.

6
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,254
-You'll also be served lunch…
-Stop!

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,632
No, wait.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,219
I can't ever let my guard down around you.

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,596
It's a special deal.

10
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,514
It's the only chance
to go to Jeju at this price.

11
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,558
So give it back before the offer ends.

12
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,935
We don't have
the money to travel right now.

13
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:01,853
Jae-yi is a senior,

14
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,064
and there's enough expenses
we can't cover.

15
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,149
Why don't you go on a trip like this later

16
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,443
when we have the money?

17
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,737
Later when?

18
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,325
Life is short.

19
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,660
If you keep waiting for the right moment,

20
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,206
it'll be over before
you even get to do anything.

21
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,293
Gosh.

22
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,171
Come on.

23
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,594
Now is really not the time.

24
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:38,014
Why don't you go later
when Jae-yi's done with his CSAT?

25
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,892
Fine. You go and wash up.

26
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,106
I'll leave this here.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,900
I have no need for that now.

28
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,370
LIL BRO

29
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,539
What is it?

30
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,707
Why won't you answer Aunt's call?

31
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,917
She called?

32
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,962
I must've missed it
over an argument with Mom.

33
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,006
Why is Mom so immature?

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,091
Gosh.

35
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,261
Listen carefully and don't be shocked.

36
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,763
What? What is it?

37
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,475
Did you get in trouble again?

38
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,102
Mom…

39
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,355
has breast cancer.

40
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,776
What?

41
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,368
Adjust our training schedule?

42
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,496
But we already adjusted it
to your personal agendas.

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,498
Did something come up?

44
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,669
I might have to work extra hours.

45
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,464
Would there be a way to make it work?

46
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,466
We're doing last-minute
preparations for the big match,

47
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,136
so I can't pardon you from training.

48
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,765
I guess it can't be helped then.

49
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,392
I understand.

50
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,310
Okay.

51
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,989
Hae-yi.

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,242
Get a hold of yourself.

53
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,494
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,789
Let's take a ten-minute break.

55
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,385
-Sleepyhead.
-Huh?

56
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,470
Is something up?

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,808
Yes.

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,602
What is it? What happened?

59
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,772
It's…

60
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,363
I'll tell you later.

61
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,615
Okay.

62
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,243
It's nothing serious, is it?

63
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,966
Didn't you say

64
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,178
you took a leave from school
to earn money for your father's treatment?

65
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,346
I did.

66
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,473
Did it cost you that much money?

67
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,934
There was the surgery, the chemotherapy,

68
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,228
and the living costs
while he was in chemo…

69
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,437
It cost me quite a fortune.

70
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,899
Plus, I was the
sole breadwinner of the house.

71
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,486
The only way you could
make money at that age

72
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,490
was to spend all the time you had working.

73
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,868
But why do you ask?

74
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,164
I was just curious.

75
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,336
Wel--

76
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,716
I won't be off work for a while.

77
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,509
You see…

78
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,761
Surprise!

79
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,890
Today is our 100th-day anniversary.

80
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,101
So I asked Yeong-woong
to let you go early.

81
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,525
Thanks.

82
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,832
SIRLOIN STEAK 60,000 WON
TENDERLOIN STEAK 70,000 WON

83
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,417
STRIPLOIN STEAK 85,000 WON
CHUCK FLAP TAIL STEAK 95,000 WON

84
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,717
Anniversary gift for you.

85
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,722
I didn't get you anything though.

86
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
It's fine.

87
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,100
I just wanted to get you something.

88
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,396
I know you don't like anniversaries,

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,150
so I wanted to gift you
a pleasant memory of one.

90
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,987
Thank you.

91
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,158
I'll buy the meal then.

92
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,745
No. I only did this because I wanted to--

93
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,580
You do everything for us all the time.

94
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,624
Let me do something for us too.

95
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,215
Let me buy this meal.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,300
I'll feel better that way.

97
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,643
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

98
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,568
It's delicious.

99
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,279
Help yourself.

100
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,124
It's so good.

101
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,291
It really is.

102
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,926
I need to use the restroom.

103
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,930
Keep eating.

104
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,897
Can I get the check, please?

105
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,192
The lady you're with
already paid for everything.

106
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,412
You're home.

107
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,998
What about dinner?

108
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,545
I ate.

109
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,964
That's good.

110
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,391
It's all right.

111
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,105
You'll be fine.

112
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,858
If you're sick, we can get you cured.

113
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,240
Gosh.

114
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,744
You're right.

115
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,248
I can just get it treated.

116
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,336
Don't worry, okay?

117
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,175
Okay?

118
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,189
You brat…

119
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,817
It's all right.

120
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,955
Goodness.

121
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,918
I'm not going to die.

122
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,294
You have to stay strong.

123
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,841
I will. Don't you worry.

124
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,766
It's okay.

125
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,769
Don't worry.

126
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,895
My mom…

127
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,272
Don't cry.

128
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,731
…has cancer.

129
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,239
Do you know the first thought

130
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,741
that crossed my mind
when I heard she had cancer?

131
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,997
"How would we afford her surgery?"

132
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,083
"What about living costs?"

133
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,588
Then it hit me.

134
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,091
"Right."

135
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,596
"My mom is sick,
but here I am worrying about money."

136
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,182
"Even when my mom is sick."

137
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,228
I hated myself for that.

138
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,945
When I heard the news, I hated my mom
for putting me in this situation.

139
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,538
It must've been tough.

140
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,833
I didn't even know and I…

141
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,586
Anniversaries and things like that…

142
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,006
You're right.

143
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,092
They're things to be celebrated.

144
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,265
But even after everything you did for me,
you seemed uncomfortable.

145
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,017
That wasn't it. I was just…

146
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,188
I was worried you didn't seem well.

147
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,357
You can't do what you want

148
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,693
without being worried about me.

149
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,448
It'll only get worse from here.

150
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,326
I'll feel more and more sorry.

151
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,122
And things will get even harder to endure.

152
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,999
I never thought that way.

153
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,585
If that's the reason--

154
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,045
It's hard for me.

155
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,433
With the surgery and living costs,

156
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,646
I'll have to earn an extra
two million won every month.

157
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,982
That leaves me with less time.

158
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,985
I'm already busy with work,

159
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,321
so we only get to
see each other briefly at night.

160
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,826
I hate that I can't do anything for you.

161
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,663
But…

162
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:51,377
it's harder to see you worry about me
when you're only giving.

163
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,845
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,766
I really am…

165
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,856
but let's end it here.

166
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,069
I don't have the strength to go on.

167
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,739
I'm not confident that I can do this.

168
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,118
Hae-yi…

169
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,995
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,251
I'm sorry, Jeong-woo.

171
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,570
Hae-yi…

172
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,413
People might think
you've been dumped or something.

173
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,956
Does it show?

174
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,126
Did Hae-yi dump you?

175
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,670
You're rich, aren't you?

176
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,090
Lend me some money.

177
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,051
Did she dump you because you were broke?

178
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,178
Then again, she does like money.

179
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,889
Maybe around 20 million will be enough.

180
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,226
Lend me some money.

181
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,854
Come on, man. Just lend me some.

182
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,440
Did she really dump you for being broke?

183
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,108
I don't even know.

184
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,319
Gosh, I…

185
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,280
What am I doing with a drunk person?

186
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,706
Hae-yi's quitting?

187
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,918
Why all of a sudden?

188
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,922
She had to quit for personal reasons.

189
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,800
What personal reason?

190
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,261
Well…

191
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,266
Hae-yi's mom is sick.

192
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,530
I heard Hae-yi's mom is sick.

193
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,907
I know.

194
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,578
God can be so cruel.

195
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,915
It's not easy raising two children alone.

196
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,710
Why would he add more to that?

197
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,087
Speaking of which,

198
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,590
can't we help out?

199
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,179
Seon-ho.

200
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,267
When it comes to money,

201
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,063
you can't just go sharing it
over something like friendship.

202
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,235
Even bringing that up alone
is crossing the line.

203
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,446
Is it?

204
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,780
Gosh.

205
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,704
Look how kind-hearted you are.

206
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,290
What am I going to do with you?

207
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,607
Is it really that good?

208
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,566
Do you want to try it?

209
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,615
What's wrong?

210
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,575
Nothing.

211
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,119
I was just taken aback
by this scene on TV.

212
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,265
What's this?

213
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
We're going somewhere.

214
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,227
Where?

215
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,814
On our final trip together.

216
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,612
All right, let's go.

217
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,509
I thought about it.

218
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,303
About you wanting to break up.

219
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,641
I don't think
we should break up like this,

220
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,394
but I'd only be
making things harder for you

221
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,646
by asking you not to break up with me.

222
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,319
I wasn't sure what to do.

223
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,866
So I've been thinking,

224
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,119
why don't we just take a break?

225
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,496
-What?
-What I mean is…

226
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,876
that we put our relationship on a hiatus.

227
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,005
-A hiatus?
-Yes.

228
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,673
What on earth…

229
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,092
It's like taking a break from school.

230
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,553
We could do that with our relationship.

231
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,851
But that seems a bit weird.

232
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,899
You never know.

233
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,819
Maybe you'll see that having me around you

234
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,364
is less burdensome and more helpful.

235
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,620
Let's take a break and see how it goes.

236
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,289
If it doesn't work out then, we'll…

237
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,171
I'll stop.

238
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,489
It was still fun being with you.

239
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,407
Was it?

240
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,325
Thanks.

241
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,369
I was happy thanks to you.

242
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,164
Why are you speaking in the past tense?

243
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,919
We still have a bright future ahead of us.

244
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,588
You said this would be our last trip.

245
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,551
It's our last trip as two people dating.

246
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,397
Ji-young.

247
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,526
Will you marry me?

248
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,991
I'm so happy to have met you.

249
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,454
I'm happy but also sad.

250
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm feeling all sorts of feelings.

251
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,334
I finally feel like I'm living life.

252
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,131
That's why…

253
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,677
I never want to let you go.

254
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,721
I feel the same way,

255
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,266
but how am I supposed to accept this?

256
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,185
There.

257
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,232
I'm not asking you to marry me right now.

258
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,067
Think of this…

259
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,196
as a way of me asking you

260
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,951
that we trust each other
and do our best to make things work.

261
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,747
And when the right time comes,

262
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,209
this ring will play its role.

263
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,294
But…

264
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,631
We both took the long and winding path.

265
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,342
Let's not give up so easily

266
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,511
on this love we worked so hard to get.

267
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,440
It fits perfectly.

268
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,026
I can't take it off now.

269
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,949
Thanks for saying
that you'll try to make it work.

270
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,041
We broke up.

271
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,252
Why?

272
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,545
It just happened.

273
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,758
Because of me?

274
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,343
It wasn't because of you.

275
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,137
You don't wield
that much influence over my life.

276
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,894
I won't get to see him much
once I take a break from school.

277
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,604
That's why I broke up with him.

278
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,317
Why would you take time off school?

279
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,821
Even if we had enough for surgery,

280
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,073
you'd still need to get chemotherapy.

281
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,367
Someone needs to make a living.

282
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,786
I've decided to go full-time
on my part-time jobs.

283
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,912
Don't worry.

284
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,123
You worked so hard to get in the school.

285
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,083
Why would you take a break
over something like this?

286
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,793
I'm not quitting school.

287
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,838
I'm just taking a little break.
Don't worry about it.

288
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,215
Cut the nonsense and withdraw the leave.

289
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,925
I'll manage to make ends meet--

290
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,218
Stop it.

291
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,263
Just think about getting better.

292
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,557
I'll take care of everything.

293
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,309
You're only twenty.

294
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,478
Why would you take care of everything?

295
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,149
Why would you take
responsibility for everything?

296
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,818
What else can we do?

297
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,862
There's no other way.

298
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,907
I'll find a way to manage somehow.

299
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,826
Okay?

300
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,664
I'll do my best
not to burden you and Jae-yi.

301
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,250
Got it?

302
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,171
Just stay in school. Okay?

303
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:32,994
Who are you?

304
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,918
Soo-il.

305
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:08,989
Hello?

306
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,700
It's me, Soo-il.

307
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,124
STUDENT AFFAIRS

308
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,296
LEAVE OF ABSENCE REQUEST FORM

309
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,132
The documents look good,
so your leave will be granted.

310
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,800
Okay. Thank you.

311
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,731
You lose if you don't play.

312
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,940
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

313
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,108
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

314
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,693
-No way! Again.
-Darn it.

315
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,153
-Again?
-Let's go.

316
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,863
You lose if you don't play.
Rock, paper, scissors!

317
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,006
Jin-il did that?

318
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,300
I can't believe Jin-il did that.

319
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,552
Did he get arrested?

320
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,138
He's still on the run.

321
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,267
He was last located
at the express bus terminal.

322
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,020
So they assume he's already left Seoul.

323
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,731
But we should still be cautious.

324
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,983
Call the police if you ever see Jin-il.

325
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,615
Shouldn't we warn Hae-yi?

326
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,533
He's been after her all this time--

327
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,827
He's a total psychopath.

328
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,082
Hae-yi has it hard enough as it is.
Why'd he have to add to it?

329
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,044
I'll talk to Hae-yi about it.

330
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,880
The police said
they'll be keeping an eye out

331
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,675
to see if Jin-il comes after her again,

332
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,760
so don't worry too much.

333
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,142
You must be shocked.

334
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:13,029
Why did Jin-il target me of all people?

335
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,157
No matter what he has to say,

336
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,493
he'd never be forgiven for what he did.

337
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,705
The teammates and I'll take turns
walking you home after your shift

338
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,623
until Jin-il is arrested.

339
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,624
What?

340
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,876
Everyone is worried.

341
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,796
I am too.

342
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,882
I'm fine though.

343
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,844
It'll only be for a while,
so let's do that.

344
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,847
All right.

345
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,473
One more thing.

346
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,232
-Here.
-What's this?

347
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,485
Did you make these yourself?

348
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:54,946
Yes.

349
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,243
I can do this much
as your leader, can't I?

350
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,246
You made me gimbap as the leader?

351
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,581
Yes. Well…

352
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,417
Making snacks for my teammates
isn't a big deal.

353
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,004
It wouldn't be right to discriminate
just because you're a former member.

354
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,302
Thanks.

355
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,975
-Let's go together. Good.
-Okay.

356
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,560
It'll be like a double date.

357
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,063
-What are you saying?
-It's not bad, is it?

358
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,775
-Do you like gopchang?
-I do.

359
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,984
-Great!
-Come with us.

360
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,736
-Really? Sure.
-Yes.

361
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,529
-Ask Hyeok-jun.
-Yeah, I'll do that.

362
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,865
-Hi.
-Hey.

363
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,118
-You can sit with Hyeok-jun.
-Then I'll call you guys later.

364
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,496
-Later?
-Later.

365
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,623
-Later when?
-I want to go now.

366
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,213
What do you want?

367
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,091
Let me walk you home.

368
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,801
You? Walk me home?

369
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,178
What for?

370
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,763
You see, I have to go…

371
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,099
I mean, it's on my way.

372
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,226
And I have to go with you
if it's on your way?

373
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,103
Not exactly, but…

374
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,146
Exactly. I don't have to.

375
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,150
Plus, it seemed like you had
plenty of people to go home with.

376
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,746
Sleepyhead! I'm here.

377
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,167
You seem disappointed it wasn't Jeong-woo.

378
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,460
No, not at all.

379
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,921
He had a meeting, so I came instead.

380
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:35,964
It'll be me

381
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,215
taking you home tonight!

382
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,385
Let's go.

383
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:46,182
I don't think
you'd be helping all that much.

384
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,102
How are things going with Min-jae lately?

385
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,354
Don't even bring that jerk up.

386
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,398
I didn't know he was so CAG.

387
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,441
"CAG"?

388
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,817
Crazy about girls.

389
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,279
Min-jae is?

390
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,030
That's nonsense.

391
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,616
Girl, what would you know

392
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,328
when you're on a so-called "hiatus"
with your boyfriend?

393
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,582
You say you're on a break,
but seeing you two together…

394
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,000
Goodness.

395
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,379
We're not on a break.

396
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,132
That's just what Jeong-woo calls it.

397
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,969
We've broken up.

398
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,065
Sleepyhead.

399
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,401
Are you all right?

400
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,864
Why wouldn't I be?

401
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,365
I should be fine.

402
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,454
At times…

403
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,626
I think you're really amazing.

404
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,755
You seem so… mature, shall I say?

405
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,008
But I don't think

406
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,637
you should grow up too fast.

407
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,014
Then you'd be…

408
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,726
way too lonely.

409
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,150
Why don't you let me spoil you at times
so we can keep on the same pace?

410
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,368
It's tough.

411
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,545
It's…

412
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,181
It's actually been really hard.

413
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,818
Don't worry.

414
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,779
Things will be all right.

415
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,866
Right.

416
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,326
Things will be just fine.

-It's so heavy.
-What are you complaining about?

419
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,316
Hurry. Get a move on.

420
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,484
There's still some left, right?

421
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,322
Keep that up and I'll blow you up.

422
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,656
Please don't.

423
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,369
Let's move quickly, everyone.

424
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,372
-Quickly.
-Quickly.

425
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,376
Cho-hui really is something.

426
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,503
This really did lighten the mood.

427
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,673
I think they needed
something else to focus on.

428
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,301
Right. But is Jin-il still on the run?

429
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,640
I can't believe him.

430
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,225
He's managed to
evade the police this long.

431
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,852
Where on earth is he hiding?

Another bottle of soju
for this table, please!

438
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,123
Positions!

439
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,459
I never thought
I'd ever be serving at a pub.

440
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,677
Woon-chan.

441
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,847
-Woon-chan. Woon-chan!
-Yes?

442
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,807
-What are you doing?
-I'm done.

443
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,142
-Can I take them?
-Yes.

444
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,562
-To that table.
-I know, I know.

445
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,150
Here's your beer.

446
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,986
-Hey, guys.
-There you are.

447
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,572
-What are you having?
-Egg rolls.

448
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,949
Egg rolls? You've got to be kidding me.

449
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,826
Have the gopchang stir-fry.
That's the most expensive.

450
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,662
But I don't really eat gopchang…

451
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,706
-Stop forcing people.
-Okay.

452
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,833
-Hello.
-Hello.

453
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,168
Just have what you want.

454
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,420
Then I'll have an egg roll.

455
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,504
One egg roll.

456
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,506
I'll have some peaches, please.

457
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,467
-I'll be right out with your order.
-Thank you.

458
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,135
-Over here.
-Yes?

459
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,804
Are you sure you don't want to
go on a blind date?

460
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,805
I'm certain!

461
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,017
I don't intend on dating anyone
for the time being!

462
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,477
"For the time being"?

463
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,021
You've never dated anyone in your life.

464
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,314
Quiet.

465
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:32,487
I plan on staying single
for another two years, at the least.

466
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,240
Yong-il. I'd be glad
if it was just two years.

467
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,659
You could end up staying single
for 20 years at this rate.

468
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,537
-Or perhaps even 30.
-Cut it out.

469
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,915
-I'll get them ready for you.
-Thank you.

470
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,588
I really hope it isn't for 20 years.

471
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,807
Hey, you're here.

472
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,725
-Hey.
-Put this on. We're so busy.

473
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,977
The group reservation
was for Theia's One-Day Bar?

474
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,979
Sleepyhead. We've got dishes to wash.

475
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,147
-Let's go.
-Right.

476
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,857
Oh, and have the glasses ready too.

477
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,067
Okay.

478
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,988
What happened is--

479
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,074
It's fine. I'm here to work anyway.

480
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,952
-Hi, Hae-yi.
-Hello.

481
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,537
-There you are, Hae-yi.
-Hey.

482
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,665
-Hello.
-Hey, you're here.

483
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,428
Can you wash these too?

484
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,513
Sure.

485
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,016
I should since I'm getting paid.

486
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,270
You don't like that we're doing this
at your workplace, right?

487
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,438
No. I'm totally fine with it.

488
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,984
You can't just cancel events
just because I've left the squad.

489
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,155
When was this confirmed though?

490
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,158
I didn't think you'd proceed with it
with everything that's happened.

491
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,077
We needed help from our seniors.

492
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,329
Why? Are you short on funds?

493
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,499
Right.

494
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,751
It's none of my business.

495
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,256
Gosh. There seems to be no end.

496
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,553
I was just saying.

497
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,598
This is part of my job,
so you don't need to worry.

498
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,224
Speaking of which…

499
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,644
here's more.

500
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,273
You really don't care, do you?

501
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,401
I'll get some more for you.

502
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,451
ONE-DAY BAR

503
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,036
I'm just going to say it.

504
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,580
-I'm going to say it.
-Go on then.

505
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:51,250
Our senior Park Yun-ho's company

506
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,712
has decided to support us
with sports drinks.

507
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,756
Yun-ho, you rock!

508
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,966
-Park Yun-ho!
-Hooray!

509
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,968
-Park Yun-ho!
-Hooray!

510
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,387
-Park Yun-ho!
-Hooray!

511
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,097
-Park Yun-ho!
-Park Yun-ho!

512
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,850
You've all worked so hard.

513
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,560
Theia!

514
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,938
-Theia!
-Theia!

515
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,288
SEON-JA

516
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,707
She could just come and find me.
Why call me?

517
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,919
What is it?

518
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,630
Sleepyhead. I'm in the restroom
and out of toilet paper.

519
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,854
Thank you, Sleepyhead.

520
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,940
That was a close one.

521
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,901
Did you have to make me
get you toilet paper too?

522
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,200
Where is everyone?

523
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,208
What is the cheering squad to you?

524
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,880
A playground where we all play together.

525
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,173
My source of energy.

526
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,591
My happiest dream and…

527
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,552
-My youth?
-My youthful spirit.

528
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,139
A challenge that I don't regret taking on.

529
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,933
One of the goals I had
for my college life.

530
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,851
Family.

531
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:36,022
Something that makes your heart fire up.

532
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,482
It fills me with fiery passion.
Maybe I went too far.

533
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,736
Something I want to
wrap up well this year.

534
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,323
A blessing that
I unintentionally came across.

535
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,908
What is Do Hae-yi to you?

536
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,037
A cute and lively friend.

537
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,457
Someone who's bright and smiley.

538
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,001
Someone with the bravery I admire.

539
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,961
A friend who feels grown up.

540
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,923
I have a lot to thank her for
and a lot to apologize for.

541
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,511
I admire her
for how hardworking she always is

542
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,097
and how she always remains positive.

543
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,145
The first girl I've had a crush on.

544
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,482
Someone who can console me
just by being there

545
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,567
and without having to say a word.

546
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,070
Someone strong.

547
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,489
Anything you want to say to Hae-yi?

548
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,157
Hae-yi.

549
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,409
I admire you.

550
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,495
Enjoy your twenties.

551
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,871
Gather your strength and keep going!

552
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:38,042
Being on the squad can be tough,
but do your best to hold on

553
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,669
so we can tear the roof off the stage
next year together.

554
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,550
As I've written in the letter
we wrote to you,

555
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,178
a flower can grow
even after a typhoon has passed.

556
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,140
No matter how tough life treats you,

557
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,767
I hope you'll blossom beautifully.

558
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,062
I'll always be there for you

559
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,940
no matter what path you walk,

560
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,569
so don't ever hesitate to tell me
if you're having a hard time.

561
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,864
I'll always be by your side. I love you.

562
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:14,703
I just hope that you don't ever
lose your smile.

563
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,082
Even a single cream bun
was enough to make you happy.

564
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,837
I want you to keep smiling
over the smallest things,

565
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,381
being cheerful as ever.

566
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:31,137
You'll always be happy
in the days to come.

567
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,433
Look over here, Sleepyhead.

568
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,060
Our long-awaited twenties are here.

569
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,689
How does it feel to start your twenties?

570
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,070
You have an incredibly fun
and radiant future ahead of you,

571
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,948
and you're amazing
to have experienced it all.

572
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,949
What was that?

573
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,243
Is that a message for your future self?

574
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,622
I think it's going to be so much fun.
How are you doing in the future?

575
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,166
I hope you're not crying.

576
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,430
-Cheer up, Hae-yi!
-Cheer up, Hae-yi!

577
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,683
-We'll always be with you.
-We'll always be with you.

578
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,288
Stay strong, Hae-yi.

579
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,779
-Our!
-Our!

580
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,739
-Shout!
-Shout!

581
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,951
-Will become one!
-Will become one!

582
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,127
Hae-yi.

583
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,754
Let's do it together.

584
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,283
When did you prepare all this?

585
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,200
Come here.

586
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,623
Surprise!

587
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,047
This is the profit from the one-day bar.

588
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,509
They said they wanted to

589
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,388
help you pay for your mother's treatment.

590
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,182
I've added a little
to the amount they put together.

591
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,559
No, I can't take this.

592
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,477
Take it.

593
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,437
You should for our sake.

594
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,983
When someone offers you help, accept it.

595
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,653
And pay it back later.

596
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,739
You can do that.

597
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:05,577
It's fine. That's how life is.

598
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,205
But I can't just keep receiving things.

599
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,332
Here's what I've learned in life.

600
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,004
You can never live life

601
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,591
giving back the exact amount
you owe others.

602
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,718
It doesn't work that way.

603
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,307
It's okay to keep receiving, Hae-yi.

604
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,395
Just be thankful.

605
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,191
And you can start giving later
when you are able to

606
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,027
to whoever is in need.

607
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,072
That's what you should do.

608
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,137
Thank you.

609
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,269
Gosh, I feel so grown-up today.

610
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:16,398
I bet you must be surprised
by how mature I can be.

611
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,318
Not really.

612
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,488
You're not?

613
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,720
I tried to do it by myself,

614
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,973
but I've ended up getting help from you.

615
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,768
I'm just glad

616
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,437
that we could help.

617
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,441
Don't you hate me even a little?

618
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,986
I asked to break up
because of my personal issues.

619
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,782
Remember how you asked me in Busan

620
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,285
if I was ever lonely?

621
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,663
Were you lonely?

622
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,960
I was a little less lonely
since I had Jae-yi.

623
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,837
But I thought you could have been lonely

624
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,590
since you were all alone.

625
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,474
It was okay.

626
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,395
I really thought I was okay back then

627
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,483
since I didn't know what it was like
to be with someone.

628
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,401
But…

629
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,988
ever since I met you

630
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,908
and learned what it's like

631
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,370
to be with someone, I realized…

632
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,875
that if I was in that situation now,

633
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,046
I would have found it lonely.

634
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,675
So…

635
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,305
I thought you'd feel the same.

636
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,725
That's why I wanted to be by your side.

637
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,894
So that you could lean on me
when you needed to.

638
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,856
So that you wouldn't be lonely.

639
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,533
Let me be by your side.

640
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,246
Wouldn't it be better
to go through it together?

641
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,901
Thank you.

642
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,328
I AM FOREVER YOUR STUCK-UP GEEZER

643
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,127
What's this?

644
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,713
I had this on all day today.

645
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,470
You're unbelievable.

646
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,349
You're so annoying!

647
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,854
Thank you.

648
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,028
I was right.

649
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,572
We really need Sleepyhead in the squad.

650
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,783
I know, right?

651
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,745
-What the…
-Let me help you with that.

652
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,667
I'll do it.

653
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,296
Are you upset with me?

654
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,673
No. Why would I be?

655
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,007
It seems like it.

656
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,093
Not at all. Why would I be upset with you?

657
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,886
It's not like we're anything.

658
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,722
Let me walk you home later.

659
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,224
I have business nearby.

660
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,601
You keep saying
that you have business nearby.

661
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,688
Did you hide some treasure
near my place or something? Forget it.

662
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,316
It's dangerous.
With Jin-il still being at large and all.

663
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:37,826
Are you perhaps worried about me?

664
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,454
Yes.

665
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,872
Why would you worry about me?

666
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:46,126
It's not like I'm the only girl
in the cheering squad.

667
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,045
Why would you be
worried about me specifically?

668
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,839
I…

669
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,176
like you, Seon-ja.

670
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,320
You've dated before, haven't you?

671
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,780
You're a total player.

672
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,490
What?

673
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,702
If you ever flirt with anyone like that,
I won't let it slide.

674
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:27,793
You better save it for just me
from now on, okay?

675
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,880
Okay.

676
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,090
Let's go.

677
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,179
Then what does that make us?

678
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,890
We're a couple now.

679
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,986
Do you want to come over
for some ramyeon later?

680
00:51:55,737 --> 00:52:00,534
Gosh, my mom ought to cook
a whole chicken to treat her son-in-law.

681
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,828
I wonder if we have any chicken at home.

682
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,249
What is it?

683
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,252
-It's nothing. Let's go.
-Okay.

684
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,183
-What about Hae-yi?
-She went to the restroom.

685
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,272
What?

686
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,481
Well…

687
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,234
I saw someone suspicious outside.

688
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,820
It can't be Jin-il, can it?

689
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,698
She wasn't in the restroom.

690
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:47,789
Everyone come outside!

691
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,668
Call me as soon as you find her!

692
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,794
-Okay.
-Let's go!

693
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,301
-Hae-yi!
-Hae-yi!

694
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,760
Hae-yi!

695
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,223
-We'll go that way.
-Okay.

696
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,078
Mom.

697
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,748
I'll be late today. Don't wait up for me.

698
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,208
Okay.

699
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:40,842
Hae-yi.

700
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,394
Hae-yi!

701
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:53,647
Hae-yi!

702
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,358
Sleepyhead!

703
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,986
-Where did she go? Sleepyhead!
-Hae-yi!

704
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,154
Hae-yi!

705
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,576
She wasn't over there.

706
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,038
-Keep looking.
-Okay.

707
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:18,964
Please…

708
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,928
Why are you doing this?

709
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,931
This is all because of you.

710
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,350
What did I do that was so wrong?

711
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,102
You made all of this happen!

712
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,402
It's because of you
that we've come to this.

713
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,655
If we manage to get Do Hae-yi onboard,

714
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,951
we'll have all the freshmen
lining up to join us.

715
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,997
We need to recruit her,

716
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,124
the Pied Piper of Yonhee.

717
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,920
I'll pay you an extra 10%
if you go on stage.

718
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,881
Add that to our contract.

719
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,594
I prepared this specially for you.

720
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,679
Try it with this.

721
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,321
It's all your fault.

722
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,073
It's all your fault, Do Hae-yi.

723
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,575
It's all your fault.

724
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,578
He's a total psychopath.

725
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,164
Let's help her forget everything
that psychopath did to her.

726
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,458
It's all your fault.

727
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,554
You're scared too, aren't you?

728
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,726
You never wanted things
to get this out of hand.

729
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,731
So please put down that knife--

730
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,525
Shut up!

731
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,246
All of this…

732
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,460
will only end once you die.

733
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,654
Are you okay, Hae-yi?

734
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,093
Run, Hae-yi.

735
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,653
Are you okay, Jeong-woo?

736
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,368
No.

737
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:23,541
No!

738
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,668
No…

739
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,589
No, you can't get hurt…

740
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,678
Please stay with me.

741
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,696
Altair.

742
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,714
Everyone will be shocked
by what's happened.

743
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,258
The school's going to take precautions
not to upset the students any further.

744
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,926
I'm glad you weren't hurt

745
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,803
and that I was able to
protect you this time.

746
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,055
Everyone. We're going on standby.

747
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,141
I think I finally get it,

748
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,768
why people join the cheering squad.

749
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:13,651
