1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,866
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,410
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,429
How adorable!

4
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,564
That's my girl!

5
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,083
She's so good.

6
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,212
INCOMING CALL

7
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,275
Mom.

8
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,235
Mom.

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,611
Mom!

10
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,697
Mom!

11
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,740
Mom!

12
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,243
Mom!

13
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:41,911
Mom!

14
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,957
What is it, Hae-yi?

15
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,460
Were you talking in your sleep?

16
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,379
Is that marinated crab?

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,093
But we still have the ones
you ordered last time in the fridge.

18
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,344
Well…

19
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,264
This one is so plump.

20
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,308
This isn't your ordinary marinated crab.

21
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,018
We still have the gas bills to pay.

22
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,477
And we have to pay Jae-yi's tuition too.

23
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,521
Don't even think about
touching my marinated crabs.

24
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,983
Jae-yi and I are going to
have them all to ourselves.

25
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,319
Well, you better finish all of it.

26
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,322
I can't believe how sweet these taste.

27
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,742
It tastes like honey.

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,869
How much did she spend on that?

29
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,167
GAS BILL FOR MARCH 2019
PAYMENT DUE 358,759 WON

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,463
TUITION FEE INSTALLMENTS
TOTAL 5,682,000 WON

31
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,215
What will I do about my tuition fee?

32
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,768
Even when I worked myself to the bone,
all I could do was barely get by.

33
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,978
Enjoying campus life was a luxury for me.

34
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,240
That's why

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,867
I was excited
about the chance I was given,

36
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,037
although it was purely coincidental.

37
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,123
YONHEE UNIVERSITY
CHEERING SQUAD

38
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,539
I heard a rumor that a member
will end up dying this year.

39
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,665
Is this true?

40
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,171
Yes. It's true.

41
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,674
-What?
-That's frightening.

42
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,883
Someone will die?

43
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,012
Just as the many legends
that this school has,

44
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,930
the cheering squad
also has a superstition.

45
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,348
One of those superstitions is

46
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,101
that an active member
will end up dying this year.

47
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,645
They say the
first two prophecies came true.

48
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,690
Whether you choose to
believe it or not is up to you.

49
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,950
How about we do a quick warm-up training
and go somewhere to introduce ourselves?

50
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,410
Move. Let's move it.

51
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,870
To the left. Get moving.

52
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,371
-Training…
-Let's go.

53
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,083
Come on. Let's get moving.

54
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,003
Let's go. Hurry.

55
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,758
-Yonhee
-Yonhee

56
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,136
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,889
-You are my love
-Keep it up.

58
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,726
-In my heart forever
-In my heart forever

59
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,019
Keep it up.

60
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,814
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,399
15 LAPS AROUND THE FIELD

62
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,485
-One, two, three. Twelve.
-One, two, three. Twelve.

63
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,403
-One, two, three. Thirteen.
-One, two, three. Thirteen.

64
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,447
-One, two, three. Fourteen.
-One, two, three. Fourteen.

65
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,157
-One, two, three.
-Fifteen!

66
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,037
Love your peers, love your country.
Let's do a lap.

67
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,539
I think it's too early
for me to love anything.

68
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,999
Can't we take things slow?

69
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,501
Get ready to run a full lap.

70
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,921
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

71
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,423
-We are…
-We are…

72
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,758
Hold your positions.

73
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,012
SIDE PLANK 10 SETS, 100 PUSHUPS
100 LUNGES, 100 SQUATS, INTERVAL 10 SETS

74
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,263
-I love you…
-I love you…

75
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,181
-Thirteen.
-Thirteen.

76
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,643
Another lap, go.

77
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,019
One, two, three.

78
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,896
We'll begin the core exercises.

79
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,316
You can do it. Keep at it.

80
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,485
This is insane.

81
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,237
TRAINING ORIENTATION

82
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,448
I'm beat.

83
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,200
We'll go have lunch now.

84
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,996
My mom called me and said
she cooked bulgogi for me.

85
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,915
I need to go and eat at home.

86
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,210
His mom asked me to come as well.
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,633
You should still eat before you go.

88
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,470
At this rate, I'll end up dying
before I enjoy anything.

89
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
Are you going to hold out?

90
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,560
What?

91
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,438
A million won for one month.

92
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:20,898
Yes.

93
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,525
Okay.

94
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,989
Do Hae-yi looks like a major nutcase.

95
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,616
We'll have a hard time keeping
the freshmen in line at this rate.

96
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,706
Jeong-woo. Should we
kick some sense into them?

97
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,791
You worry about yourself.

98
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,837
CHEERS

99
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,797
-Who's up for a drink?
-Wait for me.

100
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,341
-Get inside.
-Okay.

101
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,343
Gosh, I'm too tired to climb stairs.

102
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,596
Come on. Go upstairs.

103
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,598
-What floor?
-Second floor.

104
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,183
The second floor?
I thought it was the fourth floor.

105
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,435
It's on the second floor.
Just keep moving.

106
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,061
-Don't they have an elevator here?
-Keep going.

107
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,605
Have a seat over there.

108
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,316
Come all the way in.

109
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,360
Welcome, party people.

110
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,154
-Hey.
-Hi.

111
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,614
Come on in.

112
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,907
We've finally made it.

113
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,409
Attention, everyone.

114
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,620
THE THREE DON'TS

115
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,289
Freshmen have three things
they're forbidden from doing.

116
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,790
Number one.

117
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,251
Do not enter the leader's office.

118
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,421
The leader's office is where our uniforms
and classified documents are stored,

119
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,756
so no freshmen are allowed.

120
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,174
Where's that supposed to be?

121
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,009
-I have no idea.
-Number two.

122
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,720
Do not wear cheering uniforms.

123
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,014
Uniforms are considered sacred
to the cheering squad.

124
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,892
Freshmen are forbidden from wearing
and looking at a uniform

125
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,061
until they become official members.

126
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,230
I've already seen it.

127
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,689
Yes, so it's starting now.

128
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,399
What is this? Some sort of cult?

129
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,944
-Theimen!
-Don't take His name in vain.

130
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,320
Quiet down.

131
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,948
We'll move on to number three.

132
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,077
No dating among squad members.

133
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,747
Dating other members
is the root of various issues,

134
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,374
so it is not allowed. Never!

135
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,417
What happens if we break that rule?

136
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,254
You'll have to quit.

137
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,881
You'll be kicked out.

138
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:15,096
I'd like to thank all the freshmen
who have gathered here today.

139
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,890
Let's make a toast
to celebrate our meeting. To Theia!

140
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,183
-Theia!
-Theia!

141
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,853
-Bottoms up!
-Drink until we pass out!

142
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,647
We'll drink like there's no tomorrow.

143
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,527
By the way, aren't you worried
about the three prophecies?

144
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,237
One of us might die.

145
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,494
I told you earlier, but it's up to you
whether to believe it or not.

146
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,746
I don't believe in superstitions.

147
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,998
Right?

148
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,208
An accident won't break out
at a place like this, right?

149
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,302
Come on. Anything that's old enough

150
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,596
has some sort of a story
that goes along with it.

151
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,557
It's not a pleasant thing to talk about.

152
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,726
Let's not bring it up outside.

153
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,019
-Okay.
-Okay.

154
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,523
-Come on. Let's drink.
-Cheers.

155
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,235
-This is the 21st century!
-Cheers to new times!

156
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,740
That's it!

157
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,867
PLEASE PICK UP MY LAUNDRY
5,200 WON, MISSION DUE IN 30 MINUTES

158
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,493
-You're so good.
-Seriously.

159
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,411
ACCEPT MISSION

160
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,414
-I need to go.
-Okay.

161
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,044
Who's up next?

162
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,920
-Who is it?
-It's your turn.

163
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,173
-Come on.
-Let's go.

164
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,011
Are you leaving?

165
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,057
Yes.

166
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,266
I'm allowed to go, right?

167
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,979
About the cheering squad…

168
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,607
Yes.

169
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,610
-Why did you join the cheering squad?
-Sorry?

170
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,236
I told you during the audition.

171
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,448
I applied because I thought
it'd be a valuable experience

172
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,825
to have in college…

173
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,913
Why do you ask, all of a sudden?

174
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,792
As you've seen today,
we're quite strict with our rules.

175
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,128
Think carefully
whether you'll be cut out for it.

176
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,925
Are you perhaps asking me to quit?

177
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,842
No.

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,553
Like I said, just think about it.

179
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,394
Jeong-woo.

180
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,314
Are you sulking?

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,234
So that's the kind of person you are.

182
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,735
You're the authoritative type.

183
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,278
-What?
-Okay.

184
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,572
I'll see you at the next training then.

185
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,783
Theia.

186
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,577
What a stuck-up geezer.

187
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,836
Calm yourself.

188
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,921
This is your job as a leader.

189
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,511
There's a rumor
that someone is going to die.

190
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,138
And they have so many rules.

191
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,640
Even the library in high school
didn't have that many rules.

192
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,101
Be quiet. I missed the line.

193
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,104
Don't mothers usually ask for more

194
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,232
when their daughters
tell them about their day?

195
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,068
Right. You should quit.
That place is weird.

196
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,239
Nothing's ever easy
when you get paid to do it.

197
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,783
Gosh, this is hilarious.

198
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,168
I'm home.

199
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,377
You're home.

200
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,629
Give it here.

201
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,592
Hand over your mock exam results.

202
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,728
GIYEONG HIGH SCHOOL
MATH, PERCENTILE RANK 95.83, FIRST RANK

203
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,646
Your math percentile rank has dropped.

204
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,982
I haven't gone through
the math book entirely yet.

205
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,819
-I'll raise it by the next exam.
-Hey, let me take a look.

206
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,239
He's got first rank in everything.

207
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,408
Why are you so harsh on him?

208
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,495
You did well, Jae-yi. Great job.

209
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,748
Didn't you want to go to med school?

210
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,210
-When did I say that?
-Jong-yeol told me

211
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,754
that you're going into engineering
since med school is too expensive.

212
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,465
-You should aim for med school.
-I'll take care of it.

213
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,426
Why won't you aim for med school
when you have the grades?

214
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,762
Think of the big picture.

215
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,514
You'll be much better off being a doctor.

216
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,432
It's all about money to you.

217
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,351
Isn't money the reason
you want to go to med school?

218
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,853
Med school it is. End of story.

219
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,690
Whether you give up or fail,
I won't let you be either way.

220
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,194
I'll sign you up for math classes
starting next month, so no complaints.

221
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,908
Answer me!

222
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,619
That rude brat.

223
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,186
An accident won't break out
at a place like this, right?

224
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,717
YU-MIN

225
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO VANISH LIKE THIS?

226
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,636
I'VE BEEN APPOINTED THE NEW LEADER

227
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,939
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY ORIENTATION

228
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,030
My body aches.

229
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,116
Hello.

230
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,537
Hello.

231
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:25,966
Hi.

232
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,010
How are you all right?

233
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,305
Never mind.

234
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,562
Come see me when you have the time.

235
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,273
STUDENT AFFAIRS

236
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,399
I'm sorry?

237
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,986
Why would we discuss the festival
with the student council?

238
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,573
Nothing's been decided yet.
We'll just discuss the matter with them.

239
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,283
Exactly. For what?

240
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,035
We've been doing this for 50 years.

241
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,454
Jeong-woo.

242
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,792
You may think it's unfair,
but that's just how life is.

243
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,710
Do you know what the school
thinks of you guys?

244
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,671
There isn't anyone who'll take your side.

245
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,423
So don't waste your emotional energy

246
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,467
and try to come up
with a solution instead.

247
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,517
And take special care
in preparing the joint cheering event.

248
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,561
The president seems to be
leaning toward the student council.

249
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,442
We've been doing everything
from printing tickets,

250
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,779
inviting guests, setting up the tents,
to hanging the banners.

251
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,864
And they're just going to
take that away from us?

252
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,325
We need to do a good job
in the joint cheering event

253
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,785
to turn students' opinions around.

254
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,078
But…

255
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,165
won't we need
at least six people on stage?

256
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,887
Everybody scream!

257
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,932
That's so cool.

258
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,729
The joint cheering event
is to teach the students our cheers

259
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,522
in preparation
for the Yonhee-Hokyung competition.

260
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,774
It's an annual event with
Hokyung University early in the semester.

261
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,318
You could say that it's a competition.

262
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,950
Do you know
what's most important in a fight?

263
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
It's making the first move.

264
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,872
Joint cheers are the same.

265
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,457
Honestly speaking,

266
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,418
this is our first official battle
against Hokyung University.

267
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,004
So we need to make our first move right

268
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,964
in order to show them what we're made of.

269
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,893
Hokyung's cheering squad this year
is said to be at their strongest.

270
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,146
-Step out onto the field
-Step out onto the field

271
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,691
-And you shall roar
-And you shall roar

272
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,111
-It will become
-It will become

273
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,447
-The everlasting rhythm of the nation
-The everlasting rhythm of the nation

274
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,282
-One more time!
-One more time!

275
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,825
We'll…

276
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,042
I guess we'll just do our very best.

277
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,921
We'll choose two new members
to join us on stage this year.

278
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,547
The audition will be this Friday.

279
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,217
You'll learn of the test
on the day of the audition.

280
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,305
The joint cheer looked amazing,
even on video.

281
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,848
It'll be even better
if we make it on the stage.

282
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,559
We're having a hard time as it is now.

283
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,561
How much harder
will they work us for that?

284
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,189
That's a no for me.

285
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,774
Then are you out?

286
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,026
-Yes.
-Okay. That's one less competition.

287
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,365
EMPLOYER

288
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,453
Hello?

289
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,291
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

290
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,209
Have a drink.

291
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,794
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

292
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,506
About the joint cheer.

293
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,424
No, I'm not doing it.

294
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,009
Things are hard enough as they are.

295
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,054
Sure. Eat up. We'll talk later.

296
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,854
-Why are you doing this?
-What do you mean?

297
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,647
You're meddling
in the cheering squad's affairs

298
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,315
and even paying me to join it.

299
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,734
Are you rich?

300
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,702
These days, the members and the seniors
vote to elect the leader.

301
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,998
But there was this one time
when the leader was elected differently.

302
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,501
The rule was that the person
who received the most responses

303
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,963
with the choreography they made
would become the leader.

304
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,134
2005 YONHEE UNIVERSITY
CHEERING SQUAD LEADER ELECTION

305
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,260
Yonhee!

306
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,220
One! Two!

307
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,097
Stand up!

308
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,565
All other candidates
lacked responses from the audience.

309
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,733
But…

310
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,153
this one candidate was special.

311
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,243
Yonhee!

312
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:05,829
Wave!

313
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,249
Go!

314
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,052
Yonhee!

315
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:25,933
Stand up!

316
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,156
The "Yonhee Stand Up" move
that lives to this day

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,368
was created by the leader
of the 34th recruits then.

318
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,163
He became a chapter
in the cheering squad's history.

319
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,292
That was my heyday.

320
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,379
What?

321
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,005
Were you boasting about yourself?

322
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,090
You.

323
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,301
Don't you want to become
a new chapter in history?

324
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,053
What is he saying?

325
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,808
Mister. You're just lingering in the past.

326
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,560
People need to look to the future
and move forward.

327
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,981
I'd say it's better
than having nothing to linger over.

328
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,571
How often do you think you'll get
such an opportunity in your lifetime?

329
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,283
Never.

330
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,952
This is something
you need to do while you still can.

331
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,372
You can't live life
doing everything you want.

332
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,666
It won't do you any harm to give it a try.

333
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,042
You only just turned twenty.

334
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,967
That's why there's
no talking to rich people.

335
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:48,015
I'll pay you an extra 10%
if you go on stage.

336
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,021
Come on. That's too little
for the effort I'll need to put in.

337
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,939
I'll make it 20% then.

338
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,785
Add that to our contract.

339
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,123
I will if you actually make it.

340
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,876
Of course, I will.

341
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,504
I think I'll become rich
from being hungry.

342
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,676
The kimchi fried rice here is amazing.

343
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,512
My advice is that
you need to eat a lot of meat.

344
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,681
-It's got a lot of protein.
-Hey, Min-jae.

345
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,016
What are you doing? Come and sit down.

346
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,462
We need to talk.

347
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,384
Gosh. She's unbelievable.

348
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,682
Why did you do that?

349
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,769
Breaking up with me
after going off the grid for two weeks.

350
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,562
Do you know how flustered I was?

351
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,858
We were going to break up anyway.

352
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,862
I heard you talking to Yeong-jun.

353
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,406
But why does Do Hae-yi work so much?

354
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,324
She's just…

355
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,952
too much for me to handle.

356
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,579
I didn't mean it.

357
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,999
It was something I just blurted out.

358
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,585
No. You meant it.

359
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,464
I saw how shocked you were
when you first saw my place.

360
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,883
I pretended not to notice
because I was embarrassed.

361
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,260
You've got it all wrong.

362
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,928
Never mind it.

363
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,097
I get that people don't like poverty.
I hate it too.

364
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,184
I hear I've put you in a tough spot
in your department.

365
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,061
Sorry about that.

366
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,189
Let's just call it even and go our ways.

367
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,613
I wanted to date like others did.

368
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,117
With the CSAT over,

369
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,828
I wanted to go out
and have good food like everyone else.

370
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,708
But you were always busy working.

371
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,835
If I wanted to do something
special for our anniversary,

372
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,587
you would always say no.

373
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,757
I could tell it was burdening you.

374
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,802
But that tired me out too.

375
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,355
Exactly. Now you're free to do just that.

376
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,943
Find someone who'll do all that with you
since it's a luxury for me.

377
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,281
I wanted to,

378
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,159
but the others aren't the same as you.

379
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,455
It was you that I wanted to
do those things with, not someone else.

380
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,375
Hae-yi.

381
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,753
Let's get back together.

382
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,340
I want us to start again.

383
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,597
Well, I have a part-time job to get to.

384
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,652
Hae-yi!

385
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,798
We're off.

386
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,591
Don't be like that.

387
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,593
-Let's go.
-No one's going home.

388
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,637
Let's go for another round of drinks.

389
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,180
Come on. Come with us.

390
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,057
BUTLER CHOI
YOU HAVE A NEW MISSION

391
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,461
-The blue sky
-The blue sky

392
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,298
-The growing youth
-The growing youth

393
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,216
-Louder!
-The blooming adolescence

394
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,926
A new chapter in history? Nonsense.

395
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,891
-That's it! Continue.
-The blue sky

396
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,394
-The growing youth
-The growing youth

397
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,148
-Louder!
-The blooming adolescence

398
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,568
I told you that you can't run off
without permission during training.

399
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,111
I needed to poop.

400
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,283
You should have told me.

401
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,327
It was something beyond my control.

402
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,747
It's not like I can
tell it to wait until I'm ready.

403
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,458
It was nature taking its course.

404
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,209
She's not wrong.

405
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,128
I know, right?

406
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,340
Get back in line.
Just let me know next time.

407
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,632
Yes, sir!

408
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,927
How do I control my sphincter?

409
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,804
I don't know. Maybe the leader knows.

410
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,348
I'll need to learn that first.

411
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,557
Head toward the amphitheater.

412
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,892
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

413
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,519
I'm going to use the bathroom.

414
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,313
Get a move on!

415
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,815
Is she the star you were talking about?

416
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,985
What's gotten into him now?

417
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,614
I can see that this year
is going to be disastrous.

418
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,533
If you keep doing that,
I'll ban you from coming here.

419
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,952
How scary.

420
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,709
-Should we run away?
-Let's go.

421
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,003
What are you doing today?

422
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,053
I have a very important
business meeting to attend.

423
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:01,971
I'm off.

424
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,640
Where are you going?

425
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,267
A business meeting?

426
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,602
I'm free today.

427
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,771
This is no fun.

428
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,022
What?

429
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,024
Hey, I can be fun too.

430
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,319
Bye.

431
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,822
YNOT STOCK INVESTMENT CLUB

432
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,074
You'll be receiving
personal training in turn.

433
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,201
You'll get one about once every two weeks.

434
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,577
That often?

435
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,664
You'll be kicked out if you miss
more than two meetings, so be there.

436
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,207
By the way…

437
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,584
what's your rate of return?

438
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,756
I'm so busy.

439
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,674
FRIDAY, THEIA TRAINING

440
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,883
I'll have to quit sometime soon.

441
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,135
Jeong-woo!

442
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,726
It's so good
to finally see a friendly face.

443
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,769
So this is what it feels like
to be a returning student.

444
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,312
There isn't a single person I know.

445
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,606
-Were you discharged from the army?
-Last year.

446
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,775
Did you return this year too?

447
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,319
No. I'm going to enroll next year.

448
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,530
Right. Are you studying for a state exam?

449
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,448
No.

450
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,742
I'm leading the cheering squad.

451
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,786
The cheering squad?

452
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,998
You're still doing that?

453
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,875
Yes.

454
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,293
I see.

455
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,296
That's impressive.

456
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,175
I don't know the details,
but I heard things are looking tough.

457
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,385
Good luck.

458
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,018
BUTLER CHOI IS HEADED YOUR WAY

459
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,444
What's going on?

460
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,405
-Was it you?
-Yes.

461
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,788
-Would've been faster to buy one yourself.
-Wait.

462
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,707
Have one. You must be tired.

463
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,209
It'll help you re-energize.

464
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,339
Why are you following me?

465
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,632
I need to go this way too.

466
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,222
Do you know why
I joined the cheering squad?

467
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,474
It's because of you.

468
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,019
But we're not supposed to
date other members.

469
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,647
It's okay. Don't worry too much.

470
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,942
It takes two to tango.

471
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,068
When one person isn't interested…

472
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,404
nothing can happen.

473
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,451
I'm off now. Goodbye.

474
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,869
Why are you at an academy?

475
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,079
2020 CSAT CLASS

476
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,080
Are you sitting the CSAT again?

477
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,624
I'm here to register for my brother.

478
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,793
You pay for your brother's tuition too?

479
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,796
If I don't, who will? You?

480
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,798
Can I do that?

481
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,010
What was that?

482
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,929
Is it okay if I pay instead?

483
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:50,932
Say that again?

484
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,528
You must be rich.

485
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,571
Yes.

486
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,659
It's so nice to meet you, friend.

487
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,078
I can do much more if you go out with me.

488
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,208
Was this why you were so confident?

489
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,629
I guess it's understandable.

490
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,508
You have everything anyone could ask for.

491
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,551
I get it.

492
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,344
Then will you go out with me?

493
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,222
A million won for one month.

494
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,057
No dating among squad members.

495
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,476
But we can't date other members.

496
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,395
That won't do.

497
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,273
I didn't expect you
to care so much about rules.

498
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,484
That's right. I'm a total conformist.

499
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,528
We can just quit if we get caught.

500
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,033
Why don't we discuss this again

501
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,368
if you still haven't
changed your mind after a month?

502
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,829
I'll consider it then.

503
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,998
-After a month?
-Yes.

504
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,708
-Sure.
-Okay.

505
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:11,304
Seon-ho. I've got your vitamins
ready in the kitchen.

506
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,988
I'll pay you back for today over time.
Thank you.

507
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,830
We're having dinner
with Dr. Park this Sunday,

508
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,749
so leave your schedule open.

509
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,251
You can't slack off
because you're still in pre-med.

510
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,296
We need to prepare in advance
in order to get ahead.

511
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,381
Okay.

512
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,218
Gosh. You're so adorable.

513
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,136
Right.

514
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,139
Did you sign up for some academy?

515
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,184
I saw a payment
in your transaction history.

516
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,144
Oh, that?

517
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,730
It was for a good cause.

518
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,357
A good cause?

519
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,609
Is it a special academy?

520
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,447
My gosh. All right, then.

521
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,601
Let's not cause a scene, shall we?

522
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,965
He's studying hard.

523
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,682
So you didn't find a replacement?

524
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,602
No. Everyone seems to be busy.

525
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,229
No one wants to do it
even if I offer to pay double.

526
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,148
Gosh.

527
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,066
My goodness.

528
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,360
Would it be okay if I filled in for you?

529
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,279
Are you sure?

530
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,698
Okay.

531
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,284
Yay! Thank you.

532
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,875
I have training!

533
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,877
What should I do?

534
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,888
51ST RECRUIT DO HAE-YI

535
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,058
Jeong-woo. I'm feeling
a bit under the weather today,

536
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:06,479
so I don't think
I can make it to today's training.

537
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,564
Okay.

538
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,116
-Hey ya! In the roaring waves
-Hey ya! In the roaring waves

539
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,953
-Hey ya! And the raging storm
-Hey ya! And the raging storm

540
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,790
-Louder! We're tired all the same.
-Hey ya! We'll be there for you…

541
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,708
Somewhere here…

542
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,782
Hey.

543
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,242
-Give me the water.
-Thank you.

544
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,368
It's so hot.

545
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,749
What is it?

546
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,678
Butler service.

547
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,641
What are you doing here?

548
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,894
Do you know her?

549
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,354
Yes. She's a friend from high school.

550
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,731
I see.

551
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,691
Mom, I'll just throw these out myself.

552
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,568
You said you didn't want to
get your hands dirty.

553
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,320
That's why we called someone.

554
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,989
It must be awkward
since you two are friends.

555
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,324
Should I get someone else?

556
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,075
No, it's fine.

557
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,411
I'll take it, sir.

558
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,791
Come to think of it,
haven't I seen you out front before?

559
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,002
-You were with my son.
-No.

560
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,463
-Am I mistaken?
-You are.

561
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,176
Mom, I'll just take this and see her out.

562
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,093
Sure.

563
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,901
Let me help.

564
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,612
It's fine. I'm being paid to do this.

565
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,240
-Come on. Just let me help.
-I said I'll do it.

566
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,875
-You should've let me help.
-Just leave it.

567
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,548
About earlier…

568
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,676
It's fine.

569
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,136
Wait. What I meant was…

570
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,683
You kept it a secret from your mom
even when we were dating.

571
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,850
You don't need to explain.

572
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,312
Because it would've been
a bother if she knew.

573
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,943
Why do you want to get back with me

574
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,237
when you're so embarrassed of me?

575
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,282
You're not doing this because you like me.

576
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,575
You just hurt your pride
because I was the one who dumped you.

577
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,536
That's not it.

578
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,039
Jae-hyeok.

579
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,500
I'm never getting back with you.

580
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,504
So I hope you keep tormenting yourself,
picturing me with other men

581
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,048
because that's what I want.

582
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,650
YONHEE UNIVERSITY

583
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,655
Come on.

584
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,909
Hello.

585
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,870
Hello.

586
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,791
I wonder how many laps we'll run today.

587
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,751
I can't feel my legs.

588
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,177
-Hello.
-Hello.

589
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:09,764
Hello.

590
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,433
Hae-yi.

591
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,353
Hae-yi.

592
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,854
Yes?

593
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,483
I believe you have some
explaining to do about yesterday.

594
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,406
Well, I…

595
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,208
I had to fill in for someone at work.

596
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,460
I'm sorry.

597
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,338
Slacking off on your training
can lead to accidents.

598
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,716
Are you fine with another member
getting hurt because of you?

599
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,638
Lying to miss out on training
is making a fool of others' hard work.

600
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,139
We do not tolerate such actions.

601
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,184
You should quit
if your priorities lie elsewhere…

602
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,814
so we don't waste each other's time.

603
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,109
I'm sorry.

604
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,945
I'm not saying this
to get an apology out of you.

605
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,908
I'm asking you
if you think you're suited for this.

606
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,704
I'll make sure it never happens again.

607
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,749
Say that to your fellow members
you've wronged, not me.

608
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,179
I'm sorry.

609
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,767
I'll make sure it never happens again.

610
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,822
We'll begin training in ten minutes.

611
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,411
Are you all right?

612
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,080
Why'd he have to run you down like that?

613
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,582
He didn't have to be so harsh.

614
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,500
-I'll go get some water.
-Want me to come?

615
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,085
-I'll be fine.
-Okay.

616
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,561
What's so great about a cheering squad?

617
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,605
I'm going to quit no matter the money.

618
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,069
Hae-yi.

619
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,655
We should talk.

620
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,409
About what?

621
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,953
I don't think we have
anything left to talk about.

622
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,959
It won't take long.

623
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,711
I've got nothing to say to you.

624
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,962
But I do.

625
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,506
-But I don't.
-But I do.

626
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,924
What did you mean
by what you said yesterday?

627
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,300
-Let go.
-No.

628
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,011
She doesn't want to talk to you.

629
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,930
It's between the two of us.

630
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,640
I don't think it's any of your business.

631
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,102
That doesn't apply when you're making
unwanted physical contact with her.

632
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,991
I just wanted to talk quietly
between the two of us,

633
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,744
but I guess I'll just say it now.

634
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,206
Were you serious when you said

635
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,794
that I should keep tormenting myself,
picturing you with other men?

636
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,296
Me? Why should I?

637
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,300
You're from a poor single-parent family.

638
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,845
Did you really think I'd consider
dating you seriously?

639
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,806
You're just a fling.

640
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,101
-Jae-hyeok.
-Listen.

641
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:46,272
You must think you're special,
but stop dreaming.

642
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,024
I doubt anyone would
want to date someone like you

643
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,193
who's afraid to spend even a single penny.

644
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,237
You don't have a future,
and you're hardly there in the present.

645
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,239
BEWARE OF FALLING HAZARD

646
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,811
What do you want?

647
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,897
I thought you might need this.

648
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,026
I'll be back soon, so just leave me alone.
This is too embarrassing.

649
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,709
When I was in fifth grade,

650
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,379
we were graded on soccer during P.E.

651
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,842
All the other kids said
that their dads would teach them,

652
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,887
but I didn't have a dad.

653
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:48,185
Everyone made fun of me
for not having a dad to learn from.

654
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,231
I got terrible grades after that.

655
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:58,028
I blamed it all on my dad's absence.

656
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,740
Since then, I kept blaming my dad

657
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,785
for everything that went wrong.

658
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,080
That it was all because
I didn't have a dad.

659
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,335
And in middle school,
we were graded on basketball in P.E.

660
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,215
But I got top grades in basketball.

661
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,554
I still didn't have a dad,

662
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,266
but I was good at basketball.

663
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,727
That's when I realized

664
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:36,859
that I wasn't bad at soccer
because I didn't have a dad.

665
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,447
I was just not that good at soccer.

666
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,908
It had nothing to do with me

667
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,870
not having a dad.

668
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,041
It didn't change how others pitied me,

669
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,503
but I didn't mind

670
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,298
because I didn't feel bad about myself.

671
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,973
You shouldn't let yourself be swayed
by what others think of you.

672
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,142
Then you'll be just fine.

673
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,746
Stop acting all grown up.

674
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,624
I know, right?

675
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,460
I guess I went a little overboard.

676
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,348
I'm hungry from all the crying.

677
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,153
I did get that for you to eat,

678
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,322
but I didn't think
you'd eat it right away.

679
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,789
You're not going home

680
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,916
until you catch up on everything
you missed yesterday.

681
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,209
Finish up and hurry along.

682
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,004
I wanted to ask.

683
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,385
Why do you work so hard
for the cheering squad?

684
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,263
All your friends
are preparing for employment.

685
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,056
Aren't you anxious?

686
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,268
I am.

687
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,397
Then why?

688
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:41,984
Just because…

689
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,111
it's something I like.

690
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,826
I wonder why
I put myself through such trouble,

691
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,038
but there are moments
that make me forget all of that.

692
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,837
Hurry up and eat.

693
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,787
-We can! We do!
-We can! We do!

694
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,748
-We can!
-We can!

695
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,541
-We do!
-We do!

696
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,585
-We can!
-We can!

697
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,503
-We do!
-We do!

698
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,464
-We can!
-We can!

699
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,466
-We do!
-We do!

700
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,468
-We can!
-We can!

701
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,386
-We do!
-We do!

702
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,305
-We can!
-We can!

703
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,307
-We are!
-We are!

704
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,560
-Olé, olé.
-Olé, olé.

705
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,020
-Three, four, five…
-Three, four, five…

706
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,358
Sleepyhead! Hurry up.

707
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,484
-Okay.
-Hurry.

708
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,960
It won't do you any harm to give it a try.

709
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,420
You only just turned twenty.

710
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,131
Just because…

711
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,133
it's something I like.

712
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,436
The two new members who'll join us
for the joint cheering event

713
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,480
will be chosen based on their endurance.

714
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,442
You will run 15 laps around this field.

715
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,655
Ready.

716
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,533
Everyone to the starting line.

717
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,956
All the new recruits,
line yourselves up at the starting line.

718
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,126
Stretch your wrists and ankles
so you don't get hurt.

719
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,503
Get yourselves ready.

720
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,476
Run!

721
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,564
What the hell?

722
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,994
Second lap!

723
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,057
Let's go! Keep running!

724
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,144
You're doing great!

725
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,313
You can do it! Keep going!

726
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,440
Come on. Run faster.

727
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,609
Let's go!

728
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,825
Don't look at me!

729
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:29,878
First.

730
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,380
Seon-ho, first place!

731
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,678
Let's go! Keep running!

732
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,544
Hae-yi, second place!

733
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,435
Seon-ho and Hae-yi.

734
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,818
You two will receive extra training
until the joint cheering event.

735
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,035
Get ready.

736
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,663
Go.

737
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,624
-Hey ya!
-Hey ya!

738
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,880
Lower your arms a little.

739
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,048
Loosen your shoulder.

740
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,717
-Better, right?
-Yes, sir.

741
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,221
And turn your arms a little too.

742
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,603
-Better?
-Yes, sir.

743
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,896
Don't look down. Look straight ahead.

744
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,398
Yes, sir.

745
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,649
Jeong-woo.

746
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,859
What about me?

747
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,076
Turn your right hand forward a little.

748
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,370
And lean backward a little.

749
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,751
Better?

750
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,712
From the top again.

751
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,548
-Hey ya!
-Hey ya!

752
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,134
Get yourselves in position.

753
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,054
Repeat the choreography ten times.

754
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,640
-One, two, three, one.
-One, two, three, one.

755
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,725
-One, two, three, two.
-One, two, three, two.

756
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,936
-One, two, three, three.
-One, two, three, three.

757
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,480
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

758
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,482
-One, two, three, five.
-One, two, three, five.

759
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,901
-One, two, three, seven.
-One, two, three, seven.

760
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,903
-One, two, three…
-Good.

761
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,534
You're doing well.

762
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,103
Good.

763
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,401
You're doing great. Take deep breaths.

764
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:46,908
It's raining!

765
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,778
I think I kind of get it.

766
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,867
I can picture this place
filled with a crowd cheering on.

767
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,884
How incredible that must be.

768
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,929
It sure is.

769
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,557
You have to experience it to know it.

770
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,866
I'm sure you were told off a lot
when you were a freshman.

771
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,869
No. All I got were compliments.

772
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,206
You're stuck up now,
so I dread to even picture you then.

773
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,379
If you keep saying that, I'll have to
show you what I'm like at my worst.

774
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,091
Then I'll have to
make life harder for you.

775
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,676
-Should I? Can I?
-Go ahead.

776
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,511
-You can't, anyway.
-Can I really?

777
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,638
-Can I really do it?
-Whatever.

778
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,395
-You don't know how bad I can be.
-That's what you think.

779
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,868
ABOLISH THE CORRUPT CHEERING SQUAD THEIA

780
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,125
2019 MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION FORM
NAME: DO HAE-YI

781
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,798
Then were you a good dancer
since your freshman year?

782
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,927
UNKNOWN USER
QUIT THE CHEERING SQUAD

783
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,804
ONE OF THE MEMBERS WILL DIE THIS YEAR

784
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,347
REMEMBER THE THIRD PROPHECY

785
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,309
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

786
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,317
Watch your head.

787
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,277
Okay.

788
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,208
You can go. I'll put them back.

789
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,543
I'll help you since I'm here.

790
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,546
Do as you please.

791
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,364
Are you all right?

792
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,741
What?

793
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,952
Yes. I'm fine.

794
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,415
Wait.

795
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,755
In front of the club.

796
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,966
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

797
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,145
You must remember me,
so why didn't you say anything?

798
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,441
I wouldn't call it a happy memory.

799
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,280
You're kinder than I thought.

800
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,244
I was dumped for being poor.

801
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,996
You've seen me in my worst moments.

802
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,584
Making a living for yourself
isn't something to be embarrassed about.

803
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,795
I'd say it's the opposite.

804
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,593
Give it here.

805
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,325
It's locked.

806
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,209
Hello?

807
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,295
Hello?

808
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,679
Hey.

809
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,766
Anyone there?

810
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,164
I'm trapped in the storage.
The door's locked.

811
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,598
Open the door.

812
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,492
What's wrong, Hae-yi?

813
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,370
Hae-yi. Are you all right?

814
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,454
Hae-yi.

815
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,998
Get a hold of yourself, Hae-yi.

816
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,251
Hae-yi!

817
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,213
Hae-yi!

818
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,008
Hae-yi, get a hold of yourself.

819
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,387
Breathe. Hae-yi.

820
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,583
Doesn't this feel
eerily similar to that day?

821
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,293
You seem to have
quite a character this year.

822
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,712
Was it Do Hae-yi?
She reminds me of Yu-min.

823
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,838
Why don't you put in a little more effort?

824
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,715
It won't be any fun
if you don't put up much fight.

825
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:41,632
This is the schedule for extra training.

826
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,593
The event is around the corner.
This much is to be expected.

827
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,763
We have other things to do.
You can't expect us to do all of this.

828
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,973
There's a way to make things
easier for you guys.

829
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,100
It's the brave who end up being rewarded.

830
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,852
You're quite diligently persistent.

831
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,146
I won't ever make you cry,
so how about you go out with me?

832
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,607
Then what kind of girl do you like?

833
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,524
You.

834
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,612
