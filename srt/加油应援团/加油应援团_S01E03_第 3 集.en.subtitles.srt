1
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,228
Open the door.

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,860
I'm trapped in the storage.
The door's locked.

5
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,204
What's wrong, Hae-yi?

6
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,248
Hae-yi. Are you all right?

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,374
Hae-yi.

8
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,251
Get a hold of yourself, Hae-yi.

9
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,797
Hang in there. Help is coming.

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,511
Come here, Hae-yi.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,596
Come.

12
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,185
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

13
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,981
Take deep breaths.

14
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,024
Breathe in deep.

15
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,110
Get a hold of yourself, Hae-yi.

16
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,736
Don't close your eyes. Look at me.

17
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,032
Damn it.

18
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,620
Come on. Why won't it open?

19
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,622
Deep breaths. Don't breathe too quickly.

20
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,873
Slowly.

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,667
Take deep, slow breaths.

22
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,420
It'll be fine. You're doing great.

23
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,506
It's okay. Slowly.

24
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,217
Take deep breaths.

25
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,973
You're doing great.

26
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,891
You're doing great.

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,685
That's it.

28
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,728
Take deep breaths.

29
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,399
Big, deep breaths.

30
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,819
I don't think it's a fire.
It's a false alarm.

31
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,945
Okay.

32
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,825
This is driving me nuts.

33
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,664
I'll do it.

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:57,969
Hey.

35
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,306
Hey, are you all right?

36
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,226
-She's having trouble breathing.
-Are you all right?

37
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,981
Breathe slowly.

38
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,034
Goodness.

39
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,785
The door's been busted.

40
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,042
Is this super glue?

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,253
-I'm sorry?
-It looks like it was glued shut.

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,884
Doesn't this feel

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,137
eerily similar to that day?

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,571
It really is busted.

45
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,450
-Theia!
-I told you not to do that.

46
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,204
How are you feeling?

47
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:07,914
I'm fine.

48
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,006
I guess my stomach isn't doing so fine.

49
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,636
First girlfriend?

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,639
I think it was when I was four.

51
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,891
I asked her out during snack time

52
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,685
and broke up in two hours
due to personality differences.

53
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,937
You were a player even then.

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,108
Teach me your ways
of winning a girl's heart.

55
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,069
It seems to me you know your stuff
when it comes to dating.

56
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,281
You just stick to the basics.

57
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,658
Express your feelings,
look after her, and treat her well.

58
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,076
The same thing everyone does.

59
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,287
Is that all?

60
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,707
Once you get the basics down,
you're already halfway there.

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,334
I guess so.
But what if she still doesn't like you?

62
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,211
Then you decide
whether to stop or keep going.

63
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,839
-What do you mean?
-I have a three-out system.

64
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,300
I keep going until my third try
and stop if it doesn't work out.

65
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,094
"A three-out system"? Like a game?

66
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,637
It won't do either side any good

67
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,056
if you keep trying
when you're not meant to be.

68
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,100
I guess so.

69
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,060
But how can you just stop?

70
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,437
Pumpkin sweet potatoes are better.

71
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,896
No, the chestnut ones are.

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,648
What are you saying?

73
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,358
-Sleepyhead.
-Hi.

74
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,401
-Hi.
-Hi.

75
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,281
-You seem to be feeling better.
-I am.

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,700
It's chestnuts for sure.

77
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,702
They have just the right dry texture.

78
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,495
That's complete nonsense.

79
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,831
Pumpkin potatoes are
way tastier than chestnuts.

80
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,667
Pumpkins all the way!

81
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,669
What about you, Jeong-woo?

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,796
Chestnuts or pumpkins?

83
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,798
Chestnuts.

84
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,175
Of course. See?

85
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,010
You definitely know your food.

86
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,554
I'm so disappointed in you right now.

87
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,682
How about jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?
Three, two, one.

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,017
-Jjajangmyeon.
-Jjamppong.

89
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,269
Spicy or regular cold noodles?
Three, two, one.

90
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,479
-Regular.
-Spicy.

91
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,399
I see that you're a man of culture.

92
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,402
I can't believe you, Jeong-woo.
You have no taste.

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,405
They say that you are what you eat.

94
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,032
You're just like me.

95
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,410
-That's not a compliment, is it?
-Of course, it is.

96
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,870
Well done!

97
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,748
I like regular cold noodles too.

98
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,124
Really? Enjoy.

99
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,542
It's one out already!

100
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,377
The runner is out.

101
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,379
He touched base a little too late.

102
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,715
-Hae-yi.
-Yes?

103
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,509
You and I are completely different.

104
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,636
-There's no way we're the same.
-Why not?

105
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,096
Can't you tell?

106
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,348
Well, why is that?

107
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,600
-You're at it again.
-Why not?

108
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,900
UNKNOWN USER
QUIT THE CHEERING SQUAD

109
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,984
REMEMBER THE THIRD PROPHECY

110
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,361
YOU'LL SUFFER TOO

111
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,677
You know how rappers diss each other?

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,804
A joint cheering event
is exactly like that.

113
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,433
We diss each other before our cheer
to show them who the boss is.

114
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,725
"Hokyung University?"

115
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,394
"You sure are looking hopeless."

116
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,356
"Just hearing that name
makes me laugh. Ho ho ho."

117
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,067
What is this?
I feel embarrassed just reading it.

118
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,986
How are we supposed to
put them down with this?

119
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,947
Do you have any idea how hard it was
to come up with that?

120
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
And we're supposed to
write something like this?

121
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,163
That's your mission
for the joint cheering event.

122
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,665
Those are from the past,
so use them as reference.

123
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,835
But there are song-specific lines here.

124
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,879
How are we supposed to know
what songs they'll perform?

125
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
That's why you need one
for all of their songs.

126
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,132
-All of them?
-Are you serious?

127
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,925
-Of course.
-"Of course."

128
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,553
How many songs do they have?

129
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,346
I'd say they have around 50 songs.

130
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,347
-What?
-What?

131
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,768
"Aria of the People!"

132
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,399
HOKYUNG UNIVERSITY SONG LIST
ARIA OF THE PEOPLE, KNEEL DOWN YONHEEâ€¦

133
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,695
We have less than ten days.

134
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,239
How are we supposed to learn
all these and write a rebuttal?

135
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,074
I have extra practice. Can I be excluded?

136
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,456
Do you know what team spirit is?

137
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,876
How hard will the others have it
if you and Seon-ho aren't here?

138
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,008
I think they'll be just fine.

139
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,510
We'll be together.

140
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,095
-No way!
-It's time for training.

141
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,305
What about these scripts?

142
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,973
You write them in your own time.

143
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,269
-This isn't fair.
-This can't be true.

144
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,647
Everyone to the amphitheater.

145
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,190
Oh, my god!

146
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,275
-Get up.
-The amphitheater?

147
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,027
-I can't believe this.
-This is nonsense.

148
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,904
Where's the amphitheater?
Did we even have one?

149
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,156
The last to get up runs an extra ten laps.

150
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,992
-Jeez!
-Hurry and get up! Run!

151
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,829
We're going to be
as busy as an idol group.

152
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,831
Are we going on TV then?

153
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,416
Should we?

154
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,502
-Let's do this.
-Why not?

155
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,296
-Hello.
-Hurry. I'm so very excited.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,882
Hey, there. You have our van ready, right?

157
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,092
Where's our manager?

158
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,802
-Where could he be?
-Where is he?

159
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,220
Get back in line.

160
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,304
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,472
Let's go!

162
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,641
-Hello.
-Hello.

163
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,200
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir!

164
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,036
-One, two, three, one.
-One, two, three, one.

165
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,205
-One, two, three, two.
-One, two, three, two.

166
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,832
-One, two, three--
-One, two, three--

167
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,166
Stop.

168
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,086
Just Seon-ho, one more time.

169
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,048
-One.
-One.

170
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,176
Don't move your left foot. Again.

171
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,180
-One.
-One.

172
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,308
Straighten your back. Again.

173
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,518
Again.

174
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,772
-One.
-One.

175
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,857
Again.

176
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,817
-One.
-One.

177
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,152
Again.

178
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,071
-One.
-One.

179
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,949
You keep doing it wrong
because you won't fix your left foot.

180
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,867
Again.

181
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,162
-One.
-One.

182
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,039
-Left foot!
-I did it right.

183
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,055
Let's take a ten-minute break.

184
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,806
-Ten-minute break!
-Ten-minute break!

185
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,600
A ten-minute break, everyone.

186
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,644
Hydrate yourselves.

187
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,729
You may go to the bathroom if you wish.

188
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,482
Let's go. Cheer up everyone.

189
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,782
Slow down. Don't drink too fast.

190
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,331
What's wrong?
You've been down for a while.

191
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,630
This is no fun.

192
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,343
What's wrong?

193
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,470
I told you I can be fun.

194
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,388
Yong-il.

195
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,724
-Can I talk to you?
-Of course!

196
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,086
Should we get back to it?

197
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,921
Let's get back to training.

198
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,384
Your ten minutes are over.

199
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,302
Hurry and get back in line.

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,180
He didn't say anything?

201
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,223
That's right.

202
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,601
Cho-hui.

203
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,311
I'll do better.

204
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,273
-What do you mean?
-What I mean is

205
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,775
that I'll look after them better.

206
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,819
Sure.

207
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,072
If they have any complaints, tell me.

208
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,241
Especially Seon-ho.

209
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,576
Okay.

210
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:38,883
Yonhee! Stand up!

211
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,554
Just mimicking the motions won't do.

212
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,764
You have to make the moves fit.

213
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,600
"Fit."

214
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,769
Fit.

215
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,731
-Fit.
-Fit.

216
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,649
Gosh. Fit.

217
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,651
Are they your 51st recruits?

218
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,241
Why won't they greet us?

219
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,076
Have some snacks.

220
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,371
-Hand them over. They're not for you.
-Have some snacks.

221
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,303
What should we do?

222
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,015
What else?
We eat quickly and have them leave.

223
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,018
Hurry and eat up.

224
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,187
Faster. There.

225
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,108
What year were you in?

226
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,778
I guess you don't know.

227
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,031
I was the 47th recruit,
and they were the 49th.

228
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,450
-You started with Cho-hui, right?
-Yes.

229
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,910
But we're in the planning team now.

230
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,039
You guys must be working your butts off
for the joint cheering event.

231
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,749
They're working us like dogs.

232
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,668
PLANNING TEAM: SQUAD MEMBERS WHO ARE
NO LONGER ACTIVE BUT HELP OUT WITH EVENTS

233
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,507
There's a way to make things
easier for you guys.

234
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,591
What is it?

235
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,556
Hae-yi and Seon-ho.

236
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,808
Yes?

237
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,354
-This is the schedule for extra training.
-I'm sorry?

238
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,524
But I have work during these times.

239
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,777
Then when are you available?

240
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,072
I don't think
this is going to work out for me.

241
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,368
We're already training in the afternoons
and in between classes.

242
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,703
I can't do more than that.

243
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,913
The event is around the corner.
This much is to be expected.

244
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,957
We have other things to do.

245
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,043
We have lectures, exams,
and part-time jobs.

246
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,628
Plus, extra training.

247
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,630
We're giving this
all the time we have already.

248
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,716
You can't possibly ask us
to make more time.

249
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,051
You can't expect us to do all of this.

250
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,021
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10
JOINT CHEERING EVENT

251
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,439
You're quite good with words.

252
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,609
I agree Jeong-woo
is taking things a bit too far.

253
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,986
It's not like our lives depend on this.

254
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,489
Sleepyhead!

255
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,701
Oh, right.

256
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,583
THEIA NEW RECRUITS

257
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,627
Requesting emergency meeting.

258
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,589
We were trained
much harder back in my day.

259
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,717
Kids these days are too soft.
They don't know how good they have it.

260
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,969
You weren't that great either.

261
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,013
-Cho-hui!
-"Cho-hui!"

262
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,598
Well,

263
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,559
what Hae-yi said wasn't entirely wrong.

264
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,313
We can't have her train
when she has a job to keep.

265
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,067
Hey, you guys were here.

266
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,860
Are you having a meeting?

267
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,612
Yes.

268
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,823
Woon-chan, that's no way
to greet your seniors.

269
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,952
I'm just messing with you.

270
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,746
You seem to have
quite a character this year.

271
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,791
Was it Do Hae-yi?

272
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,087
She reminds me of Yu-min.

273
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,714
She was just like her.

274
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:08,926
Yu-min?

275
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,637
Soo-il.

276
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,890
I'd prefer it
if you didn't visit us like this.

277
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,059
You were removed
for what happened last year.

278
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,437
You're no longer a member,
so it's against the rules

279
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,689
for you to be at our training.

280
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,066
Don't be so cold, Jeong-woo.

281
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,193
We've known each other for years.

282
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,073
Come on. How about a drink?

283
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,951
I hear you're digging into
where our last year's funds went.

284
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,711
Let's not cause any trouble, shall we?

285
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,046
Let bygones be bygones.

286
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,048
Bygones are never just bygones.

287
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,218
What's been done wrong
should be made right.

288
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,472
Fine.

289
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,433
Go ahead and keep digging then.

290
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,934
You won't find anything anyway.

291
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,770
Sure. We'll have to see about that.

292
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,525
Let's go.

293
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,579
Gather around.

294
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,582
About what Soo-il said earlierâ€¦

295
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,916
How about we give it a go?

296
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,461
All you need is the menu.

297
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,670
The menu?

298
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,589
The list of songs for the joint cheer.

299
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,007
If you have that,

300
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,010
you just need to prepare the scripts
for the songs they'll be doing.

301
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,553
You'll have much less on your hands.

302
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,306
How are we supposed to
get our hands on that?

303
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,267
You can get a friend at Hokyung drunk
and have them tell you.

304
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,520
Or you can sneak into their office
and take a photo of the list.

305
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,064
And it's fine to do that?

306
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:45,981
Hey.

307
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,234
It's the brave who end up being rewarded.

308
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,195
You want to sneak into Hokyung University?

309
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,113
Yes. Let's give it a go.

310
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,031
How about it?

311
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,866
-What if we get caught?
-Oh, come on.

312
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,452
It's the brave who end up being rewarded.

313
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,371
That's right. Let's do it.

314
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,874
We should do everything we can
to save time, right?

315
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,042
Right. Let's do it.

316
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,587
Then we'll need to decide
who's actually going to do it.

317
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,131
Who's going to sneak into their office?

318
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,758
The weather sure is nice today.

319
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,343
-Look at the cherry blossoms.
-I know, right?

320
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,511
I'm not doing it.

321
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,179
I never agreed to this, all right?

322
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,015
-Min-jae.
-Min-jae.

323
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,141
Min-jae!

324
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,393
That party-pooper.

325
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,437
What if he rats us out?

326
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,897
You better not rat us out.

327
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
No volunteers?

328
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,905
Then let's do a draw.

329
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,205
Damn it.

330
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:49,920
What did you get?

331
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,300
Those who suggest it
always end up doing it.

332
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,261
Whose idea was this?

333
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,447
-What's wrong?
-That yogurt lady is on fire.

334
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,283
No, I'm not on fire.

335
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,952
What do you think you're doing here?

336
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,164
Damn it.

337
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,083
I guess I have an image to uphold.

338
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,882
Why won't people just leave me alone,
for goodness' sake?

339
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,551
Excuse me, ma'am.

340
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,846
Why don't you try
one of our new premium yogurts?

341
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,390
You see, this isâ€¦

342
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,019
You don't have to buy one.

343
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,071
Are you Hwang Jin-hee by any chance?

344
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,408
Goodness. It really is you.

345
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,828
It's me, Sung Chun-yang.
Don't you remember?

346
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,205
Come on.

347
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,290
Don't you remember me?

348
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,792
I came first
in the Hwang Jini Beauty Pageant

349
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,793
and you came in second.

350
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,046
People joked about
how you didn't come in first

351
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,131
although you had a name
similar to the competition.

352
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,674
Everyone broke out laughing.

353
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,096
We went around doing events and stuff.

354
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,226
I can't believe I ran into you
at a place like this.

355
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,729
You must have married someone rich.

356
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,148
Good for you.

357
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,817
It's so good to see you.

358
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,656
I don't think we were that close.

359
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,200
Is that right?

360
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,787
I was just happy to see you
after all these years.

361
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,290
This is too sour.

362
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,089
Is it?

363
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,059
She outright ignored me.

364
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,613
Hey.

365
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,532
Are you worried about sneaking in?

366
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,120
I've been out of luck these days.
I think I'm done for this year.

367
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,336
I know some people at Hokyung.
You need some help?

368
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,256
-Really?
-Yes.

369
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,509
-Take this into account in three weeks.
-In three weeks?

370
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,220
You said you'd consider dating me
if I don't change my mind by then.

371
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,888
Why don't we discuss this again

372
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,932
if you still haven't
changed your mind after a month?

373
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,142
Sure.

374
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,270
You're quite diligently persistent.

375
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,273
-What?
-It's nothing.

376
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,942
Sure. I know I'm not that bad-looking,

377
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,652
but I'm not worth all that trouble.

378
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,697
Have I gotten prettier?

379
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,409
She's so unbelievably fun.

380
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,621
About Jeong-wooâ€¦

381
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,499
-Yes?
-What do you think of guys like him?

382
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,668
-What do you mean?
-As a boyfriend.

383
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,628
Come on.

384
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,797
He's a stuck-up old geezer.

385
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,592
Right? He tends to be like that.

386
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,351
Hey, there's my bus.

387
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,729
Ask your friend at Hokyung for me, okay?

388
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,108
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

389
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,618
Don't forget.

390
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,505
Taxi!

391
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,965
CHEERING SQUAD RECORD OF FINANCES

392
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,554
2018 ACCOUNT BOOK

393
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,106
Good! Let's keep going!

394
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,452
Here.

395
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,330
I'll open it for you.

396
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,008
Don't beat yourself up
over a small mistake.

397
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,301
That hurt.

398
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,553
Why would you hit me?

399
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,805
You're always complaining,

400
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,016
but you've managed to last this long.

401
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,270
I know you're not the type
to thrive in group situations like this.

402
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,480
Why did you join the squad?

403
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,484
The first application I was handed
at the club showcase

404
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,944
was for the cheering squad.

405
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,905
You know what?

406
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,699
People like you
who look like they'll give up

407
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,201
always end up becoming leaders.

408
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,744
There's no way.

409
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,663
I feel like quitting every day.

410
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,541
No, it's people like you
who make great leaders.

411
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,336
Let's keep going.

412
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,631
Jeez.

413
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,883
Go where?

414
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,969
By the time I end up a leader,

415
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,846
you'll be a wage slave at some company.

416
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,225
If you ever do take on the role,

417
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,352
I'll take a day off to come visit you.

418
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,187
Just to see how much you're suffering.

419
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,149
I wouldn't ever miss out on such a sight.

420
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,030
What about you?

421
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,699
Why did you join the squad?

422
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,576
Me?

423
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,626
It is pretty toughâ€¦

424
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,592
but there are moments
that make me forget all of that.

425
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,913
Don't you think I look
pretty good for my age?

426
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,959
They say I look like
I'm in my early forties.

427
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,755
This really hits the spot.

428
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,969
I don't look like
I've struggled too much in life, do I?

429
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,098
About Jeong-wooâ€¦

430
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,767
-Yes?
-What do you think of guys like him?

431
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,185
As a boyfriend.

432
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,854
Hey, are you listening to me?

433
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,400
Why are you sitting there
as if the world's about to end?

434
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,569
You don't look like it.

435
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,906
You don't look like
you're in your early forties.

436
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,618
You look exactly like a 47-year-old woman.

437
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,875
Mom.

438
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,877
-Mom!
-What?

439
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,257
If someone asks you an unexpected question

440
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,926
and it keeps weighing on your mind,

441
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,597
does that mean I'm bothered by it?

442
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,807
What are you saying?

443
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,394
I wonder why he asked me such a question.

444
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,356
Was it maybe something I did?

445
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,151
Never mind.

446
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,194
I'm going to sleep.

447
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,366
You're becoming weirder by the day.

448
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,785
-Whatever. Turn off the lights.
-I will.

449
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,013
About Jeong-wooâ€¦

450
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,057
What do you think of guys like him?

451
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,683
As a boyfriend.

452
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,519
No way.

453
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,263
Yes, I'm Park Jeong-woo.

454
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,151
ALAIN DE BOTTON
ESSAYS IN LOVE

455
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,726
What are you doing?

456
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,480
We're in the library.

457
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,078
Do you want some bread?

458
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,750
We're in the library. Follow me outside.

459
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,347
You don't miss a single meal, do you?

460
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,270
Jeong-woo. What's your major?

461
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,566
You're a theology major too?

462
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,819
You must've barely made the cut too.

463
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,945
I'm an astronomy major.

464
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,781
You still barely got in, right?

465
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,115
Quite the opposite.

466
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,244
-I came in first in my department.
-Right. Sure.

467
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,414
The campus sure is big.

468
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,625
Hello, kitty.

469
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,296
But what do you do there?

470
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,173
Do you learn how to read the stars
to tell fortunes?

471
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,591
I thought you weren't superstitious.

472
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,388
We learn about the internal structures
and activities of newly formed stars.

473
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,681
We also do numerical simulations

474
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,558
of radiating fluids
on the surfaces of planets.

475
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,892
Not that you'd know about it.

476
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,979
Stop talking and finish your food.

477
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,313
I need to get going.

478
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,191
Jeong-woo.

479
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,528
Hey.

480
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,946
Is this your girlfriend?

481
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,700
No, she's a junior I know.

482
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,911
Right. Hello.

483
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,121
-Hello.
-Hi.

484
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,791
Why don't we grab a meal together later?

485
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,635
You could have just said no.
Why did you have to act so flustered?

486
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,595
What?

487
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,014
You were like,
"No, she's a junior I know."

488
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,850
I doubt I made
a ridiculous face like that.

489
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,977
I'm not that bad of a catch.

490
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,562
You should be thankful instead.

491
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,647
-Is the bread laced with something?
-No.

492
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,111
So?

493
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,113
Thenâ€¦

494
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,658
what kind of girl do you like?

495
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,038
I mean,

496
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,249
I was just curious to see
how great your standards were.

497
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,667
You.

498
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,092
Wipe the cream off your face.

499
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,154
-Two outs.
-Gosh, that's two outs.

500
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,656
Let's go.

501
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,366
It'll be three outs in no time.

502
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,409
Just one more.

503
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,623
Where are you going?

504
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,667
Wait for me.

505
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,377
Let's go.

506
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,009
THEIA NEW RECRUITS

00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,852
-Our voices
-Our voices

508
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,646

00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,356

-Forever

512
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,279
-Two, one, two
-Two, one, two

513
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,658
-Our voices will be sung ofâ€¦
-Our voices will be sung ofâ€¦

514
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,578
Damn. I guess they were right about
Hokyung's squad being top-notch this year.

515
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,580
Just how many freshmen are there?

516
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,251
Look how charismatic their leader looks.

517
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,378
It's unbelievable.

518
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,630
Shouldn't we be at their office right now?

519
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,550
Right.

520
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,261
-Our voices will be sung of
-Our voices will be sung of

521
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,723
-In legends
-In legends

522
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,351
-Echo throughout the land

523
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,728
-Forever

524
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,688
-Two, one, two
-Two, one, two

525
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,232
Our squad's been in charge of the festival
for the past 50 years.

526
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,444
Just because you've been doing it
doesn't mean you have to keep doing it.

527
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,071
If there's a problem, we need to solve it.

528
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,032
Yes. That's why we held an internal audit

529
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,992
and decided to make
financial reports public.

530
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,996
You have a history, so I doubt
things will be that transparent.

531
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,707
I guess the finances the student council
has been in charge of historically

532
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,876
aren't all that transparent.

533
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,337
Come on.

534
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,549
Why don't we talk about this
after the joint cheer is over?

535
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,468
-I'm sorry?
-I'm sorry?

536
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,970
The student council does have a point.

537
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,056
We'll decide after hearing them out.

538
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,892
Let's do that.

539
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,219
Go back down. Quick.

540
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,753
RESTRICTED ACCESS

541
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,256
You keep a watch here, okay?

542
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,596
HOKYUNG UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

543
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,731
Hey, Hae-yi.

544
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,275
I'll take a look in here.

545
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,630
Hey, it's notâ€¦

546
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,924
Hey.

547
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,510
-What?
-Someone's sleeping.

548
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,349
-What do we do?
-Should we sneak out?

549
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,392
He has headphones on.

550
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,942
2019 CHEERING SQUAD SET LIST OF SONGS

551
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,447
-The menu.
-Over there?

552
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,834
What now?

553
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,461
I'll lift the pillow.

554
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,921
You take the menu, okay?

555
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,036
Thank you.

556
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,588
Get out of there.

557
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,757
What's going on?

558
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,512
Let's get out of here.

559
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,639
Let's take it.

560
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,463
I told you to wait in my office.
Why are you here?

561
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,215
You're here.

562
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,386
Why didn't you nap on the couch?

563
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,305
I was choosing the songs
for the joint cheer.

564
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,681
Are you done?

565
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,016
I haven't changed it much.

566
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,559
We'll do "Aria of the People."

567
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,853
-And our big song?
-Here.

568
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,442
Where's Hae-yi?

569
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,406
What do we do?

570
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,789
She's hiding. Let's wait for her.

571
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,002
-Let's go over this together later.
-Sure.

572
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,879
Let's go. The others will be here soon.

573
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,215
Yes! Hurry and get out.

574
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,633
I will if you give me a kiss.

575
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,847
Happy?

576
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,788
Hello.

577
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,087
It's Hae-yi.

578
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,715
I've been caught.

579
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,468
You guys go ahead and head back.

580
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,055
We're so dead.

581
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,232
-Here.
-Thank you.

582
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,985
I guess the freshmen at Yonhee
have some spirit.

583
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,487
I'm sorry.

584
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,741
Well, it's not the first time
someone's tried to steal our menu.

585
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,244
You would've been fine
if it wasn't for that sound you made.

586
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,621
I won't tell anyone.

587
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,000
You know, earlierâ€¦

588
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,089
-The kiss?
-Yes.

589
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,344
I'll keep your secret,
so please let me go.

590
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,555
You don't have to do that.

591
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:17,933
Okay.

592
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,227
Sure.

593
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,814
Come on.

594
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,358
They wouldn't kill her, would they?

595
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,124
You know that face he makes, right?
And he went,

596
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,627
"Did you ever stop to think
maybe you're the one with problems?"

597
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,213
With a huge frown on his face too!
Gosh, my head.

598
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,007
I can't believe him.

599
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,301
But you still joined the squad.

600
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,011
Wellâ€¦

601
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,141
I guess he does look okay
when he's on stage.

602
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,810
He does look kind of cool with his poses.

603
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,271
So--

604
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,781
Please let me go.

605
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,621
HOKYUNG

606
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,122
I haven't seen you in a while.

607
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,126
I apologize on our member's behalf.

608
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,630
I'm sorry.

609
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,717
I expect you to offer something
in exchange for the hostage.

610
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,680
Name it.

611
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,392
Should I make it
a private or a public favor?

612
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,935
It better be a public one.

613
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,311
I want Yonhee's menu.

614
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,730
Make it fair since you know ours.

615
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,149
All right.

616
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,819
I'll send it to you when I get back.

617
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,321
You won't even hear out
what the private favor is.

618
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,573
Stop joking around.

619
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,075
I hear you guys have it tough
with everyone leaving

620
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,451
because of the three prophecies.

621
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,537
Don't you think it'd be better
to do a private favor?

622
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,956
-You know about that?
-Hae-yi.

623
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,836
They say one of your members will die.
It's scary.

624
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,551
I'll send you our menu.

625
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,845
Sure. Wait.

626
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,764
Why don't you put in a little more effort?

627
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,891
It won't be any fun
if you don't put up much fight.

628
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,578
Jeong-woo.

629
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,665
I was just trying toâ€¦

630
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,125
Listen.

631
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,794
Just quit if you're going to do this.

632
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,256
It's bad enough
that you lied to get out of training.

633
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,466
And now, a whole scheme?

634
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,051
Well, Iâ€¦

635
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,303
You trespassed into Hokyung University.

636
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,096
Do you know what could happen
if word got out?

637
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,891
Then again,

638
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,478
you wouldn't have done something like this
if you'd given it some thought.

639
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,730
You might have done this for yourself,

640
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,523
but it could have done harm
to the entire group.

641
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,277
Didn't you ever stop to think

642
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,113
that maybe it was because
the load of work was too excessive?

643
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,659
It may be okay with you
since you signed up for it,

644
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,577
but everyone thinks this is too much.

645
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,204
Just quit if you're not up for it.

646
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,747
Don't cause everyone trouble.

647
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,836
Sure.

648
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,754
I'll quit.

649
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,381
I'll quit, okay?

650
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,268
Hey, Jeong-woo.

651
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,385
That jerk.

652
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,542
Thank you.

653
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,947
Why does he always pick on me?

654
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,657
Was it really all my fault?

655
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,161
I wasn't the only one involved.

656
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,166
Are you feeling better?

657
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,795
What are you doing here?
When did you get on the bus?

658
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,838
A while ago.

659
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,300
I waited until you stopped crying.

660
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,637
Then were you the one whoâ€¦

661
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,140
Thanks.

662
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,976
People might think you got dumped.

663
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,536
Aren't you hungry?

664
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,329
I'm not.

665
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,581
I didn't think
I'd ever see you turn down food.

666
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,712
If you quit the squad,
are we allowed to date now?

667
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,801
I'm a little tired today,
so I'll head home.

668
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,261
I think this is the third time

669
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,054
that I've seen you cry.

670
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,392
I won't ever make you cry,

671
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,728
so how about you go out with me?

672
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,569
I'm sorry.

673
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,657
I only said that
because I didn't want to miss out.

674
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,077
I didn't want to miss out on the chance
to date someone perfect like you.

675
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,454
I didn't want to lose that chance.

676
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,500
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

677
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,504
Then just date me.

678
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,214
You said yourself that I'm perfect.

679
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,511
You said we should
talk it over in a month.

680
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,721
Let's do that.

681
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,683
I'm sorry.

682
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,938
Am I being rejected right now?

683
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,150
I don't want to waste your time.

684
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,404
You sound so sure.

685
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,950
I'll get going.

686
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,426
TO DO HAE-YI

687
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,702
Listen.

688
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,664
Can we talk after you're done?

689
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,262
I was too harsh on you.

690
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,889
Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?

691
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,016
Sir?

692
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,769
I heard the freshmen
were all in on it together.

693
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,273
I took it personally. I'm sorry.

694
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,195
You really hit the spot when you said
I was overworking everyone

695
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,323
for my own fulfillment.

696
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,579
I guess me being the leader

697
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,915
is making everyone suffer.

698
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,504
You don't have to go that far.

699
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,010
Thenâ€¦

700
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,928
how about we do this?

701
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,016
We'll make up

702
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,268
after we down these shots.

703
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,784
Come on. Aren't we going to make up?

704
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,339
You didn't finish it.

705
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,556
Let me pour you one.

706
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,698
The leader of Hokyung's squad
was standing in front of tens of people.

707
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,827
She looked so charismatic.

708
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,871
She almost became my role model.

709
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,039
Ha-jin?

710
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah, she's good.

711
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,546
Jeong-woo.

712
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,423
You're not so bad yourself.

713
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,094
We're just a little outnumbered.

714
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,596
But you have me.

715
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,599
I'm worth a hundred people.

716
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,936
That's right.
And I'm worth a thousand people.

717
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,772
Let's beat them!

718
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,066
Yes! Let's do this!

719
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,698
Look at those two.

720
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,535
Cheers.

721
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,663
Could we have another bottle on the house?

722
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,206
I don't know about that.

723
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,083
Come on, put it on the house.

724
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,169
You need to drink all the way.

725
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,550
The squid is dead!

726
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,218
There's a weirdo here.

727
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,928
Gosh, this is good.

728
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,306
Bottoms up, old man.

729
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,557
Here. Oh, dear.

730
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,064
Bring it on, Hokyung!

731
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,900
We'll beat you all.

732
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,611
Everyone in Yonhee, scream!

733
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,446
That busâ€¦

734
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,324
Wake up, Jeong-woo.

735
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,742
Jeong-woo.

736
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,036
That hurt.

737
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,288
I don't know where he lives.

738
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,803
Don't go.

739
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,015
Please don't go.

740
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,080
-Hey.
-Hi.

741
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,540
Please help.

742
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,875
Help.

743
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,628
Hold on.

744
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,631
There.

745
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,061
-Here. Thank you.
-Okay.

746
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,312
Thank you so much.

747
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,403
I thought you two were dating.
I guess I was wrong.

748
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:42,821
I'm sorry?

749
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,093
You know that junior of yours?

750
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,553
Could you set me up with her?

751
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,304
She's totally my type.

752
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,767
-Set you up?
-Does she have a boyfriend?

753
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,811
Wellâ€¦

754
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,189
I don't know.

755
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,402
He seemed so flustered
that I thought you two were dating.

756
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,779
You're quitting?

757
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,409
Why are you quitting the cheering squad?

758
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,995
Because I don't want three outs.

759
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,705
What are you saying?

760
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,709
He can't quit.

761
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,961
I promised Cho-hui
that I'd look after everyone.

762
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,592
I don't want to see you shaking your ass.

763
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,843
But I'm good at that.

764
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,763
-Hello everyone.
-Hi.

765
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,557
What's gotten into you?
You look like you're in a good mood.

766
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,352
-Do I?
-Your tone is way up there.

767
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,104
When's Jeong-woo getting here?

768
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,147
Jeong-woo? He'll be here soon.

769
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,065
Okay.

770
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,240
HANGOVER DRINK

771
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,458
Hi.

772
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,341
I have something to tell you.

773
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:10,760
Yes?

774
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,853
Hey, Jeong-woo.

775
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:20,979
Theia!

776
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,389
What? Isn't she the leader
of Hokyung University's squad?

777
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,476
My goodness, that car must be hers.

778
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,979
Hey. You have something in your hair.

779
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,523
What's with the intimacy?

780
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,484
-What?
-Are they dating?

781
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,905
How did you know just by looking at that?

782
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,740
No way. It was a wild guess.

783
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,500
-Come on.
-What an idiot.

784
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,711
-You can't tell anyone. It's top secret.
-Okay.

785
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,674
This is insane.

786
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,092
Right.

787
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:36,846
Let's go.

788
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,022
Hello.

789
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,443
I said I wasn't rejected!

790
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,487
Then I guess you won't date any members.

791
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,530
That's right.

792
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,615
People might end up
getting the wrong idea.

793
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,534
Hae-yi has a boyfriend. And it's me.

794
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,161
-I like Hae-yi.
-Is there someone you have feelings for?

795
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,581
Hokyung's leader?
She's a legend at Hokyung.

796
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,833
We'll destroy Hokyung this year. Let's go!

797
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,753
I love you, Yonhee!

798
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,589
You're Do Hae-yi, right?

799
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,257
No one's shaking.

800
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,883
Just keep your eyes on one person.

801
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,218
That'll make things better.

802
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:05,268
