00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,657
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,583
So you wanted to join
the cheering squad since high school?

4
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,335
Yes.

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,213
Don't exaggerate
just because you're in an interview.

6
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,215
You're going to join something else
if you don't get in.

7
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,842
Not at all.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,890
I would try again next year then.

9
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,563
I really want to join the squad.

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,233
It's an honor…

11
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,947
to meet an applicant
who's this enthusiastic.

12
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,932
TO YU-MIN

13
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,520
LEE YU-MIN

14
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,311
BREAK THE RULES AND YOU'LL BE PUNISHED
ACTIONS LEAD TO CONSEQUENCES

15
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,864
CAMPUS FORUM: THEIA'S VICE LEADER
LEE YU-MIN GIVES SPECIAL TREATMENT…

16
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,865
Gyu-jin.

17
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,492
Are you really dating Yu-min?

18
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,454
SHE HAS ABUSED HER AUTHORITY TO HAVE
HER FRESHMAN BOYFRIEND TAKE THE STAGE…

19
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,005
Help me.

20
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,173
I'm locked inside.

21
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,055
POST ANONYMOUSLY

22
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,106
STOP DATING SUNG GYU-JIN
BREAK UP WITH HIM

23
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,566
You ruined everything.

24
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,613
You must pay the price.

25
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,625
-Oh, my goodness!
-We have an emergency! Call an ambulance!

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,542
Yu-min!

27
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,054
God had shown me then…

28
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,142
BREAK THE RULES AND YOU'LL BE PUNISHED

29
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,355
…that you end up being punished

30
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,900
if you break the rules.

31
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,306
My gosh.

32
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,645
You startled me, baby.

33
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,729
My baby.

34
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,940
Did I scare you?

35
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,567
Yes. My heart went "bomp."

36
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,361
My poor baby.

37
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,947
Your heart must have gone ouchy.

38
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,157
-That's right. What should we do?
-What do we do?

39
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,910
Do a proper job. Make yourself scarier.

40
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,662
-Hey, you're here.
-Hi.

41
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,790
Yeong-woong should go near the stairs

42
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,918
and you should go near the ER.

43
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,920
I don't think that's a good idea.

44
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,172
Why don't I just stay here with Ji-young?

45
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,633
Well, that's--

46
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,885
Just do as he says.

47
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,762
Thank you.

48
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,769
I can't believe he's still the head
of the planning team despite how he is.

49
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,064
They say he's been hardworking
since he was an active member.

50
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,990
I told you to go alone.

51
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,241
Am I a sidekick to you?

52
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,368
You didn't see
how down I was today, did you?

53
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,870
Of course you didn't.

54
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,081
You were too busy
hanging out with Jeong-woo to notice.

55
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,042
I was always the one to look after you.

56
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,419
I'm sick of always having to
play along with you.

57
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,924
Surprise!

58
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,803
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday.

59
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,929
Happy birthday.

60
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,649
Gosh, he scared me.

61
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,116
-Are you all right?
-What?

62
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,618
-Of course.
-I mean, earlier…

63
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,913
You should have told me if you knew.

64
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,456
They said it was a surprise.

65
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,168
I didn't have to be so harsh on her.

66
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,045
You two must be really close.

67
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,633
I don't know what that's like,

68
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,138
so I don't know what I should say to you.

69
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,183
Right. What was that thing about?

70
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,730
Yu-min said she saw you when you were
a high schooler three years ago.

71
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,399
Oh, that.

72
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,913
What do you think?
It really motivates you, doesn't it?

73
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes.

74
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,755
Good job today.

75
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,048
-You too.
-You too.

76
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,759
Excuse me.

77
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,929
Sorry? Do you mean me?

78
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,515
This is my nephew.

79
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,309
He's in his senior year in high school.

80
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,437
He was so smitten
with your performance tonight

81
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,605
and wants to study at Yonhee.

82
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,523
If it's okay,

83
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,109
could he take a picture with you
so that he can ace the CSAT?

84
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,028
I see. Just a moment, please.

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,992
She could have just refused.

86
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,953
I don't need a photo.

87
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,582
Aren't you hungry?

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,834
Wait!

89
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,795
Here.

90
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,589
This is so that you can ace the CSAT.

91
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,382
YONHEE UNIVERSITY
CHEERING SQUAD

92
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,092
Here we go.

93
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,761
One, two, three.

94
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,472
One more. One, two, three.

95
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,354
No way. Then did you really
retake the exam three times to do this?

96
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,939
I'd say you're obsessed.

97
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,982
I am.

98
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,485
Gosh. Don't admit it just like that.

99
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,362
I wanted to belong here

100
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,615
since I haven't really
belonged anywhere before.

101
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:59,163
I kept thinking about
coming here and held on…

102
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,257
and before I knew it,

103
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,259
I was obsessed.

104
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,176
Listen.

105
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,221
I think everyone already knows, but…

106
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,724
-Jeong-woo and I--
-Don't say it.

107
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,019
I'll just pretend not to know, so don't.

108
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,690
We decided to forget about
our kiss in Busan too.

109
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,277
And we'll forget you ever rejected me.

110
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,861
Let's just stay as friends.

111
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,867
I get that I don't have a say
in how you feel,

112
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,661
but the problem is

113
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,455
that I don't have
control over mine either.

114
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,000
So I've been thinking…

115
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,793
I'll just leave it as is

116
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,588
and do what my heart tells me to.

117
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,634
If you're more comfortable
having me as a friend, do as you wish.

118
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,344
But to me,

119
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,889
you're more than just that.

120
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,727
Isn't that a bit weird?

121
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,982
You can do what your heart tells you
and I'll do the same.

122
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,192
How about it?

123
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,903
Why don't you just curse me out?

124
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,240
I don't want to.

125
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,620
I'll take a look over there.

126
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,496
Let's find Jeong-woo and win the prize.

127
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,542
I found you.

128
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,889
What on earth is going on?

129
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,372
It's a tray.

130
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,124
It was just a tray.

131
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,668
Yes, just a tray.

132
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,545
Why was I scared?

133
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,672
There's nothing here.

134
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,474
My gosh!

135
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,358
Wait, I…

136
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,416
You scared me.

137
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,795
I got you.

138
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,713
Darn it.

139
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,133
LOSERS ROOM

140
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,477
That night…

141
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,397
I know you did that because you were

142
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,900
looking out for me.

143
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,236
-Hey!
-What's he doing?

144
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,279
Hey, come on.

145
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,073
You've crossed the line.

146
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,747
I shouldn't have said that.

147
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,046
I should be the one apologizing.

149
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,465
I should have known my place.

150
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,222
But…

151
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,767
can I cross the line once more
since I'm at it?

152
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,686
I…

153
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,110
think you're very precious.

154
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,032
That's why…

155
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,162
I want you to stop seeing men

156
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,373
who keep hurting you.

157
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,628
You deserve much better than that.

158
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,639
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,893
It wasn't my place
to tell you such things.

160
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,231
I need to use the restroom.

161
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,090
Jeong-woo.

162
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,805
Jeong-woo.

163
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,267
What the heck?

164
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,730
Is this supposed to be funny?

165
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,036
Jeong-woo.

166
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,122
Anyone?

167
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,959
Jeong-woo!

168
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,512
You need to be punished
for breaking the rules.

169
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,285
I got you.

170
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,746
Fine.

171
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,331
You win.

172
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll admit defeat like a man.

173
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,337
Jeong-woo!

174
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,755
Jeong-woo!

175
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,176
Jeong-woo, a fire broke out!

176
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,397
Sleepyhead! Are you all right? Hey!

177
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,356
Sleepyhead!

178
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,691
Open your eyes, Hae-yi!

179
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,651
Hae-yi!

180
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,704
Are you all right?

181
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,080
Hurry downstairs.

182
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,374
Didn't I tell you to go outside?

183
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,500
Get out of here.

184
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,419
We can't find Seon-ja and Hae-yi.

185
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,464
We need to find them.

186
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,176
I'm in charge of your safety too.
I'll go look for them myself.

187
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,113
Are they all right?

188
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,657
-She's okay.
-We should get out of here.

189
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,826
-Let's get to the first floor.
-Hurry.

190
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,411
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

191
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,204
This way.

192
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,999
Please, Hae-yi. Hang in there.

193
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,376
She's okay, right?
Is she going to be all right?

194
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,712
Will the guardian come here?

195
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,921
Push.

196
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,260
-We'll be there after we sort things out.
-Okay.

197
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,261
Let me come too.

198
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,347
Jeong-woo will call us.
Don't worry too much.

199
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,225
We'll close the door.

200
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,649
Another ambulance is coming, so hold on.

201
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,693
Are you all right?

202
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,620
Hae-yi.

203
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,832
Sleepyhead.

204
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,335
Hae-yi.

205
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,385
Sleepyhead.

206
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,852
The doctor said she'll be okay.

207
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,486
Are you all right?

208
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,404
It's just a light burn. I'm fine.

209
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,367
If it wasn't for you,
Hae-yi might have died.

210
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,620
You saved her life. Thank you.

211
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,956
I just did what I had to.

212
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,167
Jeong-woo.

213
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,336
Can we talk?

214
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,966
Sleepyhead.

215
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,226
The police said that
it looked like an accident

216
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,145
caused by worn-out wiring and humidity.

217
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,355
What about the door?

218
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,483
-The door?
-Seon-ja said the door was locked.

219
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,696
Why that door, of all of them?

220
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,454
Sleepyhead. Are you all right?

221
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,540
Where am I?

222
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,292
She's awake.

223
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,128
Are you all right?

224
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,881
I'm fine.

225
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,509
I'm so relieved.

226
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,471
Thank goodness.

227
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,267
I'm fine.

228
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,812
I'm okay.

229
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,901
But what happened?

230
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,028
Jin-il saved you.

231
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,907
Thank you.

232
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,824
It's nothing.

233
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,327
I'll go get the doctor.

234
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,305
What are you doing?

235
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,600
Gosh, you never listen.

236
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,684
Darn you.

237
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,813
They said you needed absolute rest.

238
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,358
I'm just fine,
so why are you telling me to lie in bed?

239
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,235
I've missed work for the past few days.

240
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,862
Do you know how bad
inhaling all that fume is?

241
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,989
That stuff goes right to your lungs.

242
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,367
Stop talking and drink this.

243
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,787
I've lost count of how many bowls
of water kimchi I had.

244
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,790
I might end up bleeding
water kimchi at this rate.

245
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,335
And I looked it up online,

246
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,962
but people say it's useless.

247
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,923
Be quiet. It's all lies.

248
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,176
Since long ago, people drank water kimchi

249
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,470
to recover from inhaling toxins.

250
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,388
Open up.

251
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,932
Go on and drink it.

252
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,059
At least give me some noodles
to have with it.

253
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,270
Do I have to feed you this every time?

254
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,855
Gosh, there we go. Good girl.

255
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,649
That's my girl.

256
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,192
Who is it?

257
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,902
Finish it.

258
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,654
-I wonder who it is.
-Who is it?

259
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,620
You didn't have to come all this way.
Hae-yi's in there.

260
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,831
Hae-yi. Seon-ja's here.

261
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,007
Those are pears and this is water kimchi.

262
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,842
You keep bringing us food.

263
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,302
-It's nothing.
-Thanks.

264
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,345
-I'll get these pears ready for you.
-Okay.

265
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,306
-Thank you.
-I'll leave you to it.

266
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,558
Hey.

267
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,070
Gosh, Seon-ja.

268
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,657
They're so good.
It must be because they're locally grown.

269
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,867
It tastes

270
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,786
just like honey.

271
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,747
You're exaggerating.

272
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,290
It really does. Try it.

273
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,542
It's so good--

274
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,171
See? It's good, isn't it?

275
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,548
-I'll go get you some more.
-Thank you.

276
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,966
I'm going to enjoy them.

277
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,096
Are you feeling better?

278
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,433
I think I am,

279
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,061
but I feel sick
from drinking too much water kimchi.

280
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,064
I guess you're doing better
since you're cracking jokes.

281
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,775
I'm home.

282
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,194
Jae-yi.

283
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
You're here.

284
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,158
I heard you have a girlfriend.

285
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,618
What?

286
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,953
What's wrong?

287
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,538
Was it a secret?

288
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,290
Are you a celebrity or something?

289
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,708
Are you happy?

290
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,920
Well, yes.

291
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,380
Right. That's all that matters.

292
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,966
I'll leave you to it then.

293
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,764
Bye.

294
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,685
You have the worst taste in men.
I don't get what you see in him.

295
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
You're one to talk.

296
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,564
You like stuffy old men.

297
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:28,782
Seon-ja.

298
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,576
About that day…

299
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,911
Which day?

300
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,249
When you got upset on your birthday.

301
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,462
I reflected on what you said
and it was all true.

302
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,926
I just keep running about saying
that I'm busy with work and everything.

303
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,678
You've always looked after me.

304
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,639
I'm sorry.

305
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,893
I took you for granted,

306
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,855
and I know I shouldn't have.

307
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,232
Come on. There's no need
to be all serious.

308
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,989
I spoke too rashly too.

309
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,827
I just did that
since I got worked up at the moment.

310
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,954
I'm sorry.

311
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,084
I'm so sorry.

312
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,212
I'll do much better for you from now on.

313
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,381
Come on. There's no need for that.

314
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,178
Don't you ever leave me.

315
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,263
Who will I hang out with
if I don't have you?

316
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,141
I don't have any friends other than you.

317
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,271
Although it's unlikely
that we'll end up being in-laws now--

318
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,189
Gosh.

319
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,401
But we should be friends forever.

320
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,114
You're right. You really don't have
that many friends.

321
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,991
So do better, okay?

322
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,242
Okay.

323
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,036
Come here.

324
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,705
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,541
-Thanks, Seon-ja.
-Don't be sick.

326
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,542
I won't.

327
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,420
Hurry and have this.
Should I get you more water kimchi?

328
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,463
Have this too.

329
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,216
No. Pears are actually my favorite fruit.

330
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,468
But my mom made the kimchi herself.

331
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,720
Gosh, it must be delicious.

332
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,264
How are Hae-yi and Seon-ja doing?

333
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,475
Fortunately, they're okay.

334
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,312
Jin-il did a good job. How's your injury?

335
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,688
I'm fine.

336
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,566
If it weren't for you,
it could have been bad.

337
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,235
What if someone got hurt badly?

338
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,861
Gosh, it would've been horrible.

339
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,571
I'm so relieved.

340
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,074
Why do these things
keep happening around us?

341
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,784
Maybe we need to perform an exorcism.

342
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,411
Do you think it really was an accident?
It keeps happening.

343
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,001
It was too suspicious
to just call it an accident.

344
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,463
Are you saying
someone did it intentionally?

345
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,508
Come on. You're just imagining things.

346
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,635
Who would do that? And for what?

347
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,053
We're not in a gang war.

348
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,138
This is just a college club.

349
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,182
I think you've watched too many movies.

350
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,059
It's because it happened
to your girlfriend, right?

351
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,729
People are saying
that you're dating Hae-yi.

352
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,107
She's your girlfriend? Is that true?

353
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,570
-So that's why--
-It's not because of that.

354
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,239
Don't you know how easy it is

355
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,324
for a rumor to spread
when the leader dates a freshman?

356
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,909
How can you call yourself a leader?

357
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,995
It's not like it's never happened before.

358
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,163
You dated a member too.

359
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,082
Well…

360
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,335
I heard you did too.

361
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,504
That's what Jin-seob told me.

362
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,219
That's ancient history.

363
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,891
I'll be cautious not to cause
any more trouble this year.

364
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,018
Don't worry.

365
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,437
Look at you. You're so confident.

366
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,440
Such a rule is there
because there's always a problem

367
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,774
when members start dating.

368
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,110
Yu-min experienced the same.

369
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,202
Forbidding them from dating
is just so backward.

370
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,788
They're always training together,

371
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,875
so it's only natural.
It's about time we got rid of that rule.

372
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,961
That's right. We don't have anyone
to replace Jeong-woo anyway.

373
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,968
But they still broke the rule.

374
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,012
If we let it slide,

375
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,973
the others won't see any reason
to follow the rules either.

376
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,309
Don't be so hardheaded.

377
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,603
You have to be a little flexible at times.

378
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,563
What if you end up dating someone too?

379
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,075
-That's all then.
-Goodbye.

380
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,496
How about a drink later?

381
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,165
I don't know. I have to check my schedule.

382
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,799
So why did he have to bring that up?

383
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,279
-Should we…
-Yes?

384
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,614
quit the cheering squad?

385
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,992
-Why?
-What if there's another accident?

386
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,495
Why do things like that
keep happening to you?

387
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,957
Maybe something is really up

388
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,959
like that video
the broadcasting club uploaded.

389
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,043
I know.

390
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,295
I'm a little disturbed too.

391
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,465
At times, it feels
as if I'm being targeted,

392
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,844
but then I ask, "Why me?"

393
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,850
Theia.

394
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,396
Jeong-woo. I didn't realize
you were such a romantic.

395
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,107
I guess you can't stand to spend
a single day without seeing Hae-yi.

396
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:55,942
I…

397
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,573
The third wheel will roll away now.

398
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,576
You better drink every last drop
of that water kimchi.

399
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,579
-I'll get going then.
-Thanks.

400
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,706
Don't stay out too late.

401
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,082
Okay, we won't.

402
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,592
I guess she's right.

403
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,096
I guess you really can't
spend a single day without seeing me.

404
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:26,973
That's right.

405
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,816
Quit?

406
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,487
I'm not telling you to,
but your safety comes first.

407
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,238
So I wanted to hear what you think.

408
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,240
So you don't think
it was just an accident?

409
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,493
Do you suspect anyone?

410
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,620
No.

411
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,954
But I just want to be sure.

412
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,544
You should have told me this
before the training camp.

413
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,047
How can I miss out

414
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,715
on the Yonhee-Hokyung match
after all that hard work?

415
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,467
That's just not fair.

416
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,302
I've trained months for it.

417
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,519
Let's give it some time

418
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,522
and see whether it was intentional
or just an accident.

419
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,691
And when there's a problem,
we should solve it, not avoid it.

420
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,278
Sure.

421
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,742
Are you sure you don't have any leads?

422
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,785
Tell me.

423
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,956
That way we'll be able to
work together to solve it. Right?

424
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,167
I don't know anything.

425
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,670
Are you sure?

426
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,263
I'll get going. You should head inside.

427
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,597
Bye.

428
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,765
Go and get some rest.

429
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,981
-Thank you for coming today.
-No problem.

430
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,000
YONHEE UNIVERSITY

431
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,836
-Hi.
-Hi.

432
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,463
-Hae-yi!
-Hae-yi!

433
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,882
-Are you all right?
-How are you feeling?

434
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,675
-Are you really okay?
-You are, right?

435
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,719
-I'm just fine.
-Really?

436
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,137
I'm perfectly fine.

437
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,725
I'm fine.

438
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,145
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

439
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,063
Yes. I'm fine.

440
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,404
I know how worried
and startled you've been

441
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,822
because of that accident.

442
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,866
I'll take greater care looking after you

443
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,328
so that something like this
doesn't happen again.

444
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,915
I've been wanting to ask.

445
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,084
Are you and Hae-yi dating?

446
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,177
Well, about that--

447
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,097
To make sure everything will be
fair and transparent

448
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,099
in preparing for the Yonhee-Hokyung match,

449
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,102
we've put Cho-hui in charge until then.

450
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,649
We'll do our best not to cause anyone
any discomfort because of this,

451
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,608
so don't worry.

452
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,280
And one more thing.

453
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,450
The poster for the yearly
Yonhee-Hokyung match is out.

454
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,370
It's your job to post these
on the notice boards.

455
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,873
And you should all work together

456
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,833
to have them up all around the school.

457
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
Let's go.

458
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,340
How many posters is this?

459
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,306
Since you're dating Jeong-woo…

460
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,769
Can't you ask him
if he could go easy on our training?

461
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,855
Maybe he'll listen
if you ask him personally.

462
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,482
He won't.

463
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,359
He has no compassion.

464
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,404
You saw how he treated me

465
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,614
during training camp.

466
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,991
Is that all you've got?

467
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,746
-We did.
-Right.

468
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,123
Wait, guys.

469
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,626
Are you sure they're the only ones
who started dating after we've been away?

470
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,212
You better come clean.

471
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,297
I may not look that way, but I'm quick to…

472
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,052
Hold on. Seon-ja, you…

473
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,309
-You and Yong-il!
-What?

474
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,230
You're just so clueless, aren't you?

475
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,858
Let me be totally honest with you.

476
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,901
I won't date him
even if he was the last man on earth.

477
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,573
Hey. I've seen numerous posts on the forum
saying that I look cute.

478
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,866
Show us then.

479
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,368
Go on.

480
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,913
"I always thought only the popular kids
joined the cheering squad."

481
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:05,001
"But I was surprised to see
this one nerdy guy at the festival."

482
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,627
They called you a nerd.

483
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,922
"You mean that quiet and creepy one?"

484
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,052
"He usually wears glasses,
and he looks like a total loser."

485
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,762
This isn't it.

486
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,142
Why would they go after
someone's looks like that?

487
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,727
Don't let it get to you.

488
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,854
They never said it was Min-jae.

489
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,898
Hey. They mentioned the glasses.

490
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,524
Glasses? I don't wear them.

491
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,110
Just be quiet, will you?

492
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,529
Let's get to work.

493
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,864
-Right.
-Let's go.

494
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,158
-I know I saw it.
-It's already noon.

495
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,332
Do you need a hand?

496
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,249
Sure.

497
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,129
What do I need to do?

498
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:54,050
You need to use the rubber bands
to bundle them up in fives.

499
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,844
Are you fully recovered now?

500
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,138
Yes. I feel fine.

501
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,516
Are you sure?

502
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,311
Look. Do you see my muscles?

503
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,902
We decided to forget about
our kiss in Busan too.

504
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,279
And we'll forget you ever rejected me.

505
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,369
That's nothing. Look at mine.

506
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,167
Mine are just as big as yours.

507
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,671
See?

508
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,714
-It's huge, right?
-Not bad.

509
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,758
It's rock-hard, isn't it?

510
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,555
What are you doing?

511
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,224
I was on my way out.

512
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,475
So why were you…

513
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:45,893
Right.

514
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,063
I remembered that I left something
in my office.

515
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,740
She touched his arm.

516
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,412
I'm so upset right now.

517
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,874
I'm so peeved.

518
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,250
Oh, right.

519
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,171
I wonder how I ended up thinking
that they were talking about you earlier.

520
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,173
I should get my eyes checked.

521
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,175
I don't look like I belong here.

522
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,927
I know that much.

523
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,845
It's fine.

524
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,473
Do you think you can trust me, kiddo?

525
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,601
What?

526
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,146
MUST-READS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS

527
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,486
I've accepted it, and so should you.

528
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,073
You need to see that we don't
always have a say in how others feel.

529
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,417
Honey.

530
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,214
What are you doing here so early?

531
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,258
You didn't even call.

532
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,014
Right.

533
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,976
I have something to tell you.

534
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,732
Good work, everyone.

535
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,572
-I'm beat.
-I'm so hungry.

536
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,621
Can I have one too?

537
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,915
-You can have it all.
-Thank you.

538
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,586
Give me one too.

539
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,130
HAE-YI

540
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,759
I don't have work tonight.
Do you want to go see a movie?

541
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,732
You've been busy lately.

542
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,569
-I thought seeing this would pick you up.
-But this is expensive.

543
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,281
The seats aren't that good. I'm sorry.

544
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,701
These seats are amazing. They're perfect.

545
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,711
Are you happy?

546
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:21,424
I told you that's not how you do it!
When will you learn?

547
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,261
Right. This isn't how you do it.

548
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,721
It's like this.

549
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,181
Cut it out.

550
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,183
It's not like you're cheating or anything.

551
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,478
Then you enjoy yourselves.

552
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,524
Your acting was terrible.

553
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,276
I was nervous.

554
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,111
It's fine. You did great.

555
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,613
I know how you feel right now.

556
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,490
I'm just fine.

557
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,369
Stop it.

558
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,374
I said stop!

559
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,628
Gosh, maybe I shouldn't have
patted you on the head.

560
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,673
Why? But I like it when you do that.

561
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,176
-Really?
-Do it again.

562
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,225
Pat, pat.

563
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,397
-Happy?
-Yes.

564
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,297
It feels a little awkward.

565
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,470
Then can you please keep feeling awkward?

566
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,599
I guess I like the awkward type.

567
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,522
Aren't you glad
that you trusted me, kiddo?

568
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,191
Strictly speaking, I'm older than you.

569
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,193
Forget that and buy me a meal to thank me.

570
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,070
Sure. I'll do that.

571
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,366
But why did you do this for me?

572
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,785
You were the first
to give me a birthday present.

573
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,329
Right.

574
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,499
And so that you could be more confident.

575
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,168
You seem to think too little of yourself.

576
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,548
This makeover could be
the turning point in your life.

577
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,843
Frankly speaking,

578
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,054
you were the one who wanted
to be on the cheering squad the most

579
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,931
and you also work the hardest.

580
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,603
None of us deserve to be in the squad
if you don't deserve it.

581
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:42,940
Thanks.

582
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,112
I'm going to have something expensive.

583
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,156
I think I saw
a barbecue place around here.

584
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,241
Wait, I spent a bit too much today.

585
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,620
I have feelings for someone else.

586
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,293
I came today to tell you this. I'm sorry.

587
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,047
You could have just texted me.
Why would you waste my time like this?

588
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,049
Well, I thought maybe

589
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,552
this was the right way to tell you.

590
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,512
This is even worse.

591
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,640
It's not like we even dated.
We only went on a couple of dates.

592
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,268
I came here light-heartedly
as if going to a convenience store.

593
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,063
People might think
that I've fallen head over heels for you.

594
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,232
Right? Exactly.

595
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,443
I guess I was too serious.

596
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,404
Are you done? I can go, right?

597
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,281
Sure.

598
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,541
Who is it? Who is it that you…

599
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,803
Didn't you go to see Woon-chan?

600
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,723
Hey, Woon-chan…

601
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,644
What about him?

602
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,024
He asked me out.

603
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,239
But I rejected him.
It turns out he wasn't that great.

604
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,785
I see.

605
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,706
I wonder if he's okay.

606
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,003
Someone who attended the training camp

607
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,005
and also knows
what happened two years ago.

608
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,883
Other than you and me…

609
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,426
PARK JEONG-WOO
TAE CHO-HUI

610
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,427
TRAINING CAMP ATTENDANCE LIST

611
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,428
There are five.

612
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,979
Something was actually
weighing on my mind.

613
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,273
Two years ago,

614
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,359
I kept feeling as if
someone was following me around.

615
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,071
I caught a glimpse of the man
whom I believed to be my stalker,

616
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,533
and he was definitely smaller than Soo-il.

617
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,412
I heard it was you.

618
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,413
Yes.

619
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:04,999
I'm sorry.

620
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,127
So why did Soo-il say that it was him?

621
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,588
I don't know.

622
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,216
Maybe this is all a coincidence
and we're reading too much into it.

623
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,804
Like that'll do you any good.

624
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,232
No, this is too thick.

625
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,735
What are you doing?

626
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,989
Has there been a war in your room?

627
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,242
Why do I only have clothes like these?

628
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,911
I need something fancy
to wear to a musical.

629
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:44,747
Mom.

630
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,915
Help me pick one of these two.

631
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,500
-Which one?
-They both look great.

632
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,003
You look great.
You'll be fine wearing anything.

633
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,046
Wait, this--

634
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,341
These are in different colors
and they're completely different.

635
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,602
Mom.

636
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,069
Mom?

637
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,659
Mom!

638
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,244
Mom!

639
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,580
Mom!

640
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,624
Wake up!

641
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,418
Mom!

642
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,216
JIN SEON-HO

643
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:38,884
Hello?

644
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,889
What? My mom?

645
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,100
She's here.

646
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,103
Why do you keep calling me?

647
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,979
He wants to talk to you.

648
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,523
Me? Who is it?

649
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,651
-Seon-ho.
-Seon-ho?

650
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,653
-What for?
-I have no idea.

651
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,657
Hello?

652
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,991
HAE-YI

653
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,662
Hold on.

654
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,542
I don't think I can make it today.

655
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,461
Something came up urgently.

656
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,379
Really?

657
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,381
What's up?

658
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,298
Well…

659
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,676
I'll tell you later.

660
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,512
I'm so sorry. You must have
gone out of your way to get this for me.

661
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,015
Seon-ho. No, sit back down.

662
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,060
That's fine with me,

663
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,105
but it's not bad news, is it?

664
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,692
It's not regarding me.

665
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,278
Anyway, don't worry too much.

666
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,530
It's not like that.

667
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,532
-I'm sorry. I'll call you.
-Okay.

668
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,458
Did something happen?

669
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,751
-No.
-Okay.

670
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,297
What did they say?

671
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,552
She drank too much
while she was under a lot of stress.

672
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,305
And she had decreased blood flow
to her brain temporarily.

673
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,434
Once she wakes up after the IV drip,
they'll run more tests on her.

674
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,270
Why did she drink so much alone?

675
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,650
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

676
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,573
You were the only adult
that came to my mind.

677
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,533
Don't say that. You did well.

678
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,286
You must have been startled.

679
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,423
GWANGHYE HOSPITAL

680
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,468
-You're back.
-Hey.

681
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,762
-Did you get everything?
-Yes.

682
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,847
-Let's see.
-This will do, right?

683
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,600
Gosh, it's perfect.

684
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,019
I'll stay with her.

685
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,395
Gosh.

686
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,024
It's better that I stay with her
since I know how to look after someone.

687
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,652
You can go home.
I'll call you as soon as she wakes up.

688
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,321
It's that I don't want to go home.

689
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,784
Then stay at our place.

690
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,789
You should cook him breakfast tomorrow.

691
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,999
-Me?
-Yes. What's wrong?

692
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:19,920
Go on.

693
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,756
Okay.

694
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,301
Get up, Seon-ho. Go on.

695
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,262
Let's go.

696
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,722
My mom will call you when she wakes up.

697
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,767
I'll call you, so go. Get up.

698
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,186
Go on now. I'll call you.

699
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,787
Mom's been hospitalized.

700
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,498
Is she okay now?

701
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,293
Do you think she'd be here
if she was okay?

702
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,093
Gwanghye Hospital.

703
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,698
Wait.

704
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,659
I'll just go home.

705
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,248
Well…

706
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,505
Jeez. What bad timing.

707
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,142
Should I stay for ramyeon?

708
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,436
Sure. Do that.

709
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,731
What flavor do you want?

710
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,025
Any is fine.

711
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,249
I'm home.

712
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,668
Hey, you're home.

713
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,173
Did you move into our place?

714
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,802
Why don't you have some if you're hungry?

715
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,804
I'm fine.

716
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,348
Could you put out
a blanket for me to sleep on?

717
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,727
I'll be sleeping over tonight.

718
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,938
-Hey, wait--
-You do that.

719
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,107
I'll go do it for you.

720
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,320
-Hae-yi.
-Yes?

721
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,363
Do you have any rice?

722
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,782
We do.

723
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,455
Are you sleeping, bro?

724
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,083
If you'd let me.

725
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,837
-So you aren't.
-I'm in my senior year.

726
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,506
I need to go out to study
early tomorrow morning.

727
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,258
Bro.

728
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,844
I like your family.

729
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,849
I feel at ease when I'm with you.

730
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,809
It's because we're not family.

731
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,813
We're not involved in any way.

732
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,982
I see.

733
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,359
So that's why.

734
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,072
Since when were you so smart?

735
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,490
From the moment I was born.

736
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,455
-Bro.
-Let me sleep, will you?

737
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,128
Fine. I'll let you sleep now.

738
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,342
Feel free to come over

739
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,637
whenever you want to feel at ease.

740
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,308
You can sleep over.

741
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,272
But don't come too often.

742
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,277
Thanks, bro.

743
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,449
Good night.

744
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,366
Dream about me.

745
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,452
Why the hell would I?

746
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,996
I'm just joking.

747
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,707
Good night for real.

748
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,599
You don't need to be
walking on eggshells. I'm fine.

749
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:43,683
Well, actually…

750
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,435
Sure.

751
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,354
Thanks.

752
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,315
What?

753
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,944
I was able to hang on last night
thanks to your family.

754
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,204
Hello.

755
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,373
Hey, we sure see a lot of each other.

756
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,833
I guess so.

757
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,668
What brings you by?

758
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,586
I came to hit on Jeong-woo.

759
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,922
Why would you…

760
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,844
So…

761
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,721
you came together.

762
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,056
Right.

763
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,267
It just happened.

764
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,936
You two looked close
since I first saw you.

765
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,106
Maybe they're secretly dating.

766
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,315
No.

767
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:36,194
That's just not true at all.

768
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,572
We'll get going then. Bye.

769
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,614
Let's go.

770
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,241
Go.

771
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,961
We should go too.

772
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,465
Jeong-woo.

773
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,344
Can we talk?

774
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,725
What is it?

775
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,979
Soo-il was found innocent.

776
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,318
They apparently forgot to record
three million won spent on fireworks.

777
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,657
I guess you've heard the news.

778
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,742
We need to talk.

779
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,911
Let's talk face-to-face.

780
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,704
Why would I do that, you punk?

781
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,123
I don't ever want to see your face again.

782
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,334
I need to ask you something.

783
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,002
I won't tell you whatever it is,

784
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,629
so stop annoying me and hang up.

785
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,172
It wasn't you…

786
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,343
who sent those messages, was it?

787
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,720
Why do you ask?

788
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,014
You know who it is, don't you?

789
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,141
You know who the real culprit is.

790
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,355
I'm hanging up, you punk.

791
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,738
They found me innocent.

792
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,617
-So?
-You're a little slow, aren't you?

793
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,037
That means you can't blackmail me anymore.

794
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,208
Were you perhaps the one

795
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,127
who started that fire
at the training camp?

796
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,048
So it is you.

797
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,801
You must be out of your mind.

798
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,177
That's a crime.

799
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,095
It wasn't me.

800
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,764
You shouldn't be so quick
to suspect people.

801
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,517
You acted as if you saved them
when it was you all along?

802
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,185
Just what is your goal?

803
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,980
Is that how badly you want attention?

804
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,940
That's not what I'm doing, damn it.

805
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,693
I don't think I should let you slide.

806
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,279
Brace yourself for a police investigation.

807
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,369
I didn't ever want to see Jeong-woo again…

808
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,831
but I guess I'll have to now.

809
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,500
Right?

810
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,214
I was protecting them!

811
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,969
By setting them on fire?

812
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,637
What the hell have you protected?

813
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,889
You should be punished
if you break the rules.

814
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,934
Both Yu-min and Hae-yi are being punished.

815
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,686
So who are you to punish them?

816
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,731
You were the ones who ruined it,
and I'm the one who protected it.

817
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,025
It was all me.

818
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,987
You're completely nuts, aren't you?

819
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,072
What a freak.

820
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,326
-No! You can't!
-Damn it!

821
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,578
Let go of me, you punk!

822
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,544
You bastard.

823
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,130
I'll have you locked up soon,
so you just wait.

824
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,923
Damn it.

825
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,304
Hey.

826
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,894
What are you going to do? Stab me?

827
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:56,895
You're nuts.

828
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,605
You crazy bastard.

829
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,649
You bastard.

830
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,359
-Hey.
-No.

831
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,403
-No!
-You must be nuts.

832
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,581
You bastard.

833
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,126
You creepy attention-seeker!

834
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,684
SOO-IL, WE NEED TO TALK

835
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,605
47TH RECRUIT JUNG SOO-IL

836
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,235
The person you have called
is not available…

837
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,851
Is he holed up in his room again?

838
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,228
Just leave him be.

839
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,231
Why is he always in there?
He should be out and about like a man.

840
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,947
BREAK THE RULES AND YOU'LL BE PUNISHED
ACTIONS LEAD TO CONSEQUENCES

841
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,744
You're being punished
because you broke the rules.

842
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,501
It's all your fault.

843
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,048
It's all your fault.

844
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,300
It's your fault.

845
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,472
It's all your fault.

846
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,140
It's all your fault.

847
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,809
It's all your fault, Do Hae-yi.

848
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,437
It's all your fault.

849
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,982
It's all your fault.

850
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,694
It's all your fault.

851
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,533
THEIA'S THREE PROPHECIES

852
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,826
ONE MEMBER OF THE CHEERING SQUAD
WILL END UP DYING IN 2019

853
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,290
It's all your fault.

854
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,572
ONE MEMBER OF THE CHEERING SQUAD
WILL END UP DYING IN 2019

855
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,949
Jin-il. Have you seen
Soo-il around lately?

856
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,035
I don't think Soo-il wants to see you.

857
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,036
A TV broadcast?

858
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,539
SBC asked if we'd like to showcase

859
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,624
one of our performances
during the Hokyung-Yonhee match.

860
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,918
Today, a few of the Hokyung University
Cheering Squad members

861
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,837
will be joining Yonhee's squad to train.

862
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,964
Actually, every day feels like
an anniversary these days.

863
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,883
It kind of scares me
to be so happy every day.

864
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,219
I feel that way too.
I'm so happy every day

865
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,220
because I have you.

866
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:03,891
