1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,866
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,603
What? Isn't she the leader
of Hokyung University's squad?

4
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,689
My goodness, that car must be hers.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,193
Hey. You have something in your hair.

6
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,737
What's with the intimacy?

7
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,697
-What?
-Are they dating?

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,118
How did you know just by looking at that?

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,828
No way. It was a wild guess.

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,667
This is insane.

11
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,085
Right.

12
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,672
-I need to go now.
-Let's go.

13
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,306
Hello.

14
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:45,939
What did you want to say?

15
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,565
Sorry?

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,483
Oh.

17
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,237
Do I really have to quit
if I start dating another member?

18
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,450
-What?
-It's to do with our emotions.

19
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,828
I just think emotions
are beyond our control.

20
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,287
Well…

21
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,623
That's…

22
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,377
Would you have a problem with that rule?

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,129
No. I was just curious.

24
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,590
I'm sure some people
went against the rule.

25
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,511
Well, we could further
discuss this matter separately--

26
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,013
Our squad has a hierarchy
and a busy schedule.

27
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,183
We banned dating since we don't need it
causing unnecessary problems.

28
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,687
Then I guess you won't date any members.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,234
That's right.

30
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,740
That's all I wanted to know.

31
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,386
HANGOVER DRINK

32
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,275
So these two are the new members.

33
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,318
-That's right.
-Okay.

34
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,361
We'll rehearse first
during the joint cheer.

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,196
You can do that if you want.

36
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,490
Your freshmen are really something.

37
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,120
What?

38
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,915
Is that right?

39
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,042
Well…

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,170
Then does that mean you're not quitting?

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,048
Yeah, I'll hang around a bit longer.

42
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,091
Good choice.

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,262
Don't you think
you're acting too friendly?

44
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,764
I guess you're right.

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,021
So Hokyung's leader is dating ours.

46
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,689
This is the most shocking news so far.

47
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,651
Good job to me
for being there during the reveal.

48
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,693
Isn't that right, Sleepyhead?

49
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,321
Hey, there.

50
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,156
Snap out of it, will you?

51
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,285
You were all hyped up earlier.

52
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,204
Why are you so down all of a sudden?

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,333
-Is this some kind of manic depression?
-I think I may have an illness.

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,210
-An illness?
-Something called narcissism.

55
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,963
Knowing you for too long,
I can't say you're wrong.

56
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,422
It was fine until recently.

57
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,967
Everything seemed to click, but now…

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,760
-What's wrong with her?
-Why don't we grab something to eat?

59
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,470
-Main building?
-Sounds good.

60
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,806
What do they have on the menu today?
Let me check.

61
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,940
About what you said to Cho-hui earlier…

62
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,358
Yes?

63
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,654
You asked if you had to quit
if you ended up liking another member.

64
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,197
-Oh, that?
-Is it because of me--

65
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,448
I was just curious.

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,242
You rejected me already.

67
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,743
Right? Exactly.

68
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,330
I was going to ask you
if you asked that because of me.

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,417
Don't worry. I won't leave
the cheering squad because of you.

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,377
I'm sure you won't. I'm nothing to you.

71
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,504
-It's chicken today.
-I hate chicken.

72
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,715
What? You absolutely love chicken.

73
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,092
No, I can't stand the thought of chickens!

74
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,385
I'm having something else.

75
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,431
She just had to shove past us?

76
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,808
-What's wrong with her?
-What's gotten into her?

77
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:14,605
NO COUNTING CHICKENS
BEFORE THEY'RE HATCHED

78
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,072
HANGOVER DRINK

79
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,953
Hokyung's leader?

80
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,705
She's a legend at Hokyung.

81
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,001
You see, you can't just sign up
to be the leader.

82
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,502
Last year, we…

83
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,504
This festival is crap!

84
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,840
-It was the worst.
-The absolute worst.

85
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,091
One at a time, please…

86
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,634
…had it bad.

87
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,554
But the competition at Hokyung
was insane last year.

88
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,849
And yet Ha-jin became their leader
by a large margin.

89
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,352
Everyone knew who she was
since she was a freshman.

90
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,771
You must know her pretty well.

91
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,938
Of course.

92
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,858
You know what else?

93
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,526
Her family owns
the Sung Un Department Store.

94
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,030
So she's a second-generation conglomerate.

95
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,031
Nope.

96
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,866
She's a fourth-generation.

97
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,205
To tell you the truth, cheering squads
hardly had any female leaders.

98
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,665
But since Ha-jin became leader this year,

99
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,834
Cho-hui was motivated
to become one herself--

100
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,836
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

101
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,588
Theia!

102
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,881
Aren't you going to train?

103
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,300
-Goodness.
-We were going to.

104
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,344
What are you waiting for?
Get up. Let's go.

105
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,720
Let's get moving.

106
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,019
What are you doing?

107
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,687
What do you mean?

108
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,193
How about we apply

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,239
some massage cream before we train
to help us warm up quickly?

110
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,324
This is neat.

111
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,289
So Hokyung's leader is pretty and rich.

112
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,129
-Hold on.
-Sure.

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,258
Are you all right?

114
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,468
I'm sorry?

115
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,469
Why do you ask?

116
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,430
Why wouldn't I be?

117
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,850
Right. Of course, I'm all right.

118
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,602
I was asking if you had a hangover.

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,022
Oh, a hangover?

120
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,442
Are you sure you're all right?

121
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,611
I'm perfectly fine. What about you?

122
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,029
I guess so.

123
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,281
That's good then.

124
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,074
How about we start running?

125
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,332
DO HAE-YI

126
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,632
You're Do Hae-yi, right?

127
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,550
Sorry?

128
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,511
I am. And you are…

129
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,764
We were picked as partners
for Western Art History class.

130
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,849
You missed that class.

131
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,143
Right, I see.

132
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,022
If you give me your number, I'll send you
the details of our assignment.

133
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:01,939
Okay.

134
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,277
Here you go.
You can reach me at this number.

135
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,446
-Okay.
-Thank you.

136
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,086
I'm just going to have one glass.

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,422
I promised your son
that I wouldn't let you drink.

138
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,509
I'm the one who pays your salary,

139
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,969
so why would you listen to Seon-ho?

140
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,474
Ma'am.

141
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,269
How desperate would he be
to beg the housekeeper to stop you?

142
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,147
You can't do this
if you care about your son.

143
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,607
Get a hold of yourself.

144
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,070
Are you trying to lecture me right now?

145
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
Maybe I was too lenient on you.

146
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,450
It won't do you any good
trying to be stern with me.

147
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,285
You're not drinking under my watch.

148
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,704
I guess you don't want to
work for me anymore.

149
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,289
Do whatever you want.

150
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,250
I have plenty of houses to work in.

151
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,419
You know how hard it is
to hire people these days, right?

152
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,214
Plus, you'd have to find someone
who'll play along with you.

153
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,175
I doubt anyone other than myself
would put up with you.

154
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,153
There's another bottle here.

155
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,409
My goodness.

156
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,579
I brought it with me
so I don't get caught,

157
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,038
but what am I to do now?

158
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,469
What's security doing?

159
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,305
We pay them a fortune,
yet they let a peddler--

160
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,018
The people here seem to love yogurt.
Must be because they're rich.

161
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,856
Damn it.

162
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,608
Jeez.

163
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,785
-Goodness.
-Excuse me.

164
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,622
-Take your time.
-I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,124
My goodness.

166
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,626
Don't make such a fuss.

167
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,504
You should've waited
for the next elevator.

168
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,882
How could you
just push your way in here like that?

169
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,926
Thank you for all your hard work.

170
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,310
That's quite an item
you're carrying around.

171
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,905
I'll get the door for you.

172
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,282
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

173
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,496
-Goodness.
-Excuse me.

174
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,040
-What are you doing?
-Here.

175
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,708
-Take this for me.
-Gosh.

176
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,751
Why would you--

177
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,711
Seon-ho, you're home early.

178
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,380
Are you going somewhere?

179
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,883
No, I was on my way home just now.

180
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,967
-Get on.
-Wait.

181
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,052
This--

182
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,262
Aren't you getting off?

183
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,555
I thought you were getting off.

184
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,809
Right. I was about to.

185
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,812
So this is your son.

186
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,688
He must take after his dad.

187
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,274
Goodbye.

188
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,665
What is this all about?

189
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,166
Gosh.

190
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,669
Goodness, it's heavy.

191
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,589
Here's your card.

192
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,299
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

193
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,718
-Goodbye.
-You too.

194
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,720
Welcome--

195
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,766
What are you doing here?

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,977
I'm filling in for someone.

197
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,447
Do you need a bag?

198
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,614
Yes, give me one.

199
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,241
That will be 7,750 won.

200
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,166
I'm always open to meeting new guys.

201
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,543
Let me know if you know anyone.

202
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,920
It's the ones who are dating
who are worse.

203
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,921
What?

204
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,590
Here's your card.

205
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,556
Did I say something to offend you
when I was drunk yesterday?

206
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,433
No, not at all.

207
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,851
You don't make mistakes.

208
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,686
You're the perfect leader, remember?

209
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,062
Take care.

210
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,575
Those bastards.

211
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,118
Why won't they do their jobs properly?

212
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,704
Those punks…

213
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,963
"M Callan"?

214
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,048
Let's see here.

215
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,758
1,150,000 WON

216
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,554
How can liquor be so expensive?

217
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,390
Unbelievable.

218
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,564
Stop.

219
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,239
You're here, Hae-yi.

220
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,493
What are you doing?

221
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,661
Jeez.

222
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,753
How many times do I have to tell you

223
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,714
how much you're spending
on cigarettes every month

224
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,300
and how much your treatment will cost
if you fall sick?

225
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,052
I quit. I did,

226
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:09,223
but I had a hard day at work.

227
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,516
Hand it over.

228
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,477
I didn't even get to light it.

229
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,528
You brat.

230
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,200
Happy now?

231
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,370
What's this?
The fine is supposed to be 50,000 won.

232
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,581
Look. I don't have a single penny left.

233
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,457
My wallet is empty. Give me a discount.

234
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,253
Okay. You owe me 19,300 won
after what you gave me,

235
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,839
but I'll let you off with 19,200 won.
Wire it to me.

236
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,465
Hey, but I…

237
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,302
Hae-yi. Damn it.

238
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,263
She must take after me. She's so smart.

239
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,224
Wait for me.

240
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,518
I said, wait for me!

241
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,195
Were you rejected by a guy again?

242
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,867
What do you mean? Why would I?

243
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,161
You were definitely rejected.

244
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,622
You always have trouble eating
when you get rejected.

245
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,790
When did I ever?

246
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,959
Back when you were in first grade…

247
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,086
Hae-yi, you're home.

248
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,421
Come and have some.

249
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,342
Look, I got you sweet potatoes.
They're your favorite.

250
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,509
I don't want any.

251
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,971
Why not? Just have some. Here…

252
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,058
How can love change like that?

253
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,401
Unbelievable!

254
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
Yeong-chil or whatever his name was
rejected you

255
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,948
and you cried for days without eating.

256
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,282
In seventh grade,

257
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,202
you joined the Buddhist Club
after some eighth grader.

258
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,038
-Dig in.
-He said he was going to become a monk,

259
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,541
so you decided to become one too
and went vegetarian for a few days.

260
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,043
You sure you're not having any?

261
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,677
How am I supposed to
win him over from Buddha?

262
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,142
Just eat. It's good, isn't it?

263
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,562
You'll be fine.

264
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,774
Whenever you lost your appetite,

265
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,985
it meant someone rejected you.

266
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,614
This goes to show how diligent
your sister is in many ways.

267
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,408
Despite her busy schedule,

268
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,702
she somehow finds the time
to get rejected.

269
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,662
I said I wasn't.

270
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,166
Wait, didn't you also
come home crying a few days ago?

271
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,168
That's the second heartbreak
within a week!

272
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,294
I said I wasn't rejected!

273
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,880
Fine. Don't get mad at me.

274
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,634
Jae-yi. Are you
working on your math grades?

275
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,761
Do you know how hard I worked to pay for…

276
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,805
Can I do that?

277
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,226
Anyway,

278
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,732
you better raise your grades in May
or you'll have to pay me back double.

279
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,278
Where are you going?

280
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,780
To study to get better grades.

281
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,074
I didn't mean right now. Eat first.

282
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,328
Why does it always have to be
about money with you?

283
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,672
Stop bothering him.

284
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,716
He must be going through adolescence.

285
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,053
He was fine when he was in middle school.
Why'd it hit him so slow?

286
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,555
Just keep quiet and eat.

287
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
Did you wire me the money?

288
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,225
About that…

289
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,020
Can't you give me back 10,000 won?

290
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,273
-I need to go to work tomorrow.
-No.

291
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,943
Can't you just cut me some slack for once?

292
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,029
No, Mom. You said I was rejected.

293
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,989
I don't blame whoever rejected you.

294
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,449
-No!
-Hey. Look.

295
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,540
Thanks for lending me money
for my brother's tuition.

296
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,709
I'm so embarrassed.

297
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
DO HAE-YI

298
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,005
MAKE CALL

299
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:20,265
JIN SEON-HO

300
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,309
Yes, hello?

301
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,103
I didn't lend you the money.

302
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,688
No, take it. Thanks for helping me out.

303
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,109
Are you paying me back
because you rejected me?

304
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,985
Well, that's not…

305
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,280
Paying me back will make things
even more awkward, no?

306
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,866
Would you have kept the money
if you hadn't rejected me?

307
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,243
It sounds like I bribed you.

308
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,079
I just didn't feel the need to stop you

309
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,790
since you were rich and had the money.

310
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,709
You're right. That's exactly what it was.

311
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,964
But isn't it right that I pay you back,
considering the circumstances?

312
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,841
Then buy me a meal instead.

313
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,718
-What?
-Get me something fancy.

314
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,848
-I see. Well…
-When I feel like it.

315
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,932
That will do, right?

316
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,394
Sure, I guess.

317
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,604
I won't accept the money then.

318
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,566
It's my money, so I get to choose, right?

319
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,861
All right.

320
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,156
I'll see you tomorrow then.

321
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,038
Why did I ever let him pay?

322
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,917
I should've known
that nothing in life ever comes for free.

323
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,924
These are must-read books
for college students.

324
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,551
I expect you to write reports on them.

325
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,554
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

326
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,849
Seon-ho, did you join the cheering squad?

327
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,933
Huh?

328
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,813
Won't this take up too much of your time?

329
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,106
I'm still in pre-med.

330
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,817
You can't waste time
just because you're in pre-med.

331
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,819
Things will only get
more competitive from here.

332
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,988
You have to focus
on more important matters

333
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,616
to steer your life toward a better future.

334
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,909
You know that, right?

335
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,535
Gosh, I do.

336
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,704
My goodness.

337
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,956
Don't try to charm your way through this.

338
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,001
Am I? That's not what I'm doing.

339
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,669
Goodness.

340
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,051
MOM

341
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,554
-Hey.
-My gosh.

342
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,556
Hey, did you eat?

343
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,183
I did.

344
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,768
-Gosh, what a bad hand.
-A bad hand!

345
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,146
-Come on.
-Serves you right!

346
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,522
Are you playing cards again?

347
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,191
Jeong-woo!

348
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,819
My boy, Dong-jin, got a job at Oseong!

349
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,658
Gosh. Jeong-woo could get a job there
in no time if he wanted to.

350
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,036
Goodness. Not everyone gets a job there.

351
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,454
My son is more than capable.

352
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,164
Dong-jin got the job

353
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,333
when he used to
ride on Jeong-woo's coattail.

354
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,293
What? "Ride on Jeong-woo's coattail"?

355
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,003
Are you serious right now?

356
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,339
That's right. I'm not wrong, am I?

357
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,424
Gosh, why are you fighting?

358
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,134
Enough out of you. Hang up, will you?

359
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,846
What did you just say about my son?

360
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,115
I always have trouble with this part.

361
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,413
Can you stop flapping around
and just go to sleep already?

362
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,582
Seriously.

363
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,630
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10
JOINT CHEERING EVENT

364
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,841
TUESDAY, APRIL 23
END OF CHEERING SQUAD GIG, GET PAID

365
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,430
Whatever.

366
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,017
That'll be it for today's lecture.
I'll see you again next time.

367
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,601
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

368
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,452
Move in sync with your members.

369
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,349
-I want to go home.
-That hurts!

370
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,976
My legs!

371
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,385
Harder.

372
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,961
Gosh, Hokyung's leader is so cool.

373
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,964
I wish I could buy her charisma from her.

374
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,134
I know. But I bet
it's too expensive for us.

375
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,929
Wait, doesn't that member look familiar?

376
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,222
Who?

377
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,849
Over there. Behind their leader.

378
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,606
We should also start getting ready.

379
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,733
-Okay.
-Okay.

380
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,083
CALMING PILLS

381
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,985
Does it fit well?

382
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,779
Yes.

383
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,203
It looks good on you.

384
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,417
Gosh, you look almost
as good as I do in that uniform.

385
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,419
I can't agree with that.

386
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,172
Never.

387
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,551
Gosh, those uniforms sure look great.

388
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,393
Why does he always seem so upset?

389
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,645
I really don't like him.

390
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,941
Hey, what are you doing here?

391
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,443
-We're here to shoot the rehearsal.
-Sure.

392
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,654
You were in the broadcasting club?

393
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,782
Yes.

394
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,958
You're in your uniforms. Do they fit well?

395
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,334
-Yes.
-Yes.

396
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,672
Make sure to keep the tassel in shape.

397
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,638
You have it on wrong.

398
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,683
I'll do it myself.

399
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,811
You can't be careless
when putting on your uniform.

400
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,828
So? How does it feel
to be wearing the tacky uniform?

401
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,000
Do you know how flirty you are?

402
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,756
People might end up
getting the wrong idea.

403
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,801
Why?

404
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,386
Did you?

405
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,150
Your girlfriend would
hate to see this sight.

406
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
Fine. You do it yourself then.

407
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,157
Just don't ruin the uniform.

408
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,591
Hey guys, change back
into your practice clothes

409
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,176
and set these on the stage.

410
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,427
-Okay.
-Okay.

411
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,139
HOKYUNG UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

412
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,390
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

413
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,487
Gosh, it's so heavy.

414
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,867
UNKNOWN USER
REPEAT

415
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,327
What do they mean, "repeat"?

416
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,913
I don't get why someone
would waste their time doing this.

417
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,957
-Sleepyhead.
-What?

418
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,584
Why don't you like me?

419
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,711
I don't.

420
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,464
Let me rephrase that.

421
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,594
Why don't you want me as a boyfriend?

422
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,182
Am I the first girl
to give you the cold shoulder?

423
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,936
No, but I was just curious.

424
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,020
I can ask, can't I?

425
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,356
People usually aren't curious
about that stuff.

426
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,690
They prefer not to know.

427
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,025
But I want to know.

428
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,735
That'll clear things up.

429
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,822
To be frank,
you seemed a little airheaded…

430
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,618
I mean, you seemed a little not all there.

431
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,203
What do you mean?

432
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,288
You asked me out
the moment you were dumped.

433
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,457
That made you look like a total player.

434
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,292
What else?

435
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,711
I'm sure there's more.

436
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,923
In all honesty?

437
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,218
No pulling punches since we're at it.

438
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,222
Well, I guess

439
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,725
you're too perfect.

440
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,229
You know what I mean.

441
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,565
I like it, but I don't.

442
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,318
I'm impressed at times
but not so sure at other times.

443
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,989
I feel so inadequate.

444
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,450
You make me feel small.

445
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,995
I'm not perfect.

446
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,458
Don't give me that nonsense.

447
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,923
I'm thankful that you treat me
the same as before.

448
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,595
But then again,
you weren't all that serious, were you?

449
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,558
Right.

450
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,064
Why is there so much to do?

451
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:46,868
Hae-yi.

452
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,498
You joined the band?

453
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,501
It's not like you
to join the cheering squad either.

454
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,629
You're forcing me to say the cliché line.

455
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,797
"What am I supposed to be like?"

456
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,884
We're not on good terms anyway,

457
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,928
so let's just ignore each other, shall we?

458
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,972
What's going on between you and Seon-ho?

459
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,059
-What?
-Are you dating him?

460
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,561
What's it got to do with you
whether I'm dating Seon-ho

461
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,189
or anyone else for that matter?
Just mind your own business.

462
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,650
He's just playing around with you.

463
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,361
There's no way someone like him
would really be into you.

464
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:25,073
So you think he's just playing with me
because he's better off than you?

465
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,033
Not everyone is like you.

466
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,159
That's not what I mean.

467
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,496
I'm just telling you to be careful
so you don't end up being heartbroken.

468
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,374
You're acting all nice now.
Have you forgotten what you did to me?

469
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,544
Don't worry.
I'm sure he can't be any worse than you.

470
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,964
I only did that because I was upset.
You're the one who started it.

471
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,592
You know I didn't really mean it.

472
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,636
Seriously. That's enough, Jae-hyeok.

473
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,223
I get that people see each other
at their worst in a breakup,

474
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,434
but I'll be embarrassed
about ever dating you if you keep going.

475
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,187
Wait.

476
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,565
Hold on.

477
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,609
I really meant what I said.

478
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,573
About how I want to get back with you
and the things I want to do with you.

479
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,616
I really meant it.

480
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,869
I don't think I can allow that.

481
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,495
Hae-yi has a boyfriend.

482
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,165
And it's me.

483
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,877
Is that true?

484
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,630
Yes, it's true.

485
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,218
So don't ever come see me again
over this matter.

486
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,345
Let's go.

487
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,486
You can let go now.

488
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,200
I could've taken care of it myself
without your help.

489
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,118
I know.

490
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,830
But that was the easiest and surest way,
based on my experience.

491
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,752
The planning team will join later.

492
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,712
Hey, Jeong-woo.

493
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,755
You come here.

494
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,511
What do you think you're doing?

495
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,100
I said, come here.

496
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,356
I see you're still quick to throw punches.

497
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,441
You shameless bastard.

498
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,359
Hey.

499
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,276
Damn it.

500
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,864
Hey.

501
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,450
I heard you suggested
that the police investigate me.

502
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,911
I suggested we do that
if there was a need for it.

503
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,829
Are you trying to make me an ex-convict?

504
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,582
Use your words
if you've got something to say.

505
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,000
I won't let you hit me again.

506
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,002
What? Say that again.

507
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,462
-Stop.
-Come over here.

508
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,673
Use your words.
I won't let it slide again.

509
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,842
There was a three million won discrepancy
in the accounting books last year.

510
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,303
Some of the expenditures
could've gone unrecorded by mistake.

511
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,764
You know how some of the guests
ask for more money last minute.

512
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,516
The truth will follow
with the investigation.

513
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,810
-You bastard.
-Calm down, will you?

514
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,353
-Soo-il.
-Come here.

515
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,146
You're sure you don't know
where that money went?

516
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,023
I'm sure.

517
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,111
With an amount like that,
it could've been an honest mistake.

518
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,696
But if we go public with this,

519
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,490
public opinion will only get worse.

520
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,742
And suspicions will only get bigger
if they're left unresolved.

521
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,370
We should eliminate
the infection completely

522
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,456
to stop it from spreading any further.

523
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,630
I'll talk to the other seniors.

524
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,799
You two stay put until that happens.

525
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,843
I trust you to do that.

526
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,600
Do you have something against me?

527
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,771
-No.
-Are you doing this because of Yu-min?

528
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,190
-Do you think I'm to blame for Yu-min--
-No.

529
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,568
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

530
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,036
Goddamn it.

531
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,875
Are you doing this because of Yu-min?

532
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,881
When you're tired,
your arm keeps dropping.

533
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,840
Watch out for that.

534
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,050
-My left arm?
-Yeah.

535
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,384
Gyu-jin.

536
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,471
Are you really dating Yu-min?

537
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,934
Wait, is that why you were elected
the freshman representative?

538
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,937
Jeong-woo, did you know

539
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,231
that Yu-min and Gyu-jin were dating?

540
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,317
I didn't.

541
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
-What's happening now?
-What now?

542
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,696
Why aren't you guys training?

543
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,286
What's going on?

544
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,873
Gyu-jin.

545
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,291
-Let's get out of here.
-Let's go.

546
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,557
2017 YONHEE FESTIVAL

547
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,077
Did you tell everyone
that Gyu-jin became the freshman rep

548
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,870
because he's going out with Yu-min?

549
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,497
Well, it's not entirely made up, is it?

550
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,626
You'd know better than anyone
that Yu-min wouldn't do such a thing.

551
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,378
Gyu-jin was--

552
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,880
People might think
you're the one who's dating Yu-min.

553
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,965
Jeez.

554
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,510
Are you that desperate
to become the leader?

555
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,346
Did you think you could become the leader

556
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,390
if you said those things about Yu-min?

557
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,183
I've been too nice to you, haven't I?

558
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,018
Listen, you punk.

559
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,270
I'm your senior.

560
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,065
If you want to be treated like one,
act like it.

561
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,483
Don't play dirty like this.

562
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,110
You must have lost it.

563
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,868
-Yu-min!
-Oh, no!

564
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,203
What do we do?

565
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,831
Are you all right? Yu-min!

566
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,377
Jeong-woo.

567
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,421
Jeong-woo!

568
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,175
Hey.

569
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,760
Should we begin the rehearsal?

570
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,555
Yeah, we should.

571
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,682
Let's go.

572
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,061
-When?
-A moment ago.

573
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,023
Let's show them with this rehearsal

574
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,691
who the real boss is!

575
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,859
Let's do this!

576
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,319
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

577
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,946
Everyone, get into your positions.

578
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,031
-Okay.
-Okay.

579
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,492
Get a move on.

580
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,911
Jeong-woo.

581
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,370
You all right?

582
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,748
I'm fine.

583
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,000
What on earth happened?

584
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,043
It's nothing.

585
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,339
I don't think you should be so worried
about the opposing team.

586
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,757
Go and get ready.

587
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,092
You were pretty good.

588
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,224
I saw you at the rehearsal. You were good.

589
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,309
You looked super cool too.

590
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,227
You were like…

591
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,148
I almost ended up cheering for Hokyung.

592
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,609
Jeez, you're funny.

593
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,363
I should've just kept you on our team
instead of letting you go.

594
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,327
-Are they dating?
-How did you know just by looking at that?

595
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,663
Ha-jin.

596
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,960
Well…

597
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,634
-It's important to hold on to what's old.
-What?

598
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,389
You should cherish what's old.

599
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,974
Jeong-woo.

600
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,059
Yes?

601
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,311
I have a boyfriend.

602
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,649
Congratulations.

603
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,818
It's only been three months
since we broke up.

604
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,487
Can't you at least pretend to be sad?

605
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,329
You know what?

606
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,165
When you found out
I was seeing someone else,

607
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,960
I hoped you'd get mad and curse at me.

608
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,423
But you were too nice to me even then.

609
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,637
It seemed you weren't hurt
since you didn't have feelings for me.

610
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,473
I was the one who cheated,

611
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,643
but only I ended up being hurt.

612
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,145
You had a rough time while we were dating.

613
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,231
You said you felt lonelier…

614
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,359
when you were with me.

615
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,612
What if I was okay with that?

616
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,409
I'm sure you wouldn't have been.

617
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,202
Is there someone you have feelings for?

618
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,039
Jeong-woo.

619
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,459
Let's go.

620
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,381
That was refreshing.

621
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,219
They want you to get changed in room two.

622
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:15,931
Sure.

623
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,437
MAKEUP ROOM 1

624
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,689
I couldn't stand her.

625
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,901
She lied to get out of training.

626
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,278
I'm not that great at not being great.

627
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,947
And she acted cocky
after being elected the freshman rep.

628
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,576
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

629
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,083
Now what?

630
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,669
It's about Hae-yi.

631
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,548
There's something
you need to know about her.

632
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,508
Hae-yi.

633
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,761
I believe you have some
explaining to do about yesterday.

634
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,304
I'm sorry.

635
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,184
What does Seon-ho see in her?

636
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,777
You know there's no excuse
for what you did, don't you?

637
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,196
I'm sorry.

638
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,325
You probably acted out of impulse,
so I won't tell the others.

639
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,952
Thank you.

640
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,079
I won't ever do it again.

641
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,830
But I can't just let this slide.

642
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,293
We'll talk again tomorrow
about how we'll handle the matter.

643
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,295
Okay.

644
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,425
Do you have feelings for me?

645
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,053
Just know

646
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,181
I can't stand people like you,
even if it weren't for Hae-yi.

647
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,359
There wasn't any need to be so harsh.

648
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,361
It's better to be firm than flirty.

649
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,327
I like Hae-yi.

650
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,585
So I'd prefer it
if you stopped toying with her.

651
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,423
It'd be even better if you helped me out.

652
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,804
That's not happening.

653
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,025
Sleepyhead!

654
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,194
You won't believe this!

655
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,250
Jeong-woo.

656
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,128
Mi-jeong went home
saying she didn't feel well.

657
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,546
What should we do?

658
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,760
Tell the planning team
that we'll be missing one freshman.

659
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,513
I can't believe this.

660
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,640
Just forget about her.

661
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,856
Keep your head in the game.

662
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,943
Check your uniforms
and don't show Hokyung any weakness.

663
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,821
We'll destroy Hokyung this year. Let's go!

664
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,033
Let's go.

665
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,869
Let's go!

666
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,412
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

667
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,622
What's gotten into her?

668
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,957
Calming pills.

669
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,085
She transforms when she takes them.

670
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,503
Let's go!

671
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,171
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

672
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,217
So-yoon's right.
Keep your head in the game.

673
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,678
I won't let it slide
if you make any mistakes.

674
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,887
-Okay!
-Okay!

675
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,766
Jeong-woo and Ha-jin.

676
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,851
They were exes.

677
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,276
Go,

678
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,611
Yonhee!

679
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,410
I love you,

680
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,703
Hokyung University!

681
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:14,086
Everyone scream at the top of your lungs!

682
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,285
-Step out onto the field
-Step out onto the field

683
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,746
-And you shall roar
-And you shall roar

684
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,041
-It will become…
-It will become…

685
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,004
Everyone in Hokyung,
scream at the top of your lungs!

686
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,132
-Step out onto the field
-Step out onto the field

687
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,385
-And you shall roar
-And you shall roar

688
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,972
-It will become
-It will become

689
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,559
-The everlasting rhythm of the nation
-The everlasting rhythm of the nation

690
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,062
-It will become
-It will become

691
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,274
-The everlasting rhythm of the nation
-The everlasting rhythm of the nation

692
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,827
-Hokyung!
-Hokyung!

693
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,622
-Hokyung!
-Hokyung!

694
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,416
-Hokyung!
-Hokyung!

695
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,127
-Hokyung!
-Hokyung!

696
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,004
-Hokyung!
-Hokyung!

697
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,633
You're shaking.

698
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,717
Are you okay?

699
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,720
No one's shaking.

700
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,263
This is nothing.

701
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,890
Take deep breaths.

702
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,355
I don't think I can do this.

703
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,272
Yes, I can.

704
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,941
I can't do it.

705
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,192
Yes, I can.

706
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,946
Just do as you practiced.
Then you'll be fine.

707
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:06,698
Right.

708
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,492
Don't look at the whole crowd.

709
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,702
Just keep your eyes on one person.

710
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,579
That'll make things better.

711
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,332
Okay.

712
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,836
Our next cheer.

713
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:24,341
Do you love Yonhee, everyone?

714
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,471
"I Love You, Yonhee"!

715
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,187
Let's get ready, guys.

716
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,147
-Okay.
-Okay.

717
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:32,618
We will perform the song
with our love for Yonhee.

718
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,786
I love you, Yonhee.

719
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,663
-"I Love You, Yonhee"!
-I love you!

720
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,604
Everyone, jump!

721
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,611
Everyone in Yonhee, scream!

722
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,649
I!

723
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,733
-I!
-I!

724
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,610

726
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,614
I!

00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,740
-I!
-I!

728
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,741
Love!

729
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,784
-Love!
-Love!

730
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,328
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

731
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,585
-I love you, Yonhee

732
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,297
-I love you, Yonhee

733
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,591

737
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,148
-You are my love
-You are my love

738
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:30,694
-In my heart forever
-In my heart forever

739
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,117
Don't look at the whole crowd.

740
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,244
Just keep your eyes on one person.

741
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,891
One, two,

742
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,935
three, four.

743
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:09,065
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

744
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,861
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

745
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,530
-You shall be my love
-You shall be my love

746
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:20,160
-In my heart forever
-In my heart forever

747
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,872
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

748
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:27,542
-I love you, Yonhee
-I love you, Yonhee

749
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,045
-You are my love
-You are my love

750
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:34,007
-In my heart forever
-In my heart forever

751
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,565
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

752
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,777
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

753
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,363
-Yonhee!

754
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,907
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

755
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,244
-Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

756
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,018
That was amazing.

757
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,770
I'm exhausted.

758
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:33,608
Well done.

759
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,463
You did great.

760
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,340
You were right.

761
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,928
It really was electrifying.

762
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,990
-Sorry.
-Where are you going?

763
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,410
We need to get on stage. Where's he going?

764
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,750
Yu-min.

765
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,838
I'm sorry.

766
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,382
I thought you were someone else. Sorry.

767
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,350
What is it?

768
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,893
What?

769
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,729
It's nothing.

770
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,522
Let's go.

771
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,907
This is the last one.

772
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,825
Let's go!

773
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,326
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

774
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,203
…reach the skies!

775
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,999
-High into the sky!
-Let's get ready.

776
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,168
Get ready!

777
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,463
Everyone in Yonhee, scream!

778
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,146
-Akaraka!
-Akaraka!

779
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,856
-Akaraka!
-Akaraka!

780
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,775
-Ara Ching! Ara Cho!
-Ara Ching! Ara Cho!

781
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,359
-Ara ChingChing Chochocho
-Ara ChingChing Chochocho

782
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,765
Watch out for the light!

783
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,261
Are you all right?

784
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,143
Are you all right?

785
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,991
Was it really an accident?

786
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,451
Are you sure it was an accident?

787
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,078
What happened two years ago?

788
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:03,039
-How about quitting the squad?
-I can just quit?

789
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,624
Should we go to the retreat?

790
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,627
But it was the cheering squad
that kept me going.

791
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,712
-Who are you?
-Just think of me as your son-in-law.

792
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,923
"Love your peers, love your country."

793
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,634
You're quite the romantic.

794
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,345
Jeong-woo's first and last love.

795
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,814
Will this be all?

796
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,107
What?

797
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,901
Damn it.

798
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,075
That will be 1,400 won.

799
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,164
Here.

800
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:13,693
