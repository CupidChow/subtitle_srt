00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,907
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,377
I like you.

4
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,673
I like you, Hae-yi.

5
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,190
Hae-yi!

6
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,443
Come join us.

7
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,577
Hae-yi!

8
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,538
Look at this.

9
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,040
I found this seaweed--

10
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,755
Are you all right?

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,514
You must be really drunk.

12
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,772
I can smell the ocean in the wind.

13
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,985
You can't do this to me right now.

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,279
What?

15
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,241
You're making me want to kiss you.

16
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,333
Hae-yi.

17
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,935
I…

18
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,270
I need to…

19
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,981
use the bathroom.

20
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,297
Do Hae-yi, you must have lost it!

21
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,841
Why did you close your eyes?

22
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,885
Why would you go in for that kiss?

23
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,889
But…

24
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,851
why would Jeong-woo tell me that now?

25
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,943
Wow, look at the stars.

26
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,905
Thanks for all your help.

27
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,366
Get home safe, all right?

28
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,243
-Thank you.
-Sure.

29
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,751
Where's Jeong-woo gone?

30
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,586
-Oh.
-Where is he?

31
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,504
Over there.

32
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,258
What were you doing out there?

33
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,385
Nothing, I was just…

34
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,680
I'll get going. Get back inside.

35
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,933
All right. Don't skip any meals.

36
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,226
I won't.

37
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,644
Bye.

38
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,732
Why does yours look bigger? Is it just me?

39
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,735
They're waiting for you. Hurry.

40
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,945
-Thank you.
-Take care.

41
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,572
Goodbye.

42
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,374
There's a seat over there.

43
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,461
Did you have fun?

44
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,754
Yes.

45
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:24,467
You've had enough fun.
You should quit the cheering squad now.

46
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,302
What?

47
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,138
You should concern yourself
with more productive things.

48
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,973
Can't I keep doing it?

49
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,768
I'm only still in pre-med.

50
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,811
Seon-ho.

51
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:40,691
You're on a different path
from the other kids.

52
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,362
You can't slack off
just because all your friends are.

53
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,783
I can't quit right now.

54
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,621
Seon-ho.

55
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,084
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

56
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,795
Is it because of that
daughter of Chun-yang's?

57
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,300
That's even more of a reason to quit.

58
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,469
I'm not quitting.

59
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,639
I'm all grown up now.

60
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,724
I should be able to call shots like this.

61
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,227
I'm staying on the squad.

62
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,812
All right then.

63
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,356
Since you're all grown up now,

64
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,860
you should learn
to take responsibility for your actions.

65
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,154
If you don't quit the cheering squad,

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,657
I'll take away your credit cards.

67
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,831
Fine.

68
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,042
Wait, Seon-ho.

69
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,962
I'm really going to do it.
I'll cancel your cards!

70
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,047
Why is he…

71
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,341
Hold on, is that really my son?

72
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,468
What's gotten into him?

73
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,930
What made him change so drastically?

74
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,891
Was it you?

75
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,351
Wow.

76
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,021
Jeong-woo asked you out,

77
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,398
but you kissed Seon-ho.

78
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,942
I can't believe I missed out on that.

79
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,071
I swore I'd never drink again.

80
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,490
Hello, apparently I'm crazy.

81
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,783
You really think alcohol is to blame?

82
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,704
Maybe you've grown feelings
after Seon-ho confessed his for you.

83
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,875
Wait, what's with that look?

84
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,045
So you're a lady of two hearts, Hae-yi?

85
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,298
Will it be Jeong-woo or Seon-ho?

86
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,967
Seon-ho or Jeong-woo?

87
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,720
Forget it! I don't need love.

88
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
I'll just go my own way.

89
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,932
Yes, I'm sure you will.

90
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,558
Go ahead.

91
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,646
UNKNOWN USER

92
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,730
Was it you

93
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,982
who sent me these?

94
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,862
Why do you think it's me?

95
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,197
Because I saw it.

96
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,325
I saw you check your phone
when I sent the message.

97
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,622
Yes, it was me.

98
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,043
-Why would you do this--
-Because I don't like Jeong-woo.

99
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,546
I didn't realize
things would get so out of hand.

100
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,382
It's not a crime to send messages, is it?

101
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,175
It was the broadcasting club
that blew it out of proportion.

102
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,052
Then…

103
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,348
was the light falling

104
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,101
really an accident?

105
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,894
It wasn't you?

106
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,063
That wasn't me.

107
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,525
Do you really think I'd go that far?

108
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,404
I just sent a few messages as a prank.
I didn't do anything else.

109
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,781
-We'll see after the investigation.
-You can't.

110
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,202
I'm practically a convict already
just for being under investigation.

111
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,620
Anything more than that,

112
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,872
and I'll be jobless
for the rest of my life.

113
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,709
What should I do, beg on my knees?

114
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,793
Don't.

115
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,715
This is your last chance.

116
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,217
If anything like this happens again,

117
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,470
I'll expose you for everything you did,
from start to finish.

118
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,852
I promise it won't ever happen again.

119
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,104
You better be right.

120
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,987
Damn it. Jin-il, that loser.

121
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,948
A DAY AGO

122
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,450
Damn it.

123
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,287
I'll give you my card, so use that.

124
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,373
And send me the money
from the ticket sales when you're done.

125
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,167
See? The three million won wasn't me.

126
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,377
Where'd you get this?
I was drunk that night--

127
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,796
Turns out I'm the only one
who knows where the money went.

128
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,881
Meaning…

129
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,676
I'm the only person
who can prove your innocence.

130
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,846
The wire transfer to your account
is too big of a proof

131
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,349
and you'll be charged
if you can't explain yourself.

132
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,225
Is that a threat?

133
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,144
You're meeting Yu-min?

134
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,105
Good.

135
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,942
Tell her you did it.

136
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,612
-What?
-At least this isn't a crime.

137
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,366
Better than being an ex-con,
don't you think?

138
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,576
"This isn't a crime"?

139
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,788
Damn it.

140
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,378
The festival marked the last of our events
for the first semester.

141
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,671
You can all focus on your studies for now.

142
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,383
We'll begin summer training
when the break comes around.

143
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,510
-Yes!
-You seem way too eager.

144
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,730
-Hello.
-Hello.

145
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,072
Guys, we have something to discuss.
You go ahead.

146
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,865
-Okay.
-Bye.

147
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,080
-Jeez.
-My gosh!

148
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,499
Seon-ja, I have something urgent!
Follow me!

149
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,708
Where are you going?

150
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,795
Is she avoiding me right now?

151
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,380
Why'd you have to bring me?

152
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,840
You run so fast.

153
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,302
-I'm so beat.
-Hae-yi.

154
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,598
Seon-ja! Hurry!

155
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,688
Is she avoiding me?

156
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,568
Theia!

157
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,126
Avoiding them won't solve anything.
It just makes you look suspicious.

158
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,296
What do you mean? I acted so naturally.

159
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,630
They can hear you.

160
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,258
What do you mean? I acted so naturally.

161
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,427
You're unbelievable.

162
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,055
The end-of-semester assignment will be

163
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,142
to go on a date with your partner
on a 10,000-won budget

164
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,269
and submit a report on that.

165
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,980
I've selected your partners randomly.

166
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,903
-Do Hae-yi.
-Yes.

167
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,530
You're partners with…

168
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,200
Park Jeong-woo.

169
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,173
Since we have more male students,

170
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:24,970
I'll let those of you without a partner
choose one yourself.

171
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,056
-I'll do it with Hae-yi.
-Okay.

172
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,904
This is getting interesting.

173
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,246
JEONG-WOO? SEON-HO?

174
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,254
Hey, they're hard to eat if they're round.

175
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,130
Make them triangular.

176
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,675
You never listen.

177
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,842
I hate triangles.

178
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,761
I can't stand them.

179
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,890
There's no need to be
so pointed and sharp all the time.

180
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,977
Why can't we be more well-rounded
and be friends with everyone?

181
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,728
What are you on about?

182
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,065
What is it? Are you in a love triangle?

183
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,025
How did you know?

184
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,027
It's obvious with you.

185
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,780
You subconsciously tell me
what's going on.

186
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,074
You kept going on
about triangles just now.

187
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,036
One of them has got to be Jin-hee's son.

188
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,580
Who's the other one?

189
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,875
Wait, is it the shorter guy?

190
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,878
-I thought he was kind of cute--
-Absolutely not!

191
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,547
And you know that young leader of yours?

192
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,215
He thinks too highly of himself.

193
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,343
He seemed like the type
to nag his girlfriend all day.

194
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,513
That's only because
you saw him at the festival.

195
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,474
He's not normally that bad.

196
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,143
So it's him.

197
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,189
-No.
-You make it so obvious.

198
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,733
You leave no room for questions.

199
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,695
But sure.

200
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,157
I'm sure he's better than
Jin-hee's son, at the least.

201
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,869
Your taste in men
has no business with me, Mom.

202
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,120
What's yours then?

203
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,498
Whatever.

204
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,755
Now that you're in college,
you're busy with all sorts of things.

205
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,883
That's right. You do everything you want.

206
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:30,429
You can kiss boys
and do whatever comes after too.

207
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,098
Mom, have you been buying stuff
from infomercials?

208
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,226
Listen, I must really be aging now.

209
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,438
I've been getting these chest pains, and--

210
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,190
But this is a little too much, no?

211
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,943
This is enough to turn
a whole man into a woman!

212
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,653
I need to take plenty at a time.

213
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,363
It's for treating the root cause,

214
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,740
not just a temporary measure.

215
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,327
Does it look like we can
afford to hoard pomegranate extracts?

216
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,707
Why does everything have to be
about money with you?

217
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,627
Because you bought more than enough!

218
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,837
Stop being so cheap.

219
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,966
I'll return them. Are you happy now?

220
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,680
Who am I to enjoy
such luxurious health items, right?

221
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,139
Fine, I'll send them back.

222
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,102
What you're going through
is adolescence, not menopause.

223
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,687
Why won't you grow up?

224
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,314
Don't just stay inside all day
and go get some air!

225
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,941
That's how you look after your health.

226
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,985
Do you realize

227
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,612
how cold you can be at times?

228
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,823
You're making me be that way.

229
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,576
Fine. Just leave it.

230
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,162
I'll take care of these.

231
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,580
Finish what you already have.

232
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,627
Gosh. Just my luck.

233
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,256
Right, who am I to enjoy such luxury?

234
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,179
Hey, Ji-young!

235
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,307
-My goodness.
-Ji-young, wait!

236
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,435
Can you spare me just one minute?

237
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,686
Why are you here?

238
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,022
Because I missed you.

239
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,690
You must be nuts.

240
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,402
Go and vent to your girlfriend
you're busy posting pictures of.

241
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,654
How dare you come to vent to your ex-wife?

242
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,823
I broke up with her. I'm serious.

243
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,534
She dumped me
saying I reek of a pathetic geezer.

244
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,745
I'm not that bad, am I?

245
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,080
-You are.
-I'm so sorry.

246
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,751
I must've been nuts
to leave someone like you.

247
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,461
-You're all I have.
-Stay away!

248
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,795
Stop!

249
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,549
Who are you?

250
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,177
Who do I look like?

251
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,595
I'm her boyfriend.

252
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,390
For her,

253
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,518
I'm the only man that exists.

254
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,358
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,986
Sorry.

256
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,904
My apologies.

257
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,501
When you said,
"I'm the only man that exists,"

258
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,960
the look on his face was just…

259
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,509
I thought it was pretty cool.

260
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,306
You think I'm pathetic, don't you?

261
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,520
I still hang around the school like a bum.

262
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,192
And I don't seem to have
any goals or ambitions.

263
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,073
But I wasn't always like this.

264
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,828
There was a time when all I had in life
were my dreams and ambitions.

265
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,579
I'll be off now, sir.

266
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,916
Back then, I'd miss meals and sleep,
working my bum off.

267
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,917
CEO
BAE YEONG-WOONG

268
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,963
Then somehow, I lucked out
and achieved success.

269
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,924
That's when my health went downhill.

270
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,646
I'm fine now, as you can see.

271
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,193
Then it occurred to me
while I was bedridden at the hospital.

272
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,908
"What is the point of all this?"

273
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,871
So I got rid of everything I could then

274
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,583
and decided that I'd live my life
doing what I wanted.

275
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,543
That's what I told myself…

276
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,216
but I couldn't figure out
what I wanted to do.

277
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,971
What could someone like me…

278
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:50,355
pursue in life aside from money?

279
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,065
That was…

280
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,277
the kind of man I was.

281
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,658
That's why I came back.

282
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,621
It was the moment and place in life

283
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:11,793
that I seemed to have enjoyed the most.

284
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,591
Goodness.

285
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,428
You've gone through a lot, haven't you?

286
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,600
But then again, I guess everyone does.

287
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,311
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,064
I was too quick to judge you.

289
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,077
What's this?

290
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,913
So you understand me now?

291
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,714
You're not expecting anyone, are you?

292
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,799
What?

293
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,343
Oh.

294
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,679
Of course not.

295
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,688
I'm hungry.

296
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,276
-Should we go to the dining hall?
-I want their pizza bread.

297
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,152
Should we order some pizza?

298
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,862
-I'll pay for it.
-Really?

299
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,281
I feel like going to the dining--

300
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,617
Have some pizza.

301
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,703
Okay.

302
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,038
Thank you.

303
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,166
Wow, do we each get a whole pizza?

304
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,168
PAYMENT 150,000 WON

305
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,670
PAYMENT IN PROGRESS

306
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,631
Do you have another card?
This one's been canceled.

307
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,549
I'm sorry?

308
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,050
That can't be.

309
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,012
PAYMENT IN PROGRESS

310
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,388
CANCELED CARD

311
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,348
This one too.

312
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,600
I'll take away your credit cards.

313
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,356
-Can we pay with this instead?
-Sure.

314
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,195
I would've been fine
with just pizza bread.

315
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,864
It's nice that we have a lot to eat.

316
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,783
Is everything fine at home?

317
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,583
Going down.

318
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,552
It's you again.

319
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,431
You too.

320
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,976
It's almost as if
you wait for me to show up.

321
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,772
You're keeping
your daughter in check, right?

322
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,900
She's not someone
I can just keep in check.

323
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,360
She thinks she's better than everyone.

324
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,237
You should tell your son to be careful.

325
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,365
She thinks she's so high and mighty
that she's above everyone else.

326
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,950
As if he'll listen to me!

327
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,079
Tell your daughter to be careful.

328
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,791
There's no stopping a rich, naive boy
when he goes out of control.

329
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,176
Going down.

330
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,761
Want to grab a drink?

331
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,698
All right.

332
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,619
How about we settle on a date?

333
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,037
Sure.

334
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,205
You remember, don't you?

335
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,708
I mean, what happened…

336
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,794
in Busan.

337
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,629
Isn't that why you're avoiding me?

338
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,052
Are you also avoiding me

339
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,763
because of what happened?

340
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,183
I like you, Hae-yi.

341
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,564
What happened?

342
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,650
Well, what he's saying is…

343
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,903
What's this? Some messed-up romance show?

344
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm not avoiding you guys. Not at all.

345
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,288
So let's decide on the dates.

346
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,958
If only I could avoid them.

347
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,419
Avoiding them won't solve anything.

348
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,671
So?

349
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,508
-What does your heart say?
-I don't know.

350
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,345
I don't know what it is that I want!

351
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,931
Since it's come to this,

352
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,101
make your decision
after you go on the dates with them.

353
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,188
Decide whether it'll be
Jeong-woo or Seon-ho,

354
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,190
or whether it'll be neither.

355
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,234
Make my decision?

356
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,988
Whoever it ends up being,
you'll need to decide between the two.

357
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,199
You're right.

358
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,658
I should.

359
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,160
As I should.

360
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,085
I just got home too.

361
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,713
Call me before you go to bed.

362
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,381
I love you.

363
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,591
I love you too.

364
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,228
You startled me.

365
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,855
What are you doing with the lights off?

366
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,316
"I love you"?

367
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,026
"Smooch"?

368
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,946
You have it good, don't you?

369
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,739
Dating in your senior year.

370
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,242
You dated someone in your senior year too.

371
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,667
You and I are different though, no?

372
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,544
Aren't you aiming for med school?

373
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,964
You should be spending
every minute studying away.

374
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,590
Get yourself together.

375
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,510
I'll take care of my own problems,
so you just mind your own.

376
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,347
You must've really lost it,
sitting there with the lights off.

377
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,266
Do you even know what love is?

378
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,767
You're too young to know.

379
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,856
Hey, lover boy.

380
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,317
Get out.

381
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,988
When did you realize you were in love?

382
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,197
I said get out.

383
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,202
I'm asking on behalf of Seon-ja.

384
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,080
Someone she likes
asked her out a few days ago.

385
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,333
But she kissed someone else
right before that happened.

386
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,630
And now, she's unsure
who it is that she likes.

387
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,466
What should Seon-ja do?

388
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,513
Do you have to ask?
She should date the guy she likes.

389
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,682
But I don't know who that is.

390
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,851
I mean Seon-ja.

391
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,436
You'll find out soon.

392
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,606
It just happens.

393
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,235
It'll come to you naturally.

394
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,122
-You must be popular with the girls.
-Me?

395
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,207
You're in the cheering squad,
have a great personality,

396
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,002
and I'd say you look rather cute
after a good look.

397
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,755
You seemed popular
from what I saw at the festival.

398
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,507
Of course. I am.

399
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,469
Is that…

400
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
why you liked me? Because I seem popular?

401
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,307
I never said I liked you.

402
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,143
Right. You didn't. Sorry.

403
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,854
But it's a plus.

404
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,231
That means other people
also see you as a nice guy.

405
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,611
I'm quite popular myself, you see.

406
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,905
Like a born-to-be celebrity.

407
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,449
I guess we'd make a celebrity couple.

408
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,745
Right. I guess so.

409
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,424
Woon-chan.

410
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,844
-Are you going to the club room?
-Yes.

411
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,142
I heard you met Ji-yoon yesterday.
That must've been nice.

412
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,228
Yeah, I guess.

413
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,565
Is it because of
what happened at the festival?

414
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,571
You seem a little down since then.

415
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,254
It's just embarrassing.

416
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,383
Why? They were in the wrong.

417
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,803
Because they were telling the truth.

418
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,431
I lied to them

419
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,392
that my dad was a big corporate man.

420
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,355
It wasn't completely intentional.

421
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,233
I told people at the orientation
that my dad ran a restaurant,

422
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,195
but word spread that he was
a corporate businessman.

423
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,782
I decided to just go along with it

424
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,411
because everyone seemed to admire me.

425
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,663
So…

426
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,041
it wasn't entirely their fault.

427
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,049
I'm actually a huge attention-seeker.

428
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,802
-What?
-I've always wanted to be

429
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,722
at the center of attention,
but nobody seemed to notice me.

430
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,182
That's why I joined the squad.

431
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,562
Though nobody seems to notice me still.

432
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,232
That's why

433
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,152
I know exactly how you feel.

434
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,742
So there's no need to be embarrassed.
I'm like you too.

435
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,665
You see,

436
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,335
I still haven't given up.

437
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,215
I still believe

438
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,843
there will come a day when I get to shine.

439
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,847
I'm sure it'll be the same for you.

440
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,314
My class is starting soon.

441
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,732
I'll get going then.

442
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,284
This is so hard.

443
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,848
I needed that to wake me up.

444
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,474
Anyone want one?

445
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,727
Is today the day of your big decision?

446
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,939
The day of her big decision?
What do you mean?

447
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,400
Are you familiar
with what's called a love triangle?

448
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,944
A "love triangle"?

449
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,948
You see, Hae-yi is a lady of two hearts.

450
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,408
She has two hearts?

451
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,078
One belongs to the tall--

452
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,247
Jae-yi has a girlfriend.

453
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,832
-What?
-What's going on?

454
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,667
Why? Since when?

455
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,836
I don't know. He says he loves her.

456
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,631
You never got to ask him out.

457
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,968
No way. I can't believe this!

458
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,595
See? What did I tell you?

459
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,390
So what?

460
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,268
You have an ex too, don't you?

461
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,813
What?

462
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,113
Nope.

463
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,157
It's none of my business.

464
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,202
-That makes no sense.
-It does for her.

465
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,121
Theia.

466
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,250
I'll see you later then.

467
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,419
-Okay.
-Bye.

468
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,089
Excuse me. Coming through.

469
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,383
What's happening later?

470
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,385
I told you it's the day
of her big decision--

471
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,553
I told you to be quiet.

472
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,180
Didn't you hear me?

473
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,557
-Hello.
-Hello.

474
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,560
I heard someone needed notes
for Modern Cinema History.

475
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,228
It was me.

476
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,194
You know it's hard to come by, right?

477
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,780
-Thank you.
-It's you, isn't it?

478
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,574
The high schooler from three years ago.

479
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,077
Three years ago?

480
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,502
I hope I look all right.

481
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,088
Hi.

482
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,423
Hi.

483
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,469
Hello?

484
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,100
-Cho-hui.
-Yes?

485
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,018
How do I look today?

486
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,855
You look bad as usual.

487
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,154
I guess this isn't it.

488
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,369
Yu-min.

489
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,497
-Do I look weird today?
-What?

490
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,125
Is it the color of my shirt?

491
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,545
I don't know. You seem fine.

492
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,462
Right?

493
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,548
Cho-hui always says I look bad.

494
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,466
You must have important plans.

495
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,761
Well…

496
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,931
I have an important assignment.

497
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,349
Jeong-woo.

498
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,185
-I need to tell you something.
-What?

499
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,106
-You're studying abroad?
-Yes.

500
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,859
I've been planning on it for some time.

501
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,694
That's why I came back before I left.

502
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,030
I thought I'd tie up
the loose ends I left behind.

503
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,657
Then you're not coming back to school?

504
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,121
I'm going to start again somewhere new.

505
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,373
-But--
-As for Soo-il,

506
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,167
he won't do anything like that again.

507
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,002
Because he'll suffer the consequences.

508
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,505
I'm glad…

509
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,884
that I decided to come by.

510
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,223
For the past two years,

511
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,852
this was a place I feared
and wanted to forget about.

512
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,398
But I see it now that I'm here.

513
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:35,490
I realized this place holds
countless precious memories.

514
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,877
I'm glad I visited.

515
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,297
If I had kept avoiding it out of fear…

516
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,553
all those precious memories
would have been lost to me.

517
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,766
I knew it.

518
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,185
You're still the same.

519
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,773
You face things head-on.

520
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,150
That's how you do things.

521
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,578
So four hours with me

522
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,206
and another four with Jeong-woo after me?

523
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,459
Yes. I only have time today
because of work.

524
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,963
I've planned out our date today.
Are you okay with that?

525
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,880
Of course.

526
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,341
The weather sure is great.

527
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,637
Sleepyhead.

528
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,222
About that kiss we had…

529
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,515
What?

530
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,392
Let's forget it happened.

531
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,687
Right. Sure.

532
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,273
You seem to be
avoiding me because of that.

533
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,026
If it makes you uncomfortable,
let's pretend it never happened.

534
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,529
Let's forget all that
and just relax today.

535
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,032
That way, you'll see
how great of a guy I am.

536
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,458
Okay.

537
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,877
Deal?

538
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,045
Deal.

539
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,174
Let's go.

540
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,720
The weather is great.

541
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,180
It's such a great day for…

542
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,015
I'm looking forward to our date today.

543
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,516
What?

544
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,102
Yeah, I told you the weather's nice.

545
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,033
Wow, the view here is amazing.

546
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,660
But we only have 10,000 won.

547
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,662
It's my friend's studio.
He told me we can use it.

548
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,497
-Really?
-It's free.

549
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,415
Yes!

550
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,711
I guess some people
can afford to live so lavishly.

551
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,089
What does he do?

552
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,554
I want to play.

553
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,014
-Sure.
-Can I?

554
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,767
I've never played this before.
Let's try it right now!

555
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,851
How do I play?

556
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,107
HAE-YI THE DORAI VS CRAZY OVER HAE-YI, SH

557
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,692
START!

558
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,403
Wait. Oh, no!

559
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,490
No!

560
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,492
No!

561
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,911
No! There we go.

562
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,541
Yes!

563
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,753
I won!

564
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,837
I think mine's broken.

565
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,632
You've got to admit defeat
to be a true warrior.

566
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,841
Is it out of batteries?

567
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,718
I'll let you win. Let's play again.

568
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,388
I think we get along great.

569
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,306
Huh?

570
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,268
I'm so happy I get to share
these little moments with you.

571
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,438
-Right.
-Aren't you hungry?

572
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,732
I'll make you some pasta.

573
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,152
Do you know how to cook?

574
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,009
-Gosh, that's hot.
-Are you all right?

575
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,635
Yes, I'm fine.

576
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,930
Oh, no! It's all burnt.

577
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,265
Gosh, the smell.

578
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,766
You need to turn off the stove.

579
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,854
Are you trying to set this place on fire?

580
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,024
I did fine when I practiced.

581
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,291
I'll cook it myself,
so go put some ice on your burn.

582
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,959
It's fine. I'll do it.

583
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,044
Just do as I say.

584
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,423
So what's the recipe?

585
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,716
I'll tell you.

586
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,511
NOTES
ESSENTIAL POINTERS TO WIN HER HEART

587
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,766
"Essential pointers to win her heart"?

588
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,684
The weather is great.

589
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,269
It's such a great day for…

590
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,645
I'm looking forward to our date today.

591
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,401
Wait. Come back.

592
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,863
"Express your excitement and anticipation
for your date with her."

593
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,448
"The weather is great."

594
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,617
"I'm looking forward to our date today."

595
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,619
This is what you said earlier, right? And…

596
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:32,953
"Make it so…"

597
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,040
"Make it so that she can really get into
the moments you share together."

598
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,124
"I think we get along great."

599
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,002
"I'm so happy I get to share
these little moments with you."

600
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,879
That's why you said those things
out of the blue.

601
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,632
That's why you blurted out
those random lines.

602
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,135
I can't believe a ladykiller like you
took the time to study these--

603
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,126
Here you go.

604
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,388
This was my first time looking these up.

605
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,600
I wanted to make our date memorable.

606
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,355
That way, you'll think about me
after it's over.

607
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,327
Game over!

608
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,997
GAME OVER

609
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,667
I'll take the bus from here.

610
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,752
It's right here.

611
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,593
Thanks for the fun date today.

612
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,974
Can't you stay?

613
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,059
Please don't go.

614
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,272
A promise is a promise.

615
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,612
Your date with Jeong-woo
won't be as fun as this one.

616
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,199
Make sure you don't have fun.

617
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,496
Bye.

618
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,068
I'm so sorry I'm late.

619
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,071
Why did you run?
You weren't on time anyway.

620
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,031
It's because you asked me
to come all this way

621
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,241
instead of someplace closer.

622
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,244
There's something I want to show you here.

623
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,122
There's a great and cheap noodle place.

624
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,207
Let's eat first.

625
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,833
-Fine.
-Follow me.

626
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,421
EXPECTED WAIT TIME
APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR

627
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,340
-Gosh, look at the line.
-There are so many people.

628
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,217
-Really?
-It must be good.

629
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,261
-Let's just come back tomorrow.
-Should we wait?

630
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,054
-I'll get inside then.
-Wait.

631
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,639
-Are you coming in for a meal?
-Yes.

632
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,766
Your wait will be more than two hours.

633
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,101
-Coming.
-Thank you.

634
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,188
It's probably because it's dinner time.

635
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,148
Should we eat later?

636
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,192
Good idea.

637
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,945
There's an art library nearby.
Let's go check it out.

638
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:53,862
Sure.

639
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,782
TEMPORARILY CLOSED DUE TO MAINTENANCE

640
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,376
Why don't we just head over to our
original destination since the sun's set?

641
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:10,838
Follow me.

642
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,759
OBSERVATORY

643
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,137
This is it.

644
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,521
Hurry.

645
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,361
It's so pretty, isn't it?

646
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,531
Yes, how pretty.

647
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,533
-Right? Let's have a look over there.
-Yes.

648
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,451
Sure.

649
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,623
SOLAR AND LUNAR ECLIPSES
THE MOON'S PHASES

650
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,551
Jupiter.

651
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,180
Saturn.

652
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,732
It's so fascinating.

653
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,525
Why don't you try it too?

654
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,110
Me?

655
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,992
Let's head to the observatory.

656
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,285
The observatory?

657
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,079
I made a reservation.

658
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,121
I see.

659
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,539
Okay.

660
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:49,895
Let's go.

661
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,939
All right.

662
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,027
MAIN OBSERVATORY

663
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,321
Hey there.

664
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,325
-How've you been?
-Hey, Jeong-woo.

665
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,701
Long time no see. Have you been well?

666
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,702
Yes, I'm doing well.

667
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,122
-You look good.
-Thank you.

668
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,748
Go ahead.

669
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,834
Just give me a call when you're done here.

670
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,379
-Hello.
-Hello.

671
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,349
Wow!

672
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,271
Wow!

673
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,276
It's spinning.

674
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,077
You know how to use this thing?

675
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,338
Take a look. It's the Ursa Major.

676
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,388
Connect the seven brightest stars
and you'll get a dipper shape.

677
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,640
I can see it.

678
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,351
This is so cool.

679
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,897
So this is the Big Dipper.

680
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,484
How did it get its name?

681
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,029
It's said to have gotten its name
from the Greek classic Iliad.

682
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,289
Do you think it's true
that people become stars after they die?

683
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,791
It's true.

684
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,419
Really?

685
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,339
Humans are made up of elements,
which also make up the stars.

686
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,926
We become atoms when we die
and become a part of the universe.

687
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,428
It wasn't a scientific question.

688
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,348
It wasn't?

689
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,524
I just wondered…

690
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,404
if my dad might be out there somewhere.

691
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,589
This would be the first time
in a while to see him up close.

692
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,307
I'm sure he is.

693
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,271
He'll be watching over you from above

694
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,317
saying, "You grew up so well."

695
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,915
Show me the other constellations.

696
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,376
Where's altari?

697
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,713
I'm glad…

698
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,757
you seem to like this place.

699
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,258
Slow down, will you?

700
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,555
I really needed a drink today.

701
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,402
Why did you ask me out?

702
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,452
Why would you ask me that out of the blue?

703
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,204
I mean, think about it.

704
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,916
You apologized before
for making me think you liked me.

705
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,418
I think my actions
may have led to a misunderstanding.

706
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,756
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

707
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,635
I was going to ask you out first,
but you stopped me.

708
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,552
About that…

709
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,889
It would be better if you didn't say it.

710
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,392
I did.

711
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,185
But why now, all of a sudden?

712
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,814
It's so out of the blue.

713
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,109
It's like you're toying with me.

714
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,320
I can see why you'd feel that way.

715
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,572
You must have a really good reason.

716
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,535
I was scared.

717
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,958
At first, it was because
my feelings for you kept growing.

718
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,502
After that,

719
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,423
I was scared
that my feelings would burden you.

720
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,258
It's not like life is a horror movie.

721
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,218
What are you so scared of?

722
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,430
You've been putting on a show
all on your own.

723
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,350
But what scared me most…

724
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,355
was the fear of losing you

725
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,608
without telling you how I felt.

726
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,446
That's what frightened me the most.

727
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,283
I didn't want to lose you…

728
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,831
because you're a blessing
I may never get again.

729
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,211
I'm sorry for confusing you.

730
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,547
And I'm sorry I made you wait.

731
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,596
But could you give me another chance?

732
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,520
It's too late.

733
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,525
Let's go. I'll pick up the check.

734
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,026
No, I'll get it.

735
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,709
Why are you…

736
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,838
Why would you carry a conch shell
in a bag like that?

737
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,174
Is it something

738
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,176
important?

739
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,055
I was going to give it to you

740
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,600
so you could put it
where your dad is resting.

741
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,312
I was thinking maybe it could play

742
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,023
the sound of the waves to him.

743
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:39,114
My dad never got to see the ocean
since he was too busy working.

744
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:43,159
I felt bad enjoying this great view
when he couldn't.

745
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,287
That's why.

746
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,463
Is this what you were looking for
on the beach that day?

747
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,466
But it's cracked, so it's useless now.

748
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,095
Give it here.

749
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,890
It's cracked. I don't think--

750
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,683
I'm still going to give it to him.

751
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,454
It's pretty.

752
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,669
Thank you.

753
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,108
Come closer. You're getting wet.

754
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,835
So?

755
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,045
What's your answer?

756
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,645
Where are you?

757
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,095
Give me a hug.

758
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,757
What are you doing?

759
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,262
It's so annoying.

760
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,764
What?

761
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,075
It just happens.

762
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,745
It'll come to you naturally.

763
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,124
I think it's you.

764
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,002
What do you mean?

765
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,797
It's you I like.

766
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,335
We'll have to date in secret, right?

767
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,796
Is there anything
you'd like to do together?

768
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,214
We're already doing it.

769
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,383
The summer training will start today!

770
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,388
I think we'll all be dead
by the match anyway.

771
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,600
With Yu-min gone, Jin-il will now be
the head of the planning team.

772
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,351
They say you're similar to Yu-min.

773
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:06,894
You're even worse.

774
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,730
I haven't seen her for a while now.

775
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,440
Jeong-woo. Is that you?

776
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,357
Jeong-woo!

777
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,860
You need to be punished
for breaking the rules.

778
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:18,865
