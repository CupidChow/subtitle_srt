1
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,326
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,747
What scares me more is making ends meet.

4
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,100
Who are you?

5
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,608
It's my first time visiting in a while,
but no one's here.

6
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,779
I'll see you around.

7
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,830
Who could it be? A senior?

8
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,757
MI-JEONG: SORRY FOR QUITTING. GOOD LUCK!

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,091
SE-JEONG: I HAD FUN
TRAINING WITH YOU GUYS!

10
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,426
-What?
-What?

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,679
I'm quitting too. See you guys around.

12
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,644
Is this everyone?

13
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,521
It is.

14
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,607
The video must've been
a real shock to them.

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,611
We're screwed.

16
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,613
How will we manage with just ourselves?

17
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,992
What? You didn't quit?

18
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,869
No.

19
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,122
Right. I see.

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,384
Everyone, gather around.

21
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,639
Unfortunately, our members
have reduced drastically,

22
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,891
but it'll make our bond even stronger.

23
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,727
Let's get our hearts together
and raise our spirits!

24
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,730
That sounds like fun.

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,774
As you already know,

26
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,443
the main event we have coming up is…

27
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,862
Yes, the festival.

28
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,406
The festival is coming up!

29
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,453
Then what do you freshmen need to do?

30
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,872
Yes, a new song.

31
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,623
We'll need to come up with a new song.

32
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,167
-A new song?
-Good question.

33
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,294
That wasn't really a question.

34
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,588
It's a time-honored tradition of the squad

35
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,756
that we release a new song every festival.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,677
And it's the freshmen who are in charge
of coming up with our new song.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,178
How are we supposed to do that?

38
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,098
The band will help you,
so don't worry too much.

39
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,933
-The band?
-That's right.

40
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,355
-Any questions?
-I don't think I can do it.

41
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,481
What? Why not?

42
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,193
-I'm thinking of quitting.
-What? Why?

43
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,363
Because I don't see any more hope.

44
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,050
-Are you really going to quit?
-Yes.

45
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,927
-But why?
-Seon-ho.

46
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,971
I'm off.

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,389
Who's that?

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,476
-Did you wait long?
-No, I just got here.

49
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,810
That's his new girlfriend.

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,480
His girlfriend? Since when?

51
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,191
It's been a few days,
right after we got back from retreat.

52
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,069
I didn't realize getting a girlfriend
could be so easy.

53
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,403
I guess it works for him.

54
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,989
They say you never know with people.

55
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,242
Seon-ho sure is quick to move on.

56
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,661
I wish I could live my life
the way he does.

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,206
-Aren't you sad?
-Why would she be?

58
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,125
Why would I be? Good for him.

59
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,502
Give him my warmest regards.

60
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,338
Can't she just tell him herself?

61
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,674
She's going to regret missing out.

62
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,802
Missing out on what? Can I join?

63
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,928
It doesn't concern you.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,888
What is it?

65
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,892
There's been a series
of unfortunate events and gossip.

66
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,435
The budget for the festival
is 200 million won.

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,479
How is the cheering squad
supposed to handle

68
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,982
that much money
amidst all this controversy?

69
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,733
Thankfully no one got hurt,

70
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,653
but I feel responsible
for not having been able to prevent it.

71
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,323
We will reinforce our safety protocols
to prevent it from happening again.

72
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,742
But giving in
to all the circulating rumors

73
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,744
and allowing the student council
to plan the festival instead

74
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,579
would be nothing more

75
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,208
than the school giving
the ungrounded rumors even more weight.

76
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,878
And the issue we suffered last year

77
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,797
will soon be handled transparently.

78
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,341
How?

79
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,178
We need to punish whoever was responsible.

80
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,561
What do you mean
we'll punish whoever was responsible?

81
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,772
Our seniors asked us not to
make a commotion during the retreat.

82
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,024
Why make things worse?

83
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,608
Suspicions should be investigated

84
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,485
and any wrongs should be corrected.

85
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,281
The seniors won't sit by
and let you go ahead with this.

86
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,450
And we'll lose
the planning team's support too.

87
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,410
And if we cover it up? Will that be okay?

88
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,579
What's rotten needs to be cut out.

89
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,247
If we just leave it festering,

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,499
we might have to end up
resorting to much worse.

91
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,588
But it could be the end for us
if you go ahead with this.

92
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,632
Hey!

93
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,428
UNKNOWN USER

94
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,763
KICK DO HAE-YI OUT
WHAT FOR?

95
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,852
Why would he tell me not to date anyone

96
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,188
if he was going to
find a girlfriend that quick?

97
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,647
I almost felt bad for him.

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,579
Watch out!

99
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,134
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,553
Well… you looked like you were in danger.

101
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,472
I was. Because of you!

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,850
-Help me up.
-Right.

103
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,191
It's just that there's been
a lot of incidents lately.

104
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,985
You're the first
to actually put me in danger.

105
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,865
Have you received any more messages?

106
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,408
No.

107
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,495
Don't you think you're overreacting?

108
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,413
People get messages like that
all the time.

109
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,165
Still…

110
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,501
it won't hurt to be careful.

111
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,712
Call me right away if anything happens.

112
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,631
Don't stay out too late
for the time being.

113
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,800
People might think you're my boyfriend.

114
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,135
What?

115
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,554
Will you just ignore it again
if they say I received special treatment?

116
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,768
I was just…

117
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,438
Hae-yi.

118
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,442
Hey. Hello.

119
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,652
-Do you have time?
-Me?

120
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,863
Yes. I need to
talk to you about something.

121
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,866
With me?

122
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,120
TEMPORARY LABOR AGREEMENT

DELETE PHOTO

125
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,628
Did you and Yeong-woong
plan this together?

126
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,881
Or do the leaders know about this too?

127
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
No, Yeong-woong and I…

128
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,385
It was just the two of us.

129
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,888
I thought about going public with it.

130
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,098
But…

131
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,768
I didn't think it was a good time
with everything else on top.

132
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,813
You should quit on your own accord.

133
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,566
-What?
-Or…

134
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,609
Or?

135
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,777
…you give up on the money.

136
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,822
Who would believe you're on our side

137
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,782
if you only stayed for the money?

138
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,077
Decide before the week is over.

139
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,954
That quick?

140
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,831
It'll only get worse
if you choose to drag this on.

141
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,428
TO PARK JEONG-WOO
KICK DO HAE-YI OUT

142
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,056
I'll kick her out
if you have a good reason.

143
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,527
BUTLER CHOI

144
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,072
JAE-YI'S TUITION 360,000 WON

145
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,951
I swear, payment days
always come back so quickly.

146
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,955
-Hello. I'm back.
-Hello.

147
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,873
-Hey, Hae-yi.
-Yes?

148
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,667
You're working more hours
starting next week?

149
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,001
Right.

150
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,254
Yes.

151
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,713
Okay.

152
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,803
TUESDAY, APRIL 23
END OF CHEERING SQUAD GIG

153
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,767
Mom.

154
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,519
What would you do

155
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,854
if you had to pick one out of two
and didn't know which to choose?

156
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,357
What do you mean? You just pick one.

157
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,527
So how would you make that choice?

158
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,696
I'd choose what's more important.

159
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,281
What's the most important to you?

160
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,532
Me?

161
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,449
Money.

162
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,453
I know you're my daughter,
but how are you so materialistic?

163
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,497
I'm so proud of you.

164
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,459
Of course.
Nothing's more important to us than money.

165
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,461
And the verdict is, choose money!

166
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,672
I should, right?

167
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,757
Of course, you should.

168
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,428
Right.

169
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,682
Right?

170
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,601
Right.

171
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,269
Right.

172
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,021
Right?

173
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,273
CAMPUS FORUM
THE SPOOKY CHEERING SQUAD VIDEO IS UP!

174
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,113
Why would you upload that without asking?

175
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,282
Are you aware
of the trouble you've caused?

176
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,867
Sorry.

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,744
Damn it.

178
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,372
Never mind it.
But you're not making any more sequels.

179
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,625
Why should I?

180
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,628
What? Why should you?

181
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,008
I still have some
unresolved things to share.

182
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,927
You must be sorely mistaken.

183
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,306
We have a chain of command that we follow.

184
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,517
If you're going to do whatever you want,
you're free to leave.

185
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,395
-But…
-No buts.

186
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,940
No more videos. End of discussion.

187
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,032
I'll quit after next week.

188
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,329
I promised him,
so I need to stick to my word.

189
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,916
You're right.
I joined because of the money.

190
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,085
I need that money.

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,005
Then I'll take it
that you'll quit next week.

192
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,800
Sure.

193
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,887
But…

194
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,557
if I end up leaving,

195
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,768
there will barely be anyone left.

196
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,270
Would that be okay?

197
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,652
The reason I applied to this school
in the first place

198
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,445
was the cheering squad.

199
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,784
Joining the cheering squad
was my goal and motivation.

200
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,037
Don't you think you're going too far

201
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,581
showing off like you do
when you only joined for money?

202
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,670
It's not that I want
everyone to feel the way I do.

203
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,799
But you at least
shouldn't be here for money.

204
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,054
Think about how pathetic that makes me.

205
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,734
Hello.

206
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,619
What do you think you're doing?

207
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,622
You could end up hurting yourself, ma'am.

208
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,166
The thing I asked for?

209
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
Jeez.

210
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,894
What are you doing?

211
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,064
People get rewarded
for finding lost items.

212
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,233
Where's my reward?

213
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,777
That's why I got you
to deliver yogurt to us.

214
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,033
Isn't this too much to drink alone?

215
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,290
Even the judges made a joke out of it.

216
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,875
They kept saying I should've won

217
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,294
the Hwang Jini Beauty Pageant
for my namesake.

218
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,047
They said I didn't live up to my name.

219
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,717
-Then they should've made me the winner.
-Here.

220
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,555
Why would they crack jokes about my name?
It wasn't even funny.

221
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,475
You haven't changed at all.

222
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,229
You still have
that girlish charm of yours.

223
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,772
That's nonsense.

224
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,858
I've changed a lot.

225
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,736
It's been years, after all.

226
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,823
I've changed a lot, haven't I?

227
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,952
You're definitely more outgoing now.

228
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,206
You were always hiding behind someone

229
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,250
and couldn't even speak for yourself.

230
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,711
Living life, I realized that I no longer
had anyone to hide behind.

231
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,090
I couldn't help
but become my own advocate.

232
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,094
I guess that's how I ended up like this.

233
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,021
Goodness, look at the time.

234
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,439
I'll be late for work.

235
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,483
I thought you were done.

236
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,652
I have another part-time job to get to.

237
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,988
But you've been drinking.

238
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,573
I'll sober up on my way there.

239
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,033
Call me up next time
when you have some good liquor.

240
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,619
We should do this again.

241
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,037
Come on. Promise?

242
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,207
I'll see you.

243
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,834
I'm off. Bye.

244
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,765
Seon-ja. If one more person
ends up leaving--

245
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,142
That can't happen.

246
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,311
It'd be just the three of us left.

247
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,562
What is it?

248
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,606
Is Yong-il leaving? Because Seon-ho left?

249
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,232
No, that's not it.

250
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,029
I didn't expect Min-jae to stay behind.
I thought he'd be the first to leave.

251
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,073
I have trouble getting along with him,

252
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,034
but I guess it's better
than having no one around.

253
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,039
By the way,
are you still getting those messages?

254
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:15,956
What?

255
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,085
I'm sure it's a prank.

256
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,213
It's probably the broadcasting club
to make their video more plausible.

257
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,216
Maybe they stopped
because things got out of hand?

258
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,804
What's this?

259
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,556
What is it?

260
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,810
This looks like an old school newsletter.

261
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,563
Why is this in your locker?

262
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,399
Shouldn't you tell the seniors?

263
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,360
Someone probably put it here by mistake.

264
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,975
SHIN JI-YOUNG
ADDRESS TO MOTEL

265
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,476
Eight o'clock.

266
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,104
I want tteokbokki and sundae
with lots of offals.

267
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,541
-Hello.
-Hello.

268
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,210
We're the cheering squad freshmen.

269
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,046
And we need the band's help
to come up with a new song.

270
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,756
I see. He's in charge of that.

271
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,341
Hey.

272
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,010
-Yes?
-Hello…

273
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,138
-What the…
-What?

274
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,599
I need to use the bathroom.

275
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,313
You were the one from that video
who received those messages, weren't you?

276
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,858
You need to quit the cheering squad.

277
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,027
There's no need for you
to put up with something like that.

278
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,363
I almost thought
you were worried about me just now.

279
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,158
I'll take care of it
whether I quit or not.

280
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,202
Stop the sarcasm. I'm genuinely worried.

281
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,455
We're not strangers, after all.

282
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,623
Right. We're worse than strangers.

283
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,710
I saw Seon-ho has a new girlfriend.

284
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,962
Yes.

285
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,882
What did I tell you?
I told you to be wary of him, didn't I?

286
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,718
Don't worry.
At least he and I ended on good terms.

287
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,304
That's because your feelings
for each other weren't genuine.

288
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,058
We only ended that way
because what we had was real.

289
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,686
I can't believe him.

290
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,439
Are you sure you won't regret it?

291
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,025
It won't be easy for you
to find someone like me.

292
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,447
I know. You really are one of a kind.

293
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,574
You're not going to follow me in, are you?

294
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,458
Should we watch a movie?

295
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,376
Sure.

296
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,837
Or should we go to a karaoke?

297
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,547
We can do that.

298
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,424
Isn't there anything you want to do?

299
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,842
Me? Well…

300
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,469
Anything you want to do.

301
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,224
-But I want to do what you want to do.
-Should we go to the movies then?

302
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,226
Let me see what's on.

303
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,484
I sent you some food.

304
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,361
Okay.

305
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,571
How are your studies going?

306
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,740
Fine.

307
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,702
Is there anything you might need?

308
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,246
No.

309
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,165
Tell me right away if you need anything.

310
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,625
I've got lots of money.

311
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,502
Right.

312
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,129
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,672
For what?

314
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,050
You're working hard.

315
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,468
Nonsense.

316
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,011
You talk too much.

317
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,389
I'll leave you to it then.

318
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,498
What are you doing?

319
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,712
What are you doing here at this hour?

320
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,590
I was at the library
studying for tomorrow's exam.

321
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,757
Then I got hungry.

322
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,768
I can't eat too much
since I'll get sleepy.

323
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,646
I think you've had too much already.

324
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,231
I missed dinner.

325
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,279
I should have bought some kimchi too.

326
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,906
Do you want some altari kimchi?

327
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,532
-You have some?
-Yes.

328
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,118
Altari.

329
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,455
There's the altari.

330
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,500
Jeong-woo. Please don't crack
such lame jokes in front of others.

331
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,295
What do you mean?
Everyone laughs at my jokes.

332
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,589
That's because you're in
a position of authority.

333
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,257
They're all probably cursing you inside.

334
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,220
You should be thankful to me
for letting you know.

335
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,096
Are my jokes that lame?

336
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,807
I guess I do scoff when I'm reminded of it

337
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,810
once in a very long while.

338
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,274
Nothing's happened recently, right?

339
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,692
What do you mean?

340
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,110
Never mind then.

341
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,156
Then I'll take it
that you'll quit next week.

342
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,704
I do have something to say to you.

343
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,539
What is it?

344
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,836
You see…

345
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,838
What is it?

346
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,971
I…

347
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
That's so pretty.

348
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,977
Happy 100th-day anniversary.

349
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,357
Don't they know how late it is?

350
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,484
Couldn't they wait until daytime?

351
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,153
They probably couldn't wait to celebrate.

352
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,907
There are so many needless anniversaries.

353
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,118
Valentine's Day, White Day,

354
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,996
Christmas, birthdays,
and dating anniversaries.

355
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,915
There's some anniversary to keep
the whole year round.

356
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,625
You're right.

357
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,586
It's nice to have a lot to celebrate.

358
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,965
Anniversaries are supposed to be special.

359
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,551
But there's one too many special days,
don't you think?

360
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,511
It'd cost an arm and a leg
commemorating all of them.

361
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,725
You need money to date someone these days.

362
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,061
You think so?

363
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,399
At times, you're so naive
that you fail to be realistic.

364
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,652
Well, I guess that's why you're doing
cheering squad work

365
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,821
while everyone's studying
late into the night.

366
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,407
I guess so.

367
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,704
I guess I need to become more realistic.

368
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,123
What's gotten into you?

369
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,960
You should be arguing with me
like you usually do.

370
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,881
Why would you agree
and make me feel awkward?

371
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,759
You made a good point.

372
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,935
People like me waste time
while others are studying hard,

373
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,564
so I'm sure there are people
who date without money.

374
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,114
But you could end up
being a burden to your partner.

375
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,282
That's the problem.

376
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,826
I'm sure they won't feel that way.

377
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,788
How would you know?

378
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,665
I just do.

379
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,336
That's how I would feel.

380
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,929
Didn't you say you had something to say?

381
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,388
-Huh?
-What?

382
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,724
Oh, that…

383
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,233
I forgot.
I'll tell you when I remember it.

384
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,454
It's delicious.

385
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,420
This is nice.

386
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,048
What?

387
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,430
The wind feels nice.

388
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,143
Is the wind even blowing right now?

389
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,864
SUNG GYU-JIN

390
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,032
CAN WE MEET TOMORROW?
SURE

391
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,589
Are you still in touch with Yu-min?

392
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,215
No.

393
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,760
We broke up, so you'd have
a better chance at that.

394
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:34,931
It wasn't me.

395
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,518
I saw the video about the squad.

396
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,104
I wasn't involved with it.

397
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,231
Isn't that why you wanted to see me?

398
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,108
Well, not exactly.

399
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,778
Can you tell me

400
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,741
if Yu-min ever received
messages like that?

401
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,871
She did receive a message once

402
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,498
telling her to break up with me
while we were going out.

403
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,085
I made a fuss over it
and she didn't bring it up anymore.

404
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,297
So I don't know if she received any more.

405
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,217
So she did.

406
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,136
There was something fishy about it though.

407
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,063
Guys.

408
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,315
Shall we play a game for coffee?

409
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,524
-One.
-Two.

410
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,859
Three.

411
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,320
-Shit!
-"Shit" doesn't count.

412
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,949
-Four.
-That's not the issue right now.

413
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,951
-Five.
-What is it?

414
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,417
Theia will cooperate
with the police investigation

415
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,921
and take all legal responsibility
if issues are found within the club.

416
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,216
This just might be
the end of the cheering squad.

417
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,178
I'm sure he had a good reason to.
There's no need to be alarmed.

418
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,226
-Hello.
-Hello.

419
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,560
What's with the long faces?

420
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,277
You did that because you're sure
you can handle it, right?

421
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,987
I'll find a way.

422
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,534
Thanks for giving me the chance

423
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,620
to prove my innocence by cooperating
with the police investigation.

424
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,501
We were dating in secret then,

425
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,587
so hardly anyone knew we were dating.

426
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,301
Soo-il somehow managed to find out
and spread the rumors.

427
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,095
So if anyone knew, it would be him.

428
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,763
What will you do?

429
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,640
Our seniors are very upset about this,

430
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,809
so I doubt you'll get any help
for this year's festival.

431
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,936
You don't even have that many members.

432
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,897
It's unfortunate to have a leader
with such poor leadership.

433
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,568
What?

434
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,073
Don't worry.

435
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,769
I'll do everything to help.

436
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,358
Yu-min. How are you…

437
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,818
Why are you acting
as if you've seen a ghost?

438
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,655
Jeong-woo's first love?

439
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,169
"Leader, Park Jeong-woo."

440
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,796
What happened?

441
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,589
I told you…

442
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,801
that I'd come visit you
if you ever became the leader.

443
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,513
-To see how much you're suffering.
-Where were you for the past two years?

444
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,807
You went off the grid,
so no one could reach you.

445
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,683
I've just been around.

446
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,020
Were you worried?

447
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,563
Of course, I was.

448
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,400
It's good to see you again.

449
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,945
You're back for good, right?

450
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,947
Are you resuming your studies?

451
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,740
Yes.

452
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,908
As I should.

453
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,662
I've got some unfinished business.

454
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,293
Jeong-woo. We have training.

455
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,170
Right.

456
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,758
It's fine. Go ahead.

457
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,346
I won't disappear again.

458
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,891
You better not.

459
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,878
Can't you do a better job?

460
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,464
I get that your mind is elsewhere,

461
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,132
but don't let your personal life
get in the way.

462
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,843
Jeong-woo.

463
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,146
Huh? Hi.

464
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,626
STRAWBERRY MILK

465
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,587
Seon-ho.

466
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,631
I was curious.

467
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,843
You don't have any plans of joining
the cheering squad again, do you?

468
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,470
I don't. Why?

469
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,387
Just because.

470
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,765
I just wanted you back.

471
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,145
It feels so empty without you.

472
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,191
I saw you practice during the joint cheer

473
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,401
and thought maybe you enjoyed it.

474
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,321
You wouldn't have worked that hard
if you didn't enjoy it.

475
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,323
Wasn't that why you were watching earlier?

476
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,456
Please don't quit.

477
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,877
You like doing this.

478
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,676
And you're capable.

479
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,096
You're doing it now.

480
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,183
Why do you say it as if you can't?

481
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,688
Right.

482
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,481
I just stopped to look while passing by.

483
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,733
I didn't come to watch you guys.

484
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,653
I joined thinking it'd be fun,

485
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,280
but the fun wasn't there anymore.

486
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,407
I'll kindly reject.

487
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,162
What about you though?

488
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,624
I thought you barely had the time
because of work.

489
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,419
Well…

490
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,629
I just…

491
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,344
Do you like it?

492
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,352
You must like it a lot,

493
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,022
seeing how you've made the time for it.

494
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,941
I have a lecture to get to.

495
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,870
Hey, Cho-hui!

496
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,165
What?

497
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,710
-Oh, my!
-Oh, gosh! Why is he doing that?

498
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,254
-What the hell are you doing?
-Stay out of it.

499
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,589
Did you just shove me?

500
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,841
How dare you block me?

501
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,510
You hit me first, right?

502
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,720
What?

503
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,723
Damn it.

504
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,894
-Hey, film it.
-What?

505
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,646
-Get everything on video.
-Okay.

506
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,772
Hey, hold on.

507
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,289
You don't want people to know
that you were beat up by a girl, do you?

508
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,833
Don't ever come see me again.

509
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,211
Hey, wait.

510
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,714
Just wait and see! I won't stay still!

511
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,802
-Is he following us?
-Sorry?

512
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,887
No.

513
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,181
-Walk faster before he starts chasing us.
-Right.

514
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,820
What's gotten into you?
You never have instant noodles.

515
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,073
I just felt like it today for some reason.

516
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,833
Just one glass would be nice.

517
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,967
COOKING OIL

518
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,227
I bet she didn't know about this.

519
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,524
-Mom.
-Yes? What is it?

520
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,608
What are you doing?

521
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,905
I was going to fry an egg.

522
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,199
Son.

523
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,952
Are you still in the cheering squad?

524
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,995
Oh, that?

525
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,580
I quit.

526
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,000
Right? Good thinking.

527
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,044
It's just a waste of time.

528
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,046
It's useless.

529
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,882
Why would you wash it? Just throw it out.

530
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,639
You're home, honey.

531
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,102
-Did you have dinner?
-I did.

532
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,273
You had instant noodles?

533
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,026
It was me.

534
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,278
It's not good for you. Don't eat too much.

535
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,157
Ask the housekeeper to get you
something to eat if you're hungry.

536
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,998
-I'm home.
-You're here.

537
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,128
Your knees won't last like that.

538
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,296
Is that geotjeori?

539
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,423
Give me some!

540
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,301
Wash your hands.

541
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,469
I did.

542
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,179
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

543
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,057
There you go again.

544
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,601
That stain will be impossible to get out.

545
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,977
Take it off and wash it.

546
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:05,895
It's fine.

547
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,356
This will be my last week wearing this.

548
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,732
This week?

549
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,609
I'm going to quit next week.

550
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,362
Why? I thought you liked it.

551
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,656
I never did.

552
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,283
I need to make money.
I can't keep playing around.

553
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,620
People might think
you're earning billions.

554
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,705
I'm going to.

555
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,957
I'll get changed and help you.

556
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,085
Do you know?

557
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,378
Someone once said

558
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,132
that the phrase "give up"
should only ever be used literally.

559
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,675
What? That's so lame.

560
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,344
Don't give up too easily
when you're still young.

561
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,179
You'll make a habit of it.

562
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,730
Then I'll take it
that you'll quit next week.

563
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,274
Don't you think you're going too far

564
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,442
rubbing it in our faces
when you only joined for money?

565
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,153
You must like it a lot,

566
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,655
seeing how you've made the time for it.

567
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,457
-Did you eat?
-I did.

568
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,172
It must really be adolescence.

569
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,632
Be quiet.

570
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,843
He walks around like he owns the place.

571
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,960
Hello.

572
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,096
Aren't you scared?

573
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,350
Of what?

574
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,311
I saw that video too.

575
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,437
Right.

576
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,273
It's nothing to be scared of.

577
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,858
What scares me more is making ends meet.

578
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,197
Still, you should be careful.

579
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,491
You never know.

580
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,035
I'm sorry?

581
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,004
-Jeong-woo.
-Jeong-woo.

582
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,468
You're here early.

583
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,805
I left home early so I got here quick.

584
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,391
Right. Hae-yi, what brings you here?

585
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,269
It's nothing.

586
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,063
It seems you two need to talk.
I'll come back next time.

587
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,609
Goodbye.

588
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,588
It's been a while
since we ate together like this.

589
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,549
I know.

590
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,218
Maybe I should have left earlier.

591
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,847
It's just that she's been going through
some stuff, so I was worried.

592
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,432
You two must be close.

593
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,893
Well, we can't have
any more freshmen leave, so…

594
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,191
-Yu-min.
-Yes?

595
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,193
About two years ago…

596
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,111
I…

597
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,156
would rather not talk about that.

598
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,534
I'm sorry.
I should have been more thoughtful.

599
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,249
Here's your food.

600
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,753
I'm so hungry. What shall we have?

601
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,047
Seon-ja.

602
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,549
The phrase "out of sight, out of mind"

603
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,176
goes both ways, right?

604
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,552
What are you saying?

605
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,347
That must mean
that you'll be able to move someone's mind

606
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,015
when you hang around that person.

607
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,308
What are you on about?

608
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,311
Why don't you try to make some sense?

609
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,111
-Hey.
-Hi.

610
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,158
You want me to pretend
that I'm your girlfriend?

611
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,994
Have you…

612
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,997
finally gone nuts?

613
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,875
I made a mistake.

614
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,627
Hey.

615
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,004
I heard you were dumped.

616
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,298
At the start of the semester at that.

617
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,758
I wasn't dumped.

618
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,387
I'm sorry. You weren't dumped
but broken up with.

619
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,097
Seriously.

620
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,975
She was just upset then.

621
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,561
-Then are you still together?
-Yes.

622
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,149
Then are you bringing your girlfriend
to the Med Ball tonight?

623
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,902
-I'm sorry?
-You're allowed to bring a partner.

624
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,321
Come with her and show us what she's like.

625
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,284
He's famous for making fun of you nonstop
once he has his eye on you.

626
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,536
So I couldn't help but say that.

627
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,831
I'm sorry. I know I've put you
in a difficult position,

628
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,250
but can you please help me out?

629
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,546
Think of it as a part-time job.

630
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,964
I'll even pay you.

631
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,134
Are you serious right now?
You're unbelievable.

632
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,010
-Hae-yi.
-Let go!

633
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,096
This is so much fun.

634
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,889
Please?

635
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,936
I don't want my campus life
to be ruined from my first year.

636
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,107
You're also partially at fault
for what happened to us.

637
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,401
I'm sorry, I--

638
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,779
Please do me a favor.

639
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,535
-Hae-yi!
-Stop filming.

640
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,245
2019 YONHEE MED BALL

641
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,102
-Hello.
-Hey.

642
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,230
Where's your girlfriend?

643
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,024
Well, she…

644
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,776
She was feeling unwell.

645
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,944
I see.

646
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,240
So she was fine during the day,

647
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,285
but suddenly fell ill
after the sun went down?

648
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,162
That's it, right?

649
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,176
Then I guess she'll be dead by dawn.

650
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
She really is unwell--

651
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,554
I know.

652
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,785
Hae-yi!

653
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,732
Take a seat here.

654
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,318
-Hello.
-Hello.

655
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,280
This is my girlfriend, Do Hae-yi.

656
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,823
I thought you were unwell.

657
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,451
I was, but I felt better.

658
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,080
-Are you feeling okay now?
-Yes.

659
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,544
She studies really hard.

660
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,382
-She studied so hard for the CSAT.
-This will be fun to go together, right?

661
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,134
What? Right.

662
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,721
What is it?
Did you see something interesting?

663
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,973
It's nothing. Where is it?

664
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,686
Here. Min-jae told us about it.
It's pretty, isn't it?

665
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,152
Thanks.

666
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,744
I heard you and Jae-hyeok
have been a couple since high school.

667
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,204
You must have been popular.

668
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,497
How did you end up with him?

669
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,915
He's cool, isn't he?

670
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,338
That doesn't sound convincing at all.

671
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,672
He really was.

672
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,091
He worked hard at school

673
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,469
and also with things he liked.

674
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,597
He was sincere.

675
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,017
That's why I liked him.

676
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,230
But seriously speaking,

677
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,775
the world is so unfair.

678
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,694
If you studied at Dongnam High,
your family must be pretty wealthy.

679
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,029
You really have everything.

680
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,365
-Well, my family--
-I'll have to do good by her.

681
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,494
You startled me.
That's right. Treat her well, you punk.

682
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,090
Right.

683
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,259
-Hi.
-What happened?

684
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,012
Should I say,
I'm here tying up some loose ends?

685
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,474
I'm in a hurry. Sorry.

686
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,235
Thank you for today.

687
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,242
This is a token of my gratitude.

688
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,744
Forget it.

689
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,914
You've been nice to me all those years,
so there's no need.

690
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,668
Actually…

691
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,131
I was quite moved today.

692
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,841
To be honest,

693
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,845
I always thought I was a bit of a loser.

694
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,098
But you said I was cool tonight.

695
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,893
Because I really thought that way then.

696
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,728
I'm sorry.

697
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,023
I only hurt you because I was upset.

698
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,278
Well, I…

699
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,865
Can I make it up to you
after we start going out again?

700
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,200
I promise I'll do my best, Hae-yi.

701
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:46,910
Jae-hyeok.

702
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,204
It won't work out.

703
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,417
You'll be ashamed of me for being poor,

704
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,712
and then I'll be ashamed of myself
for being poor.

705
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,341
I don't want to live
being ashamed of myself.

706
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,259
Hae-yi.

707
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,220
That's really a misunderstanding.

708
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,806
-I--
-I found someone.

709
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,687
Someone who would be okay

710
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,107
with the way I am right now.

711
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,860
I think I found someone like that.

712
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,365
It consoled me a lot.

713
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,581
And I felt comforted
to have someone like that.

714
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,421
I like that person.

715
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,133
That's why this is it for the two of us.

716
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,847
We'll call it even now, okay?

717
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,061
Bye.

718
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,947
She keeps doing things that bother me.

719
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,459
I need to tell Seon-ja
and Jeong-woo about this.

720
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,295
The thing we ate last time.

721
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,549
The thing we ate together.

722
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,259
-Oh, that.
-Do you remember?

723
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,648
Then I'll take it
that you'll quit next week.

724
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,108
You must like it a lot,

725
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,527
seeing how you've made the time for it.

726
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,862
Don't give up too easily
when you're still young.

727
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,531
You'll make a habit of it.

728
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,911
Why are you sighing so deeply?

729
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,955
You startled me.

730
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,957
Why did you sneak up on me?

731
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,459
What's weighing so heavily on your mind?

732
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,963
Training is starting soon.

733
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,715
I know.

734
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,050
Then why are you still here?

735
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,303
You know what?

736
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,265
I find games where I have
no chance of winning boring.

737
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,183
Games?

738
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,394
But it keeps weighing on my mind

739
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,731
how I'm missing out on the game

740
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,318
more so than the chance of me losing.

741
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,280
So I've decided
to waste my time a little more

742
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,283
because I want no regrets.

743
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,038
Let's do it together.

744
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,165
It'll be fun with you.

745
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:57,017
-Seon-ho, you're here!
-Seon-ho!

746
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,187
Good thinking.

747
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,939
What? I was the one who convinced him.

748
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:03,857
You decided to come back?

749
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,402
Good decision.

750
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,413
NEW SONG PRESENTATION

751
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,697
Bravo!

752
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,991
I like the new song.

753
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,451
Good job.

754
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,078
We worked so hard.

755
00:49:59,121 --> 00:49:59,955
Welcome back.

756
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,623
Thanks.

757
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,876
Shall we go grab some drinks?

758
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,877
-Sounds good!
-Sure!

759
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,838
Let's go to Cheers.

760
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,840
"Let's go to Cheers."

761
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,591
What?

762
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,093
Good job, everyone.

763
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,720
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

764
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,972
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

765
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,890
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

766
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,686
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

767
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,021
I like the new song. It's really good.

768
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,525
The song's very lively.
I especially liked this part.

769
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,864
I was saving this for a special day,

770
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,615
but I think today is the day!

771
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,535
Yes! Today is the day!

772
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,456
-Thank you!
-A glass for Seon-ho.

773
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,000
Thank you.

774
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,042
Seon-ho.

775
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,462
Thanks for coming back.

776
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,255
I'm so glad you're back.

777
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,592
What's wrong with you?
Just treat me like you used to.

778
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,385
That's what I'm doing.

779
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,137
She's even scarier like that.

780
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:00,766
Drink up.

781
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,900
Come out.

782
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,238
Me?

783
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,377
TEMPORARY LABOR AGREEMENT

784
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,966
I'll get rid of this.

785
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,637
-Let's annul our contract, sir.
-What are you doing?

786
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,145
I'll give up on the money
and keep being in the squad.

787
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,688
All good?

788
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,487
Then I guess we're done here.

789
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,115
Why all of a sudden?

790
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,827
Why did you decide to stay
and give up on the money?

791
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,371
Right? I must be crazy
to give up on a million won.

792
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,289
No, you've done well.

793
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,833
What are you scheming?

794
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,252
Are you putting on a show
to accept the money without me knowing?

795
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,801
I'm usually that smart…

796
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,265
but not this time.

797
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,394
Just this once,

798
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,522
I want to waste my time
doing something useless

799
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,232
because I want no regrets.

800
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,653
For once, at least,

801
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,781
I thought I could do that.

802
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,284
Well…

803
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,498
Fine.

804
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,552
Fine!

805
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,636
My ear.

806
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,514
Let's party!

807
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,017
Let's do it!

808
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,729
Let's party!

809
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,816
Let's eat and drink!

810
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,360
Let's party!

811
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,072
But why do you want to break up
all of a sudden?

812
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,241
-I'm sorry.
-But why?

813
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,577
Tell me why.

814
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,661
It's just…

815
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,831
that I got bored.

816
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,999
You bastard.

817
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,876
I'm sorry.

818
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,003
You really are a bastard.

819
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,088
That's why people call you a robot.

820
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,508
You never really liked anyone, have you?

821
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,387
There will come a day
when you shed tears of blood over someone.

822
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,025
The thing is…

823
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,236
I was going to the bathroom.

824
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,621
I'm getting a phone call.

825
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,748
Hey, Mom.

826
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,416
Hae-yi.

827
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,074
We're running out of food.

828
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,576
How many people are there?
One, two, three… We have so many

829
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,953
and we only have this left--

830
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,746
Fine, I'll get you some more.

831
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,289
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

832
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,683
Oh, so that was Yu-min.

833
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,561
What's this?

834
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,104
Where did you get it?

835
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,733
Someone left it in Hae-yi's locker.

836
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,484
Where did Hae-yi go?

837
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,069
It's been a while
since she went to the bathroom.

838
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,237
Should I call her?

839
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,782
Didn't you see Hae-yi in the bathroom?

840
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,201
-The person you have called…
-Hae-yi? I didn't. Why?

841
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,912
Her phone is turned off.

842
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:34,998
UNKNOWN USER

843
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,207
YOU'LL SUFFER TOO

844
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,045
Hae-yi!

845
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,093
I'll go look for her.

846
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,270
The person you have called…

847
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,493
Hae-yi!

848
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:18,750
Hae-yi.

849
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:22,837
I'm sorry.

850
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,260
Hae-yi!

851
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,138
Have you seen this person?

852
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,767
Have you seen this person?

853
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,852
Hey, she…

854
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,605
Isn't she the one
that was being carried by a man?

855
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,359
Thank you.

856
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,698
Hae-yi…

857
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,495
Excuse me.

858
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,664
Jeez. What do you want?

859
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,832
I'm sorry.

860
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,167
I'm sorry.

861
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,212
Where…

862
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,507
Where did you go, Hae-yi?

863
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,010
Jeong-woo?

864
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,431
What happened to you?

865
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,059
-What?
-We couldn't reach you.

866
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,728
I was worried sick about you.

867
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,607
Well, I lost my phone and…

868
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,825
That's a relief.

869
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,787
Were you…

870
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,167
worried a lot?

871
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,418
Please…

872
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,963
Please stop making me worry.

873
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,806
The freshmen will showcase our new song
during the festival this year!

874
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,600
Do you know what I hate the most?
It's losing.

875
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,269
What if all of this isn't a prank?

876
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,687
What if someone
ends up dying like the prophecy said?

877
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,897
There must be something
going on between you and her.

878
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,274
No. We're not allowed to
date other members.

879
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,026
Rules are there to be broken.

880
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:36,155
You keep leaving behind loose ends
and that's causing misunderstandings.

881
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,533
Live your lives as you wish.
Don't hold back on anything.

882
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,450
Leave no regrets.

883
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,619
Are you available tomorrow night?

884
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,454
It's a perfect day to be asked out.

885
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,261
CHO-HUI
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING, HAE-YI?

886
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,178
SEON-JA
WHERE ARE YOU, SLEEPYHEAD?

887
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,933
SEON-HO: CALL ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS
JEONG-WOO: WHERE ON EARTH ARE YOU, HAE-YI?

888
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:15,153
