1
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,824
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,435
Why are you lying there?

4
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,730
What's going on?

5
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,981
Jeez.

6
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,527
You'll get sick
if you just sleep anywhere.

7
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,738
Why would you walk all over me like that?

8
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,907
I'm so sorry.

9
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,619
That must have hurt.

10
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,622
You seem all right though.

11
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,125
I'm going to the hospital.

12
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,627
-What for?
-To see Seon-ho's mom.

13
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,797
Go sleep somewhere else.

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,757
-Okay.
-You'll be all right, won't you?

15
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,926
-Bye.
-Bye. I'm sorry.

16
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,693
MY JEONG-WOO

17
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,738
Hello?

18
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
I just woke up.

19
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,790
What? You're outside my place?

20
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,512
SOO-IL, WE NEED TO TALK
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU

21
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,195
-Jeong-woo.
-Hey.

22
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,823
Let's go.

23
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,704
SOO-IL, WE NEED TO TALK
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU

24
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,394
THEIA'S THREE PROPHECIES

25
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,856
ONE MEMBER OF THE CHEERING SQUAD
WILL END UP DYING IN 2019

26
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,032
GWANGHYE HOSPITAL

27
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,120
Goodness.

28
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey.

29
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,213
What made you drink
until you passed out like that?

30
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,260
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

31
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,224
He wants a divorce.

32
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,232
He said he doesn't feel alive
when he's with me,

33
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,859
so he wants to divorce me.

34
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,907
He says it feels as if

35
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,703
he's like a dead tree.

36
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,252
Can't he see that I'm the one who's been
living like a corpse next to him?

37
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,342
He says he's already chosen a lawyer.

38
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,594
Gosh.

39
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,439
Life sure feels like shit.

40
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
I know.

41
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,323
Life sure feels that way.

42
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,745
You're here, Seon-ho.

43
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,497
Hey.

44
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,500
I need to go see to something.

45
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,466
Did you eat, Seon-ho?

46
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,510
Not yet. I'll eat soon.

47
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,971
Don't skip any meals.

48
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,309
Ask the housekeeper
to make you something to eat.

49
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,147
Don't worry about me
and look after yourself.

50
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,108
I startled you, didn't I?

51
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
I…

52
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,947
I actually quit drinking,

53
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,867
but I suddenly had the urge to drink.

54
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,870
-I think I drank too much at once.
-It's okay.

55
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,751
I promise I won't ever drink again.

56
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,336
So…

57
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,547
don't worry too much, okay?

58
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,591
I really will quit drinking now.

59
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,552
It's fine by me…

60
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,890
so just divorce him if you want to.

61
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,271
I just want you to be happy.

62
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,526
I'll be happy with whatever,

63
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,821
as long as you're happy.

64
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,243
So just do as you like.

65
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,622
Don't cry.

66
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,600
-Is something up?
-Huh?

67
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,352
No, nothing's up.

68
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,771
You seemed down.

69
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,232
Right. It's nothing much.

70
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,234
What is it?

71
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,070
It's just that I've had a lot of work.

72
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,948
It's not like it's some
confidential government stuff.

73
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,325
We're not the CIA.

74
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,369
You tend to overreact.

75
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,080
I don't want to have you
worry about things like this.

76
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,543
I'll tell you
when everything's been sorted.

77
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,463
You always say that.

78
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,216
So what happened yesterday?

79
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,471
-You see…
-Yes?

80
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,771
Something did happen,

81
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,899
but I don't think I can tell you

82
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,902
since it's not exactly my business.

83
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,116
They might not want other people to know.

84
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,912
Is it Seon-ho?

85
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,167
It just seemed that way.

86
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,215
Fine. Maybe it's better you don't tell me.

87
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,925
You don't have to tell me.

88
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,594
Are you sure?

89
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,221
What do you mean?

90
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,682
I thought you might get upset.

91
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,647
I'd be lying if I said
I was perfectly fine with it.

92
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,318
But I'm sure you have
a good reason for not telling me.

93
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,322
I trust you.

94
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,116
You're really laid-back.

95
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,368
I'm just pretending to be

96
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,579
so you don't see how much of a loser I am.

97
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,708
Thank you…

98
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,128
for trusting me.

99
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,839
But honestly speaking,

100
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,759
I'm not entirely not upset.

101
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,135
Jeez.

102
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,848
You're too weak.
I didn't even push you that hard.

103
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,727
Get up.

104
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,149
You pushed me too.

105
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,695
You're acting as if this place
is your living room.

106
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,822
This is a public space, you know.

107
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,783
Gosh, I can't believe you two.

108
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,451
Unbelievable.

109
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,161
Just lying down wherever like that.

110
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,955
Why are you together?

111
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,792
I brought him to have dinner
since he was at the hospital.

112
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,919
They hired a caregiver starting today.

113
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,927
Well, why don't you come in
to join us for a meal too?

114
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,804
-What?
-He needs to eat.

115
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,264
I'll gratefully join you.

116
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,601
-Really? Let's head inside then.
-Okay.

117
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,727
Can you get my stuff?

118
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,104
Let's go.

119
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,148
Come on, let's go.

120
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,817
What?

121
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,944
This looks delicious.

122
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,739
Here we go.

123
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,365
It'll be ready in no time.

124
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,080
Gosh, it looks delicious.

125
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,498
It looks great.

126
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,042
Dig in, everyone.

127
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,877
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

128
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,760
-It's good.
-This looks really easy to make.

129
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,597
Are you confident
that you can make my daughter happy?

130
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,932
Jeez.

131
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,311
-Mom!
-I'm sorry.

132
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,146
It's fine.

133
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,440
Why would you ask him about my happiness?

134
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,734
That's my business, so don't ask him that.

135
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,444
I just wanted to give it a try.

136
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,447
Parents ask that to their
daughters' boyfriends on TV.

137
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,115
That's when they get married.

138
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,409
It's not entirely out of the question.
Aren't I right?

139
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,244
You're right!

140
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,289
See? You never know.

141
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,084
Bro. Pass me a perilla leaf.

142
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,175
Why do you call him "brother"?

143
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,843
Well, you see…

144
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,971
I used to call him that
and now I've made a habit of it.

145
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,559
Still, maybe you should
call him something else.

146
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,852
I don't mind.

147
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,030
All right then.

148
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,535
Have this too, bro.

149
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,128
This too, bro.

150
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,761
Pass me a perilla leaf, bro.

151
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,099
You must be happy to have so many bros.

152
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,600
How about a toast?

153
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,186
-Nice to meet you. Cheers.
-Cheers.

154
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,583
I'll see you.

155
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,503
You too.

156
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:41,051
You both should get going
since you go in different directions.

157
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,888
No, let's go together.

158
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,516
Okay.

159
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,227
You know what I think?

160
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,480
I'll side with whoever wins

161
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,815
I'll side with whoever wins

162
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,609
-I'll side with--
-Mom!

163
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,903
She only used to have crushes.

164
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,488
Thanks for liking my daughter.

165
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,655
Where is she?

166
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,573
See you.

167
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,117
-My goodness.
-I told you to stop, didn't I?

168
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,244
Bye.

169
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,250
Up for more drinks?

170
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:15,920
Sure.

171
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,762
-Listen--
-Let me talk first.

172
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,848
All right.

173
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,600
I used to like Hae-yi.

174
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,809
You "used to"?

175
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,811
I wanted to steal her away from you.

176
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,649
-I was confident that I could.
-But?

177
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,984
But I thought I should call it quits now.

178
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,739
If I went any further,
it'd put Hae-yi in a difficult spot.

179
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,786
She seems happy being with you for now.

180
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,162
That's why I've given up.

181
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,914
For now.

182
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,375
Sure.

183
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,256
But I don't like how you added "for now."

184
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,383
What are you implying by that?

185
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,428
Hae-yi might not be happy
being with you in the long run.

186
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,471
Right.

187
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,431
I doubt that will happen.

188
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,561
You can't ever be too sure.

189
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,023
Hae-yi and I are friends.

190
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,817
Let me have that much.

191
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,277
I know that.

192
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,529
I'm not too keen on it,

193
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,407
but what can I do but understand?

194
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,538
Just don't cross any lines.

195
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,043
Right. Jae-yi's still my bro.

196
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,672
Gosh, that's gross.

197
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,717
You and Hae-yi are the same.

198
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,511
What do you mean, he's still your bro?

199
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,599
The person you have called
is not available…

200
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,435
Soo-il won't answer my calls either.

201
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,855
Let's wait him out for a few more days.

202
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,986
Hey, you're here.

203
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,407
2019 HOKYUNG-YONHEE MATCH
DOCUMENTARY PROPOSAL

204
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,491
A TV broadcast?

205
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,327
SBC asked if we'd like to showcase

206
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,288
one of our performances
during the Hokyung-Yonhee match.

207
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,457
We told them we'd do it.

208
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,126
We can go ahead with it
if you agree to it.

209
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,253
They're going to sponsor us
for the match too.

210
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,671
Really?

211
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,884
There's plenty of reasons
for us to sign up,

212
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,636
but why do you want to do this?

213
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,847
It's a fun deal.

214
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,100
It'd be good to have
something we can look back on.

215
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,813
-You're sure it isn't for PR purposes?
-PR?

216
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,650
"A conglomerate heir,
working hard in college."

217
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,276
It paints a nice picture.

218
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,364
It'll do wonders
for your conglomerate's image.

219
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,116
You're quick to catch on
with things like that.

220
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,745
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I didn't have that in mind.

221
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,247
She sure is different.

222
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,541
So this TV broadcast

223
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,546
is supposed to have you at center stage
and we're just the supporting role.

224
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,881
That sounds rather exaggerated.

225
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466
Well, it's true, isn't it?

226
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,099
How about you give us
all the sponsor money?

227
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,186
You have enough money this year

228
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,147
and your ticket sales did amazing,
so you don't need the funds.

229
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,362
Sure.

230
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,116
Really?

231
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,118
These matches are only fun

232
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,161
when the two sides are neck to neck.

233
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,165
It won't be any fun to watch
if you fall behind too much.

234
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,627
It sounds like a deal
that'll be beneficial for us too.

235
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,587
The budget in hand isn't everything.

236
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,964
It's still very important.

237
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,884
We'd rather go begging
than accept money like this.

238
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,762
Being so stubborn will only
make it harder for your freshmen.

239
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,641
Fine. We'll think about it.

240
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,727
Okay. Call me back
after you've discussed it.

241
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,536
They just humiliated us.
You're not going to agree to it, are you?

242
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,874
-Let's do it.
-What?

243
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,627
The unexpected fire took away
much of the funds we had left.

244
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,588
We're running short on funds.

245
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,007
At this rate,
we might even need to get the freshmen

246
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,468
to pitch in for the money we're short on.

247
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,471
We can't have them suffer as well.

248
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,431
You're right.

249
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,476
We'll just play the supporting role then.

250
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,480
We'll use that
to make our performance even better.

251
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,941
Since it'll be going on TV,

252
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,736
we should ask the others what they think.

253
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,654
When's Seon-ja getting here?

254
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,989
She should be here soon.

255
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:58,952
Hi.

256
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,099
Who is this? He looks familiar.

257
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,976
-It's Min-jae.
-Min-jae?

258
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,561
What happened to you?

259
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,860
That's Min-jae?

260
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,077
A TV broadcast?

261
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,537
I need to look good on camera.

262
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,747
We'd be exposed to the public,

263
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,999
so I'm asking for your opinions too.

264
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm all for it.

265
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,212
It'd be an honor to be on TV.

266
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,713
I'm against it.

267
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,841
You say that because you have no idea

268
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
how burdensome being famous can be.

269
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,136
Let's do it.

270
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,682
They said they'll give us
the funds we're short on.

271
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,725
Woon-chan told me.

272
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,435
You little…

273
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,106
If it's something we need,
I say we do it together.

274
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,858
Right. Let's do it.

275
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,818
Sure, let's do this.

276
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,111
-I'm in.
-Same here.

277
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,238
-I'm in too.
-I'm all for it.

278
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,449
We could end up
being cast for other roles too.

279
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,369
-Good work today.
-Good work today.

280
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,675
I can do it alone.

281
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,261
We'll be done quicker together.

282
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,975
Is this because of Ji-yoon?

283
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,312
-Is that why you're helping me?
-What?

284
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,105
Oh…

285
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,900
It's not like that.

286
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,113
Do you want to grab a drink tonight?

287
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,531
What?

288
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,492
Hurry.

289
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,828
I'm almost done.

290
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,542
Have this.

291
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,128
Thanks.

292
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,423
What was that?

293
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,593
It's exactly what you think it is.

294
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,887
Oh, you must've borrowed money from him.

295
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,640
What do you mean?
Can't you see what's going on?

296
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,891
It's the start of something special.

297
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,561
Between you and Min-jae?

298
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,397
I think Min-jae likes me.

299
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,650
Why?

300
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,526
Love doesn't need a reason.

301
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,654
Then what about you?

302
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,783
I'm considering it in a positive light.

303
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,411
I guess love has finally
found its way to me.

304
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,541
He's all grown up.

305
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,876
Nonsense.

306
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,381
He can't really be fine with it.

307
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,466
He just said that to put me at ease.

308
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,134
That's what you call grown up.

309
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,220
He said those things to put you at ease.

310
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,599
I guess you're right. He grew up so fast.

311
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,102
So what will you do?

312
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,606
I don't know.

313
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,150
When will I ever grow up?

314
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,861
I still don't know what I want,
even at this age.

315
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,367
Listen.

316
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,954
My grandmother died at the age of 100.

317
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,790
Here's what she said as she passed away.

318
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,128
"All throughout my life,
I thought all I ever wanted

319
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,881
was for my children to live a good life."

320
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,925
"But now that I'm almost dying,

321
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,594
I can see that what I really wanted

322
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:51,018
was to live freely
without a husband or any children."

323
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,772
On the day we were told
to prepare for her passing,

324
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,234
one of my aunts came a day late
because her flight got canceled.

325
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,569
And guess what?

326
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,114
My grandmother held on
until that aunt of mine arrived.

327
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,826
She only passed away
after everyone got there.

328
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,536
Unbelievable, right?

329
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,208
That's when I realized
that even if we live to be a hundred,

330
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,380
we never really know
what it is we truly want.

331
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,382
Not even a hundred years is enough,

332
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,719
so how would we know
when we've lived only half of that?

333
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,722
Tell me. Do you think we'd know?

334
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,766
-It's fine.
-Ms. Sung.

335
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,683
Yes?

336
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,186
The doctor will see you
before we run the tests.

337
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,187
Okay.

338
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,022
Hey.

339
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,193
Why do I need to be tested
when I'm perfectly fine?

340
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,903
Be quiet.

341
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,572
These tests are expensive.

342
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,034
It's to thank you
for taking care of me at the hospital.

343
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,119
So don't complain and just do it.

344
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,873
Fine.

345
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,667
Thanks to my rich friend,

346
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,922
I'll be getting
a luxurious health checkup.

347
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,882
Right. I'm off.

348
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,759
Hey.

349
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,676
Thanks.

350
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,608
What's all this?

351
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,653
YEONG-WOONG AND JI-YOUNG

352
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,905
It's the noble and beautiful fruit

353
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,368
that our love has borne.

354
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,329
It's our 100th-day anniversary today.

355
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,374
Then are we closed today?

356
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,210
We may be closed,
but you still have a job to do.

357
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,589
You're too old to be doing
100th-day anniversaries.

358
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,760
Others your age don't even celebrate
their wedding anniversaries.

359
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,055
I need to do this
more so because of my age.

360
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,851
It's not easy lasting
a hundred days at my age.

361
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,645
They say people are worse
when they get into something so late.

362
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,148
It's scary seeing you
make such a fuss like this.

363
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,192
Things hit you differently
when you're more familiar with them.

364
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,654
-What?
-When you go from partners to single,

365
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,407
you only feel more lonesome
on celebratory days

366
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,285
because your memories haunt you.

367
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,788
That's why I went the extra mile

368
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,124
to make a huge deal out of it.

369
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,626
Since she's been through so much,

370
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,463
I want to write over
her sad memories with happier ones.

371
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,467
You're more thoughtful than I thought.

372
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,721
What?

373
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,972
You surprise me at times.

374
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,769
We're done.

375
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,610
Gosh, I'm so nervous.
You think she'll like it?

376
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,907
You're sure she's into
this sort of stuff, right?

377
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,824
Huh?

378
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,160
Good question.

379
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,916
It's okay.

380
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,585
Ji-yoon's rejected a lot of guys.

381
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,796
I understand that you can be no fun.

382
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,090
It's okay to be a bit of a loser too.

383
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,511
She just has high standards,
so don't be so discouraged.

384
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,722
That's supposed to be comforting, right?

385
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,769
I'm fine.

386
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,438
I don't think we were a good match anyway.

387
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,191
-What?
-I think

388
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,069
I want to be with someone
I can be myself around.

389
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,489
Sure.

390
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,910
Drink up. Drink and forget about her.

391
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,454
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

392
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,759
Hey, they're kissing again.

393
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,140
Gosh, they keep doing it.

394
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,935
Why do people

395
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,355
keep kissing in front of me?

396
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,273
What?

397
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,151
Is it really that good?

398
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,361
You haven't tried yet?

399
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,822
Have you?

400
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,741
I haven't.

401
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,202
-Do you want to try it?
-What?

402
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,378
Ms. Deputy Director.

403
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,588
Now, open your eyes.

404
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
YEONG-WOONG AND JI-YOUNG

405
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,346
I LOVE YOU BABY, YOU'RE PERFECT FOR ME

406
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,391
What's all this?

407
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,101
It's for our 100th-day anniversary.

408
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,646
Surprise!

409
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,277
Right. Our 100th day…

410
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,362
I didn't even know.

411
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,243
As of late, I actually…

412
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,872
didn't have much to expect.

413
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,250
I just lived day-to-day.

414
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,421
But ever since I started dating you,

415
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:16,926
I've been excited to see
where life will take me.

416
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,307
That's something I missed.

417
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,522
Having such anticipation in my life.

418
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,399
That's why

419
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,985
I wanted to celebrate

420
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,863
every precious moment with you.

421
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,369
Are you perhaps
not into this kind of thing?

422
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,413
No, it's not that.

423
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,540
Then it's fine.

424
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,252
Yeong-woong, I think
I might end up studying abroad.

425
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,549
You're going overseas?

426
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:01,179
It was something I'd been preparing for
before I started seeing you,

427
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,807
and I got an email
from one of the schools I applied to.

428
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,100
I got accepted.

429
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,936
I see.

430
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,732
This calls for a celebration.

431
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,609
-Right?
-Yes, I guess so.

432
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,848
Hey, Jeong-woo. What are you doing here?

433
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,182
Oh, I'm just…

434
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,686
Did Soo-il show up to the lecture today?

435
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,480
Soo-il? He hasn't been
showing up recently.

436
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,066
He said he'd text me later
when I tried messaging him.

437
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,069
-I see.
-Hello.

438
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,488
Jin-il. Have you seen
Soo-il around lately?

439
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,573
You two are close.

440
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:06,619
Oh. He left on a trip,
saying he wanted to clear his mind.

441
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,708
I don't think

442
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,711
Soo-il wants to see you.

443
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,547
He told me he didn't want to
see you for a while.

444
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,302
Okay.

445
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,680
Tell him to call me
when he clears up his thoughts.

446
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,768
That I really need to
talk to him in person.

447
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,605
Sure. I'll see you then.

448
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,648
-See you.
-Bye.

449
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,016
Is this 911?

450
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,353
Someone seems to be hurt.

451
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,828
I've asked the police to identify
the patient who was brought in yesterday.

452
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,456
It has to be a robbery,
seeing how he had nothing on him.

453
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,167
-He's been transferred to a regular ward?
-Yes.

454
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,377
Is he still unconscious?

455
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,420
They say he may never be able to recover.

456
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,600
She's ten minutes late.

457
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,564
Is Hokyung's leader yet to come?

458
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,190
Yes. But she'll be here soon.

459
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,427
-Hello!
-Hello!

460
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,304
Sorry I'm late.

461
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,639
How are you?

462
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,600
-Hello.
-She's so cool.

463
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,268
-You're here.
-Hey.

464
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,270
Here.

465
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,405
Is everyone ready?

466
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,489
-Yes.
-Yes.

467
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,949
Me too.

468
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,164
Let's do this!

469
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,374
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

470
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,465
We'll take another shot of you stretching.

471
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,865
I can't believe I've made a mistake.

472
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
I'm usually perfect.

473
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,537
Should we go again?

474
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,041
Let's see the leaders stretch too.

475
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,672
Get a good shot of Hokyung's leader.

476
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,216
Ms. Lee? Can you face the camera?

477
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,133
Sure.

478
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,559
Let's get started.

479
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,523
-Let's do this.
-Here we go!

480
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,818
That's good. This time,
to show that it's a friendly competition,

481
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,695
can you wrap your arms around each other?

482
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,826
A little closer.

483
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,165
-Let's do this.
-Here we go!

484
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,876
Cut. Wow, you look great together.

485
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,963
Oh, my goodness!

486
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,922
Are you all right?

487
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,382
Hae-yi!

488
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,425
-Hae-yi.
-I'm fine.

489
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,593
-Are you all right?
-I'm totally fine.

490
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,389
I really am. Oh, my goodness!

491
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,307
What if you end up scarring your face?

492
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,893
Please stop. I'm fine.

493
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,228
Let's get you to a hospital.

494
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,814
No. I'm fine, really!

495
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,691
Make sure to get that in the final cut.

496
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,070
Gosh, I hope her face
doesn't end up scarring.

497
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,156
She's definitely an entertaining one.

498
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,700
GI WOON-CHAN

499
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,248
I don't remember a thing.

500
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,125
How did I get home last night?

501
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,043
What?

502
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,670
You took the bus.

503
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,798
I must have drank too much.

504
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,593
Right. You blacked out.

505
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,637
Yes. I think I blacked out.

506
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,972
Right.

507
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,849
You blacked out.

508
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,063
Hey.

509
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,272
Don't even say hi to me.

510
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,567
Sure.

511
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,117
You will all have heard by now.

512
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,661
Today, a few of the Hokyung University
Cheering Squad members

513
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,622
will be joining Yonhee's squad to train.

514
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,123
So just be natural

515
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,251
as you would be any other day.

516
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,294
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

517
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,880
-Act natural.
-Be natural, everyone. Let's go, Theia!

518
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,882
-Theia!
-Theia!

519
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,598
-You can do it!
-Let's go, handsome man!

520
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:10,358
Yonhee! Stand up!

521
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,781
-Gi Woon-chan!
-Gi Woon-chan!

522
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,243
-Gi Woon-chan!
-Gi Woon-chan!

523
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,040
Now, I'll go through
the choreography step by step.

524
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,250
First, you…

525
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,044
Yonhee!

526
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,130
Stand…

527
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,009
up!

528
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,973
-That was awesome!
-You're amazing!

529
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,059
Amazing!

530
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,270
Is this it?

531
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,730
I guess you can just do it in one go.

532
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,607
She really is something.

533
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,067
I can do it too.

534
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,280
-Yonhee! Stand--
-Oh, my goodness.

535
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,448
You better stop.

536
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,618
There's nothing more foolish
than getting into a fight you can't win.

537
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,162
Why? I'm good at it too.

538
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,248
Yes. We're all good at something.

539
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,002
However, there are people out there
who are even better.

540
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,211
Darn it.

541
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,052
Anything like that?

542
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,345
You know what I mean.

543
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,639
Thank you.

544
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,435
We were interviewing the freshmen.

545
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,448
I have an idea to propose.

546
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,742
Since Hokyung came all the way to train,

547
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,953
how about we try something
like a one-on-one battle?

548
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,330
That would be interesting.

549
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,749
Sure. It sounds fun.

550
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,543
Okay. Then we'll have
Hokyung's leader against…

551
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,462
let's see.

552
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,715
How about you do it
as the freshman representative?

553
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,802
Not you. The one who's lying down.

554
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,679
Me?

555
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,266
-Yes.
-Yong-il, come.

556
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,026
Ready, set, go.

557
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,736
-You can do it, Ha-jin!
-Go!

558
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,950
Pull her!

559
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,245
-No!
-No!

560
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,247
Pull!

561
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,290
Yes! Pull harder!

562
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,509
-That's it!
-You're doing great!

563
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,261
Come on. What is she doing?

564
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,263
Ha-jin, come on!

565
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,279
Nicely done!

566
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,829
Good job.

567
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,793
Good game.

568
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,547
-Good game.
-Good game.

569
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,923
-Well done!
-Great job!

570
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,010
-Great!
-That's it!

571
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,303
You're so strong.

572
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,139
-Well done!
-Good job!

573
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,223
Who's next?

574
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,310
I thought my shoulder was going to pop.

575
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,274
Could we interview you?

576
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,527
-Me?
-The others all had a turn.

577
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:42,945
Sure.

578
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,706
How is life in the cheering squad?

579
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,623
It's fun.

580
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,500
When's your favorite moment?

581
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,545
When we take breaks.

582
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,842
I heard you were
going out with the leader.

583
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,469
Did any situations arise

584
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,305
from dating the leader?

585
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,806
Well…

586
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,641
I'm not sure.

587
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,602
You do know

588
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,688
that your boyfriend used to date
Hokyung's leader, right?

589
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,107
All the others seemed to know.

590
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,277
Right. I do.

591
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,448
Doesn't it make things awkward
to have your boyfriend's ex

592
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,202
be the leader of Hokyung's cheering squad?

593
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,246
-Well--
-I think I'd be bothered by it.

594
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,291
If his ex is a conglomerate heir
and your rival team's leader,

595
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,835
-wouldn't it bother you?
-I know, right?

596
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,636
Well, you see…

597
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,887
That's enough.

598
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,269
I never agreed to let you

599
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,189
broadcast anything
about our members' personal lives.

600
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,732
Look, we were just--

601
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,650
It's fine.

602
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,694
You're right.

603
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,532
Ha-jin is beautiful and she's amazing.

604
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,659
She's someone I respect.

605
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,327
But I've decided

606
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,832
not to think about
any previous relationships.

607
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,670
I would've been jealous before.

608
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,381
And it would've made me feel small.

609
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,676
But…

610
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,638
I've learned that there are people
who love me for who I am.

611
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,977
I don't want to be ashamed of myself

612
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,855
when I'm already loved for being me.

613
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,734
Because I'm a pretty decent person myself.

614
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,411
You can't air it now, can you?

615
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,207
We can just edit that part out.

616
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,337
Her improv was good.

617
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,517
I wonder if they can do it.

618
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,686
-They're quick on their feet.
-That's true.

619
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,604
-Right.
-Jeong-woo.

620
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,820
I've talked to them
so they won't air anything personal.

621
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,823
It isn't like you

622
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,159
to break the rules like that.

623
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,953
I mean Hae-yi.

624
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,124
You have to run too.

625
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,085
You must really like her.

626
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,339
I didn't know you could be so passionate.

627
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,424
It just happened.

628
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,013
Let's go. We should get ready
for the relay race.

629
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,644
HOKYUNG'S RUNNERS
CHOI JI-YOON, LEE SEUNG-MIN, KIM YEONG-JU

630
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,231
YONHEE'S RUNNERS
JOO SEON-JA, JIN SEON-HO, DO HAE-YI

631
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:15,074
LEE HA-JIN

632
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,909
Gather around everyone.

633
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,702
Okay.

634
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,375
We win, no matter what.

635
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,587
I'll double your training time
if you lose, so you better win.

636
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,256
-Okay.
-Okay.

637
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,550
Is that all you've got?

638
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,676
-Okay!
-Okay!

639
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,593
All right.

640
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,974
This will be our last training,
so be careful not to get injured.

641
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,225
Let's win this.

642
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,268
-Okay.
-Okay.

643
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,519
Don't worry!

644
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,437
-Don't you worry!
-Okay.

645
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,565
Let's do this, everyone!

646
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,024
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

647
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,653
Do your stretches.

648
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,029
-Okay.
-Okay.

649
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,410
We took care of it thanks to you.

650
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,580
I didn't do it for you.

651
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,291
To emphasize the love triangle,

652
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,960
we'll need her to compete
a little more with Do Hae-yi.

653
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,005
How about we just interview Do Hae-yi?

654
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,590
That'd be the most effective.

655
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,091
Right? Okay.

656
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,635
I know.

657
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,514
But still, thank you.

658
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:34,570
RELAY RACE

659
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,162
-Get ready!
-Ready!

660
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,336
Run!

661
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,338
Run, Ji-yoon!

662
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,631
-Hurry!
-Let's go!

663
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,924
-Keep running!
-Run faster!

664
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,432
You can do it, Seon-ja!

665
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,902
Hurry!

666
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,641
Run!

667
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,685
You can do it!

668
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,706
Sorry, guys.

669
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,303
Rest up, and I'll see you all tomorrow.

670
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,971
-Okay.
-Okay.

671
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,348
-Theia!
-Great job today.

672
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,229
Good work today.

673
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,733
Consider yourself lucky.

674
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,235
We won't go easy on you
at the Hokyung-Yonhee match.

675
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,028
That's the same for us.

676
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,154
Congratulations…

677
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,659
on leaving the past behind
and living in the present.

678
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,246
How did she do it?

679
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,498
How did she make you change so much?

680
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,041
I'm tired now.

681
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,970
Were you always this irritating?

682
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,930
-What?
-Happy?

683
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,140
I'm off.

684
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,067
-Really?
-Yes. You look so different.

685
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,152
-Seriously.
-You have something in your hair.

686
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,612
-My hair?
-Yes.

687
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,447
-Thanks.
-I think you cheered too hard.

688
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,865
-Right.
-I guess so.

689
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,369
Jeez, look at him enjoying that.
I shouldn't have given him a makeover.

690
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,997
Hey, let's go.

691
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,750
-You look so different without glasses.
-I know, right? He reminds me of someone.

692
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,377
Excuse me. My stuff is here.

693
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,175
-You did great today.
-Thanks. Bye.

694
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,135
See you tomorrow.

695
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,809
Do you want to grab something to eat?

696
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,229
Yes.

697
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,421
You asked me why I kept seeing
worthless guys like that, right?

698
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,717
I don't think I said those exact words.

699
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,760
You're right.

700
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,846
I admit that I did.

701
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,474
What I meant was…

702
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,392
You see,

703
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,355
I don't like to get serious.

704
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:08,070
That's why I kept seeing guys
I'd be able to date for a fling.

705
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,282
That makes me feel more at ease.

706
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,204
But you can't really
call that a relationship.

707
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,997
Then what's it supposed to be like?

708
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,167
Well, one where you love each other,

709
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,712
understand each other,
and look after each other.

710
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,839
Exactly.

711
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,344
You have to make an effort
to get to know and understand someone.

712
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,223
-It's burdensome.
-How so?

713
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,935
I don't believe in things like that.

714
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,064
I don't want to hurt anyone.

715
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,859
Nor do I want anything in return.

716
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,951
I told you during our retreat

717
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,286
not to have feelings for me.

718
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,539
I really meant it

719
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,042
because you seem like a good kid.

720
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,922
And because I'm not.

721
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,884
There's this thing

722
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,096
that my mom always says.

723
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,017
"There's nothing more foolish
than giving up on things

724
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,394
just because you're scared."

725
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,023
"You can deal with anything that arises
after you face them first."

726
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,697
Do you choose to run away from your fears
and suffer the consequences?

727
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,078
You're quite good with words.

728
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,378
At first, I just liked you
because I thought you were cool.

729
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,173
But not anymore.

730
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,761
I like you because you're warm-hearted.

731
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,013
You may be harsh with words,

732
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,974
but you look after Jeong-woo and us
more than anyone else.

733
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,436
No bad person
ever looks after others like that.

734
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,691
You're a great person.

735
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,987
What makes you think you're not?

736
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,284
You shouldn't do that to yourself.

737
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,290
You're right.

738
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,710
I should be the last person

739
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,046
to be doing this to myself.

740
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,552
That's why I'm going to stop
making such bad decisions.

741
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,067
I won't be dating anyone for a while.

742
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,278
What?

743
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,074
I'll spend some time alone
while taking a break from dating.

744
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,328
I think that's what I need right now.

745
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:10,877
You don't have to go that far.

746
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,962
Thanks.

747
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:17,676
I wouldn't have come to this decision
if it weren't for you.

748
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,557
I asked you to eat with me
because I wanted to thank you.

749
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,309
-Well…
-Let's eat. The food's getting cold.

750
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,565
How long? A year?

751
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,609
-Just eat.
-Okay.

752
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,655
Around two years?

753
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,205
It's hot.

754
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,089
Gosh.

755
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,219
It's not three years, is it?

756
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,519
You've done a lot today.
Are you sure this is enough?

757
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,106
There's nothing better than
having ramyeon outdoors after exercising.

758
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,400
Not a thing.

759
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,029
Perfect for our 100th-day anniversary.

760
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,245
It must be their anniversary.

761
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,543
You're right.

762
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,629
Should we celebrate ours too?

763
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,469
You said you didn't like
celebrating anniversaries.

764
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,181
Actually, every day feels like
an anniversary these days.

765
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,558
I'm so happy every day.

766
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,105
I like how I'm having ramyeon with you.

767
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,983
And I like hanging out with others
on the cheering squad.

768
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,110
I even like training.

769
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,908
It kind of scares me

770
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,119
to be so happy every day.

771
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,122
I wonder if I deserve this happiness.

772
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,376
You'll feel that way even more now.

773
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,714
You have me.

774
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,051
I'm yours and you're mine.

775
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,428
Just eat your ramyeon.

776
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,207
I like this.

777
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,752
Huh?

778
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,049
I like you.

779
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:08,763
I like you too.

780
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,320
Don't look at me.

781
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,238
I won't.

782
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,699
You're looking at me.

783
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,868
How can I not?

784
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,662
YOUTH IS BEING YOUNG AT HEART

785
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,589
You should go.

786
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,135
-By the way…
-Yes?

787
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,388
-I feel that way too.
-Feel what way?

788
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,932
I'm so happy every day

789
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,061
because I have you.

790
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:03,985
See you.

791
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,732
God is cruel.

792
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,163
If he were going to let me down yet again,

793
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,128
he should have never raised my hopes.

794
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,880
I think I kind of get it.

795
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,093
I can picture this place
filled with a crowd cheering on.

796
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,851
We now present to you
the new song for 2019!

797
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,853
"Higher"!

798
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,897
Ready!

799
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,400
If we had never

800
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,153
shined so brightly…

801
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,590
If only I never got to be so happy…

802
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,723
it would have been far less painful

803
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,393
to face such a familiar betrayal.

804
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,258
Why did you want to meet at a café?

805
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,514
What is it? Did something happen?

806
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,187
Come on. It's fine, just tell me.

807
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,734
Let's…

808
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,697
break up.

809
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,882
God is cruel.

810
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,948
Sleepyhead. Are you all right?

811
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,032
It's actually been really hard.

812
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,618
Hae-yi's quitting? Why all of a sudden?

813
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,870
Everyone is worried.

814
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,414
I am too.

815
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,040
I can't believe Jin-il did that.

816
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:46,958
Did he get arrested?

817
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,543
He's still on the run.

818
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,753
Call the police if you ever see Jin-il.

819
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,464
-What about Hae-yi?
-She wasn't in the restroom.

820
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,799
Sleepyhead!

821
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,092
Hae-yi!

822
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,052
Why are you doing this?

823
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,387
Shut up!

824
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,805
All of this will only end once you die.

825
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:06,603
