1
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,199
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,785
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,291
That's a relief.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,709
Were you…

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,088
worried a lot?

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,673
Please…

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,177
Please stop making me worry.

8
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,584
Hae-yi!

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,175
You were here.
I was looking all over for you.

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,968
When did you get here?

11
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,221
Jeong-woo. Cho-hui is looking for you.

12
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,348
Right.

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,433
Let's get back.

14
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,312
Something came up at home,
so I need to get back.

15
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,522
I just need to find my phone.

16
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,732
-Your phone was off.
-Really?

17
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,735
Why now?

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,529
Why don't you go, and then call--

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,281
I'll come with you. You can use my phone.

20
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,285
You can head back. I'll go with her.

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,333
I'll grab your things.

22
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,085
Okay.

23
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,962
Sure.

24
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,714
Call me if anything happens.

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,049
Don't worry about it.

26
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,177
Should anything happen,
I'll take care of it.

27
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,266
I'll see you tomorrow then.

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,725
Okay.

29
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,935
Right, sure.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,751
Just wait. I'll be there soon.

31
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,421
I'm almost there.

32
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,510
Thanks. I was in a hurry.

33
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,721
It's nothing.

34
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,642
Did something happen?
Why do you look so down?

35
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,938
I know, right?

36
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,984
Nothing happened,
but I don't feel so good.

37
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,402
Sir, can you stop here?

38
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,195
But this isn't your neighborhood.

39
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,325
I need to go to the police station.

40
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,409
What?

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,507
My goodness!

42
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,304
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,598
I should've taught my brother better.

44
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,309
Can you please let it slide this once?

45
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,393
Look.

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,772
We're not complete strangers.

47
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,816
So I didn't want to
involve the police either.

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,943
But…

49
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,987
look what he did to my son!

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,532
-I'm so sorry, ma'am.
-I'm sorry.

51
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,284
-I'm so sorry.
-We're sorry.

52
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,912
-Goodness.
-Hey.

53
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,914
Get up.

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,459
Apologize this instant.

55
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,339
I did nothing wrong. Get up now.

56
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,466
Look at him.

57
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,678
I'll apologize in his stead.

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,222
He's still young
and doesn't know any better.

59
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,766
He's only a year younger than you.
He's not young.

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,726
He should know better.

61
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,897
Fine. Let's take things to court.

62
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,149
-My goodness, ma'am.
-Get up. Let's go.

63
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,069
Ma'am, can you please calm down?

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,322
-Hurry and apologize.
-Sir, we're so sorry.

65
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,158
-Sir, we're sorry.
-How could you?

66
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,493
Can you please stop?

67
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,956
Stop what? You go and apologize right now.

68
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,958
-I said stop!
-Stop what?

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,546
You can't afford to have any faults
on your student record.

70
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,298
Do you want to end up an ex-convict?

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,091
Are you trying to screw up your life?

72
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,093
Yes, that's right!

73
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,304
It's my life.

74
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,972
I'll be the one to screw it up,

75
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,349
so you stay out of it.

76
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,101
-You crazy bastard.
-Hit me.

77
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,604
Hit me as much as you want,

78
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,775
but don't ever kneel
to that bastard's mom again.

79
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,545
That bastard.

80
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,299
Why is he holding onto his ego
when his life is about to be ruined?

81
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,093
He drives me nuts.

82
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,638
You sound like a mom
when you're only his sister.

83
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,060
Thanks.

84
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,437
You should get going.

85
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,440
I can wait until he's done.

86
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,151
I'm just too embarrassed. Just go.

87
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,487
See? You're holding on to your ego too.

88
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,115
I'm not in the mood
to joke around with you.

89
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,454
Your brother probably had his reason
not to hold back.

90
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,046
Give me your bag. Let me carry that.

91
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,172
Come on.

92
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,429
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

93
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,350
I hope we meet again
under better circumstances.

94
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,434
See you.

95
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,936
Guys.

96
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,022
Can't you guys just get along?

97
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,108
Yes. Is Hae-yi all right?

98
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,734
Yes, she left.

99
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,778
Did everything work out well?

100
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,322
-Yes.
-What happened?

101
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,158
It's private,
so I don't think I can tell you.

102
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,327
All right then.

103
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,247
I'm just glad to hear it worked out.

104
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,999
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

105
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,380
He has a knack for getting on my nerves.

106
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,591
That little punk. I ought to just…

107
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,398
Someone left it in Hae-yi's locker.

108
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,984
YOU'LL SUFFER TOO

109
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,113
UNKNOWN USER
KICK DO HAE-YI OUT

110
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,167
ANONYMOUS
THEIA'S FORMER LEADER IS SCREWED

111
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,128
MAYBE HE'S JUST A SCAPEGOAT

112
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,212
DID THEY FINALLY COME TO THEIR SENSES?

113
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,922
MAYBE WE'LL FINALLY LEARN
WHY LAST YEAR'S FESTIVAL WAS SUCH A MESS

114
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,800
We're getting more positive comments
than I expected.

115
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,802
You're right.

116
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,848
By the way, do you know
your sister's actual phone number?

117
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,558
I do. She's family.

118
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,476
Right?

119
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,145
Then how about sharing it with me?

120
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,230
You're not her type.

121
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,648
How would you know?

122
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,443
I'm different when I approach someone
with the intent of dating them.

123
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,654
I'm glad I'll never have to see
what that's like.

124
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,872
I'll ask her though.

125
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,000
Really? You have to promise.

126
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,128
You've made a huge commotion again.

127
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,380
I just did what needed to be done.

128
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,133
There's no need to be so serious about it.

129
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,763
As for this year's festival,

130
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,682
-let's just run it as we always have.
-Sorry?

131
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,352
The budget's already been wired to them,

132
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,938
and there's no good reason
for you to take over immediately.

133
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,190
-But--
-It's time for your meeting, sir.

134
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,900
You're right.

135
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,443
Let's wrap it up for today.

136
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,612
Then what about the match
in the second semester?

137
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,696
The Yonhee-Hokyung match?

138
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,576
We still have time,

139
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,329
so why don't we decide
after we see how the festival goes?

140
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,166
Right. We'll keep an eye on the festival.

141
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,385
When are they coming?

142
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,471
SETTLEMENT COST
PAY IF POSSIBLE, BUT HOW MUCH?

143
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:20,268
JAE-YI'S SETTLEMENT COST

144
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,525
HOSPITAL BILLS
MENTAL COMPENSATION

145
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,734
PART-TIME JOB, TUTORING (ADS),
MORE HOURS WITH BUTLER CHOI

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,074
Mom.

147
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,034
Seong-cheol is
Gwang-cheol's brother, right?

148
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,454
-And he's a high school senior?
-He should be.

149
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,665
Can I have his mom's number?

150
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,501
Everyone gather around.

151
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,378
-Hello.
-Hello.

152
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,671
Take a seat, everyone.

153
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,383
We'll get down
to the festival preparation now.

154
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,969
I think we've been busy enough as is.

155
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,513
No. Until now,
it was easy peasy lemon squeezy.

156
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
Now, you'll be
stressed depressed lemon zest.

157
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,683
-What the heck?
-Gross.

158
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,602
Concept planning,
finding sponsors, making tickets,

159
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,020
putting up banners, handing out tickets,

160
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,397
setting up the amphitheater,
and on top of that, training.

161
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,901
-What?
-But we still have

162
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,654
some good news left for you. And that is…

163
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,911
The freshmen will showcase our new song
during the festival this year!

164
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,955
-Really?
-That's right.

165
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,502
It's rare for freshmen
to take the stage during a festival.

166
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,087
You should be proud of yourselves.

167
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,423
However, not everyone will be on stage.

168
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,717
Oh, come on.

169
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,552
This is a competition.

170
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,183
-Hello.
-Hello.

171
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,225
-Hello.
-Hi.

172
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,356
This is Jeong-woo's team.

173
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,151
This is Cho-hui's team.

174
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,282
The winning team will take the stage.

175
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,409
I wish you all the best of luck.

176
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,827
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

177
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,249
The planning team will help us out
since we're always shorthanded.

178
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,793
The person in charge of planning

179
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,545
will be Yu-min this year.

180
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,093
I'm Lee Yu-min, Theia's 47th recruit.

181
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
I've been away from school for a while,

182
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,556
so I don't know how well I'll do,
but I look forward to working with you.

183
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,269
It's the return of the first love.

184
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,486
Guys.

185
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,156
Do you know what I hate the most?

186
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,451
It's losing.

187
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,664
Let's give it our best.

188
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,834
-Okay!
-Okay.

189
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,131
Theia!

190
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,925
I told you not to do that.

191
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,927
Jeong-woo. What's your plan for victory?

192
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,054
I really want to take the stage this time.

193
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,142
The plan for victory isn't with me.
You three need to come up with one.

194
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,394
How did you divide up the teams?

195
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,355
We never got any say in it.

196
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,107
Isn't this too one-sided?

197
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,733
Why?

198
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,569
You don't like that you're on my team?

199
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,781
We randomized the teams because
giving you a say could cause a problem.

200
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,827
If you really want to switch teams,
talk to the other members and ask them.

201
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,953
It's fine.

202
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,705
Whatever you say goes.

203
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,128
Good work today.

204
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,504
-Good job.
-Hae-yi.

205
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,506
Yes?

206
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,341
This is yours, right?

207
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,928
Where did you…

208
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,139
I found it near Cheers yesterday.

209
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,184
I charged it and saw
the messages were addressed to you.

210
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,977
Thank you.

211
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,895
Of course.

212
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:53,981
Wait.

213
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,984
Do we know each other?

214
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,653
No.

215
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,893
Did something serious happen last night?

216
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,604
I heard Seon-ja mention a lawyer earlier.

217
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,067
Seon-ja was just overreacting.

218
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,944
That's a relief then.

219
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,323
You know, Yu-min…

220
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,534
She's around a lot.

221
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,327
You must be happy.

222
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,038
Right.

223
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,375
So you are.

224
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,172
Why did you hug me yesterday?

225
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,298
What?

226
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,883
I mean… What?

227
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,635
Well, I…

228
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,931
Because I was relieved?

229
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,183
Right.

230
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,435
So you hugged me
because you were relieved.

231
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,353
That's right.

232
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,771
Sure.

233
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,606
That's settled then.

234
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,653
I'll think of it
as an action of camaraderie.

235
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,364
"Settled"?

236
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,491
We should keep things clear.

237
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,119
If we don't settle things like this
with the ends untied,

238
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,081
you're just asking to be misunderstood.

239
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,127
I might end up thinking you like me, or…

240
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,044
What?

241
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,007
But people in the West
hug as a way of saying hello.

242
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,258
I can even do it now.

243
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,263
Goodbye.

244
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,655
Coward.

245
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,786
Jeong-woo.

246
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,872
Yes?

247
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,834
You asked for a meeting
but didn't show up.

248
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,795
Oh, the meeting.

249
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,713
Right.

250
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,548
I should go.

251
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,467
Your bag.

252
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,470
My bag. Thank you.

253
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,679
Bye.

254
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,349
Let's go.

255
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,648
Damn it. I was going to leave first.

256
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,609
Is he just full of love for everyone?

257
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,324
I checked with the seniors
who'll congratulate us.

258
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,868
They said they'll have time here,

259
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,163
so we should film their interviews then.

260
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,417
Hey.

261
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,170
Sure.

262
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,464
I'll get the detailed schedules.

263
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,636
Are you thinking about
the hug from earlier?

264
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,389
-I'm sorry?
-Are you and her--

265
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,682
No, not at all.

266
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,850
We're not allowed to date other members.

267
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,520
There must be something
going on between you and her.

268
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,897
Right?

269
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,815
What?

270
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,067
-No.
-So there is.

271
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,113
You're always like that
when something's up.

272
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,870
2016 YONHEE UNIVERSITY FESTIVAL

273
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,666
"Our season is…"

274
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,670
"blue."

275
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,257
What do you think? Cool, right?

276
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,676
It is. You did an amazing job.

277
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,594
Why don't you look at it first?

278
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,512
I did.

279
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,394
Why do you have to
stare at my face like that?

280
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,604
People might think you have a crush on me.

281
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,064
Yes. I mean, no.

282
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,566
What?

283
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,276
Is that a yes or a no?

284
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,235
It was a no.

285
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,404
You sure are full of yourself.

286
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,990
You did have a crush on me then.

287
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,118
That was a long time ago.

288
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,954
Did you know?

289
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,041
I was interested in you then.

290
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,254
But I thought you just
thought of me as a close friend.

291
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,007
I only found out later that you liked me.

292
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,800
I guess the timing wasn't right.

293
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,514
I'm glad it didn't work out.

294
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
I wonder sometimes.

295
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,321
What would it have been like

296
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,907
if I hadn't dated Gyu-jin then?

297
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,911
Would none of it have happened

298
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,498
if I had held back my feelings?

299
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,508
It's ridiculous, right?

300
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,595
He didn't even remember
his own name, yet he…

301
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,353
You really have to be half-drunk

302
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,523
to be able to get through life.

303
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,818
That's the way to live life,
don't you think?

304
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,778
Why would you drink with me again

305
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,823
and not with those fancy friends of yours?

306
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,368
Because my fancy friends
don't drink during the day.

307
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,207
But you never know.
They could be drinking secretly at home.

308
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,170
I guess you rich people
have a complex life too.

309
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,505
Isn't that right? Cheers.

310
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:56,426
It's only natural that things
get more complicated the more you have.

311
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,845
You brat.

312
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:02,266
You have the wrong idea if you think
life without much is simple.

313
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,601
Everything is complicated
on so many levels

314
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,520
even when you don't have much.

315
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,397
What would you know when you're loaded?

316
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,233
Everyone everywhere
lives a complicated life.

317
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:17,781
-Everyone.
-So how are you doing for money?

318
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,199
What?

319
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,077
How much do you have?

320
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,580
What?

321
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,457
Hey.

322
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,169
-How about we…
-Yes?

323
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,337
don't talk about our personal lives?

324
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,755
Fine.

325
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,635
It'll only be bothersome
to know the details of each other's lives.

326
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,764
It's good to remain as friends
who get together at times

327
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,725
to share a drink together, isn't it?

328
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,935
No emotional stuff.

329
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:52,608
We already have more than enough
emotional relationships, no?

330
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,359
Isn't that right?

331
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,029
Sure.

332
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,532
Fine, let's just drink then.

333
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,492
Cheers. Nice to meet you again.

334
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,212
Oh, no. Am I drunk?

335
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,213
Not yet.

336
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,095
Straight ahead.

337
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,144
You can't do that here.

338
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,368
HAE-YI'S

339
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,514
Gosh.

340
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,190
Are you nuts?

341
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,778
Do you know how much this bag costs?

342
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,947
It's counterfeit, isn't it?

343
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,991
I've lived in this neighborhood
long enough to tell.

344
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,659
What?

345
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,579
Do I look like someone
who would carry around a counterfeit bag?

346
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,666
This isn't a bag you can buy

347
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,043
just because you want to.

348
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,337
What should I do?

349
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,299
After all, you need to be able
to afford something like this

350
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,842
to tell how valuable it is.

351
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,887
What are you going to do about this?

352
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,766
Why would you ask me that?

353
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,227
You were the one who threw up, not me.

354
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,273
That's true,

355
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,987
but I was going to
throw up here on this wall.

356
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,488
Exactly.

357
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,948
I had you throw up on your bag

358
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,242
because you were going to throw up
in front of our house.

359
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,078
Isn't it right that you throw up
on your own stuff?

360
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,414
Not on someone else's wall or plants?

361
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,208
But still…

362
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,004
This still isn't right.

363
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,089
I'd never throw up on this bag.

364
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,259
I'd rather pay
for this wall to be rebuilt.

365
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,844
Goodness.

366
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,680
My bag.

367
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,100
-Yes?
-Where are you?

368
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,393
I'm in front of our house.

369
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,438
Mom, there's a drunkard here.

370
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,649
-"A drunkard"?
-A drunkard who hears really well.

371
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,485
I'll be up soon. Okay.

372
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,654
I was going to let this slide, but you--

373
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,739
Fine.

374
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,075
I get it.

375
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,706
This is for dry cleaning.

376
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,002
If we were to get down
to who's responsible,

377
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,089
I don't need to pay you
since I was protecting my property.

378
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,758
But I'm giving it to you
out of common courtesy.

379
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,510
Are we good?

380
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,223
One…

381
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,684
Damn it. That little…

382
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,605
This will be nowhere near enough.

383
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,274
She thinks this'll do for dry cleaning?

384
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,986
Is this two bills or one?

385
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,074
Hey. Where'd you go?

386
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,830
That bag can't be real, can it?

387
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,710
What is it, Mom?

388
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,089
Goodness.

389
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,967
-You're here.
-Are you celebrating your son's demise?

390
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,679
I'm drinking because I'm frustrated.
I was trying to pull some strings.

391
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,431
I couldn't bring myself
to talk about money while sober.

392
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,934
-What are you saying?
-I don't even know.

393
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,437
-Where's Jae-yi?
-He's going straight to the academy.

394
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,108
Has he pleaded with them to let it slide?

395
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,694
-As if he would.
-What on earth is he thinking?

396
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,114
-I should go now and--
-Hey, don't.

397
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,366
He says he'll quit school
if you go plead with them.

398
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,535
-What?
-You know what he's like.

399
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,163
He's usually the compliant type,
but once he gets upset…

400
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,291
He's more than capable of quitting school.

401
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,420
That punk must
really want to ruin his life.

402
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,463
I'm at my wit's end.

403
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,008
I'll need to come up
with the settlement money somehow.

404
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:33,638
Why isn't there
a single day of peace in my life?

405
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,190
Bro!

406
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,863
Here.

407
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,824
I thought it'd be better than tofu.

408
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,743
You know how people eat tofu
after being released.

409
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,206
How did you know I'd be here?

410
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,251
Did Hae-yi tell you?

411
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:04,878
No.

412
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,589
I have some shares in that academy.

413
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,091
What the hell?

414
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,260
You see,

415
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,014
I might be able to get you out of trouble.

416
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,353
But what would you do for me in return?

417
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,025
Then let's settle the schedule at that.

418
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,485
-Okay.
-Okay.

419
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,571
But people in the West
hug as a way of saying hello.

420
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,073
I can even do it now.

421
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,032
Goodbye.

422
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,663
Coward.

423
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,457
What are you doing?

424
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,918
-Hey.
-Huh?

425
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,169
What are you doing?

426
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,421
It's nothing.

427
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,724
Guys.

428
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,562
How about…

429
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,566
we say goodbye the American way today?

430
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,609
The American way?

431
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,528
Goodbye.

432
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,169
What's wrong with you?

433
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,132
He's okay, right?

434
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,509
Maybe he's gone mad from all the fatigue.

435
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,552
I know, right?

436
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,393
Why on earth doesn't it feel the same?

437
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,739
It isn't the same.

438
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,843
I really should be getting paid

439
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,596
for the amount of work I'm putting in.

440
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,356
What? Did he just avoid me?

441
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,115
What's gotten into you, Jeong-woo?

442
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,542
-Again.
-I'm sorry?

443
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,128
You copied last year's choreography.

444
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,967
-Do it again.
-Okay.

445
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,803
Do this again,

446
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,013
and you're pulling all-nighters with me.

447
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,098
-Okay.
-Okay.

448
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,481
Why did I end up with that witch?

449
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,401
I'm not in the right frame of mind
to be doing this.

450
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,237
I thought it looked cool.

451
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,988
-Who?
-Me.

452
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,325
I'm so stressed right now.

453
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,081
What is it?

454
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,921
We have more people,
so it'd be embarrassing to lose.

455
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,381
Show me what you prepared.

456
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,260
Don't tell me…

457
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,387
There's no way.

458
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,014
You two have something prepared, right?

459
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,685
1-3-5-2-4-6, 2-4-6-2-3-1.

460
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,602
What?

461
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,272
CHOREOGRAPHIES FOR THE NEW SONG

462
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,648
There are six basic choreographies.

463
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,567
If we arrange them
to the rhythm of the new song,

464
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,694
it'll be 1-3-5-2-4-6, 2-4-6-2-3-1.

465
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,028
You memorized all of this?

466
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,364
I'm good at memorizing.

467
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,908
I'm starting to like you a little more.

468
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,538
-Where are you going?
-I have to go somewhere.

469
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,834
Does he think
he's the only one who's busy?

470
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,210
He didn't prepare a thing.

471
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,296
Is he expecting us to do all the work?

472
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,468
Jae-yi's lawsuit has been dropped!

473
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,344
-What?
-A lawsuit?

474
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,475
-So Jae-yi doesn't have to serve time?
-No, he doesn't!

475
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,729
I'm so relieved
our little Jae-yi won't have to suffer.

476
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,732
But what happened?
I thought his parents were super upset.

477
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,941
-"Our little Jae-yi"?
-I don't know.

478
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,402
He said he'd handle it.
Maybe he pleaded with them.

479
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,946
Who cares as long as
it's been taken care of?

480
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,493
-Yes!
-Stop.

481
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,119
-I'm so happy.
-That hurts.

482
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,705
I'm so glad.

483
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,418
The girl on the cover is Yu-min, who was
involved in that accident two years ago.

484
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,254
And someone put that magazine
in Hae-yi's locker.

485
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,840
Just let it go.

486
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,385
-Why?
-What do you mean why?

487
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,888
I told you to stop covering it.

488
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,641
What if all of this isn't a prank?

489
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,894
What if someone
ends up dying like the prophecy said?

490
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,562
Don't you think
you're taking it too seriously?

491
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,773
We only said those things
to cause a controversy.

492
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,235
Forget it, and go work
on the plans for the festival.

493
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,167
I'll contact the agencies
with the list we made today.

494
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,418
Sure.

495
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,754
As for the seniors' interviews--

496
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,131
Jeong-woo. You have a nosebleed.

497
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,638
I'll do it.

498
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,392
Do you even get any sleep?

499
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,186
-I do.
-You only sleep a couple hours, don't you?

500
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,357
Take it easy
or you'll end up harming your health.

501
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,568
I'll get some rest
once the festival is over.

502
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,320
It's nothing to grind yourself into.

503
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,615
It doesn't mean much in the end.

504
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,124
I'll go get more tissues.

505
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,876
Okay.

506
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,059
VICE LEADER
JACKET, BLOUSE, SKIRT

507
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,768
Yu-min.

508
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,522
Jeong-woo. My meds.

509
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,440
They're in my bag.

510
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,454
Are you all right?

511
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,206
Take slow breaths.

512
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,929
Are you okay?

513
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,818
What's going on? Is Yu-min sick?

514
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,024
Next to you.

515
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,663
I'm glad things worked out for Jae-yi.

516
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,790
Of course.

517
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,792
All he has is his smart brain.

518
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,586
If he didn't get to go to college
because of that…

519
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,629
Gosh, just the thought frightens me.

520
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,132
See? You act like his mom
when you're only his sister.

521
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,926
You and your brother have a mom.

522
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,678
Let your mom do her job.

523
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,013
Jeez.

524
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,265
What would a spoiled
rich kid like you know?

525
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,061
Why do you assume I don't know anything?

526
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,773
I mean,

527
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,443
because you have everything.

528
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,197
Did I upset you?

529
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,033
I have my problems.

530
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,077
What kind of problems?

531
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,295
Having people assume
that I don't have any problems.

532
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,303
Right. I'm sure life is hard for you.

533
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,764
Cheer up.

534
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,895
What is it that you want?

535
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,481
-Your sister's weakness.
-What?

536
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,525
What's your sister's greatest weakness?

537
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,110
Tell me that and our deal is on.

538
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,986
Money. It's money.

539
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,823
Not that.

540
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,867
I mean her real soft spot.

541
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,830
Something that moves her heart
and not her head.

542
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,255
Showing weakness.

543
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,848
Hae-yi has a soft spot

544
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,184
for wounded people.

545
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,400
"Showing weakness"? This is hard.

546
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,902
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

547
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,991
Can I have this too?

548
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,617
Go ahead.

549
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,828
Later.

550
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:17,341
Don't you think it's about time

551
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:22,138
we redefine our relationship?

552
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,725
Just what are we

553
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,145
supposed to be?

554
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,939
Us?

555
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,984
Two people having fun.

556
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,528
"Two people having fun"?

557
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,531
Yes. You're having fun, and so am I.

558
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,034
We're just having fun.

559
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,578
"Fun"?

560
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,747
Why? You don't like it?

561
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,791
No, I didn't mean that.

562
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,085
See? You feel the same way, right?

563
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,423
Who knew that we'd be
such a great match in bed?

564
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,177
I thought I'd end up regretting that night
for the rest of my life,

565
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,721
but it turned out great.

566
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,016
So…

567
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,603
we're just enjoying each other's company.

568
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,606
We just sleep with each other.

569
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,690
Yes.

570
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,318
There's nothing more to it.

571
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,614
Wait.

572
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,452
Was there a miscommunication between us?

573
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,208
Today will be the last day we have fun.

574
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,964
You see, this wasn't
the type of relationship I was seeking.

575
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,878
Don't wake her up.

576
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,488
My fried chicken!

577
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,953
It was just a dream.

578
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,789
Why do you always…

579
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,583
You need to stop
falling asleep out in public.

580
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,005
Are you talking to me?

581
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,673
I thought you were avoiding me.

582
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,342
I never avoided you.

583
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,095
I just had some
urgent business to attend to then.

584
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,430
So you do know what I'm talking about.

585
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,185
Stop sleeping out in public
and leaving yourself helpless like that.

586
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,146
Whatever. Why would you care so much?

587
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,692
Yes, Yu-min.

588
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,406
Sure. I'll see you at the interview then.

589
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,407
Okay.

590
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,536
Was that Yu-min?

591
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,748
-Yes.
-You're more than sweet to her.

592
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,709
You must be so happy to be busy with her.

593
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,962
-What?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

594
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,923
It's your private matter.
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

595
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,093
But you know that rule
about not dating other members?

596
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,095
I wholeheartedly agree with that.

597
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,389
I can't stand seeing people
get special treatment.

598
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,978
Rules are there for a reason.

599
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,813
It's all in the past.

600
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,525
What?

601
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,319
It's in the past.

602
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,492
Right. Okay.

603
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,506
But I guess if you think about it,

604
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,468
rules are there to be broken.

605
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,554
I'll see you later then.

606
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,472
Theia!

607
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,524
2017
MEMORY, THEIA MATERIALS, SCHOOL LIFE

608
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,504
What's wrong?

609
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,131
I'm at my wit's end.

610
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,093
That's how I feel these days.

611
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,220
What are you saying?

612
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,810
Director Na Jeong-seon?

613
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,271
I'm Theia's 51st recruit
and leader, Park Jeong-woo.

614
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,565
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

615
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,983
My meeting got delayed.

616
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:16,158
Since I've been told that the festival
will be readily prepared,

617
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,452
all you have to do
is come and enjoy yourselves.

618
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,416
To wrap it up, do you have any
words of advice for your juniors?

619
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,418
I don't have that prepared.

620
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,546
You can just say anything
that comes to mind.

621
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,259
Would this be fine?

622
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,178
Everyone.

623
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,180
Live your lives as you wish.

624
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,894
Looking back,

625
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,273
I think I was too careful
when I was in my twenties.

626
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,234
I was emotionally timid

627
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,779
since I was afraid I'd get hurt.

628
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,825
But when I look back,
I find myself regretting it.

629
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,868
Sometimes I wish

630
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,871
I'd lived life to the fullest.

631
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,582
So…

632
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,502
as long as it's within
the boundaries of the law,

633
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,421
live your lives as you wish.

634
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,800
Don't hold back on anything.

635
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,885
And experience as much as you can.

636
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,762
Leave no regrets.

637
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,094
So live your lives as you wish.

638
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,890
Don't hold back on anything.
Leave no regrets.

639
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,814
Are you available tomorrow night?

640
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,526
I have something to tell you.

641
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,121
That's right.

642
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,707
Do first, regret later.

643
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,627
I'll live my life as I wish.

644
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,069
Theia.

645
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,196
Yes, what is it?

646
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,158
Min-jae isn't contributing at all.

647
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,702
You can sort that out between yourselves.

648
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,037
He didn't prepare anything
and won't even participate.

649
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,457
Can't you talk to him?

650
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,208
He won't listen to me,

651
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,586
and Seon-ho doesn't seem to care.

652
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,088
All right then.

653
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,222
Jeong-woo.
Where are we meeting later tonight?

654
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,517
I'll leave you a message.

655
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,436
What is it that you want to tell me?

656
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,229
You wanted to meet in private.

657
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,566
Is it something personal?

658
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,526
Something that's meant
for just the two of us?

659
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,695
Yes. I'll message you.

660
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,205
What could it be?
He said it was something personal.

661
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,332
Why does he look so down though?

662
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,792
No matter how I look at it,

663
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,295
I think I know where this is heading.

664
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,257
Maybe he's nervous.

665
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,052
Or could it be a surprise?

666
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,512
What surprise?

667
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,430
You startled me!

668
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,307
Sleepyhead.

669
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,809
Can't you at least
keep yourself together in public?

670
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,813
I'm worried people will catch on
that you're not sane.

671
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,234
Just wait, Seon-ja.

672
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,946
I might have surprising news
for you later tonight.

673
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,532
I'm not curious at all, but what is it?

674
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,741
Can I join in?

675
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,327
-Hi.
-What is it?

676
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,995
Right. Well…

677
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,830
It's nothing.

678
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,668
I'm so hungry.

679
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,170
-You're hungry, right?
-No.

680
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,964
-Yes, you are.
-Not at all.

681
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,382
-Shall we go eat?
-I'm not hungry.

682
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,592
-Where are you taking me?
-Just come.

683
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,427
Bye.

684
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,933
You said you wanted to
join the cheering squad since high school.

685
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,772
I know you meant what you said
during your audition

686
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,733
because I've noticed your genuine passion.

687
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,069
In the end, all you'll have left

688
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,364
are the memories you've made here
with your friends.

689
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,408
Try to get along with your friends.

690
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,120
I did.

691
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,757
I prepared for it too.

692
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,436
Why didn't you tell your teammates?

693
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,481
Because they didn't seem to need it.

694
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,276
I'll share this with the others.

695
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,903
It'll be of great help to your team.

696
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,622

KIM MIN-JAE

697

UNKNOWN USER

698
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,130
EMAIL: 19145633@ZMAIL.COM

699
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,306
-I'll get going then.
-Sure.

700
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,924
It's a perfect day to be asked out.

701
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,771
You're here.

702
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,156
-Do you want something to drink?
-Sure, I'm fine with anything.

703
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,450
-I'll pay for it.
-No, it's on me.

704
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,368
It's on me.

705
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,080
Then how about we do
rock, paper, scissors…

706
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,303
-About last time…
-Yes?

707
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,440
I'm sorry if I upset you
by stepping over the line.

708
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,403
I think my actions
may have led to a misunderstanding.

709
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,904
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

710
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,157
What do you mean?

711
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,327
People could get
the wrong idea about you and me.

712
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,874
And I felt the need
to clear things up with you.

713
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,838
I see.

714
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,136
Right.

715
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:04,144
It was nothing, but I overreacted.

716
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,905
You could've just told me.

717
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,826
You didn't have to set time aside for it.

718
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,877
So is that all you needed to tell me?

719
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,426
Yes.

720
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,685
I should get going then.

721
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,813
I don't want the others
to get the wrong idea.

722
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,960
Why did you want to see me?

723
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,472
One, two. One, two, three.

724
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,390
Stop.

725
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,435
Hold that position for three seconds.

726
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,815
Hello. Theia!

727
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,358
Hello.

728
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,798
UNKNOWN USER

729
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,677
JUST WAIT. I'LL EXPOSE EVERYTHING.

730
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,949
One, two, three, and four.

731
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,661
-Five, six, seven, and eight.
-Five, six, seven, and eight.

732
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,623
-One, two, three, and four.
-One, two, three, and four.

733
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,833
-Five, six,
-Five, six,

734
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,251
-seven, and eight.
-Stop.

735
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,504
Pull your leg backward. Arms higher.

736
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,468
You have to train harder
to make up for the training you missed.

737
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,053
Just Seon-ho, again.

738
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,517
Five, six, seven, eight.

739
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,019
One, two, three, and…

740
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,008
Are you all right?

741
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,385
Yes.

742
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,095
There's no need to be ashamed.

743
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,723
It's okay to make mistakes
during practice.

744
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,892
Look at you, acting all cool.

745
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,437
Get back when you're ready.

746
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,066
Jeong-woo.

747
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,153
I heard Yu-min was your first love.

748
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,492
You must feel torn to see her again.

749
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,744
Have you asked her out yet?

750
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,788
I guess you haven't.

751
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,207
Well, the circumstances won't allow it.

752
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,793
I'm not too keen on
talking about this, so let's not.

753
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,420
It's none of your business anyway.

754
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:41,921
Is that even possible?

755
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,633
When I like someone,
I don't care about the circumstances.

756
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,470
Don't you think you're being cowardly?

757
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,514
I'd argue that we're just different.

758
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,600
Don't tell me

759
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,270
you're doing this
because of the rules against dating.

760
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,191
Come on. She's not even
an active member, so it won't matter.

761
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,151
Go after her while you can.

762
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,322
I told you to stop, didn't I?

763
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,200
Do as you like.

764
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,285
You'll know yourself
better than anyone else.

765
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:18,583
But doesn't it mean you still like her
if you're worried about her?

766
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,966
Listen.

767
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,929
I won't let it slide
if you go any further than that.

768
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,224
Bring your personal feelings
into this anymore,

769
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,434
and I won't just sit and watch.

770
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,522
You're the one who's bringing
your personal feelings into this, no?

771
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:44,234
You keep leaving behind loose ends

772
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,403
and that's causing
misunderstandings every time.

773
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,073
Don't worry.

774
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,742
I'm not making that mistake anymore.

775
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,343
Are you okay, Yu-min?

776
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,470
I'm fine.

777
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,056
Training isn't over yet, is it?

778
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,809
I'll go lie down in the office
until the meeting begins.

779
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,082
Don't go.

780
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,792
What?

781
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,006
I don't want you worrying about Yu-min.

782
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,681
Jeong-woo, I…

783
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,357
What is it?

784
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,447
What is it?

785
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,366
Break's over.
We need to get back to training.

786
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,285
I'll be there soon.

787
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,665
Can't you just look at me
and not Jeong-woo?

788
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,123
SPECIAL THANKS TO JANG NA-RA
FOR HER SPECIAL APPEARANCE

789
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,015
Someone who knows
what happened two years ago…

790
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,684
But why Hae-yi?

791
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,060
-Do you like Jeong-woo?
-Sorry?

792
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,479
Just end it at that. Things will only
get complicated if you keep going.

793
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,064
Tomorrow is the day of the festival.

794
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,400
They say you'll end up
dating the person you sit with

795
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,527
at the half-moon spot
the day before the festival.

796
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,238
He's a good person. I like him too.

797
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,972
