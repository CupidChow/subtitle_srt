00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,368
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,

WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE WE?
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,638
WE JUST WANT TO PARTY
WILL I BLACK OUT BEFORE THE SUBWAYS END?

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,848
WE ARE THE PARTY PEOPLE!

8
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,077
Don't forget to bring
the chairs back inside.

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,288
And have these delivered
to the band and the staff evenly.

10
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,664
Yes.

11
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,541
Don't doze off and keep yourself awake.

12
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,295
We got up at 6 a.m.
It's hard keeping myself awake.

13
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,672
Let's get it started
once the planning team gets here.

14
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,008
The first part is the club showcase,
the second is celebrity performances,

15
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,885
and the third is the cheering show.

16
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,180
Make sure to check the times ahead
so we don't fall behind schedule.

17
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,515
-Okay.
-Okay.

18
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,724
Which celebrities are coming?

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,101
The lineup is kept secret
because of scalpers.

20
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,397
Can't you just tell us?
We'll keep it a secret.

21
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,609
You think?

22
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,070
Hurry and work.

23
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,446
You got told off.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,865
Seon-ja, Min-jae,

25
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,700
and Seon-ho. Come to the front.

26
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,876
Your uniforms.

27
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,268
All freshmen will get changed
before the cheering show.

28
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,728
You can't joke around
while you're in those uniforms.

29
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,813
-Okay.
-Okay.

30
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,523
Hae-yi and Yong-il.

31
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,067
You can wear those.

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,531
Okay.

33
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,577
Can we talk?

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,789
ANONYMOUS FORUM
JIN SEON-HO AND DO HAE-YI, DATING?

35
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,001
It was uploaded in the morning,

36
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,878
but it seems to have been deleted
because of the comments.

37
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,005
I don't think the rest of us
have seen it yet.

38
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:52,964
What should we do?

39
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,591
Should I try asking them?

40
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,259
Who could've taken these?

41
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,678
It must've taken quite the effort.

42
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,556
They must've seen it while passing
since the lights were on.

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,850
We'll see how it plays out
and talk about it then.

44
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,059
We have a festival to run first.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,146
Couldn't they be more discreet?

46
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,231
It's like they want
the whole world to know.

BRILLIANCE
OUR EVERLASTINGLY GLOWING MOMENTS

48
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,968
Did Seon-ho stay out last night?

49
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,470
Yes.

50
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,181
He must've slept over at a friend's place.

51
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,183
Don't worry too much.

52
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,771
Aren't these tickets for today?

53
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,148
He must've thrown it out by mistake.

BRILLIANCE

55
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,665
When are they coming?

56
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,962
2019 YONHEE UNIVERSITY FESTIVAL

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,631
I was so excited
that I wouldn't have to stand in line.

58
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,426
Only now do I see
that I'd rather be in line.

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,805
Why am I always standing
with the laborers?

60
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,932
Labor is sacred, right?

61
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,269
You must have a lot of time on your hands,
chatting away like that.

62
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,187
Cho-hui.

63
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,732
I'm fine as long as you're happy.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,110
-Get a move on, yeah?
-Okay.

65
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,241
I haven't seen you work so hard.

66
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,535
You could make the employee of the month.

67
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,161
I'm just doing my job.

68
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,331
Is it because of yesterday? It's fine--

69
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,582
I need to man the ticket booth.

70
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,550
Can't you just look at me?

71
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,641
Maybe he's embarrassed about last night.

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,482
Are you two dating?

73
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,902
Wow.

74
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,821
That's a nice photo.

75
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,948
So are you?

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,869
We'll talk about this later.

77
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,500
Seeing how he won't give me an answer,

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,419
they most likely are dating.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,672
I guess it's better
that the freshmen date each other

80
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,507
instead of dating one of the seniors.

81
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,594
You must have a lot of free time.

82
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,530
I wasn't sleeping.

83
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,494
You would've slept through me
screaming into your ear.

84
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,246
You screamed in my ear?

85
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,332
No.

86
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,085
Okay.

87
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,338
Finish eating. You're dropping crumbs.

88
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,176
Okay.

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,764
I'll leave you to it then.

90
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,641
Jeong-woo.

91
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,728
I'm fine.

92
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,148
-What?
-You seem to feel awkward around me.

93
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,983
Well, Iâ€¦

94
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,238
Whatever.

95
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,573
You must know already.

96
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,830
It's true. I did have feelings for you.

97
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,082
But I understand how you feel,

98
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,960
so I gave up on you completely.

99
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,962
What?

100
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,715
So you don't need to
feel so awkward around me.

101
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,177
Just keep acting like you used to.

102
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,140
Right.

103
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,766
Okay.

104
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,687
So what you're saying isâ€¦

105
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,066
that you're happy
with how things are now, right?

106
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,778
Yes, I guess.

107
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,698
That's enough then.

108
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,335
What's with him?

109
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,421
What did he mean by that?

110
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,133
It feels like I've lost to him.

111
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,636
So annoying.

112
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,186
What?

113
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,022
-Is Ji-yoon coming to the festival today?
-What?

114
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,817
HERE I COME, YONHEE FESTIVAL!

115
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,236
Yes, I guess so.

116
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,325
I don't look as good as I usually do.

117
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:17,205
You don't look any better usually
from what I remember.

118
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,665
What time will she be here?
I should ask her.

119
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,792
I'll ask her to stay
for the cheering show.

120
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,260
Can you stop ghosting Woon-chan?

121
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,638
What?

122
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,473
He keeps asking me about you.

123
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,183
Gi Woon-chan?

124
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,187
I was going to try dating him for fun,
but he talks way too much.

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,605
I'd rather be by myself.

126
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,316
Then why don't you end it with him?

127
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,193
He'll get the idea if I keep ghosting him.

128
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,111
And it's not like
we were in a relationship.

129
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,242
"What time will you be here today?"

130
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,415
-Let's go, Yonhee!
-Yonhee!

131
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,125
So hectic.

132
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,296
MUAK DORMITORY 4

133
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,759
Hello.

134
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
I'm Park Jeong-woo's mother.

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,224
I wanted to drop off
some food I made for him.

136
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,059
Park Jeong-woo?

137
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,353
Park Jeong-wooâ€¦

138
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,771
Right.

139
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,900
He'll be returning late today.

140
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,070
He must be busy studying.

141
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,324
I guess I'll tell him to come early
and grab the food I brought him.

142
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,787
I don't think he'll be able to do that
since it's the day of the festival.

143
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,332
Jeong-woo's the leader
of the cheering squad.

144
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,293
I'm sorry?

145
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,878
The cheering squad?

146
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,382
Our leader said
he won't let it slide this time

147
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,718
if you act independently again
without permission.

148
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,346
Let's just film the festival today
as we're supposed to.

149
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,264
Okay?

150
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,937
Hey.

151
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,526
It was you, wasn't it?

152
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
You uploaded
the broadcasting club's video.

153
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,034
I've got some questions for you.

154
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,120
How did you find out
about the accident two years ago?

155
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,248
It happened during the rehearsal,
so only the cheering squad knows.

156
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,833
Someone tipped us off.

157
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,502
I knew it.

158
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,842
The person who contacted us
and the person who sent those messages

159
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,887
are probably cheering squad members.

160
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,181
And at the retreat too.

161
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,766
The retreat?

162
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,851
They'll probably be watching today.

163
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,400
Please show us your tickets. Thank you.

164
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,736
Thank you. Go ahead.

165
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,238
Thank you.

166
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,584
They'll probably be watching today.

167
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
You're here today, aren't you?

168
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,506
I need to talk to you in person.

169
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,966
And I'll leave after that.

170
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,899
4 O'CLOCK AT THE OBSERVATORY

171
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,771
Hello. I'm Theia's leader, Park Seon-ja.

172
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,528
Seon-ja.

173
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,281
Jeong-woo will beat you up
if he catches you in his uniform.

174
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,950
I'll put it back before he does.

175
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,369
Looks cool, don't you think?
It was over there.

176
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,663
It's a perfect fit.

177
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,332
-I look--
-It looks like you're wearing your dad's.

178
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,961
Take it off before somebody catches you.

179
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,297
Fine, I will.

180
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,926
But what you just said was kinda sexy.

181
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,428
What's wrong with her?

182
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,805
While you're wearing it,

183
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,725
why don't you try doing, "Scream"?

184
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,643
-Do you want it?
-I do.

185
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,728
-Should I?
-Please.

186
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,854
-Please!
-Okay.

187
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,066
Everyone in Yonhee,

188
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,444
scream!

189
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,664
Uniforms are considered sacred
to the cheering squad.

190
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,421
We're dead meat.

191
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,635
I'm telling the seniors.

192
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,430
-You were in it alone--
-Please, you can't.

193
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,640
Let go!

194
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,982
This much is your fault.

195
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,276
Damn it.

196
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,906
Jeong-woo.

197
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,824
Yes?

198
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,576
We have a problem.

199
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,745
What do you mean?

200
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,089
What do we do?

201
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,550
Look, I'm a clothing and textiles major.

202
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,719
I can fix anything
as long as I have a needle and thread.

203
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,597
Hurry up. There's no time for small talk.

204
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,307
I heard that cost five million won.

205
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,190
You mean 500 won?

206
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,027
Don't tell me it's five million.

207
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,447
This thing costs 5000 cream buns?

208
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,617
Do you think you can handle it?

209
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,620
I'll have to try.

210
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,003
What is it now?

211
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,716
All freshmen report to waiting room two.

212
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,802
Who told him?

213
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,513
Did you rat us out?

214
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,476
What? What is it?

215
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,693
YONHEE UNIVERSITY
CHEERING SQUAD

216
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:17,499
Were you lying to me all along
about studying for the civil servant exam?

217
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,834
Mom, Iâ€¦

218
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,465
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,092
Jeong-woo.

220
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,762
How could you be so foolish?

221
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,931
This isn't the time for you
to be doing this.

222
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,349
This will be my last year.

223
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,268
I'll start my studies next year.

224
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,478
Soâ€¦

225
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,773
CHO-HUI

226
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,819
I'll explain everything, Mom.

227
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,739
Just wait here for 20 minutes andâ€¦

228
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,867
I'm going back.

229
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,243
Mom!

230
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,412
I won't feel good
if you just leave like this.

231
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,665
Do you only think about yourself?

232
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,750
Hurry and get going.

233
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,295
You seem to be so busy
being the leader of that cheering squad.

234
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,588
Mom.

235
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,881
Why don't you just--

236
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,677
I never dreamed
you'd let me down like this.

237
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,767
CHO-HUI

238
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,551
The new song showcaseâ€¦

239
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,014
has been canceled today.

240
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,016
-What?
-What?

241
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,225
Is it because of your uniform?

242
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,979
His uniform?

243
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,689
What about it?

244
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,068
It's nothing. Why was it canceled?

245
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,030
We just received the news

246
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,742
that the artist who sang the song
was arrested for DUI.

247
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,120
The planning team has decided

248
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,042
that we refrain from using a song
originally sung by a DUI offender.

249
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,839
But we worked so hard for it.

250
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,762
I know how hard you all workedâ€¦

252
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,682
but this is beyond our control.

253
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,604
Let's hope we have better luck next time.

254
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,691
Then the uniforms--

255
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,153
You'll all have to wear those instead.

256
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,461
"Theia."

257
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,630
"Wonsirim."

258
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,173
Okay.

259
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
Let's go.

260
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,472
I asked them to replace
the freshman song with "Luxembourg."

261
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,016
What?

262
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,977
Right. Okay.

263
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,397
Are you not feeling well?

264
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,401
I'm a little tired.

265
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,403
You can't get sick.

266
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,031
We can't afford it
with all that's happening.

267
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,659
No one gets to be sick
on the day of the festival.

268
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,077
Don't worry.

269
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,080
The freshmen seemed really disappointed.

270
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,083
Let's first deal with the problems
we're facing now.

271
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,086
Keep your head in the game.

272
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,468
Jeong-woo.

273
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,055
The props have arrived.
Could you go check if they're all there?

274
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,457
Hey, are you crying?

275
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,168
I'm not.

276
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,919
But you are.

277
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,637
You really are.

278
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,769
I've waited for this for so long.

279
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,375
Don't cry.

280
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,005
Let's do it.

281
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,220
Let's perform the new song.

282
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,568
Where are the props?

283
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,364
I actually needed to talk to you.

284
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,914
UNKNOWN USER
4 O'CLOCK AT THE OBSERVATORY

285
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,835
I received those messages

286
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,256
two years ago like Hae-yi did.

287
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,716
-Why didn't you raise your hands?
-Why would I?

288
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,593
Hold on.

289
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,764
UNKNOWN USER
STOP DATING SUNG GYU-JIN

290
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,686
BREAK UP WITH HIM

291
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,940
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING
YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE

292
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,656
Even I don't know

293
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,492
whether the accident two years ago

294
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,452
was just an accident

295
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,705
or if it was planned by someone.

296
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,252
But if it truly wasn't an accident,

297
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,005
Hae-yi could be in danger too.

298
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,180
It has to be one of our members.

299
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,057
Someone who isn't present at 4 o'clock.

300
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,392
Could you check for me?

301
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,312
You're the only one I can trust this with.

302
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,612
PLAYLIST

303
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,532
This is the backup song I had in mind

304
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,160
while we were doing the other song.

305
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,163
We'll use the same lyrics,
but we need your help revising some parts.

306
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,414
Sounds good.

307
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,876
Us three will change our choreography
to fit this new song.

308
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,877
-Okay.
-Sure.

309
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,253
What about me?

310
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,840
You'll be in charge
of the most important task.

311
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,425
I'll do anything.

312
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,304
No, I can't.

313
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,472
You can.

314
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:33,226
Why do I have to go to Jae-hyeok
and ask him for a favor?

315
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,063
Well, we need to go see the band right now

316
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,398
and ask them
to revise the song on short notice,

317
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,150
but you're the only oneâ€¦

318
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,735
And why does it have to be Jae-hyeok?

319
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,320
Because he owes you.

320
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
The Med Ball.

321
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,452
Let him show his gratitude while he can.

322
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,455
I too don't want to
ask him for such favors.

323
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,540
Butâ€¦

324
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,919
-Let's go higher
-The circumstances call for it.

325
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,046
-Are you sure this is right?
-Fa.

326
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,798
-Just copy what I'm doing.
-Do.

327
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,468
Sleepyhead.

328
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,972
You're our last remaining hope.

329
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,978
Welcome!

330
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,696
Did you hear?

331
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,533
Apparently, Jin Seon-ho
is dating Do Hae-yi.

332
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,659
Jin Seon-ho?

333
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,204
I saw it on the anonymous forum
before it was deleted in seconds.

334
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,748
-There was a photo of them hugging.
-Really?

335
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,793
No wonder. The two of them seemed fishy.

336
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,838
-Right? They were hugging and everything.
-Gosh.

337
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,214
Oh, gosh.

338
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,133
Who is Do Hae-yi?

339
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,139
Hey, Woon-chan!

340
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,892
You must be busy, huh?

341
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,645
Why don't you get your
rich corporate daddy

342
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,355
to get more people to work for you?

343
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,608
But then again, how rich could he be

344
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,278
when he just runs
some tiny hole-in-the-wall?

345
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,531
Did you also lie to everyone
in the cheering squad

346
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,366
about your dad being a corporate man?

347
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,330
-Jeong-woo is looking for you.
-Okay.

348
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,710
I'll see you around.

349
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,588
And quit lying, will you?

350
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,220
You see, I--

351
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,847
You don't need to explain.

352
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,352
Don't let people like that shake you up.

353
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,577
Hey, I need to take off for a moment.

354
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,912
-Sure.
-Thanks.

355
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,254
It has to be one of our members.

356
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,050
Someone who isn't present at 4 o'clock.

357
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,427
Could you check for me?

358
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,360
You can go in.

359
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,080
DELIVER TO YU-MIN AT THE OBSERVATORY

360
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,394
Huh?

361
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,735
I told you not to come.

362
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,779
How could I not?

363
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,531
I couldn't let you come by yourself.

364
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,616
Nothing's happened, right?

365
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,754
Someone wanted me to deliver this to you.

366
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,302
-Who?
-I found it with the checklist.

367
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,811
I WONDER WHAT DO HAE-YI IS DOING RIGHT NOW

368
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,867
-Where's Hae-yi?
-Hae-yi?

369
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,327
Maybe in the waiting room?

370
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,120
She's not answering.

371
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,540
I'll check the waiting room.
Could you go to the club room?

372
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,585
If anyone sees Hae-yi,
tell them to call me.

373
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,669
Okay.

374
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,341
One, two, three.

375
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,512
It's in a different time signature,
so you can't do that.

376
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,765
-How am I supposed to do this?
-You need to make it work.

377
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,060
One, two, three.

378
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,188
This is the wrong move.
You use both hands on three.

379
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,233
Got it?

380
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,035
Where's Hae-yi? Is she not here?

381
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,745
What? No.

382
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,497
Do you know where she is?

383
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,165
Hae-yi?

384
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,719
Should we try again?

385
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,722
Right. Oneâ€¦

386
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,224
JEONG-WOO

387
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,936
5 MISSED CALLS

388
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,192
And the drumsâ€¦

389
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:15,902
How much longer?

390
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,822
This is my first time doing this.

391
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,366
I told you it'll take some time,
so stop rushing me.

392
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,992
You're making me anxious too.

393
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,119
-Okay.
-My gosh.

394
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,954
And nextâ€¦

395
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,206
So how long is it going to take?

396
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,377
You want me to do it or not?

397
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,383
That person you like.

398
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,428
It's Park Jeong-woo, isn't it?

399
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,348
No. Not at all.

400
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,767
So it is.

401
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,687
I'm glad.

402
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,231
What? Why are you glad?

403
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,066
Because I don't think it'll work out.

404
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,984
Why not?

405
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,199
I meanâ€¦

406
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,745
not that I'm interested in him,

407
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,874
but what makes you think
that he and I won't work out?

408
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,250
I just want to know.

409
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,128
Just because.

410
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,381
It looks like he has the upper hand,
but I doubt he'll make a move.

411
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,143
What are you two doing?

412
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,312
Sir.

413
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,525
You sure are different.

414
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,821
By the way, didn't you two break up?

415
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,074
I guess kids these days
are different from our generation.

416
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,910
It's all in the past anyway.

417
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,288
I don't know.

418
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,624
I think one of you
still hasn't gotten over it.

419
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,256
Okay. There you go.

420
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,091
Thank you.

421
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,384
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

422
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,476
Hae-yi!

423
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,063
Are you all right?

424
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,815
Did anything happen?

425
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,149
What do you mean?

426
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,151
Did something happen?

427
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,196
Where were you? I couldn't reach you.

428
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,739
Well, I wasâ€¦

429
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,369
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,373
I went out for a break
and didn't realize time had passed.

431
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,792
I told you not to disappear like that
during the festival.

432
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,377
I'm sorry.

433
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,628
You should've
at least answered your phone.

434
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,129
What if you got in an accident?

435
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,635
Everyone could have suffered
because of you.

436
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,972
Do you not have a sense of responsibility?

437
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,309
I'm disappointed.

438
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,033
Jeong-woo.

439
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,581
It's a relief nothing happened.

440
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,498
Yu-min.

441
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,544
Don't do anything risky like that again.
I'll find out who it is.

442
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,005
-But--
-They're toying with us.

443
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,552
It seems they want to play a game,

444
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,221
so I'll play along with them.

445
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:36,853
Theia.

446
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,989
They reworked another song
and even revised the choreography.

447
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,533
They put in a lot of effort.

448
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,786
But it won't be good enough
for the stage, right?

449
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,293
Jeong-woo.

450
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,794
What should we do?

451
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,881
One of the celebrities has backed out.

452
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,138
Jae-yi. Look over there.

453
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,434
There's all sorts of events going on.
Gosh, this is so great.

454
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,647
To be holding a festival
at such a festive age, I'm so jealous.

455
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,732
Jae-yi.

456
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,610
Why can't you act more your age?

457
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:30,156
I'm getting butterflies in my stomach
being at a place like this at my age.

458
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,367
That's because of your age.

459
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,826
What about my age?

460
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,957
You apologize to Hae-yi today, okay?

461
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,918
When she tries to make up with you,

462
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,837
just pretend like
you can't help but make up.

463
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,298
Come on. Will you?

464
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,177
Why don't you ever answer
your sister or me?

465
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,849
How could they pull out
on the day of the show?

466
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,102
Their previous schedule got delayed.

467
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,812
It's for TV, so they can't miss it.

468
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,773
Let's move the other shows forward
and do more cheer songs.

469
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:08,152
We already had enough trouble doing that
since one of our songs became unusable.

470
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,862
This is driving me nuts.

471
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,032
There was an uproar last year
since the festival wasn't up to par.

472
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,618
We can't afford
to have this year ruined for us.

473
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,834
Let's put the freshmen on stage.

474
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,712
You've got to be joking.

475
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,589
How would they perform something
they prepared just hours ago?

476
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,550
He's right. That's going too far.

477
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,678
They used existing choreography
and lyrics from before,

478
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,221
so there aren't major revisions.

479
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,557
But how can you guarantee
they'll do a proper job

480
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,767
with such sudden revisions?

481
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,939
It's a stretch.

482
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,823
I'm disappointed.

483
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,204
Sleepyhead.

484
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,373
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,250
You took the fall for us.

486
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,586
No, it's fine.

487
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,009
But I guess all our hard work
just went down the gutter.

488
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,343
It looks like it.

489
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,015
Maybe it really was a stretch
like Min-jae said.

490
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:36,407
Today will be your first big event
and your first cheering festival.

491
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:41,204
And perhaps today will be
the day you get to experience

492
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,208
the rewarding moment
I promised at the start.

493
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,306
Why are you moving these?

494
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,683
You'll be the ones

495
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,228
to showcase our new song today.

496
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,146
-What?
-What?

497
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,233
It's a stretch.

498
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,735
I know it's a stretch,

499
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,822
but can't you give them a chance
just this once?

500
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,783
They spent a whole month
preparing for today.

501
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,077
You all know how they must be feeling.

502
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,038
I want to give them a chance,

503
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,082
even if they aren't entirely ready.

504
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,210
Please trust them.

505
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,004
I will take

506
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,298
full responsibility.

507
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,182
We're letting you do this
because we trust you.

508
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,934
Show them what you're made of, okay?

509
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,018
-Yes!
-Yes!

510
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,146
Let's tear the roof off!

511
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,397
You can do it!

512
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,565
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

513
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:51,983
You can do it!

514
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,777
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

515
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,119
Let's get changed then.

516
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,497
YONHEE UNIVERSITY
CHEERING SQUAD OF 2019

517
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,273
We can do it. We really can.

518
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,858
We can do it.

519
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,944
All right.

520
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,696
Good work making it here.

521
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,740
All there's left is
for us to enjoy ourselves,

522
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,993
so let's give it our everything
and leave no regrets.

523
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,662
-Okay.
-Okay.

524
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,789
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

525
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,290
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

526
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,000
Here.

527
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,754
-One, two, three, Theia!
-Theia!

528
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,054
We'll begin the third part
of the cheering festival!

529
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,641
Please welcome them
at the top of your lungs!

530
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,031
Hey, there she is.

531
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,033
It's your sister.

532
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,287
Hae-yi!

533
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,231
We now present to you
the new song for 2019!

534
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,777
"Higher"!

535
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,534
"Higher"!

536
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,538
Ready!

537
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,712
BRILLIANCE

538
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,102
You're doing great, Hae-yi!

539
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,062
Let's go!

540
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,447
-Soar above the clouds in the blue sky
-Soar above the clouds in the blue sky

541
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,616
-We'll reach the ends of space
-We'll reach the ends of space

542
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,870
-We'll go higher and faster
-We'll go higher and faster

543
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,288
-Higher
-Great!

544
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,747
-Higher
-Jump!

545
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,417
-Let's scream louder
-Let's scream louder

546
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,462
-Our voices will reach afar
-Our voices will reach afar

547
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,466
-You and I will do it together
-You and I will do it together

548
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,718
-Soar above the clouds in the blue sky
-Soar above the clouds in the blue sky

549
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,512
-We'll reach the ends of space
-We'll reach the ends of space

550
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,807
-We'll go higher and faster
-We'll go higher and faster

551
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,392
-Higher
-Great!

552
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,560
-Higher
-Jump!

553
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,354
-Let's scream louder
-Let's scream louder

554
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,816
-Our voices will reach afar
-Our voices will reach afar

555
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,361
-You and I will do it together
-You and I will do it together

556
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,437
Everyone in Yonhee,

557
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,064
scream!

558
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,818
-Soar above the clouds in the blue sky
-Soar above the clouds in the blue sky

559
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,654
-We'll reach
-We'll reach

560
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,863
-the ends of space
-Way to go!

561
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,200
-We'll go higher and faster
-We'll go higher and faster

562
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,660
-Higher
-Great!

563
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,495
-Higher
-Jump!

564
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,039
-Let's scream louder
-Let's scream louder

565
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,167
-Our voices will reach afar
-Our voices will reach afar

566
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,587
-You and I will do it together
-You and I will do it together

567
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,299
-Higher!
-Hey!

568
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,427
-Higher!
-Hey!

569
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,313
You're the best, Hae-yi!

570
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,694
That's right.

571
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,073
I knew Seon-ho would take the center.

572
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,128
Are you after Hae-yi this time?

573
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,474
That was unbelievable.

574
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,268
-We killed it.
-I know.

575
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,813
I won't ever forget this day.

576
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,065
Me neither.

577
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,817
It felt amazing to be on stage together.

578
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,152
I choked up.

579
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,821
Of course. It was my debut stage.

580
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,034
Well done.

581
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,830
Good work.

582
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,958
You can watch the rest of the show
in the front row.

583
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,168
-Really?
-Really?

584
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,087
-Let's go!
-Nice!

585
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,937
Hello, I'm Jukjae. Nice to meet you.

586
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:56,652
There's something special
about school festivals.

587
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,114
They say how great it is to be young.

588
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,909
It makes me feel like
I'm standing here with you

589
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,995
while you are at the peak of your lives.

590
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,790
That's why I begged for them to put me on.

591
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,088
I hope this will be
a special moment for you all,

592
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,799
as much as it will be for me.

593
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,883
Here's my first song.

594
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,271
The summer night falls upon us

595
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,149
It casts a light on you

596
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,278
And I hide in your shadow

597
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,577
Every time I close my eyes

598
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,872
I feel the fragrance of your heart

599
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,875
Reaching out to mine

600
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:00,090
What do you think about

601
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,136
When we lie side by side

602
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:09,183
And look up at the stars

603
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:14,313
I don't know if you feel the way I do

604
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,066
But the time we spend togetherâ€¦

605
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,359
Feeling troubled?

606
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,196
We've been through a lot today.

607
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,532
It's not because of Hae-yi?

608
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,494
You like her, don't you?

609
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,666
These days,

610
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,837
I don't think there's anything
I'm getting done properly.

611
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,924
I'm doing what I can to protect things,

612
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,302
but I only end up hurting others

613
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,846
and ruining things.

614
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,266
Everythingâ€¦

615
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,436
seems to be going wrong.

616
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,902
I think you're slow
because you think too much.

617
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,821
You're going to regret it.

618
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,369
I already am.

619
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,629
This moment I share with you

620
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,592
Means the world to me

621
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,972
-Will you take a walk with me?
-Will you take a walk with me?

622
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,225
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-What are you doing tomorrow?

623
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,812
-Will you take a walk with meâ€¦
-Wow.

624
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,022
Today feels like a dream.

625
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:41,900
Right?

626
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:47,781
Hae-yi.

627
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,992
I like you.

628
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,830
I said I like you.

629
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,293
Guess what?

630
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,255
This is my first time
telling someone that I like them.

631
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,220
It's been easy for me
to just ask people out,

632
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,556
but I think I was scaredâ€¦

633
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,226
to tell someone that I liked them.

634
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,399
My motto in life is to never stop anyone

635
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,526
who either comes to me or leaves me.

636
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,821
Butâ€¦

637
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,533
although I know you don't like me back,

638
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,620
I can't help but like you.

639
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,166
That's whyâ€¦

640
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,587
I've decided to have a crush on someone

641
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,466
for the first time in my life.

642
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,154
Will you take a walk with me?

643
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,170
This will be the last song of the night.

644
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,590
I would like to touch on
a rather personal matter

645
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,592
while I'm on the stage tonight.

646
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,470
As you already know, the cheering squad

647
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,722
has been receiving malicious messages.

648
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,307
If you sent those vulgar messages

649
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,686
and you're here with us, listen carefully.

650
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,855
"If you have something to say,
don't hide like a coward

651
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,358
and say it to my face."

652
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,402
If you have a problem, come talk to me.

653
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,071
Not anyone else.

654
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,116
Make sure you come to me and me alone.

655
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,537
I apologize for taking up time.

656
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,665
We'll gather our strength together
and perform our last song.

657
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,417
It's the world's bestâ€¦

658
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,961
No, it's the best cheering song
in the universe.

659
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,422
"Wonsirim." Prepare for "Wonsirim."

660
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,847
Wonsirim!

661
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,765
-Wonsirim!
-Wonsirim!

662
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,068
Everyone in Yonhee,

663
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,487
scream!

664
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,508
Everyone in Yonhee,

665
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,302
scream!

666
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,483
-Stop
-Stop

667
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,360
-Run, run, run, run
-Run, run, run, run

668
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:57,864
-Sit, stand, and stop
-Sit, stand, and stop

669
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,075
-Run, run, run, run
-Run, run, run, run

670
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:03,453
-Shout out loud
-Shout out loud

671
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:10,252
-Let's get up again and run
-Let's get up again and run

672
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:14,005
-Sit, stand, and stop
-Sit, stand, and stop

673
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,466
-Run, run, run, run
-Run, run, run, run

674
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,887
-Sit, stand, and stop
-Sit, stand, and stop

675
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,082
That's my son, all right.

676
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,801
-Well done!
-Great job!

677
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,970
-Good job!
-You did well.

678
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,221
Good work.

679
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,225
-Great work today.
-You did great.

680
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,654
You all did great on stage.

681
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,157
Jeong-woo's uniform earlierâ€¦

682
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,702
I know. How could it rip like that?

683
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,871
Maybe you gained weight.

684
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,749
The uniform couldn't handle his charisma.

685
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,334
It was so cool when you threw it.

686
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,585
Right, Yong-il?

687
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,046
-That was so cool.
-Right, Seon-ho and Min-jae?

688
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,177
Let's all get changed,
clean up, and meet at Cheers.

689
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,595
-Okay!
-Okay!

690
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,306
-Good work, everyone!
-Good work, everyone!

691
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,390
Well done.

692
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:51,978
Woon-chan.

693
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,814
Hey, Ji-yoon.

694
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,777
That was fun.

695
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,571
You looked a little different on stage.

696
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,449
Ji-yoon.

697
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,910
I'll see you around then.

698
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,827
Sure.

699
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,915
Who is he?

700
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,817
COME TO THE OBSERVATORY

701
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,575
Jeong-woo.

702
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,831
Jeong-woo!

703
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,169
Excuse me.

704
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,657
Excuse me.

705
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,401
Stop hiding like a coward
and show yourself!

706
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,094
We'll have all the freshmen
lining up to join us.

707
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,559
Hae-yi, get a hold of yourself.

708
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,522
They were the 49th.
You started with Cho-hui, right?

709
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,940
WATCH OUTâ€¦

710
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,236
Repeat.

711
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,659
4 O'CLOCK AT THE OBSERVATORY

712
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,537
I WONDER WHAT DO HAE-YI IS DOING RIGHT NOW

713
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,838
KIM JIN-IL

714
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,706
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUKJAE
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

715
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,809
Let's go to Jeong-woo's mom!

716
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,269
It's the sea. The sea?

717
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,063
I'll need something in return
for the bed and food I provided you.

718
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,482
Seon-hye. It's an emergency!

719
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,108
What did I do last night?

720
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,360
I'm ruined!

721
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,988
What's this? Some messed-up romance show?

722
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,408
It's a blessing to be able to find

723
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,619
something that you like so much.

724
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,078
-Hae-yi!
-Hae-yi.

725
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,080
Then who will she choose?

726
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,804
I told her to stop sleeping out in public.

727
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,951
Are you asleep?

728
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,667
Don't get sick, Hae-yi.

729
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,963
Don't get hurt either.

730
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,397
I like you, Hae-yi.

731
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,192
I really do.

732
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,881
I wasn't sleeping.

733
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:05,643
