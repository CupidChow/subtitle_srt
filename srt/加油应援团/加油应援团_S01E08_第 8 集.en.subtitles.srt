1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,324
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,785
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,416
Seahorses are famous for being lovers.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,711
They're known to be devoted
to their partner until they die.

5
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,964
What does devoted mean?

6
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,842
It means they only love one partner
throughout their lifetime.

7
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,724
Do you like the seahorses, Seon-ho?

8
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,904
Just leave the documents on my desk
and go home.

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,405
Okay.

10
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,120
Long time no see.

11
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,415
-Hi.
-Who is he?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
He's a lawyer

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,421
that I used to work with.

14
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,340
-Hello.
-Hello.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,884
We'll take a look around
while you catch up with him.

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,138
Seon-ho.

17
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,058
You can't walk around alone.

18
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,601
What is it?

19
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,911
Seon-ho. We should go.

20
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,788
We don't want to miss the dolphin show.

21
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,209
Dad, buy me a dolphin.

22
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,044
He wants a dolphin.

23
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,171
I don't think we can.

24
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,848
Dad. Are you devoted too?

25
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,768
-What?
-Will you only love one person

26
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,021
throughout your lifetime,
like seahorses do?

27
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:34,237
Have you already memorized
everything you learned at the aquarium?

28
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,074
I wonder who you got your brains from.

29
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,744
Yes, that's right.

30
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,330
Are you devoted to your child too?

31
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,832
What?

32
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,878
Will you only love one child
all throughout your life too?

33
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,636
Of course. He'll only love you
and you alone, Seon-ho.

34
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,860
Will you please just stop?

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,113
I'm never breaking up with you.

36
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,782
I won't move an inch until you accept me.

37
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,201
What's wrong with you? I don't want to.

38
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
Please?

39
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,913
I don't want to!

40
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,501
Why won't she just say yes?

41
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,838
CHAE-HYEON: SEON-HO, I GOT US TICKETS!
OH YUN-A: LET'S GET TTEOKBOKKI

42
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,175
There's plenty of girls around.
Why is he so desperate for her?

43
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,594
Come on, Seon-ho. He was rejected.

44
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,973
It's pathetic to be holding onto someone
who won't love you.

45
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,573
What is it?

46
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,954
What is it?

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,415
Break's over.
We need to get back to training.

48
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,334
I'll be there soon.

49
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,547
Can't you just look at me
and not Jeong-woo?

50
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,428
What?

51
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,644
I keep making mistakes.
Can you come with me and help me practice?

52
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,607
I thought you were asking me out.

53
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,151
Of course not.

54
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,779
It would be over for me
if you rejected again.

55
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,743
Jeong-woo.

56
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,580
What's this? Is this really you?

57
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,500
I cannot allow the recent series of events

58
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,420
to lead to any more accidents.

59
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,422
So I've decided
to ask the police for an investigation.

60
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,303
This item will also
be handed over as evidence.

61
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,597
Why do you keep making a commotion?

62
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,016
We'll talk later.

63
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,310
What's more urgent than this?

64
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,856
Why would you…

65
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,359
Never mind.

66
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,195
Good job.

67
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,032
Wait, what?

68
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,669
Why am I so immature?

69
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,423
Either talk or eat.
Stick to one, will you?

70
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,092
Why am I so immature?

71
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,969
What's this about?

72
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,598
I can't afford to
worry about this right now.

73
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,893
I don't have the money or the time,

74
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,187
but I still want everything
others get to enjoy in life.

75
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,564
When will you grow up, Hae-yi?

76
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,940
Listen.

77
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,070
You still have that one thing
that all rich people want.

78
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,322
Don't you know?

79
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,491
What do you mean?
I don't have such a thing.

80
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,450
Your youth.

81
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,745
That's all you ever need in life.

82
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,873
If someone was willing to buy it off me,
I'd sell it right away.

83
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,169
I just want to age quickly
and live a stable and prosperous life.

84
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,379
Stop talking nonsense and eat your food.

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,507
Here. Open up.

86
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,728
I thought you were asking me out.

87
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,314
Of course not.

88
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,025
It would be over for me
if you rejected again.

89
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,114
That was so lame.

90
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,414
What's gotten into him?

91
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,044
You're here.

92
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,546
What is it?

93
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,685
Welcome--

94
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,900
I don't want you worrying about Yu-min.

95
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,195
What are you doing here?

96
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,615
Well…

97
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,493
I'm starting work here as of today.

98
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,204
Right, I see.

99
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,247
You're here.

100
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,229
Wel--

101
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,946
How are you feeling?

102
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,374
We're doing this today.

103
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,344
Would this be good for seating?

104
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,055
Yes.

105
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,477
Should we call it a day?

106
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,354
Yes, let's do that.

107
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,023
Hae-yi.

108
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,403
Coming.

109
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,534
Do you need anything?

110
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,578
I need someone
to help me number the tickets.

111
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,083
-I'm sorry?
-Can you help me after you're done?

112
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,417
It won't take long.

113
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,002
Okay.

114
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,759
You said you were busy. Get going.

115
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,969
Right.

116
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,179
Okay.

117
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,698
They say we're alike.
Do you think that's true?

118
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,450
-I'm sorry?
-People keep saying

119
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,910
that you and I are alike.

120
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,788
I was wondering if we really were.

121
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,457
I don't know.

122
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,710
Do you like Jeong-woo?

123
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,462
Sorry?

124
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,841
Why do you ask?

125
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,302
Because it looks like you do.

126
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,390
What about you?

127
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,226
Do you like Jeong-woo?

128
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,938
I do.

129
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,357
He's a good person.

130
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,779
I like him too.

131
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,659
He's a good person.

132
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,208
Just end it at that.

133
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,549
Things will only get complicated
if you keep going.

134
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,971
I'll deal with it myself.

135
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,111
Drink this.

136
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,723
UNKNOWN USER

137
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,728
So it was you.

138
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,651
UNKNOWN USER
KICK DO HAE-YI OUT

139
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,240
Why did you do it?

140
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,617
Because I hated Hae-yi.

141
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,378
She kept causing issues.

142
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,213
That's why you sent me these messages?

143
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,882
Because you hated Hae-yi?

144
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,968
Not anymore though.

145
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,012
Why did you change your mind?

146
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,266
Just because.

147
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,564
What about the photos then?

148
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,488
What photos?

149
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
I don't know what more there is,

150
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,081
but it wasn't me.

151
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,045
It's too bad if you refuse to believe me.

152
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,631
I'll believe you.

153
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,261
But I won't allow
anything like this ever again.

154
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,680
If you have something to say,

155
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,975
just say it rather than
resorting to something like this.

156
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,480
I will.

157
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,483
You know,

158
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,319
you need to be careful too.

159
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,403
What do you mean?

160
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,113
Of giving anyone special treatment.

161
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,993
This campus

162
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,207
holds too many memories
we shared together.

163
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,626
YEAR 2002

164
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,179
Jeez, that was really damn close.

165
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,978
Do you know him?

166
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,688
I'm sorry?

167
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,442
No. I think he might be crazy.

168
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,860
Unbelievable.

169
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,823
Why won't he stay out of my sight?

170
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,204
YONHEE 2019
BRILLIANCE

171
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,964
Don't you think we're doing
too much overtime work?

172
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,134
I need to use the bathroom.

173
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,887
Make it quick.

174
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,029
Look.

175
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,365
You shouldn't press down too hard.

176
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,658
I know that.

177
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,994
Like she does.

178
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,128
Give it here.

179
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,971
This is how you do it.

180
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,236
You barely have any done.

181
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,130
Jeong-woo, I…

182
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,345
You know,

183
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,681
about what I was
trying to tell you yesterday…

184
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,308
Well…

185
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,852
Of giving anyone special treatment.

186
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,438
About that…

187
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,191
It would be better if you didn't say it.

188
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,490
Right.

189
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,121
Well, you see,

190
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,291
you just seemed
too distracted by your first love.

191
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,044
So I wanted to tell you
to get yourself together

192
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,089
and look after us freshmen too.

193
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,884
Right. Okay.

194
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
I'll do that.

195
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,471
Yeah. Good.

196
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,225
I should get going then.

197
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,503
Did something happen?

198
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,630
It's nothing.

199
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,091
I hit my finger by mistake.

200
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,544
LEADER PARK JEONG-WOO

201
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,864
So it was you?

202
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,292
We installed it after noticing
a stranger was trespassing.

203
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,921
But I don't know
whether to call you a stranger or not.

204
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,299
Yes, that was me.
But I didn't do anything else.

205
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,802
So it wasn't you before,
and now it's magically you?

206
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,055
All I wanted

207
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,183
was to make more commotion.

208
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,061
The broadcasting club
really seemed to have it in for you,

209
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,188
so I figured they'd air
anything I report to them.

210
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,483
It isn't a crime to leave this thing
in someone's locker, is it?

211
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,276
If it isn't, why were you trying

212
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,862
to destroy the evidence?

213
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,322
I didn't want to be wrongfully accused.

214
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,659
I didn't want to go through
the damn police investigation again.

215
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,246
Did you really call the police?

216
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,873
Tell me.

217
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,376
Were you just making empty threats?

218
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,504
I knew it.

219
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,923
The police wouldn't have cared.

220
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,010
How am I supposed to believe
you weren't behind anything else?

221
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,304
It's up to you
whether to believe me or not,

222
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,806
but I'm not the one who did it.

223
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,851
You can report me for theft if you like.

224
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,352
You love reporting people.

225
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,910
I did good.

226
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,621
I shouldn't have.

227
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,040
I did good.

228
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,625
I shouldn't have.

229
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,128
I did good.

230
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:42,055
You think that flower will tell you
whether Soo-il is the culprit or not?

231
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,141
I wasn't asking that.

232
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,643
Then what were you asking about?

233
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,021
Were you asking it
about your true feelings?

234
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,108
It's nothing that concerns you.
Why do you keep asking?

235
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,362
How much of what he said
are we supposed to believe?

236
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,157
Did he do that to get us back

237
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,576
because we called the police on him?

238
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,869
There may just be…

239
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,288
different people behind it.

240
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,456
I don't even know.

241
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,000
We scared Soo-il straight,

242
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,794
so he won't cause us any more trouble.

243
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,131
Right. I do hope so.

244
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,093
Remember when we were drinking last time?

245
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,012
The night Hae-yi left early.

246
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,514
Where was Min-jae that night?

247
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
Min-jae?

248
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,352
He was at Cheers. Why?

249
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,604
Nothing.

250
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
ONE OF THE MEMBERS WILL DIE THIS YEAR

251
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,574
SECOND MESSAGE
YOU'LL SUFFER TOO

252
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,617
THIRD MESSAGE

253
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,660
APRIL 13, BROADCASTING CLUB'S VIDEO

254
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,953
APRIL 14, MESSAGE FROM MIN-JAE
KICK DO HAE-YI OUT

255
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,457
MIN-JAE

256
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,918
So it was you.

257
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,671
-Why did you do it?
-Because I hated Hae-yi.

258
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,547
Min-jae? He was at Cheers.

259
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,677
SCHOOL NEWSLETTER IN LOCKER
SOO-IL

260
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,137
Yes, that was me.
But I didn't do anything else.

261
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,599
YOU'LL SUFFER TOO

262
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,109
Someone who knows
what happened two years ago…

263
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,654
But…

264
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,906
why Hae-yi?

265
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,805
Is Ji-yun seriously ill?

266
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,850
What do you mean?
Did she say she was sick?

267
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,686
She was fine two days ago,

268
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,895
and we texted nonstop.

269
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,356
But she hasn't replied
after she told me she was sick yesterday.

270
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,859
I'm worried she's so sick
she can't even be on her phone.

271
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,902
Maybe I should get her some medicine.

272
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,031
No. She hates taking medicine.

273
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,450
Then should I get her some porridge?

274
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,328
No. She hates porridge.

275
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,662
Then what should I do--

276
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,080
Just don't do anything.

277
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,458
What I mean is

278
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,504
that you should wait
until she texts you back.

279
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,422
Right?

280
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,133
It's hard getting back to people
when you're sick.

281
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,343
Right on!

282
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,892
One, two, three, four…

283
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,103
Seon-ho. You have no rhythm.

284
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,107
One, two, three, four, five.

285
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,067
Like this, but you…

286
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,152
One, two, three--

287
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,278
Let's call it a day.

288
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,864
What do you mean?
We haven't even done a third of it.

289
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,032
I have to go.

290
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,785
Hey. You're the worst one here.

291
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,038
You're even doing worse than him.

292
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,581
That should motivate you, no?

293
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,666
Why don't you do it alone
if you're so eager?

294
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,847
-Hello.
-Hello.

295
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,850
Everyone learns at different speeds.
You didn't have to say that.

296
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,477
Then when will he ever get better?

297
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,271
We'll all lose if he holds us back.

298
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,109
I want to take the stage for once.

299
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,945
Why would you say that
when I'm giving it my best?

300
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,155
Shouldn't you tell Seon-ho off instead?

301
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:42,963
I KNEW NOT OF YOUTH WHEN I HAD IT,
AND I KNEW NOT OF LOVE WHEN I WAS IN IT

302
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,849
Lee Sang-eun is unbelievable.

303
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,144
Can you believe she wrote this song
when she was 23?

304
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:02,149
-Exams are over. Let's drink!
-Cheers!

305
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,193
That's right.

306
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,446
You don't realize your youth
while you have it.

307
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,782
There's even a saying that goes,

308
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,703
"Youth is wasted on the young."

309
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:19,499
Ma'am, you can't keep
talking to yourself while drunk.

310
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,293
Are you still mad at me?

311
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,296
I'm not mad.

312
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,965
I'm only expressing my opinion.

313
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,845
However, you seem to be
ignoring my opinion.

314
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,099
Fine then. We can do as you wish.

315
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,517
What?

316
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,274
We can do as you wish.
Let's try giving it a go.

317
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,905
I don't know
what you're talking about, ma'am.

318
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,781
I mean dating.

319
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,118
We can try making it official.

320
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,956
Then how about…

321
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,500
we call each other by terms of endearment?

322
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,463
I've gone too far, haven't I? I agree.

323
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,216
How about "baby"?

324
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,263
"Baby"?

325
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,351
Where else would we be called
something like that at this age?

326
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,561
Then how about it, baby?

327
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,647
Yes, I'm your baby.

328
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,023
Goo goo ga ga.

329
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,443
I'm here.

330
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,696
Help yourself to some more drinks.

331
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,490
This baby might end up getting drunk.

332
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,160
Bro!

333
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,626
Remember what you said

334
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,670
about Hae-yi's weakness?

335
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,588
Is there anything else other than that?

336
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:54,886
It's just that I really don't have
any weaknesses to show her.

337
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,554
Why do you like her so much?

338
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,639
What?

339
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,976
You seem to have everything
and you look like the popular type.

340
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,770
So there's no need for you
to obsess over her like that.

341
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,072
Because she's fascinating.

342
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,950
Sleepyhead lives so diligently.

343
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,660
I find that fascinating.

344
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,622
That's why I like her.

345
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,670
I've never been that desperate before.

346
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,222
I'll get going. I need to study.

347
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,890
You're not going to tell me
her other weaknesses?

348
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,976
I don't know her that well either.

349
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,896
Wouldn't it be better
to not waste time with me

350
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,983
and ask her yourself instead?

351
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,320
You're right.

352
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,033
Anyway, thank you for your help
in settling the lawsuit.

353
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,915
Right, Seon-ho. Did you know?

354
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,127
You're so full of yourself sometimes.

355
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,797
Maybe that's why
my sister doesn't like you.

356
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,932
PARK JUN
WE'RE GOING CLUBBING. WANNA COME?

357
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,300
What?

358
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,219
You were rejected in that short time?

359
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,223
I wasn't exactly rejected per se--

360
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,308
You fell for him and then got rejected
in that short time.

361
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,893
I know you fall in love easily,

362
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,563
but it all happened way too quickly
even for someone like you.

363
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,774
-I wasn't exactly rejected.
-Then what?

364
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,528
I'd say it was more of a light refusal.

365
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,864
Things worked out for the better.

366
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,742
You were bound to be rejected anyway.
The earlier the better.

367
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,287
Plus, Jeong-woo isn't the type
to go against the rules to date you.

368
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,499
You think?
Maybe he rejected because of the rule.

369
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,750
But then again,

370
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,003
it doesn't look that way
with Yu-min, does it?

371
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,341
Yeah, you're right.

372
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,635
He just doesn't like me.

373
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,555
Your emotions sway from one end to another

374
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,432
in the briefest moment, don't they?

375
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,474
Forget it!

376
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,768
I won't like him if he doesn't like me.

377
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,562
Just wait and see.

378
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,106
I'll act nonchalant
as if nothing ever happened.

379
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,537
-You're here, Jeong-woo.
-Theia.

380
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,414
Hey. What is it?

381
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,124
Nothing.

382
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,752
It was just an exclamation.

383
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,337
So you were here!

384
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,551
I'll leave you to it then.

385
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,229
SELF-ESTEEM RECOVERY, HEAL YOUR WOUNDS

386
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,315
Don't ever beg to be loved.

387
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,401
-I'm just fine.
-"I'm just fine."

388
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,278
Our existence itself is love,

389
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:44,199
and we are overflowing with love.

390
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,492
It's overflowing.

391
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,036
-I'm just fine.
-"I'm just fine."

392
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,207
I know she's my daughter,
but she's unbelievably versatile.

393
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,833
She's so entertaining to watch.

394
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,251
Cheer up. You can do it.

395
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,922
You're home, Jae-yi. Did you eat?

396
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,757
Hey.

397
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,595
Give this to Seong-cheol.

398
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,138
Tell him it's for his mom.

399
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,266
She saved your life from being ruined.
It's the least we can do.

400
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,310
-Forget it.
-Hey.

401
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,563
This was expensive.
It cost me an arm and a leg.

402
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,942
It's a costly cosmetic cream
I'll never get to use myself.

403
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,777
-Take it.
-I said I don't want to.

404
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,654
Hey!

405
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,789
You almost broke it!

406
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,541
I can't afford another one.

407
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,377
Never mind then.
I know his mom too, so I'll go myself.

408
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,962
Just stop it, will you?

409
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,385
Do you even know
what that bastard said to me?

410
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,056
He said that you'll come
running back to him if he pays you.

411
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,393
You must've really gone on about money
for him to say that.

412
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,396
It's all because you act so shallow--

413
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,941
Apologize to her.

414
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,361
Apologize to your sister
right now, you punk.

415
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,281
Apologize to her now.

416
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,708
-Where are you going?
-Let him be.

417
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,460
He'll come crawling back
if he has nowhere to go.

418
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,172
And you can use that yourself.

419
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,009
She's not the only one
with skin to take care of.

420
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,846
You should use expensive cosmetics
and do whatever you want to.

421
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,266
Stop being so miserly
when you're still young.

422
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,867
Begin.

423
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,453
One, two, three, four.

424
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,872
One, two, three, four.

425
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,124
One, two, three, four.

426
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,418
One, two, three, four.

427
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,879
-One, two, three, four.
-Do it again.

428
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,715
One, two, three, four.

429
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,051
One, two, three, four.

430
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,802
One, two, three…

431
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,764
Hae-yi.
Are you going to keep slacking off?

432
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,683
I'm sorry.

433
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,437
We'll take five, so you better
pull it together until then.

434
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,605
Okay.

435
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,202
It's not like you to make mistakes.

436
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,288
I don't feel so great.

437
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,709
Wouldn't it be better
to not waste time with me

438
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,295
and ask her yourself instead?

439
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,633
Sleepyhead. What do you like?

440
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,095
What are you saying all of a sudden?

441
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,097
Right?

442
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,183
It was rather out of the blue
and badly timed.

443
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,227
Yes.

444
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,108
-Do I…
-Yes, what about you?

445
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,402
Do I look that way to you?

446
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,279
Do I look shallow…

447
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,950
and superficial?

448
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,744
Well, that was out of the blue.

449
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,831
I do keep going on about money.

450
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,001
Right, you do.

451
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,795
Right?

452
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,676
I'm not saying that
that means you're shallow.

453
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,473
I think it's impressive
that you're like that.

454
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,268
Are you making fun of me?

455
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,770
Remember what you said to me
when we first met?

456
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,355
You see,

457
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,773
I'm real fucking poor.

458
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,109
Some people might find that
embarrassing to admit,

459
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,654
but I found it fascinating
how you could be so open about it.

460
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,241
I could never do that.

461
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,078
What else could I say when I really am?

462
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,748
You see,

463
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,459
I can't ever admit anything embarrassing

464
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,003
because I'm afraid
it'll disappoint people.

465
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,509
But you're not afraid to say it
and just go on with your life.

466
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,888
I really do think it's impressive.

467
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,517
It takes courage to acknowledge that.

468
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,314
You'd do the same if push comes to shove.

469
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,400
No.

470
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,528
I could never be like that.

471
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,872
Right. I guess I am impressive.

472
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,839
Now that I've gathered myself,
I'll show them what I'm made of.

473
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,445
You're so unique.

474
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,781
How do you dance like that?

475
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,574
I could never do that even if I wanted to.

476
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,952
You have some very unique movements.

477
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,412
Let's try that one more time.

478
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,540
One, two, three, four.

479
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,625
One, two… That's it.

480
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,712
Gosh. Hey.

481
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,215
Why would you trip there?

482
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,676
You've got dirt on your face.

483
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,097
Are you sure you dreamed of this
since high school?

484
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,057
Yes.

485
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,067
Are you all right?

486
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,261
What the heck?

487
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,846
Why does he look handsome?

488
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:29,061
NEW SONG CHOREOGRAPHY EVALUATION

489
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,857
Evaluations of the choreography
for Theia's new song of 2019 will begin.

490
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,152
The winning team
will be taking the main stage.

491
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,072
Good luck, everyone!

492
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,732
Both teams did so well.

493
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,027
The team that'll take the stage
during the festival will be…

494
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,954
Jeong-woo's team!

495
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,540
Thank you, Jeong-woo!

496
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,250
Hey, give me a bump.

497
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,167
You too.

498
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,879
I saw you practiced a lot.

499
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,589
I hate being a burden to others.

500
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,466
Of course, you shouldn't be.

501
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,926
Good work.

502
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,096
-You too.
-You too.

503
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,142
Well done, and I'm sorry.
I know how hard you worked.

504
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,519
I should've done better.

505
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,562
Don't say that.

506
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,897
We know how hard you worked.

507
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,775
Good work.

508
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,865
I told you to do this move, didn't I?

509
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,837
Cho-hui.

510
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,596
Why are you crying?

511
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,099
You guys worked so hard for nothing.

512
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,980
I really wanted you guys
to take the stage.

513
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,108
It's fine. We'll have more opportunities.

514
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,572
Did you see Jeong-woo
rubbing it in earlier?

515
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,202
I thought we did much better.

516
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,248
You're adorable, Cho-hui.

517
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,466
You…

518
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,344
Don't you dare tell anyone that I cried.

519
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,721
You're dead if you do.

520
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:52,681
Okay.

521
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,436
Quit smiling.

522
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,983
Stop smiling.

523
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,112
I told you to stop.

524
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,171
Jae-hwan's already decided everything.
What else can I do?

525
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,551
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

526
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,055
You haven't changed at all.

527
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,517
You still put in so much effort

528
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,811
in making unnecessary commotion.

529
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,274
I guess you're just not
confident enough to win head-on.

530
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,943
Why are you back,
poking your nose everywhere?

531
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,364
Why?

532
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,534
Is there a reason
I shouldn't have come back?

533
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,327
You're the one who hasn't changed.

534
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,246
Why won't you just stay put?

535

Stop going around
disturbing the order like you used to.

536
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,334
You'll end up getting hurt again.

Take a look, will you?

549
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,007

-Okay.

I know you're tired,
but let's finish strong.

00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,435
They say you'll end up
dating the person you sit with

567
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,687
at the half-moon spot
the day before the festival.

568
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,938
Is that true?

569
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,398
Where exactly is the half-moon spot?

570
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,193
I wouldn't know. They say nobody knows.

571
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,447
Why are there so many myths here?

572
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,162
The half-moon spot?

574
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,547
Do you have time later?

575
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,216
Time? What for?

576
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,512
Woon-chan told me to check
the sound system with you one last time.

577
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:42,930
Really?

578
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,808
I thought So-yoon was doing it.

579
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,104
Then…

580
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,730
how about later at eight?

581
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,690
Sure.

582
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,025
I'll see you at eight then.

583
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,777
Sure.

584
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,586
-Mom.
-What is it?

585
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,216
Here you go.

586
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,592
What's that?

587
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,887
Tickets for our school's festival.

588
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,514
Why would you put that there?

589
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,725
For you to come check it out
if you want to.

590
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,437
-Me?
-Yes.

591
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,440
You can bring Jae-yi with you
if he wants to come.

592
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,608
Or you can just throw them out.

593
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,569
Okay, we'll see.

594
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,404
Get going. Bye.

595
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,116
I'm staying out tonight!

596
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,952
Are you insane?
I ought to break your legs…

597
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,085
Yes!

598
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,005
My hair…

599
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,174
What should I wear?

600
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,509
What else?

601
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,552
Jae-yi.

602
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,678
I need to call Jae-yi.

603
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,479
I didn't break it.

604
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,815
I didn't break it. It broke on its own.

605
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,067
I can't have anyone find out.

606
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,652
It's dangerous.

607
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,325
Look who it is. It's my dear son, Seon-ho.

608
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:29,286
My precious baby.

609
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,205
My treasure.

610
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,165
The reason for my life.

611
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,416
Have you been drinking?

612
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,752
A little.

613
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,796
I drank a little.

614
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,384
Dad never celebrates anniversaries.

615
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,513
That's why I'm doing it instead.

616
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,473
Why won't you stop already?

617
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,851
Why do you always wait for him
when he couldn't care less?

618
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,854
There's no point in waiting.

619
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,692
Oh, no.

620
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,699
Welcome home, honey.

621
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,702
Have you been drinking?

622
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,872
A little. I drank just a bit.

623
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,045
It's your wedding anniversary today.

624
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,633
Mom had a drink while she waited
for you to come home.

625
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,555
Even a stranger would treat her better.

626
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,352
Seon-ho, I…

627
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,460
Hello.

628
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,088
Can you help me out?

629
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,348
It's finally the day
of the festival tomorrow.

630
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,934
Are you excited?

631
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,479
Yes.

632
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,401
I was excited too,
the night before my first festival.

633
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,742
Were you upset because I told you
to stop liking Jeong-woo?

634
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,246
No, well…

635
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,043
It's just that

636
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,004
I don't want anyone to go through
what I had to experience.

637
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,423
I don't know what happened,

638
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,133
but you and I are different.

639
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,094
I've been through so much

640
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,430
that I don't bat an eye
even if something happens.

641
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,434
You don't need to worry about me.

642
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,062
You're right.

643
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,105
You and I are different.

644
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,275
We're here.

645
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,403
Thanks for helping me with my stuff.

646
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,240
Sure.

647
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,039
-I'll be off then.
-Bye.

Up to you.

00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,067
-My boyfriend.
-What?

664
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,570
When did you…

665
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,780
It hasn't been long.

666
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,114
Shall we go?

667
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,783
Wait.

668
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,286
Well…

669
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,666
-We don't need to check.
-What?

670
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,959
You see,

671
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,711
So-yoon said she did the sound check.

672
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,297
What? You should've called to tell me.

673
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,717
I only found out just now.

674
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,177
Okay then.

675
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,006

678
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,348
I wasn't sleeping. I'm perfectly awake.

679
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,265
Sure.

680
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,942
-Three iced coffees please.
-Sure.

681
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,320
That'll be 13,500 won.

682
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,828
They'll be sleepy at this hour.

683
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,081
It isn't weird for me
to get them coffee, is it?

684
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,209
I'll give one to Hae-yi, one to Seon-ho,
and have the last one myself.

685
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,336
There'll be one for everyone.

686
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,463
It isn't weird at all.

687
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,018
We're here until 2 a.m., right?

688
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,353
Yes.

689
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,775
You don't seem to be in a good mood today.

690
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,318
Is something up?

691
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,905
No, I just have a headache.

692
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,157
-Do you want some painkillers?
-No, it's fine.

693
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,326
It'll go away soon.

694
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,413
Okay.

695
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,626
How are we supposed to kill time
for three hours?

696
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,341
What was that?

697
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,262
Why would that turn on all of a sudden?

698
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,179
That scared me.

699
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,894
Shall we show off some dance moves

700
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,271
since the lights are on?

701
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,944
Right then. Let's just sit here.

702
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,238
We'll just sit still.

703
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,867
Remember when you asked…

704
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,535
Yes?

705
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,912
what I could possibly be worried about?

706
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,623
Oh, that.

707
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,001
Were you still holding onto that?

708
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,212
Of course I know you have your problems.

709
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:47,343
You said it's having people assume
that you don't have any problems.

710
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,767
I'm sorry.

711
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,353
I really can't seem to be
able to read the room today.

712
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,773
I hate my dad.

713
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,275
What?

714
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,153
He's the root of my problems and worries.

715
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,492
I'm just joking.

716
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,244
I thought I'd keep you entertained.

717
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,872
Don't be so flustered.

718
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,878
All right.

719
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,092
But perhaps…

720
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,720
it weighs you down
not because you hate him

721
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,140
but because you like him.

722
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,604
That's how it was for me.

723
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,066
There were times when I hated
how I was born into my family.

724
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,030
But because I like them so much…

725
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,452
it's hard for me to hate them.

726
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,456
Not that I know much about your family.

727
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,126
Hey.

728
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,669
Why are you crying?

729
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,714
I'm sorry. I must've spoken out of line.

730
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,843
Just ignore what I said. I'm so sorry.

731
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,345
Why can't it be me?

732
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,435
Why do the people I like

733
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,104
always have their attention
on someone else?

734
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,734
Can't you look at me?

735
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,991
Can't you just look at me?

736
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,676
I'm sorry.

737
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,568
It's okay.

738
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,789
I understand how you feel,

739
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,374
so I gave up on you completely.

740
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,168
I hope this will be
a special moment for you all.

741
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,963
You're slow because you think too much.

742
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,673
-You're going to regret it.
-I already am.

743
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,426
The person who sent those messages
is probably a cheering squad member.

744
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,802
They'll probably be watching today.

745
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,262
Where's Hae-yi?

746
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,681
We'll begin the third part
of the cheering festival!
