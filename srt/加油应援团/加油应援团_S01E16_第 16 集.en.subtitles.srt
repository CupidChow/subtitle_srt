00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,824
THE EVENTS, CHARACTERS, AND ORGANIZATIONS
DEPICTED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,326
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL EVENTS, PERSONS,
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,095
Run, Hae-yi.

4
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,200
Are you okay, Jeong-woo?

5
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,830
Look at me. Look at me!

6
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:22,999
Jeong-woo.

7
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,045
No.

8
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,884
No!

9
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,137
Stay with me!

10
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,973
Please just stay with me!

11
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,891
Jin-il!

12
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,240
No, stay with me…

13
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,033
Jeong-woo.

14
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,914
-Somebody get help!
-You bastard.

15
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,128
Please, somebody get help!

16
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,922
-Call an ambulance.
-Okay.

17
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,847
Yong-il, help!

18
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,988
You crazy psychopath!

19
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,197
Grab him.

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,034
Hae-yi!

21
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,414
Are you all right, Seon-ho?

22
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,589
Jeong-woo!

23
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,924
Stay with us.

24
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,136
-Hang in there, Jeong-woo.
-Please.

25
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,349
No!

26
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,788
He'll be all right, ma'am.

27
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,760
Fortunately, the blade
didn't hit any organs,

28
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,179
so there was only bleeding
and no organ damage.

29
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,555
He'll be all right.

30
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,557
Thank you so much.

31
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,935
Thank you, sir.

32
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,895
Thank you so much.

33
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,856
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,524
He'll be fine.

35
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,199
I'm so sorry.

36
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,302
Everyone will be shocked
by what's happened.

37
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,429
The school's going to take precautions

38
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,057
not to upset the students any further
with articles and all.

39
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,767
That's a relief.

40
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,894
How's Jeong-woo doing?

41
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,029
Having a blast, aren't you?

42
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,991
You're here.

43
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,492
I was watching something funny.

44
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,287
You must be doing better,
seeing how you're laughing.

45
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,624
-I am.
-I swear, my heart almost dropped.

46
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,459
Didn't I look cool though?

47
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,211
I bet I looked like a movie character.

48
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,754
Cut it out. It wasn't cool.

49
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,673
What if something went wrong? I'd have--

50
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,553
I'm glad you weren't hurt.

51
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,142
I wasn't scared one bit.

52
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,824
All of this…

53
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,909
will only end once you die.

54
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,587
The only thought that ran through my head

55
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,630
was that I had to stop him.

56
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,509
I was agonized every time you got hurt

57
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,554
because I wasn't able to
stop it from happening.

58
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,391
I'm glad

59
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,978
that I was the one who was stabbed

60
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,191
and that I was able to
protect you this time.

61
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,153
Still, it was dangerous.

62
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,532
-The needle.
-I'm so sorry.

63
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,911
Gosh, those two sure are in their prime.

64
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,371
His mom would flip if she heard him.

65
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,915
That's right.

66
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,625
Tell me about it.

67
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,006
Hello.

68
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,011
Are you sleeping?

69
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,931
Your mother is here. Wake up.

70
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,932
Are you sleeping?

71
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,350
Get up.

72
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,269
Hello.

73
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,230
-Hello.
-Hello.

74
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,441
Guys, you're here.

75
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,485
Why do you seem so glad to see us?

76
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,113
It's just so good to see you all.

77
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,994
Hey, Mom. I didn't realize you were here.

78
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,664
Ouch, that hurts.

79
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,833
I'll see you.

80
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,925
I'm going away for a few days.

81
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,389
MOM

82
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,940
MY BABY GIRL

83
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,109
MY BABY GIRL
MISSED CALL

84
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,321
MOM

85
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,365
Maybe she went on a trip alone.

86
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,661
She has been through a lot, after all.

87
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,373
Has she really gone to Jeju
all by herself?

88
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,916
Why won't she pick up her phone?

89
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,795
She can be such a handful.

90
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,506
I'm sure she'll call
when she sees you've called.

91
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,133
Don't worry too much.

92
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,432
Okay.

93
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,654
Isn't it tiring coming to visit every day?

94
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,574
If anyone's tired, it would be Jeong-woo.

95
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,664
I'm thankful for you.

96
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,084
I'm sorry?

97
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:28,883
When Jeong-woo was still out of it
after his surgery,

98
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,469
you came to visit every day

99
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,723
to hold his hand and look after him.

100
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,184
Seeing that,

101
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:44,524
I could tell that you
genuinely care about my son.

102
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,278
He grew up lonely,

103
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,739
so it's a relief for me to see

104
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,284
that he has someone like you by his side.

105
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,461
Thank you.

106
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,258
Are you all right?

107
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,139
-Thank you.
-Goodness.

108
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,310
Get better soon.

109
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,648
Thanks for worrying about me.

110
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,699
Hae-yi asked me once

111
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,995
if she was the first girl
to make me feel this way.

112
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,582
You know, she is.

113
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,044
She really is the first girl
to make me feel this way.

114
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,548
-What do you…
-I'm normally the selfish kind

115
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,133
that always puts himself first.

116
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:58,055
Hae-yi was the first person ever

117
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,891
that I put before myself.

118
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,315
I wish…

119
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,610
that Hae-yi will be all right.

120
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,741
And for that, you'll have to get better.

121
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,493
All right.

122
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,712
Good boy.

123
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,100
Mom.

124
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,061
Mom.

125
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,437
Mom!

126
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,563
Mom!

127
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,940
Please open the door, Mom.

128
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,567
Mom!

129
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,985
Mom!

130
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,499
MOM

131
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll find a way to manage somehow.

132
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,963
I'll do my best
not to burden you and Jae-yi.

133
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,300
The person you have called
is not available.

134
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,385
Please leave a message…

135
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,138
Mom?

136
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,767
It was you.

137
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,810
What about Mom?

138
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,853
She told us she'd be back in a few days.

139
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,899
Where on earth is she right now?

140
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,192
She's out of her mind.

141
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,862
Look, maybe she needs time alone
to clear her head up.

142
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,239
She's not a kid, you know?

143
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,866
Stop worrying about her and go to sleep.

144
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,785
Aren't you worried about her at all?

145
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,163
You ruthless punk.

146
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,999
Where are you going at this hour?

147
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,014
The person you have called
is not available.

148
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,850
Please leave a message…

149
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,982
EMERGENCY

150
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,652
Hello? I'd like to
report a missing person--

151
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,407
Where are you going at this hour?

152
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,792
Mom, what have you…

153
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,672
What have you been doing until this late?

154
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,426
You didn't even answer my calls.

155
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,677
Right.

156
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,098
I left my phone charger at home,

157
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,478
so I had to carry this dead phone
around with me.

158
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,523
Are you crying?

159
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,903
What's wrong?

160
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,492
Why are you crying?

161
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,872
-Hae-yi, why are you crying?
-It's such a relief.

162
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,167
You said…

163
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,754
You said you'd find a way and left.

164
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,257
And then you didn't answer your phone.

165
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,425
Goodness.

166
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,515
Come on, why would you cry over that?

167
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,475
It's…

168
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,771
-It's your fault.
-Goodness, my baby girl.

169
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,981
I was scared that you might be

170
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,902
thinking bad thoughts like when Dad died.

171
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,364
Do you know how worried I was?

172
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,784
I know everything.

173
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,993
What?

174
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,496
I remember everything.

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,208
I remember

176
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,922
when you left Jae-yi and me behind.

177
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,706
I'M SORRY

178
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,296
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HAE-YI AND JAE-YI FOR ME

179
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,968
-Dad, buy me tteokbokki.
-Tteokbokki?

180
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,284
Mom!

181
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,621
Mom!

182
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,039
-Mom!
-Hae-yi!

183
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,294
Mommy.

184
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,549
Mom!

185
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,594
-It's okay.
-Where were you?

186
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,888
It's all right.

187
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,806
Mom…

188
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,687
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,358
I'm so sorry.

190
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,617
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,955
I'm so sorry, Hae-yi.

192
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,123
Don't leave me again.

193
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,584
Don't ever leave us.

194
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,795
I'll be right by your side.

195
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,466
I'm not going anywhere. Don't worry.

196
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,844
I won't go anywhere without you two.

197
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,599
I'm sorry, Hae-yi. Don't cry.

198
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,185
Back then,

199
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:25,401
I must've been beside myself
after losing your father.

200
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,453
It was you and Jae-yi
that made me come to my senses.

201
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,666
Since then, I've never once
had a thought even close to it.

202
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,876
My goodness.

203
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,757
Don't worry.

204
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,635
I'm not dying anytime soon.

205
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:57,099
I'll only die after I see you two age
to be older than I am now.

206
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,022
As you should.

207
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,231
Right.

208
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,275
So just trust me.

209
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,195
Gosh, you.

210
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,741
Where were you then?

211
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:15,909
Me?

212
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,955
Tongyeong.

213
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,415
Tongyeong?

214
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,126
I went to see your uncle.

215
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,377
What for?

216
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,838
You cut ties with him.

217
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,049
To get money.

218
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,095
Come on, just give me some!

219
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,308
It's too late to ask for your share
of the inheritance now, don't you think?

220
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,103
I came all the way here
to save us both the time.

221
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,483
They say I can get my share
if I take issue with it legally.

222
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,944
It might take longer,
but we can do this through the law.

223
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,863
My business went under,

224
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,491
and this apartment
with a high mortgage is all I have left.

225
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,535
-But…
-There's nothing for you here!

226
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,579
If you were going to be so greedy,

227
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,041
you could've at least become rich.

228
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,793
Gosh.

229
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,129
Is that why you took all the inheritance?
So you could live like this?

230
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,714
I'm going to sue you.

231
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm going to get that money
no matter what.

232
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,221
-Just wait and see.
-This should be enough for your surgery.

233
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,223
Take it.

234
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,770
Do whatever it takes to live.

235
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,907
He said this should be enough
for the surgery…

236
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,413
so you return to school, all right?

237
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,041
We can make ends meet
with what we saved for the surgery.

238
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,044
But that's a loan.

239
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,964
I'd rather use that money

240
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,300
than take a loan on your future
and live off of that.

241
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,846
How would we pay that back later?

242
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,180
You know what, Hae-yi?

243
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,767
I really liked it then.

244
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,310
When?

245
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,771
The day of your school's festival.

246
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,776
Watching you…

247
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,029
up on the stage,

248
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,785
dancing around
without a care in the world.

249
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,580
It was such a sight to behold.

250
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,124
I thought, "Right."

251
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,128
"Hae-yi used to love being on stage."

252
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,716
"She's finally getting to enjoy herself."

253
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,894
Do you know what breaks my heart the most?

254
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,904
Watching you try to carry
all the burden yourself.

255
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,325
You never got to enjoy your childhood.

256
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,413
You had to grow up too fast because of me.

257
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,042
Hae-yi.

258
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,422
Leave it up to me
to play the role of a parent.

259
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,550
That's how we can both live.

260
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,178
But--

261
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,430
It's fine. Don't worry.

262
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,016
I can manage that much.

263
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:27,976
Okay?

264
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,025
Come here.

265
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,206
Thanks.

266
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,416
I should be the one thanking you.

267
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,503
You've been through so much, Hae-yi.

268
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,214
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,801
Don't cry.

270
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,803
No more crying.

271
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,597
Don't cry.

272
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,103
I hate you.

273
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,525
What a crybaby you are.

274
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,653
Don't cry.

275
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,993
I'm sure you all rested well
while I was away.

276
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,871
We're going to get back on that grind,
so brace yourselves.

277
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,958
I think it's for the best
that you get some more rest, Jeong-woo.

278
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,917
Health comes first, right?

279
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,252
Don't stitches

280
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,380
normally take about a week to heal--

281
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,258
Now that Jeong-woo is back,

282
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,011
let's hustle
until the Yonhee-Hokyung match.

283
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,178
-Okay!
-Okay!

284
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,806
I've brought some snacks!

285
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,226
What do we have here? Let's eat.

286
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,603
We'll be training afterward, so eat up.

287
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,521
Okay.

288
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,109
This is Sleepyhead's favorite.

289
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,155
It'd be perfect if Hae-yi was here.

290
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,489
I know, right?

291
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,911
Slacking off now, aren't you all?

292
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,331
Sleepyhead.

293
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:14,958
Hey.

294
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,961
What's with the lack of spirit?

295
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,421
What are you doing here?

296
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,339
What's happening?

297
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,342
I'm back.

298
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,469
Come on.

299
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,679
Why didn't you tell me?

300
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,807
Have you decided to come back?

301
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,476
-Yes.
-Welcome back.

302
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,852
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

303
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,689
-Welcome back.
-I'm stuck in the middle.

304
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,070
Now we're all together.

305
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,946
Let's go rock the Yonhee-Hokyung match!

306
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,823
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,618
We'll rock the match.

308
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,328
-Hold on.
-Where are you going?

309
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,750
Gosh.

310
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:04,091
Well, you're looking like
you're here on vacation.

311
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,720
I was here for treatment

312
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,224
and stopped by
after hearing you were here.

313
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,186
How's your daughter doing?

314
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,856
-Hae-yi?
-I heard she almost got stabbed.

315
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,610
Thankfully, she's not hurt. She's okay.

316
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,533
I can't believe Seon-ho wants
to stay on the squad

317
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,535
when a lunatic like that was in it.

318
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,121
Hae-yi's joined it again too,
so let him be.

319
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,456
And you just let her?

320
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,625
Hae-yi almost got hurt because of it.

321
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,043
Well, you know…

322
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,005
It seemed she had more to gain from it.

323
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,342
I doubt the risks are worth it though.

324
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,553
Listen.

325
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,933
Money was all Hae-yi ever cared about
since she was a little kid.

326
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,396
It's true that our poverty was to blame,

327
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:04,234
but I was worried that she'd grow up
to know nothing but money.

328
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,944
But you see,

329
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,197
she changed after joining
the cheering squad.

330
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,617
Something grew inside of her.
A passion for something.

331
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,077
It's changed her for the better.

332
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,998
I'm so happy that Hae-yi has
found something like that in her life.

333
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,375
Looking at you, I can't help but think…

334
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,212
that you're still very naive.

335
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,049
Passion won't put food on your table.

336
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
Hey, it's that naivety

337
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,638
that pulled me through
all the hardship I faced.

338
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,058
People don't live off of food alone.

339
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,228
Some things can
only be enjoyed in your youth.

340
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,649
You saw how much the kids
enjoyed themselves at the festival.

341
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,746
Have you talked things through
with your husband?

342
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,085
Not yet, but I will.

343
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,678
What are you doing?

344
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,474
I'm getting used to it.

345
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,478
My soon-to-be seat, I mean.

346
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,237
Great work cleaning up
the mess from previous years.

347
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,031
It's not entirely satisfactory,

348
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,159
but I'll take care of the rest next year.

349
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,083
-Thanks.
-For what?

350
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,211
You joined the squad this year
just to help me out.

351
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,921
Thanks for your help.

352
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,756
You better be thankful.

353
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,341
Of course, I am.

354
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,553
I'm glad I played the part this year.

355
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,306
It was fun.

356
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,105
What will you do now?

357
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,401
Well, I'll need to think about it.

358
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,572
I am dying to know though.

359
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,241
Why did you say you'd do it?

360
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,535
You hate being in a communal setting.

361
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:20,954
Because it's cool.

362
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,455
Gosh.

363
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,499
It looks cool, doesn't it?

364
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,837
You did a great job.

365
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,891
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

366
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,394
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Thank you.

367
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,646
Go on and eat.

368
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,861
I didn't expect you to stay until the end.

369
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,490
I thought you'd leave
the moment you were rejected by Hae-yi.

370
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,243
I didn't know either
that I could be so determined.

371
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,247
It's been a time of self-discovery.

372
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,208
Was it because of me?

373
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,296
I get that a lot.

374
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,923
People just can't seem to escape my charm.

375
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,844
That's not including Cho-hui, right?

376
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,179
I think you're too--

377
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,557
You and I were both rejected, so save it.

378
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,184
How are we the same?

379
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,270
We're in the same boat, aren't we?

380
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,314
We're similar in height too.

381
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,941
That's not true at all.

382
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:32,859
Just eat.

383
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,573
Egg rolls.

384
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,622
It's so good.

385
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,375
2019 YONHEE-HOKYUNG MATCH

386
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,628
With the recent events, it occurred to me…

387
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,715
that you never know
what's around the corner.

388
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,386
-Right.
-To tell you the truth,

389
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,683
there was something I wanted to do
after our performance at the match.

390
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,602
But…

391
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,896
I'll just do it now instead.

392
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,399
Do what?

393
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,402
I…

394
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,783
I like you.

395
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,831
You told me last time

396
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,127
that a day will come
when I'll get to shine.

397
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,463
I think it was then

398
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,465
that I started seeing you in a new light.

399
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,509
And one day, I found myself…

400
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,681
seeing how brightly you were shining.

401
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,311
This might be all too sudden for you,

402
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,106
but So-yoon…

403
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,318
I like you.

404
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,541
Seon-ja.

405
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,461
You're like the sun.

406
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,421
But I'm actually the opposite.

407
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,338
I mean…

408
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,218
I could get along with the teammates

409
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,263
all thanks to you.

410
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,271
Min-jae.

411
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,273
No more wearing contacts
starting tomorrow.

412
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,819
-What?
-I need to keep you in check.

413
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,823
Save your flirting for me, okay?

414
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,534
Okay.

415
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,377
I can't believe it'll all be over
in a few days.

416
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,378
I know, right?

417
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,965
So much happened this year.

418
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,471
Before I joined the squad…

419
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,979
I questioned why people did it
when it didn't put food on the table.

420
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,192
I think I finally get it,

421
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,986
why people join the cheering squad.

422
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,159
I wonder why
I put myself through such trouble,

423
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,538
but there are moments
that make me forget all of that.

424
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,331
Seriously.

425
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,544
Gosh, this is good.

426
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,754
What is?

427
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,466
That we shared the same feeling.

428
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,606
Hey, Hae-yi!

429
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,776
I saw that.

430
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,028
-You…
-Our lips didn't touch.

431
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,363
-They didn't.
-That's right.

432
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,157
What are you doing in a public space?

433
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,201
Do you have no sense of public decency?

434
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,244
Bro, what happened was--

435
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,413
And what are you doing out this late?

436
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,914
It's late in the night.

437
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,708
Why are you making such a big fuss?

438
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,418
How are you putting all your trust in him?

439
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,878
You have to protect yourself.

440
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,505
I'm fine with it.
Why are you so worked up about it?

441
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,924
-I don't need to be protected.
-Why you…

442
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,136
-I don't need to be protected.
-Hold still.

443
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,512
Stand still.

444
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,222
Come here.

445
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,767
I don't want to be protected.

446
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,936
I don't need it.

447
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,117
Why'd he have to come right then?

448
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,059
Don't look at the whole crowd.
Just keep your eyes on one person.

449
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
That'll make things better.

450
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,773
And have this.

451
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,735
Oh, no.

452
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,697
Cho-hui.

453
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,492
What if I make a mistake?

454
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,369
Why do you bother asking?

455
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,996
I'll end you all after we're done.

456
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,210
Just do as we always have.

457
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,338
-We'll back you up if you make mistakes.
-Just trust me.

458
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,261

-A bit longer.

468
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,931

00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,224

Ta-da.

493
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,215
What's this?

494
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,466
It wasn't me.

495
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,636
What do you mean?
Who else here ever smokes?

496
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,014
Mom, you had surgery for cancer.

497
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,057
How can you be so careless?

498
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,767
I told you it wasn't me.

499
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,144
You're not a kid.

500
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,771
Why are you so immature?
Didn't you tell me to trust you?

501
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,275
You just have to bring that up every time,
using it to your advantage.

502
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,444
Whatever then. Quit it.

503
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,737
Fine, quit it.

504
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,072
-And quit smoking while you're at it.
-Gosh, it wasn't me!

505
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,575
-It's not good for you, so why do it?
-Why won't you believe me?

506
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,160
You just had your surgery.

507
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,828
-So what?
-It was me.

508
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,999
I smoked it outside
but didn't have anywhere to throw it out.

509
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,250
-Hey!
-Hey!

510
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,544
Are you out of your mind?

511
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,047
-What are you doing?
-Did you start smoking in the squad?

512
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,757
-You're quitting the cheering squad.
-Why?

513
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,343
-Just quit.
-But you stayed in the squad too!

514
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,011
How can you call yourself a squad member?

515
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,846
-Hey.
-Take this off.

516
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,682
How dare you?

517
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,267
-Come on!
-I ought to…

518
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,394
Gosh, be quiet.

519
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,945
Hey.

520
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,157
-I'm here.
-Hey.

521
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,744
Why does Hae-yi need to be
so nasty with her words?

522
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,747
-Gosh.
-What did you do now?

523
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,500
Why do you assume
I was the one in the wrong?

524
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,462
Because you tend to be the immature one.

525
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,967
You were doing ballet for a while,
and now you're painting?

526
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,678
Can I expect a solo exhibition soon?

527
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
You sure can.

528
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,894
I've realized my talent too late.

529
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,604
Had I known earlier,

530
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,358
I would've divorced
that bastard Min-cheol earlier

531
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,902
to become a renowned painter.

532
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,697
It's a shame the world has lost
a potential renowned female artist.

533
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,867
You do realize you've been through

534
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,120
six different hobbies now
since your divorce.

535
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,372
Yet you always
make such a fuss every time.

536
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,459
I don't think any field has suffered
that grave of a loss yet.

537
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,753
It's different this time.

538
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,548
Let's take a look.

539
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,050
Let's see.

540
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,727
Right. Since you're rich,

541
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,938
you should hold an exhibition

542
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,441
and buy your own paintings.

543
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,113
I think the lips could do a re-do.

544
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,283
That is your son, right?

545
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,592
Hurry!

546
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,844
We're running late.

547
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,429
Can we slow down a little?

548
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,346
Hurry.

549
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,307
Hae-yi.

550
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,145
Can't you hurry up?

551
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,730
I'm coming.

552
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,899
Goodness, be careful.

553
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,088
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

554
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,340
BAE YEONG-WOONG & SHIN JI-YOUNG

555
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,720
-You look beautiful!
-Thank you.

556
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,348
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

557
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,517
You look so pretty.

558
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,520
Deputy Director,
you really did a wonder for him.

559
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,483
Don't call me that anymore.
I quit years ago.

560
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,736
We would've married much sooner
if it weren't for Covid.

561
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,446
I'm glad it was delayed.

562
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,324
I needed at least three years to know

563
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,785
-whether he's worth living with.
-She's so fussy.

564
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,245
What are you saying?

565
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
-Hello.
-Hey, you're here.

566
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,456
-Hello.
-Hello.

567
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,791
Look who it is.

568
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,293
You're glowing too bright
I can't keep my eyes open.

569
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,461
I'll see you later.

570
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,046
-Hi.
-Hello.

571
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,839
Hi. What's this?

572
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,385
-Congratulations.
-You look stunning. Congratulations.

573
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,208
Now, three years
since those intense years…

574
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,422
our lives had completely changed.

575
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,550
PARK JEONG-WOO

576
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,594
Mr. Park Jeong-woo.

577
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,812
Among the changing trends
in the Chinese cosmetics market,

578
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,357
the most notable is
that consumers now have taken

579
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,193
a greater interest
in the ingredients and functionality.

580
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,321
If you take a look
at the sales chart on the next page…

581
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,781
Here's your coffee, everyone.

582
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,158
-Coffee!
-Thanks.

583
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,535
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

584
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,290
MY SO-YOON
MY PRESENTATION IS OVER! ENJOY YOUR LUNCH

585
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,879
RESEARCHER TAE CHO-HUI

586
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,774
DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, PARK DO-CHANG

587
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,610
Hey.

588
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,278
What are you guys doing?

589
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,619
Where'd you get that gown?

590
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,163
You're only second years. How dare you?

591
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,414
Wait.

592
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,124
You can keep it on.

593
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,335
Is your mother doing well?

594
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,171
-Yes.
-My mother is doing fine too.

595
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,881
All right. Get going then.

596
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,883
There's a gathering this weekend.

597
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:40,928
Get going.

598
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:48,143
To most of us, the cheering squad
was a memory of the past…

599
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,605
YONHEE UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

600
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,524
…but for Seon-ja

601
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,859
and Min-jae,

602
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,362
it was a thing of the present.

603
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,989
I'm Kim Min-jae,
Theia's leader for its 54th recruits.

604
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,535
This will be a meaningful year
as we'll be performing

605
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,036
in front of an audience after three years.

606
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,331
Congratulations on making it
as Theia's 54th recruits.

607
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,628
Get ready for training, everyone.

608
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,921
-Theia!
-Theia!

609
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,798
Theia…

610
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,050
That's enough.

611
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,012
-Ten-minute break.
-Ten-minute break!

612
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,807
Where are you going?

613
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,727
RULE NUMBER 3
WE ENCOURAGE DATING OTHER MEMBERS

614
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,107
SEON-JA

615
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,194
What do you think? Don't I look cool?

616
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,071
2022 OSEONG SECURITIES
NEW RECRUIT INTERVIEW

617
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,908
Good luck with your job interview!

618
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,244
Ms. Do Hae-yi. You're up next.

619
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,329
Yes.

620
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,088
OSEONG SECURITIES
INTERVIEW ROOM

621
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,095
There are weeds in the world of plants.
But in the world of humans, there is me.

622
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,430
Nice to meet you.

623
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:10,309
My name is Do Hae-yi,
and I have the vitality of a weed.

624
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:11,977
How's your stamina?

625
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,854
The workload here is quite heavy.

626
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,944
Mr. Bae and Mrs. Shin,

627
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,447
please come forward.

628
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,416
Please give them a big round of applause.

629
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,087
The handsome groom…

630
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,049
and the beautiful bride
are making their appearance.

631
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,603
Open up.

632
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,397
Look at you eat.

633
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,900
-Hold on.
-Give it to me.

634
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,401
-My feet hurt.
-They do?

635
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,779
That won't do. Put these on.

636
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,615
-Put these on.
-Are you sure? Okay.

637
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,741
Of course. Go on.

638
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,538
There's just no getting used to that.

639
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,374
Seriously. I can't believe it.

640
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,833
Everyone's dating,

641
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,086
but I'm still single just like Yong-il.

642
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,799
How did the great Jin Seon-ho
end up as the prince of the singles?

643
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,509
Hasn't it been three years already?

644
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:27,928
Poor you.

645
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,555
I must be cursed.

646
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,640
Nothing's ever worked out
ever since you rejected me.

647
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,643
Maybe I should go see a shaman.

648
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,103
Good idea!

649
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,938
-Hey, you're here.
-Sorry, I had an arrangement

650
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,190
in the afternoon,
so I couldn't make it on time.

651
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,442
Say hello, everyone.

652
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,152
Theia's 25th recruit.

653
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,405
He's the shaman of the legends.

654
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,990
The shaman?

655
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,660
The three prophecies.

656
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,371
-Right. Hello.
-Hello.

657
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,706
-Hello.
-Hello.

658
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,169
Can you really tell the future?

659
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,131
I wasn't planning on boasting about this,

660
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,799
but my prophecies were always on the mark.

661
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,552
Gosh, that's not true.

662
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,055
You said a member
was going to die in 2019.

663
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,600
Nobody died. Everyone's well alive.

664
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:18,145
I never said
anyone was going to die in 2019.

665
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,062
What?

666
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,482
My third prophecy was…

667
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,034
In 2019…

668
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,913
one of the members of the cheering squad

669
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,041
will die of loneliness.

670
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:39,958
-What?
-What?

671
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,210
-That's nonsense.
-Come on.

672
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,463
-That's ridiculous.
-This is a scam.

673
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,924
It tastes very lonely.

674
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,509
You're a fraud.

675
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,219
Let's go. It was a waste of time.

676
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,721
I still respect you, sir.

677
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,222
-Let's go, guys.
-Let's go.

678
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,266
-Let's get out of here.
-Let's go.

679
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,477
-Let me have some more.
-Get out.

680
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,770
-Fine then.
-It's good.

681
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,606
-Try some.
-You can have it. I don't want it.

682
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,566
Leave me alone. I don't want to.

683
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,652
Hey.

684
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,404
You have no idea how precious this is.

685
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,323
Isn't that rubbish?

686
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,699
-Darn it.
-What's wrong with him?

687
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,535
Damn it.

688
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,537
-You have it.
-It's stained.

689
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,331
ONE MEMBER WILL DIE…

690
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,375
"One member will die of loneliness."

691
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,127
Die of loneliness?

692
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,255
Meaning that one person
will remain single in a sea of couples.

693
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,924
You're still wrong.

694
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,344
There's one, two, three singles here.

695
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,387
Not one.

696
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,098
Why'd you have to point that out?

697
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,683
You've hurt our feelings.

698
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,850
Isn't that right?

699
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,020
Right, it has.

700
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,939
This can't be right.

701
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,274
You know what I think? Come.

702
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,444
-He's a fraud.
-A frost?

703
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,363
Has your hearing gone bad?

704
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
Oh, he's a fraud.

705
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,199
So he's a fraud?

706
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,951
-There's no way.
-Poor him.

707
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,035
Okay.

708
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,791
Do you have lab tests today too?

709
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,669
Yes. Later in the evening.

710
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,379
You're always so busy.

711
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,382
I can't do anything about it.

712
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,807
What are you doing?

713
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,643
Giving you my energy.

714
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,403
What was that?

715
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,156
I was giving you my energy.

716
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,290
Excuse me.

717
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,417
ONE DAY, AT THE CAMPUS

718
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,503
I'm sorry but I already like someone.

719
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,172
Do you believe in paranormal beings?

720
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,552
I…

721
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,013
believe in Tae Cho-hui.

722
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,601
Okay.

723
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,441
Yong-il.

724
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,109
Yes?

725
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,114
-Have you eaten?
-No.

726
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,784
Do you want to grab something together?

727
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,619
Sure.

728
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,163
All right.

729
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,795
Want to go out with me?

730
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,764
Yes!

731
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,362
Happy?

732
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,741
I think I received it.
Your energy, I mean.

733
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,453
-Let's go.
-A toast to Seon-ho!

734
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,871
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

735
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,123
-Drink up!
-Drink up!

736
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,920
This is so annoying.

737
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,297
-Just come back to the cheering squad.
-You should.

738
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,799
-Join them.
-Do come.

739
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,925
-There's plenty of freshmen.
-Right.

740
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:17,968
Can I date other members?

741
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,427
-We encourage it.
-We encourage it.

742
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,554
-We changed the rules.
-Of course, you can.

743
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,930
I'll find someone someday, right?

744
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,599
They're so immature, aren't they?

745
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,565
I thought it looked cool.

746
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,110
What an eyesore.

747
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,239
Shall we go grab more drinks?

748
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,075
Why don't we go to that place?

749
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,665
Let's go.

750
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,255
WE WELCOME ALL ALUMNI

751
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,012
Wait for me!

752
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,972
Hurry up.

753
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,660
It's been ages since we last came.

754
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,870
Gosh, the memories.

755
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,670
Jump!

756
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,797
Hey. Let's go.

757
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,257
Why are you so excited?

758
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,010
Let's have a toast. Our youth is…

759
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,054
-Now!
-Now!

760
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,139
You're as lame as usual.

761
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,903
You try.

762
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,780
-I can't do it.
-Just try.

763
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,990
-Go on.
-How do I do this?

764
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,914
What are you doing here alone?

765
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,166
Just thinking about old times.

766
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,628
Remember?

767
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,880
What I said here back in freshman year?

768
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,926
I think I kind of get it.

769
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:27,013
I can picture this place
filled with a crowd cheering on.

770
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:37,440
It sure is.

771
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,444
You have to experience it to know it.

772
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,290
I think it was then

773
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,086
that I started to grow feelings for you.

774
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,214
How interesting.

775
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,341
What is?

776
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,928
It was the same for me.

777
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,686
I'm so glad that I met you.

778
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,031
My twenties were passionate

779
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,491
thanks to the passion
I came across by chance.

780
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,578
You can't do that at the amphitheater.

781
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,247
Did you hear me?

782
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,332
Okay.

783
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,711
Without that time,

784
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:44,132
I would've never known
how much support it can be

785
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,342
to be cheering each other on.

786
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,553
Have you still not found a girlfriend?

787
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,810
"HIGHER"

788
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,270
This is "Higher."

789
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,646
I made this song.

790
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,482
How about we dance? It's been a while.

791
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,817
Shall we? Will you be okay, guys?

792
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,736
-Your joints might not function.
-Let's do it.

793
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,197
I'm still perfectly fine. See?

794
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,364
Let's do this.

795
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,741
-Let's go.
-Let's do it.

796
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,952
-Sleepyhead.
-You can do it!

797
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,704
-With arms linked!
-With arms linked!

798
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,019
Let's go!

799
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:07,132
I will look back
to those cherished moments

800
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,301
whenever I encounter any hardship in life.

801
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,390
The times when we all supported
each other to gain the strength to go on.

802
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,787
-Great!
-Great!

803
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,830
-Jump!
-Jump!

804
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,342
One, two,

805
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,219
three, four.

806
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,532
Everyone

807
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,117
in Yonhee,

808
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,453
scream!
