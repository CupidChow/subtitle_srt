What Do You Want to Be When You Grow Up?

Let's look at this question.

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,460
We have to add two auxiliary lines.

44
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,880
One is on the left, the other on the right.

45

00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,940
And...

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,820
Maybe we should turn to Jingjing for help.

No.

Perhaps I'll figure it out.

OK, let's do it together.

I'm not good at math.

- Maybe we should work on English. - Chinese.

54

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,170
Brave you underachievers.

163
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,680
One dares to tutor; the other dares to listen.

164
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,840
Keep going.

165
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,410
Why are you hiding?

166
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,500
I was hospitalized again.

167
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,210
I came in again.

168
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,920
So...

169
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,810
The teacher asked you to write down which university you want to go,

170
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,620
and what you want to be in the future.

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll help you hand it in.

172
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,420
I'll pass. I don't have anything special in mind.

173
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,210
Well...

174
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,100
I've brought you the test papers.

175
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,540
I've written the problem-solving processes and annotations down.

176
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,500
- Take a look. - No, thanks.

177
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,320
I can't finish the 10 papers my tutor gives me every day.

178
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,660
Just...

179
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,660
Just take a look.

180
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,260
I've written everything down clearly.

181
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,860
- Get up. - No, thanks! Just take it back.

182
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,060
The college entrance exam is coming.

183
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,850
Don't waste your time here.

184
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,400
Go home.

185
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,090
Don't come back again.

186
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,700
Lu Yang, do you have to do this to me?

187
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,320
You were never like this. What do you want now?

188
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,060
I'll ask again. Take it or not?

189
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,440
No.

190
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,040
Fine.

191
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,840

Why are you crying?

203
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,730
Mommy said Daddy may not come back again.

204
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,290
Brother?

205
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,780
Brother?

206
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,980
My dad's gone, too.

207
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,520
Sweet heart, Daddy's fine.

208
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,920
Let's go and see him.

209
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,000
Thanks to the doctor, Daddy is out of danger.

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,220
We must thank the doctor when we see him.

But your dad's disease is rarely seen.

214
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,680
But he was a good man.

215
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,990
The organs he donated will help lots of people.

216
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,000
How stingy!

217
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,300
What happened?

218
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,200
Were you venting your feelings?

219
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,300
Jingjing did it.

220
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,920
I made her upset.

221
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,370
Are you really gonna break up with her?

222
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,340
I don't think I'm healthy enough to love someone.

223
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
What did the doctor say?

224
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,540
I don't know.

225
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,490
My parents didn't tell me anything.

226
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,240
Maybe they just didn't want me to worry.

227
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,450
Never mind.

228
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,250
Xiaoxi said you attended the independent recruitment tests of Tsinghua.

229
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,010
How was everything?

230
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,890
There should be no problem.

231
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,820
Right.

232
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,820
Since when you'd have any problems?

233
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,140
But...

234
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,140
Are you sure for the decision?

235
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,810
Xiaoxi lamented she'd never be admitted into a university in Beijing.

236
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,060
- I won't go. - Really?

237
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,800
For Xiaoxi?

238
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,240
I wanna be a medical student.

239
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,730
And I wanna be with her.

240
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,410
Oh man!

241
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,580
Did I mishear what you said?

242
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,250
Yes, you did.

243
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,620
That's awesome.

244
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,640
I guess you'll live happily ever after.

245
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,730
Don't shut Jingxiao out.

246
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,730
She's been upset lately.

247
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,660
Am I a jerk?

248
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,080
I was always following her around.

249
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,320
But now I...

250
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,660
But...

251
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,320
I'm afraid she'd be much more upset if I...

252
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,710

I've decided not to study math in Tsinghua.

You didn't do well in the tests?

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,330

Could you help me with the trigonometric functions?

267
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,440
The trigonometric functions are about deformation of the formulas.

268
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,960
Only basic algorithms are needed.

269
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,670
But there will be two solutions if it's a complicated problem.

I'm gonna wipe sweat off your face...

your tear gland naturally responded.

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,180
OK. Stay here for a moment.

293
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,520
I'll get you other medicine.

294
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,520
Very lately,

295
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,750
I've found a pretty serious problem.

296
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,740
In our school, some students are dating.

297
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,080
They spend their parents' money, doing such a nasty thing.

298
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,360
They walk on the playground hand in hand at noon.

299
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,780
Looking from the back,

300
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,280
I assume they are from your class.

301
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,160
Students in your class are well-known for creating troubles.

302
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Where there is an incident,

303
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,160
there must be someone from your class.

304
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,250
I feel sick the moment I see any of you.

305
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,580
As the Director of Academic Affairs in Chenxi for years,

306
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,250
- I've never seen students like you! - What?

307
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,940
Grandma's missing?

308
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,170
You...

309
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,270
Where are you going?

310
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,380
- Where are you going? - Sir, his grandma's missing.

311
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,850
You're mendacious!

312
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,690
You're with Wu Bosong every day.

313
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,750
- Tell the truth, are you dating? - Sir.

314
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,840
Your wig's falling off.

315
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,660
Sir, I'm dating someone.

316
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,060
- You... - Sir, it's us who are dating.

317
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,050
It's true, sir.

318
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,370
- You... - Yes.

319
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,170
And you!

320
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,000
Sir, I wanna date someone, too.

321
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Sir, I wanna get married!

322
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,150
You stop it!

323
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,490
- Have you met Wu Bosong's grandma? - Yes.

324
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,370
Where does she go often?

325
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,900
She said she would buy him swimming goggles.

326
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,530
So let's start looking with the shopping mall.

327
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,680
Hi, have you seen an old lady about this high?

328
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,520
With short hair.

329
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,020
No, sorry.

330
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:01,940
Hello.

331
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,480
Have you seen an old lady about this high?

332
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,840
- With short hair. - No.

333
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,550
Is that her?

334
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,580
Yes!

335
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,580
Call Wu Bosong.

336
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,450
Hello?

337
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,270
Wu Bosong, we've found your grandma.

338
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,170
Where?

339
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,740
On the street opposite to the shopping mall.

340
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,010
OK, I'll be right there.

341
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,730
Madam.

342
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,620
Hello, I'm a friend of Wu Bosong's.

343
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,360
My name is Jiang Chen.

344
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,110
You... Don't come closer!

345
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,260
It's OK, madam. Don't be scared.

346
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,480
It's OK. Let's go home.

347
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,520
Don't come closer! These are for Bosong.

348
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,530
- Don't...  - Let's go home.

349
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,570
Grandma!

350
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,440
I'm Bosong.

351
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,730
I'm Bosong.

352
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,290
- Grandma! - Let's go home.

353
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,650
Grandma!

354
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,740
Grandma.

355
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,000
Grandma!

356
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,310
Grandma, I'm hungry. I wanna eat.

357
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,940
You're hungry?

358
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,240
Grandma will cook noodles for you.

359
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,500
Plus two eggs.

360
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,530
Two eggs.

361
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,680
Let's go back to cook noodles.

362
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,080
These are for Bosong.

363
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,700
Look, Bosong.

364
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,440
I bought these for you.

365
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,100
You can swim with these.

366
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,400
My Bosong is a fast swimmer.

367
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,920
He's the best.

368
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,300
No one can ever beat him.

369
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,270
He'll be the world champion!

370
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,680
Let's go home.

371
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Put these on, please.

372
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,180
My good boy.

373
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,470
I'll buy you a Band-Aid.

374
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,830
Thank you.

375
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
How's your arm?

376
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,170
It's OK.

377
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,330
I've decided to go back to swim.

378
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,710
I can't let my grandma down.

379
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,720
I've decided not to go to Beijing.

380
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,420
Please take care of Chen Xiaoxi.

381
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,680
It's not your place to say it.

382
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,800
Sometimes I just can't put up with you.

383
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,120
Me, either.

384
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,570
As a homeroom teacher, you should give them demerits!

385
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,700
Don't be so irritated, Director Zhang.

386
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,320
There must be some misunderstanding.

387
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,940
How could be so?

388
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,830
Calm down, please.

389
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,780
Wu Bosong.

390
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,760
Why are you here?

391
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,700
We're being punished.

392
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,720
I want to thank you for what you've done.

393
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,310
Don't worry. I'll explain the whole thing to your teacher.

394
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,600
Bosong, say goodbye to your friends.

395
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,630
I'm here to drop out of school.

396
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,860
I'll focus on swimming.

397
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,710
So I won't be here with you in the future.

398
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,440
Don't miss me too much.

399
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,860
I knew you'd make that decision.

400
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,410
Good luck!

401
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,020
Cheer up.

402
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,910
Don't act like we'll never meet again.

403
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,550
Invite us to a big meal when you win a gold medal.

404
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,560
You all work hard.

405
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,960
I'll treat you after the exam.

406
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,220
Wu Bosong is leaving, too.

407
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,850
Wu Bosong's gonna focus on swimming.

408
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,320
You're going to study math in Tsinghua.

409
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,370
Lin Jingxiao's going to study astronomy.

410
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,810
Seems you all know what you wanna do.

411
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,590
-I'm not going to Tsinghua. - What?

412
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,780
I wanna study medicine in Zhejiang University.

413
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,740
Really?

414
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,410
Then I'll try a university near you.

415
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,600
I wanna be an art student.

416
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,720
Up to you.

417
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,710
Could you write something in my yearbook?

418
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,040
Why not?

419
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,320
That's only for those who'll be apart.

420
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,660
Let's go.

421
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,320
=Natatorium

422
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,230
Bosong,

423
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
remember what the doctor has said.

424
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
Don't exhaust myself.

425
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
No more than two hours a day.

426
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,350
Don't forget it, son.

427
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,090
The national team has good news.

428
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,090
When your muscle completely recovers, we'll go to Beijing!

429
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,910
The water is cold!

430
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,980
The water is cold!

431
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,220
-Help! - No crying!

432
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,390
Don't come up before you've learned how to swim!

433
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,590
Help!

434
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,470
I wanna go out!

435
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,810
=Wu Bosong, come on!

436
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,800

00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,590
Wu Bosong, you're the best!
=Wu Bosong, come on!

438
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:28,760
Wu Bosong, you're the best!

439
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,430
No one can ever beat you!

440
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,680
=From Wu Bosong
Waiting for you in the auditorium.

441
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,870
Wu Bosong?

442
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,710
Wu Bosong?

443
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,060
Chen Xiaoxi.

444
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,680
There's something I haven't told you.

445
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,780
Now I want to be formal.

446
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,430
The first time I saw you,

447
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,630
I thought you were cute.

448
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,960
B-a-l-a-n-c-e.

449
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,200
I know about this.

450
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,110
Then I fell in love with you when you came to watch my game,

451
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,790
and cheered me up.

452
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,880
At the Sports Meeting,

453
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,220
the one running with you in the cartoon garment was me.

454
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,680
In the game of "keeping our secrets",

455
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,870
I wrote "I love you".

456
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,960
=I love Xiaoxi.

457
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,560
I meant what I wrote.

458
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,580
And in 2006 I made the first snow for you.

459
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,180
When I see you upset,

460
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,770
I'll be flustered.

461
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,700
And I wanna cheer you up.

462
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,960
When I see you happy, I wanna laugh with you.

463
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,030
See?

464
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,160
When I see you cry, I wanna cry, too.

465
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,880
But it's OK, Chen Xiaoxi.

466
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,520
I've decided to stop loving you.

467
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,240
I'm here to say goodbye.

468
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,060
I'm gonna pursue my dream.

469
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,560
You'll support me, right?

470
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,430
Farewell, Xiaoxi.

471

=Tsinghua University
Certificate of Achievement

472
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,960
Winter in Beijing is very cold.

473
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,390
It'll be hard for you to adapt.

474
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,680
After the college entrance exam, let's go get some down coats.

475
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,230
- Mom. - What?

476
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,990
I'm not going to Tsinghua.

477
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,120
What are you talking about?

478
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,000
The certificate is here.

479
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,850
Tsinghua is in the bag.

480
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,400
- I've made up my mind. - No way!

481
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:45,770
Mom.

482
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,800
Do you know why I learned math?

483
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:51,710
Why?

484
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,180
You thought Dad would achieve nothing by learning math.

485
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,720
I wanted to prove you were wrong.

486
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,570
Learning math was Dad's dream.

487
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
Going to Tsinghua is your dream.

488
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,570
My dream is to study medicine at Zhejiang University.

489
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,600
It doesn't matter.

490
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,730
You've got the certificate.

491
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,690
You can't miss the good opportunity.

492
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,690
I can make my own decision.

493
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,110
Brother.

494
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,460
Why did you decide not to go to Tsinghua?

495
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,420
I don't want to.

496
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,200
Go back to do your homework.

497
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Brother.

498
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,390
Do you hate me?

499
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,570
You always ignore me.

500
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,860
It seems that you love the stray dog more.

501
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,690
You can't compare yourself to the dog.

502
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,250
I love the dog and I love you, too.

503
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,180
But in different ways.

504
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,280
But you ignore me.

505
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,830
Actually...

506
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,520
Dad loved both of us in different ways, too.

507
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,880
You may not remember, Dad always scolded me.

508
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,560
But he shielded you from everything.

509
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,430
I was jealous of you.

510
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,840
So, brother...

511
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,500
You ignore me out of jealousy?

512
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,460
Yes, I did.

513
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,220
But later on, I realized his love for us was the same.

514
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,720
You're so petty.

515
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,950
You're a big boy.

516
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,850
Don't talk about "hate" anymore.

517
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,640
Which means you love me!

518
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,280
Then I'll support your decision on not going to Tsinghua.

520
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,230
It's Dad's.

521
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,530
Take it.

=Certificate of Honor for Donation of Human Organs

523

During the examination period, watch your diet.

524
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,890
No cold or raw food.

525
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,800
Do not stay up late.

526

527
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,640
Have good rests and stay healthy.
=Keep working hard and we'll succeed!

528
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,590
Have good rests and stay healthy.

529
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,880
And prepare everything for the exam.

530
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,130
Like 2B pencils, black gel pens, erasers, rulers,

531
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,600
your ID cards, and admission tickets.

532
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,560
It's time to show your abilities during the college entrance exam.

533
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,620
You must take it seriously.

534
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,820
Try your best to correctly answer the questions you can handle,

535
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,580
and make lucky guesses at the ones you can't!

Two things are important when you're swimming.

545
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,720
Breathing and coordination.

546
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,160
But it's more important to overcome your fear of water.

547
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,990
It's fun. Wanna try?

548
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,230
No, you're gonna kill me.
