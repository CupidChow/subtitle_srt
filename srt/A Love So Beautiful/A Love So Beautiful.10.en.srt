00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:34,120
Some leaders will come to inspect our school next week.

Some leaders will come to inspect our school next week.

3
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:39,634
We want to organize an activity
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

4
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,033
to show off everybody's talents.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

5
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,373
So I arranged a debate contest for you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

6
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:43,874
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:45,274
Let Chen Xiaoxi join you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

8
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:46,574
She has never attended debate competitions before.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

9
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:46,874
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

10
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,234
She is so curious about it.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

11
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:48,994
Okay?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

12
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:50,113
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:50,954
Okay.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

14
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:53,554
For example, the best Wu Bosong in our class.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

15
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:53,994
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

16
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,153
Because he has a good start.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

17
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:55,753
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:56,713
I'll go first.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

19
00:01:56,713 --> 00:01:57,393
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

20
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,433
Are you mad?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

21
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,674
Is it because I mentioned about Wu Bosong,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

22
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,194
then you got mad?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

23
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:02,874
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

24
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:03,473
No, I haven't.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

25
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:05,393
There is something wrong with this drink.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

26
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:05,793
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

27
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,994
Qiao Lu asks for leave for poor health.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

28
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,593
Which one can take Qiao Lu's place?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

29
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:12,033
Chen Xiaoxi.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

30
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,154
Lu Yang.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

31
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,274
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

32
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:16,354
Are you kidding me?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

33
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:17,753
I didn't have many friends when I was a child.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

34
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:19,473
But I am so happy that I can make friends with you now.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

35
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,634
So...
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

36
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:24,113
Everyone has his strengths and weaknesses.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

37
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:28,033
Instead, the key point should be...
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

38
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,473
the students themselves.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

39
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:34,290
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

40

=Episode 10
And Then There Were None

41
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:41,833
Recently...

42
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:43,274
Xiaoxi.

43
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:44,645
There was an Avian influenza outbreak

44
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:45,794
in An Wu hennery in outskirts.

45
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:46,953
Put on your long johns.

46
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:47,634
It's fine.

47
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,473
I do it for your own good.

48
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:52,033
The weather forecast says it will be cold today.

49
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,634
It's ugly. I don't want to wear it.

50
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,434
It's long johns. Not pants.

51
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:00,514
You are still wearing your school uniform.

52
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,914
No. No. No.

53
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:03,953
Put it on.

54
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:05,274
No. No. No.

55
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:06,673
You this silly child.

56
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,634
Good morning.

57
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:16,473
Breakfast for you.

58
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:17,673
I've already have my breakfast.

59
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,154
I bought it for you.

60
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,274
It's fine.

61
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,593
I'll eat it up.

62
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,434
I'm still hungry anyway.

63
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,706
You can have an extra breakfast

64
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,274
in the name of buying me breakfast.

65
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,074
You got me.

66
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:05,473
Did you really have your breakfast just now?

67
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:07,233
Yeah.

68
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,994
You want some now?

69
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,434
You think I am going to give you what I'm eating?

70
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,154
Wait.

71
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:19,074
Take it.

72
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:20,153
I bought it for you.

73
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:21,074
Jiang Chen.

74
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,634
I made it by myself.

75
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,074
It maybe not so delicious.

76
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:26,873
Just share it with everybody.

77
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:27,954
I've already have my breakfast.

78
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:29,194
Let's have a try.

79
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,153
You can give me some suggestions.

80
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,153
Then I can improve myself.

81
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:34,473
Okay. Just put it there.

82
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,394
Here you are. I bought it by myself.

83
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:40,794
Do not tell me even it's not delicious.

84
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,473
Chen Xiaoxi.

85
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:52,354
It's quite delicious.

86
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,074
Hey!

87
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,433
How about that novel I lent to you?

88
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,473
I tell you what.

89
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:58,473
I forgot my novel at home today.

90
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,713
I'm so lonely now.

91
00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:01,993
Let me have a look.

92
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,674
Chicken sandwich. 8 yuan.

93
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,354
Chen Xiaoxi.

94
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,674
It's chicken sandwich. Don't you know the Avian influenza?

95
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:14,993
You scared me to death.

96
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:18,753
No. I am going to die.

97
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,954
You kill me for loving me so much.

98
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,473
You are a man. How can you use hot-water bags?

99
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,074
You can treat me as a woman if it will make you feel better.

100
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,473
You can't drain all the hot water,

101
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:56,153
even if you're a woman.

102
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:57,194
How about others?

103
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:58,354
How about that?

104
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,713
This hot-water bag is my cup.

105
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:01,713
And what I am doing is just to fill my cup with hot water.

106
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:03,514
Does it make you feel better now?

107
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:13,993
Jingjing. Jingjing.

108
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,194
You're so disgusting.

109
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,713
I wonder why my inlaid harp has fifty strings.

110
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:28,394
Each with its flower-like fret an interval of youth.

111
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,114
Teacher is coming.

112
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:34,753
Chen Xiaoxi.

113
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,514
Hush. I am almost done.

114
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:46,674
Good morning, Miss Liu.

115
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,433
Hand it out.

116
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:55,993
Please, Miss Liu.

117
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,553
Be quick. Hand it out.

118
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,114
You are a student in senior two. Still indulging in novels?

119
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:09,114
Can it make you go to the college?

120
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,273
You treat yourself as Han Han, right?

121
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,074
Han Han was failed to pass the college examination.

122
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:17,713
Shut up.

123
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:18,873
Stand up.

124
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:25,074
It must be all your fault.

125
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:37,593
Sit down!

126
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,234
Focus on studying!

127
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:02,993
What's wrong?

128
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:05,674
My new MP3 is broken.

129
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:08,674
The novel that I almost done was confiscated.

130
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:11,033
I got a cold for not wearing my long johns.

131
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:14,514
I'm so miserable.

132
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:15,954
Are you are doing cross talk here?

133
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:16,914
Chen Xiaoxi.

134
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,553
You should compensate me.

135
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:20,313
I have no money.

136
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:21,674
Then you can not blame me.

137
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:23,954
The murderer is...

138
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,674
I give her back to you.

139
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,114
It's so kind of you.

140
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,394
Okay. I accept it.

141
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:29,993
How dare you?

142
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:32,913
What are you doing?

143
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,913
My MP3 is broken.

144
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:36,954
Can I use yours?

145
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:37,993
No.

146
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:39,673
Why?

147
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:42,274
There is no reason.

148
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:47,714
It makes me feel so ambiguous right now.

149
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,074
My sweet Lu Yang.

150
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,553
Don't be so hard on yourself if you can't figure it out.

151
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:53,753
Go back to your seat.

152
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:54,474
Okay.

153
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,233
Jiang Chen.

154
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:00,673
Can I borrow your notebook?

155
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,873
I missed some parts yesterday.

156
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,074
I don't take notes.

157
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:09,313
Can you explain that part for me?

158
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:11,433
The teacher spoke too fast yesterday.

159
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,034
I could barely understand.

160
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:14,034
Here are you.

161
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,034
Okay. Wait for me.

162
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:35,313
You are so mean to me while so generous to Li Wei.

163
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:38,594
Don't you know the huge differences between you and Li Wei?

164
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,233
The rain is coming down.

165
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,433
And looking around...

166
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,993
to see if there's somewhere to place the desk.

167
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:51,793
But no.

168
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,913
What's wrong? Are you ill?

169
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:56,954
I think I have a fever.

170
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:01,753
Seems like you've got a fever.

171
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,034
Let me tell the teacher about this.

172
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,313
Help you ask for a leave.

173
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,194
Teacher...

174
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,394
It seems like Qiao Lu has got a fever.

175
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:11,313
Got a fever?

176
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:13,954
Classmates.

177
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,433
I will go for your Miss Liu.

178
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:16,954
Class monitor, just take care of your classmates.

179
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,594
I heard that there's avian influenza now.

180
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:24,673
Will it be...

181
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:26,034
It's hard to say.

182
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,313
She was fine this afternoon.

183
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:29,353
And suddenly she got a fever.

184
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:31,074
What's wrong with Qiao Lu?

185
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:32,793
Seems like she has got a fever.

186
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,834
Qiao Lu.

187
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:37,954
How about you?

188
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,194
Let's go to the medical room. Let's go.

189
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:45,634
Classmates, let's continue.

190
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,514
Let me translate this paragraph for you.

191
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:53,514
Xiang Jixuan, who used to be called Nan Gezi.

192
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:06,233
Come here, Qiao Lu.

193
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,514
Let me see your tongue.

194
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:15,274
Lie down and have a rest.

195
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:18,233
Miss Liu.

196
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:23,993
She is having a fever now.

197
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,594
And by now,

198
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,394
it seems like suspected avian influenza case.

199
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,194
The point is there are several cases in the city right now.

200
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,594
So I think we should get her to the hospital.

201
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,113
For further examination.

202
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,673
Is there any possibility of infection?

203
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:41,634
There's no human-to-human transmission of avian influenza by now.

204
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:44,634
But according to the requirements issued by ministry of health.

205
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:45,993
As long as there are suspected cases,

206
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,594
we should deal it with the strictest standards,

207
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:48,873
to take precautions.

208
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:50,433
What should we do now?

209
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:51,313
Make everyone isolated?

210
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:52,394
No.

211
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,793
It's not that bad.

212
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:57,034
How about this?

213
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,793
We report it to the school first.

214
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:01,274
And then observe other students closely.

215
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:04,793
Don't cause unnecessary panic.

216
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:10,274
There some many problems in our class recently.

217
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,514
Director Zhang is very unsatisfied.

218
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,594
He will keep an eye on our class.

219
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,034
So don't hang around outside these days.

220
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,673
Just stay in the classroom. Okay?

221
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,514
Okay.

222
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,194
Miss Liu.

223
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,474
How about Qiao Lu?

224
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:28,673
She has been taken to the hospital.

225
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:32,714
It's nothing serious. Don't worry.

226
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:35,673
If any of you feel sick,

227
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,954
just tell me in time.

228
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,353
Don't ignore it.

229
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:39,834
Learning is important,

230
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,753
but health is also important.

231
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,714
Don't hang around outside.

232
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:46,793
Stay in the classroom and read some books.

233
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:48,433
Okay.

234
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,873
What's wrong?

235
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,913
I feel something is wrong.

236
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:58,034
Would it be Qiao Lu?

237
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:58,913
What's wrong with Qiao Lu?

238
00:12:58,913 --> 00:12:59,954
Haven't you heard?

239
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,553
There are several cases of avian influenza recently.

240
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:04,034
I've told you.

241
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,834
There must be something wrong.

242
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,074
The school won't tell us the truth.

243
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,474
I think...

244
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:12,034
The current situation is more serious than the teacher said.

245
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,514
Have you ever seen a movie called

246
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,913
"Outbreak" or something like that?

247
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:20,233
The story is about a group of monkeys got the virus.

248
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,954
Then everyone died from the infection.

249
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:25,074
Just shut up!

250
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:25,793
Okay.

251
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,474
Qiao Lu must has something to do with avian influenza.

252
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,913
Be quiet!

253
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:32,753
Miss Liu said it was all right.

254
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,433
Stop it.

255
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:39,113
Li Wei just sits beside by Qiao Lu.

256
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,834
If she was infected too.

257
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:46,753
Right.

258
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,154
You two stay together every day.

259
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:49,353
Like twin sisters.

260
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:51,433
Li Wei, go to find Miss Liu now.

261
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,673
What's wrong with you?

262
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,673
Be careful Li Wei will get back at you by spitting.

263
00:13:58,474 --> 00:13:59,913
You are not helping her.

264
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,113
Don't play nice here.

265
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:04,714
Isn't that you hate most about Qiao Lu in usual.

266
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:06,514
So fake.

267
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:08,954
How dare Yu Tian!

268
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:10,034
That's Lin Jingxiao.

269
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,753
She is not only hate the people she doesn't like.

270
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:14,954
She will wreck anyone she is unable to control.

271
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,753
You are not afraid, right?

272
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,274
Then just sit next to Li Wei.

273
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:22,793
Li Wei.

274
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:23,714
Come here.

275
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:34,753
Come here.

276
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:41,074
Thank you.

277
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:44,474
Li Wei, you can sit next to me.

278
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:45,993
I'm strong enough. It's okay.

279
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:47,154
Do you know how to talk?

280
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,154
Never mind.

281
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,753
He's complimenting you on your beauty.

282
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:52,154
And he wants to sit next to you.

283
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:52,834
Yeah.

284
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,353
He always talks like that.

285
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,913
Never mind.

286
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:59,274
There's no human-to-human transmission of avian influenza by now.

287
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,074
Can you stop being so self-absorbed?

288
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:03,993
You know everything.

289
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:04,793
Jiang Chen,

290
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,834
have you ever had avian influenza?

291
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:07,793
Wang Dazhuang, you...

292
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:19,954
What's wrong?

293
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,714
Why so nervous?

294
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,553
Here's the thing.

295
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:26,074
There's some special situation now.

296
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,074
We need to record everyone's temperature.

297
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,753
Don't be panic.

298
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:33,313
It's not a big deal.

299
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:34,954
Just some simple body checks.

300
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,394
Every class has to do it.

301
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,793
Dr Li, let me help you.

302
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,714
Okay. You can help me do the records.

303
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:42,913
I can help, too!

304
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:43,673
Go back to your seat.

305
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,313
I just want to help you. I'm...

306
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,793
Chen Xiaoxi has been infected.

307
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,553
Bullshit!

308
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:03,993
Chen Xiaoxi.

309
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:05,113
Have you been infected?

310
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:06,353
Wang Dazhuang, shut up!

311
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:09,553
Calm down, don't be panic.

312
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,913
I'll check out.

313
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:19,433
It's fine.

314
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,514
Just several sneeze.

315
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,714
Come to medical room with me for a body check.

316
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:25,313
You'll be back soon, all right?

317
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:27,034
Dr. Li.

318
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,873
It's okay. Don't worry.

319
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:30,753
Let's go.

320
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:31,793
Don't worry.

321
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,514
Dr. Li said it was just several sneeze.

322
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,194
I'll come back soon.

323
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,353
Don't worry.

324
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,353
I have something to do now.

325
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:59,553
I'll let the new teacher check it for you later.

326
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,553
You can have a good rest first.

327
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,074
Bye.

328
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:16,994
Let me take a nap.

329
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:33,994
Please don't.

330
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,513
Please don't say anything.

331
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,234
Promise me.

332
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,793
Take good care of yourself after I die.

333
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:42,673
Okay.

334
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:45,234
Do not accept others' cookies easily.

335
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:46,714
Okay.

336
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:49,194
Do not tutor others in homework.

337
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:52,393
Okay.

338
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:54,074
Before you get married,

339
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,594
a master once gave me a hint.

340
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:59,194
What?

341
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:00,633
Never...

342
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:04,354
Never ever marry the woman whose family name is Li.

343
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:13,994
No.

344
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:18,393
No.

345
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:37,313
Wake up.

346
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:38,553
Wake up.

347
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:40,913
It's time to measure your temperature.

348
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:51,033
Have you touch any birds lately?

349
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,273
Did you eat any chicken?

350
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,153
No.

351
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:56,633
No. No. No.

352
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:59,074
I ate a chicken sandwich this morning.

353
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:02,194
Teacher.

354
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,433
I'll be okay, right?

355
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:05,673
It's hard to say.

356
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:08,313
You just stay here.

357
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,754
We will check your body every once in a while.

358
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:13,874
Here.

359
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,834
Sign this paper.

360
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,834
Don't forget.

361
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:28,474
Teacher.

362
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:30,033
You stay here.

363
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:30,954
Don't walk around.

364
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:32,273
I'll be back soon.

365
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:43,433
I feel a little bit hot.

366
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:47,594
Feel me if I have a fever.

367
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:56,273
I am going to die with Xiaoxi together.

368
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:57,393
You can die alone.

369
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:58,954
I'll miss Lin Jingxiao.

370
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:01,393
Jingjing.

371
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,513
Please take good care of yourself.

372
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,033
How long has it been?

373
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,194
She said she'd be right back.

374
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:12,913
It has been 40 minutes.

375
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:15,474
I wonder if she will be afraid.

376
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:19,313
Let's have a look.

377
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:29,114
Where is Jiang Chen?

378
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:41,033
Chen Xiaoxi.

379
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:43,238
Jingjing.

380
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,711
- Chen Xiaoxi. - Why are you here?

381
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,234
Don't be afraid.

382
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,114
Are you all right? Are you afraid?

383
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,033
Wu Bosong.

384
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,153
Take it easy.

385
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,633
Don't make so much noise.

386
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,594
Who's there?

387
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,153
Stop! Come back! Which class are you in?

388
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:01,393
I'll be right back.

389
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:02,313
Stand there!

390
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:07,754
Chen Xiaoxi.

391
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,393
Jiang Chen.

392
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,553
I thought you wouldn't come.

393
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,834
Even if I've came here, it won't be helpful.

394
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:25,433
There is another one here!

395
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,153
What are you talking about?

396
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:48,153
I'm going to the toilet.

397
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,354
There's no need to report to us.

398
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:59,273
Just several sneeze.

399
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,393
It's okay. It's fine.

400
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:03,474
You are not gonna die.

401
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,033
Who's there?

402
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:36,474
Hello?

403
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:37,474
Mummy.

404
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,594
It's me.

405
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:40,673
Why are you calling me at this point?

406
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:42,194
What's wrong? Don't cry.

407
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,513
Mummy, please help me!

408
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:45,633
What's wrong?

409
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,114
Where are you, Xiaoxi?

410
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:48,633
What's wrong? What's wrong?

411
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,673
I just had several sneeze.

412
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,673
And they locked me in the medical room.

413
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:54,633
Where are you now?

414
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,874
Say it again.

415
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,994
I am in the medical room.

416
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:00,313
You deserve it!

417
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,793
I've asked you to wear your long johns this morning.

418
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:04,234
See?

419
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,474
You know what?

420
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:08,354
Take some medicine and come back home to wear your long Johns.

421
00:23:09,994 --> 00:23:11,594
Oh, my god. The pig's feet are over cooked.

422
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:33,594
You cried.

423
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:35,234
No, I didn't.

424
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,673
Don't be afraid. I am standing here with you.

425
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:40,354
Only if stop kicking the door.

426
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:48,834
Aren't you afraid of being alone?

427
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:50,074
It's fine.

428
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:51,754
Just a little bit.

429
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:54,513
How about I share some sadness with you?

430
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:56,114
What made you unhappy? And when?

431
00:23:58,234 --> 00:23:59,273
I can't remember.

432
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,594
I am a little tired for standing too long.

433
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:10,393
You just go to sit on the bed.

434
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:12,194
What about you?

435
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:13,874
Me too.

436
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:15,874
Okay.

437
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,633
Xiaoxi.

438
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,513
Can you see me?

439
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:29,754
I am here.

440
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:30,954
Yes, I can.

441
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:20,393
Chen Xiaoxi.

442
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:21,793
Chill out.

443
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:24,474
There's no human-to-human transmission of avian influenza by now.

444
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:26,474
Let me tell you how it spreads.

445
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,673
Firstly, through feces.

446
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:30,223
Secondly, spread through water

447
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,273
which contaminated with diseased poultry.

448
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:45,033
Li Wei.

449
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,273
Can I borrow your compasses?

450
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:53,474
Li Wei.

451
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:54,433
You...

452
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:55,874
Have you got a fever?

453
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,074
Who has got a fever?

454
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:03,754
You've got a fever.

455
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:05,273
Do you cough?

456
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:07,874
Let's go to the medical room with me.

457
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:09,114
Go there for a rest.

458
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:09,754
Let's go.

459
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:19,913
Hey you! Which class are you in?

460
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:21,954
Xiaoxi, teacher is coming.

461
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,194
See you later.

462
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:24,673
Stop!

463
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:26,633
Stop!

464
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,033
Have a rest.

465
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:34,313
Why are you here?

466
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:38,033
Take a seat.

467
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:52,954
Teacher.

468
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:54,033
What's up?

469
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,033
Could you please help me to bring this to Chen Xiaoxi?

470
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:57,954
Who?

471
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,194
The girl who was just taken into the medical room.

472
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,194
What's your name?

473
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:03,273
Jiang Chen.

474
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,234
Thank you, teacher.

475
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:05,673
Go back to your classroom.

476
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:11,513
This boy is so romantic.

477
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:18,594
A boy named Jiang Chen wanted me to give this MP3 to you.

478
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:20,393
Thank you, teacher.

479
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,074
There are three suspected cases in this class.

480
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:04,954
Will it be more and more serious?

481
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:07,834
Let's take them to the hospital.

482
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,074
No.

483
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,033
Three suspected cases in one time.

484
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:11,273
Can you imagine what's going to happen?

485
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,354
And Dr. Li said that they didn't have a high fever.

486
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:15,954
It's better to take them to the hospital.

487
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:16,834
Miss Liu.

488
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,513
Chen Xiaoxi and Li Wei are not as serious as you think.

489
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:21,513
But now, these are special moments.

490
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:22,994
We still need to do further observation.

491
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,513
What you can do now is to comfort your students.

492
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:27,954
Don't make them think too much.

493
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,673
I think we can inform their parents to come to school first.

494
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:31,513
You are right.

495
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:33,513
What are you doing?

496
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,673
All parents will come to school once you inform them.

497
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:36,313
What shall we do?

498
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:36,874
Director Zhang,

499
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:39,474
you're not allow me to take them to the hospital.

500
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:41,633
And you also not allow me to inform their parents.

501
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:44,153
What if something happens to my students?

502
00:28:44,153 --> 00:28:45,714
Can you take this responsibility?

503
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:46,834
Miss Liu.

504
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,313
What are you talking about?

505
00:28:48,714 --> 00:28:49,913
I just do it for our school's own good.

506
00:28:49,913 --> 00:28:51,153
It was because they were fine!

507
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,633
I will take them to the hospital if there is something wrong.

508
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,834
Didn't we take Qiao Lu to the hospital?

509
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,754
All right. Just calm down.

510
00:28:58,714 --> 00:28:59,464
How about this?

511
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,354
I'll check their situation regularly.

512
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:03,874
Don't worry.

513
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,074
I don't think it's that serious.

514
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:06,677
If we should take them to the hospital,

515
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,994
and inform their parents or not?

516
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:09,594
Just wait.

517
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,194
And think it over.

518
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:13,114
Director Zhang, excuse me.

519
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,954
Dr. Li, when can Chen Xiaoxi come out?

520
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,594
She is still under observation.

521
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:28,793
Don't worry.

522
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,393
Can I meet her?

523
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:32,194
Even if you can,

524
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:33,754
there is nothing you can help her.

525
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:35,033
Why do you have to go in there?

526
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,633
Because she is my friend.

527
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,633
Do you know that in astronomy,

528
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,673
if there's something wrong with one detector.

529
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:42,313
And what the other one should do?

530
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,074
It should wait for orders.

531
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:46,673
So...

532
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:48,114
You should go back to your classroom now.

533
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,633
I'll check her situation regularly.

534
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,633
And make sure she will not woolgather .

535
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,714
Now you go back to your classroom and wait for orders.

536
00:30:03,354 --> 00:30:05,874
He likes astronomy too.

537
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:28,594
Dr. Li,

538
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,033
I feel sick.

539
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:36,994
Here. Just measure your temperature.

540
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:52,313
Miss Liu.

541
00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:54,673
Jiang Chen.

542
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,433
Li Wei has got a fever.

543
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:59,874
You also have strong management ability.

544
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:02,553
I think you can take the place of class monitor provisionally

545
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:04,153
before Li Wei's recovery.

546
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,474
Help me to take good care of others.

547
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:09,874
There's a box of gauze mask on the desk.

548
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:12,114
Help me to hand it out to the class later.

549
00:31:12,114 --> 00:31:15,714
And there are some suggestions about health there.

550
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:19,074
Go to the radio station later and read it.

551
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:19,994
Just go.

552
00:31:36,114 --> 00:31:37,234
Miss Liu, see you.

553
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:37,994
All right.

554
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:41,153
Take a rest.

555
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:42,033
Okay.

556
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:45,194
Why are you here?

557
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,194
What did I just say?

558
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:47,793
I'll come back for you later.

559
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:48,834
Are you okay?

560
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:49,714
I'm fine.

561
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:51,594
They said I've got a fever.

562
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:54,474
Come here and sit down.

563
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:56,714
What a coincidence!

564
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:01,793
Let's play the Gobang.

565
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:04,954
Then you've got the right man.

566
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,273
You'll lose if you take this step.

567
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:39,354
No. It was a mistake.

568
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:40,633
All right.

569
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,474
You've acted shamelessly.

570
00:32:42,673 --> 00:32:44,234
I'm a dying person.

571
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:45,553
Show me your mercy.

572
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:47,354
Why I chose to take another step?

573
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:58,474
To control infectious diseases,

574
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,714
we have to do it from 3 steps.

575
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,746
The sources of infection, routes of transmission,

576
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,033
and the susceptible population.

577
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:06,153
It's Jiang Chen.

578
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:09,673
Minimize unnecessary touch with poultry.

579
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:11,954
Especially the sick or dead poultry.

580
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:14,553
If you've already touched,

581
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:18,074
you should clean your hands with alcohol or water.

582
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,478
=Jiang Chen, I will not marry you.

583
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:56,834
I really enjoy reading all kinds of detective and horror stories.

584
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,874
In order to divert myself from boredom,

585
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:00,594
I've imagined the most ingenious method of murder.

586
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,754
Several years later, I became a judge.

587
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:06,714
My secret nature was encouraged to develop.

588
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:09,633
It's "And Then There Were None". He is reading it for me.

589
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,314
When I saw a hapless criminal struggling in the dock,

590
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,034
and intermittently tortured.

591
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,873
The killer was a judge.

592
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:19,433
It's impossible!

593
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,274
However,

594
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:23,913
if there was an innocent man stand in the dock,

595
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:26,474
I won't be that happy.

596
00:34:26,474 --> 00:34:28,153
At least there were two times...

597
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,633
Xiaoxi, do you still want to play?

598
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,314
I terminated the trial.

599
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:35,194
And pointed out to the jury that the charges were not true.

600
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:36,353
But...

601
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:38,122
Thanks to our security services for

602
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,794
its impartiality and efficiency...

603
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,314
Open the door!

604
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,153
Who is in there?

605
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,393
Open the door for me!

606
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:46,794
Open the door!

607
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,954
When the sea calms down,

608
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,474
people on the shore will bring in boats.

609
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:55,433
What they find on the soldiers' island will be ten bodies.

610
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,474
And a riddle that no one can solve.

611
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:00,153
Okay.

612
00:35:00,153 --> 00:35:01,754
I'll wait for you from outside.

613
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:05,474
And finally, he said,

614
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:08,954
don't be afraid.

615
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:18,554
What are you doing here?

616
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,673
Jiang Chen.

617
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:26,433
Do you think you can get good grades

618
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:29,034
means that I will let you do anything you want?

619
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,538
- Hello. - Are you Miss Liu?

620
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,274
Yes, I am.

621
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,194
The results have came out.

622
00:35:37,194 --> 00:35:38,234
Both of them are fine.

623
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:39,113
Don't worry.

624
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:41,274
Okay.

625
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:43,393
That's great.

626
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:44,554
All right.

627
00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:45,913
Thank you. Thank you so much.

628
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:51,913
Go back to your classroom.

629
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,353
The hospital has confirmed that

630
00:35:58,353 --> 00:35:59,833
Qiao Lu just got a regular fever.

631
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,554
She will be okay by staying a few more days in the hospital.

632
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:04,754
Let me have a look.

633
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,194
All right. Everything is fine now.

634
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,714
Just remember to take your medicine on time.

635
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:14,353
It's your turn. Let me have a look.

636
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:20,314
There was nothing wrong with you at first.

637
00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:22,474
Are you still sneezing now?

638
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:25,194
That's all right.

639
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:34,913
It's so strange.

640
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,474
When I measured your temperature in the classroom just now,

641
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:39,034
it was almost 40 degrees centigrade.

642
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,754
I'm an athlete.

643
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:47,873
Jiang Chen.

644
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:50,754
You this bad boy!

645
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:52,913
I tell you what.

646
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,433
Miss Liu didn't punish you,

647
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,554
because it was you.

648
00:36:57,754 --> 00:36:59,754
You can't do that again.

649
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,593
You this bad boy!

650
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,194
Jiang Chen.

651
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:14,673
I am out.

652
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:15,873
Or...

653
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:17,073
Did you break out of prison?

654
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:19,153
Anyway, I'm free now.

655
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,833
How fresh the air is!

656
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,673
What's this smell?

657
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,514
You've suffered a lot today.

658
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,194
Let's go. Let me buy you some delicious.

659
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:36,913
Let's go.

660
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:38,994
See you.

661
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:41,754
Smell me for vinegar.

662
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,393
I spent a whole day in detoxifying with white vinegar.

663
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,474
Let me help you.

664
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:55,833
It's fine. It's almost done.

665
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:57,873
I can do it, too.

666
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:00,314
I can do it as good as you are.

667
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,314
Daddy, mummy. Why are you here?

668
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:15,034
Your teacher called me to come to school.

669
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:16,194
Are you okay?

670
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,474
It was a false alarm.

671
00:38:22,393 --> 00:38:23,073
Daddy.

672
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,113
Have you been waiting for a long time?

673
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:27,474
No. It's okay.

674
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:29,754
Here, put on your long johns.

675
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,153
Do not catch a cold again.

676
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:33,314
How can I wear it in the street?

677
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,353
Put it away. Put it away.

678
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:37,514
Let's go back home!

679
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:38,873
Okay. Let's go.

680
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:39,994
Be careful.

681
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,643
=Jiang Chen
Is "And Then There Were None" a good book?

682
00:39:22,962 --> 00:39:24,453
=Just so so.

683
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:43,348
=Lu Yang
What's relationship between you and Jiang Chen? Tell me!
Or I'll make Lin Jingxiao to coma after you!

684
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:02,994
I will be waiting for one more minute.

685
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:15,393
Dear little sister,

686
00:40:15,393 --> 00:40:18,353
just take your time.

687
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,833
What time is it now?

688
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,314
How can you take it easy?

689
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,034
Director Zhang, I will take it easy.

690
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:26,873
No. No. No.

691
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,353
I am in a hurry.

692
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:29,673
What's that in your ears?

693
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:32,433
Hand it to me!

694
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:34,873
Hand it to me!

695
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:41,274
How can you take it easy?

696
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:43,073
You are my key person of observation now.

697
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,194
You know what?

698
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,153
You are always halfhearted.

699
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,593
And doesn't look like a student at all.

700
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:53,353
Good morning, Director Zhang.

701
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:54,153
Director Zhang, I am wrong.

702
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:54,913
See you later!

703
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,153
Good bye, Director Zhang.

704
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:57,194
Take it easy!
