00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,990
I can't go to any first-tier university.

165
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,760
So I filled in the form for fun.

166
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,080
If someone asked me, I'd say:

167
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,590
I'd applied for Zhejiang University.

168
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,410
But I missed it by a few points.

169
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,600
Lu Yang, hurry up and give me your form.

170
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,560
The rest of you can go home now.

171
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,990
Let's go.

172
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,890
Bye.

173
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,580
I'll be waiting for you.

174
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,670
Let's go.

175
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,820
Hey, you two go first.

176
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,790
- I'll wait for Jiang Chen. - OK.

177
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,750
- Hang out together some day? - OK.

178
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,350
Hi, Mrs. Jiang. This is Jiang Chen's form.

179
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,080
=A. Zhejiang University
B. Tsinghua University

180
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,800
No.

181
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,440
His first aspiration has to be math major in Tsinghua.

182
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,870
He's got a good score.

183
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,530
He can choose either one.

184
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,430
- Maybe you should talk about it? - Ms. Liu,

185
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,680
I've made up my mind.

186
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,430
No need to change it.

187
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,060
I can't believe it.

188
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,580
A dispute over whether he's going to Tsinghua?

189
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,130
I'm going to Lanxiang Vocational School!

190
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,020
I don't have to wear school uniform anymore!

191
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
If you don't, I'll change it for you.

192
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,030
Mom.

193
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,790
If you know me well,

194
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,800
you should know I'd quit Tsinghua once you changed it.

195
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,750
Jiang Chen.

196
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,800
Jiang Chen.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,540
Let's go.

198
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Jingjing.

199
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,010
So...

200
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,040
Do you think...

201
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,240
I can have a girlfriend if I'm cured?

202
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,980
You can have one even if you're not.

203
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,210
What if I couldn't be cured?

204
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,030
You still can have one.

205
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,320
No.

206
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
It'd be unfair to the girl.

207
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,560
Lu Yang,

208
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,560
you don't have a girlfriend?

209
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,760
- No. - You have one now.

210
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,030
Stop.

211
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
Walk over slowly.

212
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,600
Seems that your mom wants you go to Tsinghua.

213
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,190
So?

214
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,700
You're quite rebellious.

215
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,110
Are you really not going?

216
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,160
No.

217
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,790
What a pity!

218
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,620
Jiang Chen, you're successfully admitted into Zhejiang University.

219
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,670
Awesome! Brother, you made it!

220
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,600
You're excellent! Yeah!

221
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,560
That's great!

222
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,120
Good boy, it's great.

223
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,230
Congratulations!

224
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,660
I'll cook a big meal for you.

225
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,090
Brother, you're amazing!

226
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,020
This is for you.

227
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,040
Thanks.

228
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,090
Mom.

229
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,490
I was admitted into Zhejiang University!

230

=From Lin Jingxiao
I was admitted into ZJU, how about you?

231
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,980

234
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,730
How is it?

235
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,870
I made it!

236
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,950
I made it. I really did!

237
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,530
A second-tier university.

238
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,950
It's very close to yours.

239
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,450
Just two bus stops away.

240
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,280
I can go to see you by running.

243

Xiaoxi, it's OK.

244
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,060
Dad and I have decided to send you to study abroad.

245
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,500
Right.

We can sell our pig's trotter restaurant.

248

Running a restaurant is too toilsome.

249
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,260
It's too much for your mom.

250
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,280
Exactly.

251

=From Jiang Chen

252
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,960
Brother, you still making phone calls?

253
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,520
To Xiaoxi?

254
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,360
So?

255
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,060
She lives across the street.

256
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,340
Why not go find her?

257
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,000
- I'm going out. - OK.

258
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,830
Hi, Jiang Chen.

259
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,760
Hi, Mrs. Chen.

260
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,580
I'm here for Chen Xiaoxi.

261
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,290
She's been in her room for the whole day.

262
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,520
No one could persuade her to get out.

263
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,930
May I talk to her?

264
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,470
Sure.

265
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,980
And help us to console her, please.

266
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,980
It's OK that she was not admitted.

267
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,700
We can try our best to send her abroad.

268
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,010
Please tell her not to be so upset.

269

I've decided to retake high school classes.

335
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,620
I want to learn art and take the art exam.

336
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,400
To start over?

337
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,400
- Do you have confidence? - It'd be stressful.

338
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,720
Can you endure that?

339
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,140
Yes.

340
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,410
Jiang Chen told me about it.

341
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,660

those who eat still-life objects won't make it to college.

Hi, are you from the Department of Medicine?

397
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,230
I had thought about majoring in medicine.

398
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,160
However, my score was not good enough.

399
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,660
But I'm really interested in medicine.

400
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,480
Could you take me to your courses?

401
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,320
I suggest you should not waste your time.

402
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,740
They are not for those with low scores.

403

00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,880
Weirdo.

500
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,560
Are you going?

501
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,040
My legs are numb.

502
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,440
Could you carry me in your arms?

503
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,090
I'd like to knock you out,

504
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,480
and drag you back home.

505
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:18,910
Please wrap it up.

506
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:19,960
Wu Bosong.

507
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,410
What are you doing here?

508
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,110
I came back for a competition.

509
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,770
Lu Yang asked me to go to a reunion party.

510
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,460
So here I am.

511
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,870
This is a gift for you.

512
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,950
You two will go together?

513
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,440
- What gift? - Wait.

514
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,190
- A party? - Yep.

515
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,290
Lu Yang said he had called but no one answered.

516
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,040
So he texted you.

517
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,410
He wants to congratulate you and has booked a KTV room.

518
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,100
I'm the reason of the party but he didn't properly inform me?

519
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
Cheers!

520
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,870
For Chen Xiaoxi!

521
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,720
# It's a city that never sleeps. #

522
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,040
Cheers!

523
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,920
# Sing and dance to extol the good times. #

524
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,520
Come on.

525
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,100
The whole bottle.

526
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,460
Xiaoxi, I wish you good luck at college.

527
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,200
Thank you.

528
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,850
What a surprise!

529
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,310
Latecomers surpass. Amazing.

530
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,020
Come on, cheers!

531
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,520
Drink it all.

532
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,900
Don't forget us if you become a great painter one day.

533
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,140
Congratulations!

534
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,950
I can't drink anymore.

535
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,360
You surprised me.

536
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,230
I should have retaken classes.

537
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,800
Jingjing.

538
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,020
To be honest, no one expected you to be admitted by ZJU.

539
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,230
Excuse me?

540
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,570
You care about her?

541
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,800
Yes.

542
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,680
Go home safe.

543
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,690
Where did you go?

544
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,720
Jingjing.

545
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,920
Jingjing.

546
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,960
How could you let her drink so much?

547
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,680
You should have stopped her.

548
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,120
Jingjing.

549
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,880
Let's go home.

550
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,050
No more drink.

551
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,350
Weren't you playing computer games?

552
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,060
I've stopped.

553
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,130
Let's go home now.

554
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,700
Your mom has a bad impression on me.

555
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,540
Now I don't know what to tell her.

556
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,050
- Jingjing. - Chen Xiaoxi, bye.

557
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,280
Jingjing.

558
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,850
I won't play games anymore.

559
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,390
I swear, OK?

560
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,150
- Please don't be mad at me. - Go away.

561
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,650
Please, don't be mad...

562
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,060
Go away!

563
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,340
Can you stand on your feet?

564
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,360
Asshole, Jiang Chen.

565
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,990
I'll take her home.

566
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm going with you.

567
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,370
Who are you? I don't have money.

568
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,120
I can do it alone.

569
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,710
You have a competition. Don't waste your time.

570
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,290
Take care of her.

571
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Can you walk?

572
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,160
Or you want me carry you in my arms?

573
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,690
I can walk.

574
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,840
Let's go.

575
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,700
Hold my hand.

576
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,630
Will you still remember...

577
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,300
What happened tonight?

578
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,600
I don't know.

579
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,650
If you do,

580
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,950
just call me.

581
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,840
OK.
