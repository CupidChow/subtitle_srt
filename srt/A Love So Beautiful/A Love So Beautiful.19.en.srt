00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,870
Ministry of Health has put forward a talent-cultivation plan.

169
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,750
Every province could send one excellent medic

170
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,280
to UMCH for a four-year training class.

171
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
And this quota goes to our hospital.

172
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,350
After consideration of all aspects,

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,650
we decided to recommend you.

174
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,920
OK.

175
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,330
But I have to think about it.

176
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,610
Yes, you should.

177
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,710
It's a good chance for you.

178
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,290
Why do you have time to visit me?

179
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,110
I feel like I have earned a lot if I can meet you at the campus.

180
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,230
Then I'll make you earn more.

181
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,890
Who are you?

182
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,570
Tear your mask apart.

183
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,580
- Have you finished your graduation project?- No.

184
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,910
No way.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,880
You are not allowed to have a look.

186
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,890
I haven't finished yet.

187
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,060
All right, then I won't see it.

188
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,260
All right, I won't see it. I said it.

189
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,080
Shall we go for a walk?

190
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,870
I haven't gone for a walk with you for ages.

191
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,820
I have to go back to hospital at 9.

192
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,280
We just stay like this till 9.

193
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,260
Do you come to me for anything special?

194
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,110
Nothing.

195
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,510
Just for you.

196
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,200
You have missed me.

197
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,030
Now you have realized that I am important, right?

198
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,530
Do you have to hug me while talking?

199
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:49,970
Yes.

200
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,080
It's OK, I won't be ashamed of you.

201
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,530
Did you have dinner?

202
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,570
How about Yu Yongbo at Room 3207?

203
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,790
Not good.

204
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,850
He have suffered from shock three days ago.

205
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,160
Terminal congestive heart failure.

206
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,920
Heart transplantation is the only solution.

207
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,560
You should keep tabs on him.

208
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,550
Report to me if necessary.

209
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,420
OK.

210
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,670
Director He.

211
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,990
Last time you told me about the plan in UMCH.

212
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,760
I have thought about it.

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,130
What about it?

214
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,790
I won't go there.

215
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,460
It's such a good chance.

216
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,170
You just give it up.

217
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,550
Actually, for me,

218
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,160
hospital doesn't influence my learning.

219
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,650
Is it because of your family?

220
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,330
My girlfriend.

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,970
We are going to get married.

222
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,030
Do you know,

223
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,150
how rare the opportunity is?

224
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,010
We all think highly of you, so we decide to send you there.

225
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,280
Moreover,

226
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,800
she can go with you.

227
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,640
I...

228
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,760
That's enough.

229
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,150
Think about it again.

230
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,650
You are moving out now?

231
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,400
No.

232
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,300
I just move some things there one after another.

233
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,990
So it won't be too difficult for us to move.

234
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,860
Don't worry.

235
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,080
I'll move with you then.

236
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,270
I don't know whether I can move yet.

237
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,470
My boyfriend just pissed me off.

238
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,690
He just haven't found a house yet.

239
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,460
How about you, Xiaoxi?

240
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,330
I haven't yet.

241
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,810
Jiang Chen is too busy.

242
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,830
I haven't told him.

243
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,200
You can't do that.

244
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,060
You haven't finished graduation projects,

245
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,470
haven't found a job, house neither.

246
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,850
What should you do?

247
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,630
You're the only one who haven't finished the graduation project.

248
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,910
Xiaoxi, leave her alone.

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,760
It's saying that,

250
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,480
in the end things will mend.

251
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,470
Don't worry.

252
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,830
Or so,

253
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,787
I ask my boyfriend to send you

254
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:24,600
the phone number of the real estate agent.

255
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,040
You can tell your boyfriend about it.

256
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,840
How about it?

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
OK.

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,520
=the real estate agent

259
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,440
Miss Chen,right?

260
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,010
I am Meng who contacted you just now.

261
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Why do you come here along?

262
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,120
Where is your boyfriend? Doesn't he come with you?

263
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,780
Please wait a moment.

264
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,780
Hello, Jiang Chen.

265
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,140
What's the matter?

266
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,730
Are you free today?

267
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,780
There are two operations today.

268
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,890
But if you need me, I can ask for leave.

269
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,000
Nothing.

270
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,770
I just want to know,

271
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,810
whether you have time to hang out with me?

272
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,581
Have you finished your graduation project?

273
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,450
Do you still have time for hanging out?

274
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,730
I...

275
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,440
Never mind.

276
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,790
I...

277
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,670
Forget it.

278
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,280
I will go with my roommates and Jingjing.

279
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,020
Let's go.

280
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,300
Let's go.

281
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,530
Would you like it, Dr.?

282
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,400
No, thanks.

283
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,960
Prepare adrenaline.

284
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,400
Report to Director He and the operating room.

285
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,930
Dr.

286
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,480
Dr, you have to save him.

287
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,760
Dr, you have to save him.

288
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,030
I am right.

289
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
If you have boyfriend, you won't check the house alone.

290
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,510
Let's go.

291
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,180
Come in and have a look.

292
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,170
What are you afraid of?

293
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,060
Come in and have a look.

294
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,280
No.

295
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,930
I don't want to see today.

296
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,300
What's wrong with you?

297
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,000
Come in and have a look.

298
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,670
Let me go.

299
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,470
If you don't let me go, I'll call the police.

300
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,390
Why do you call the police?

301
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,890
Have a look.

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
Excuse me.

303
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,850
I want Jiang Chen.

304
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,620
Is he the intern of Cardiac Surgery Department?

305
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,290
He's performing the operation.

306
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,510
Little girl,

307
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,540
do you like Dr. Jiang?

308
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,060
Dr. Jiang is handsome.

309
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,460
Most of the nurses

310
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,370
fall in love with him, too.

311
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,530
But love doesn't count.

312
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,300
He'll go to Beijing soon.

313
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,940
Where?

314
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,460
Beijing. To engage in advanced studies.

315
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,840
Four years.

316
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,160
Although he is handsome,

317
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,040
he is good at working.

318
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,830
There is only one quota in the whole province.

319
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,640
It goes to him.

320
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,710
What's wrong with you?

321
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,280
Why did you call me so many times?

322
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,590
What's wrong?

323
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,610
Are you leaving to Beijing?

324
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,240
Who told you this?

325
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,210
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,010
I haven't decided yet.

327
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,230
In your decision,

328
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,820
my opinion doesn't count.

329
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,960
Am I right?

330
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,950
Answer it.

331
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,510
I'll go back now.

332
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,160
Xiaoxi.

333
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,060
I don't want to love you anymore.

334
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,680
Dr. Jiang, Director He is looking for you.

335
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,350
Maybe it's about Yu Yongbo at Room 3207.

336
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,720
I will ask Lu Yang to find the house.

337
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,290
You don't have to worry about that.

338
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,650
I'm sure you can find a job. Don't hurry.

339
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,170
However, firstly,

340
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,080
you should finish your graduation project.

341
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,330
Everything's after graduation.

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,460
Jiang Chen...

343
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,540
You need good communication.

344
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,710
But till now,

345
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,530
he hasn't called me.

346
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,900
Maybe he is too busy.

347
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,160
He is busy all the time.

348
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,270
The ending of our conversations is always

349
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,450
he has a operation.

350
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,530
I will let Lu Yang scold him.

351
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,520
Never mind.

352
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,980
I have forgotten.

353
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,830
He didn't love me

354
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,420
at the beginning.

355
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't be sad.

356
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,100
I think that everybody knows about

357
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,850
Yu Yongbo this afternoon.

358
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,900
Rescue once again.

359
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,620
Jiang Chen did a great job.

360
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,940
His prompt treatment should be appreciated.

361
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,240
Here is a piece of good news.

362
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,620
We have found a suitable heart for Yu Yongbo.

363
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,360
It's on the way to our hospital.

364
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,220
To our hospital,

365
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,080
heart transplant operation

366
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,050
is not refined.

367
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,750
I hope that we can cooperate with each other,

368
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,880
and win this uphill battle.

369
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,820
Dr. Zhong,

370
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,190
you are responsible for operating room arrangement.

371
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,830
OK.

372
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,730
Dr. Li,

373
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,270
You are responsible for transporting the heart to the op.

374
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,860
好

375
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,750
Jiang Chen,

376
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,860
you are responsible for the preparation of germfree isolator,

377
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,680
and the isoproterenol.

378
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,310
Keep in touch.

379
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,470
Hurry up.

380
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Dr. Jiang,

381
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,690
I just want to know,

382
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,410
how's the risk of this operation?

383
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,080
The risks are high.

384
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,210
But we will try our best.

385
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,890
Thank you, thank you very much.

386
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,600
Dr., you must save him.

387
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,860
You must save him.

388
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,350
I will.

389
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,310
You must save him.

390
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,620
Dr.,

391
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,240
This is you drawn by me.

392
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,980
Thanks for saving my dad.

393
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,350
Thank you.

394
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's a wonderful painting.

395
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,710
Heparin, 300 units per kilo,  intravenous injection.

396
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,730
Heparin, 300 units per kilo,  intravenous injection.

397
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,260
One milligram adrenaline, intravenous injection.

398
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,020
One milligram adrenaline, intravenous injection.

399
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,910
Time of death,

400
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,820
19:40.

401
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,270
You are a bad man.

402
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,040
Get out.

403
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,300
You are a bad man.

404
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,620
Get out, get out.

405
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,230
Hello.

406
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,110
I'm downstairs in your dormitory.

407
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,900
It's so late,

408
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,150
what do you come here for?

409
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,490
I had an operation today.

410
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,660
I know you had an operation today.

411
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,230
So you can't meet me at once.

412
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,250
I also know that you are busy doing something.

413
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,130
I know all about it.

414
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,640
You don't have to come here and tell me.

415
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,730
Don't you want to know what happened to me today?

416
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,370
Don't you want to know what happened to me today?

417
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,590
Do you have to talk with me like this?

418
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,380
What else do you want to say?

419
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,520
If no, I'm going back.

420
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,400
Chen Xiaoxi.

421
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,960
Is it your first time that you have sent away the patient?

422
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,490
We have done everything we could.

423
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,140
Then we are free from any compunction.

424
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,850
Actually the risks of the operation,

425
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,870
are very high.

426
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,703
It it weren't for the bad health of the patient

427
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,810
for which he couldn't be transferred to another hospital,

428
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,830
I hope that he could be transferred to

429
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,990
a more experienced hospital.

430
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,630
I think I haven't done my best.

431
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,790
I could have done better.

432
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,500
This is why I want you to take the advanced studies in UMCH.

433
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,340
They have the best medical resources,

434
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,860
and the best medical team in the world.

435
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,110
If you study there, you can learn more.

436
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,800
=Chen Xiaoxi.
Have you thought about this?
It was so late that the dormitory was closed.

437
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,050
I have decided.

438
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,260
I'll go to UMCH.

439
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
I'll lift it myself.

440
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,720
It's alright.

441
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,830
Hello.

442
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,190
Where are you now?

443
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,750
I want to talk to you face to face.

444
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,870
I'm busy with my graduation projects.

445
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,010
I can't...

446
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,400
Chen Xiaoxi.

447
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,380
Why do you have so many packages?

448
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,800
Fortunately I have asked my friend for help.

449
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,670
Or else I'll be tired to death.

450
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,180
I'll appreciate you in front of Jingjing.

451
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,650
Let's go.

452
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,490
Jiang Chen.

453
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,960
- What's wrong? - What's the matter? Let's go.

454
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,310
Let's go.

455
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,090
Jiang Chen.

456
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,160
What's this?

457
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,280
Bracelet.

458
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,840
I love you.

459
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,780
If you remember,

460
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,940
call me.

461
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,920
The life is so long.

462
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,330
You won't be my only love in my life.

463
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,960
Chen Xiaoxi.

464
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,950
Can you come here for me?

465
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,960
You are at the airport now?

466
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,840
Can you come here for me?

467
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,940
Jiang Chen, you bastard!

468
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,420
I won't go there for you!

469
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,240
Passengers taking flight CA1840 to Beijing...

470
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,570
Please be quick to board the aircraft through the gate No.9.

471
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,500
It's really you!
