Nothing expresses the tenderness of a girl like knitting scarf.

Chen Xiaoxi chose the same color!

I have something to show you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,940
I knitted a scarf myself. Try it on!

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,770
I think Li Shu has got a girlfriend.

Lin Jingxiao,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

12
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,470
Movie tonight?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,210
What's wrong with you? Get away!

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,240
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,950
Lin Jingxiao, you are too crazy to find a boyfriend!
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

16
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,820
I'd like to be though.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,650
I don't want to wear this.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

19
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,640
It's Li Wei's present for you.

Firework for four

24
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,310
Thank you, Jiang Chen.

25
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,720
That must be the upperclassman from Senior Two!

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,060
He's so handsome!

27
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,360
That should be his girlfriend.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,460
They are such a match!

29
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,450
Bullshit!

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,610
I... I mean you said it wrong that,

31
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,910
he's not Senior Two. He's Senior Three.

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,270
Who is she?

33
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,790
No idea. Maybe some fan of Jiang Chen.

34
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,720
The "there be" structure,

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,450
belongs to incomplete inversion among inverted structures.

36
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,110
To give you a very simple example.

37
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,340
There is a book on the desk.

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,270
Here in "there is", "there" is a adverb.

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,040
Lin Jingxiao,

40
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,000
Lu Yang

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,090
On your feet!

42
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,870
What are you two doing in class?

43
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,280
Have a look on the calendar.

44
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Do you have any idea you are in Senior Three?

45
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,820
Especially you, Lu Yang.

46
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,440
Let alone your pathetic grades,

47
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,980
you now dare influence Lin Jingxiao?

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,070
Guess falling alone can't satisfy you.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,750
What's so funny?

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,140
Chen Xiaoxi, what's so funny?

51
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,640
- Madam, - Why don't you...

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,920
can you keep on teaching?

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,110
If you give up one minute,

54
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,010
it would be forty minutes for forty students.

55
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,880
Sit down.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,980
You three sit down!

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,320
Let's keep on with the class.

58
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,710
So this sentence, in normal order, should be

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,280
"A book is there on the desk."

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,910
Breaking news,

61
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,020
did you know that a girl in No.1 Middle School

62
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,070
committed suicide out of pressure?

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,890
Really?

64
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,600
Absolutely true! My father works in Bureau of Education.

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
He said it's quite a big event last night.

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,210
There were many police cars,

67
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,400
ambulances and fire engines.

68
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,220
Today I went to the city's Bureau of Education,

69
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,760
and had a very important meeting.

70
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,960
I'll now deliver the main idea.

71
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,160
What are you all so busy with?

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,640
Listen to me!

73
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,880
Said it's very important!

74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,590
The meeting mainly discussed the suicide of the girl

75
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,790
from No.1 Middle School.

76
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,360
The Bureau of Education reiterates that

77
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,660
every school should try to avoid

78
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,440
such incident from happening again.

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,200
The officials are very serious about it.

80
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,390
Any idea?

81
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,750
What about, to make use of recent good weather,

82
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,930
- organize an outing? - No.

83
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,540
It's Senior Three.

84
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,070
No outings. All for the exam.

85
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
Then what about...

86
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,920
the physical examination is now soon,

87
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,350
students will go to the hospital,

88
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,270
which shall cost the entire morning,

89
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,160
and it's highly possible that

90
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,860
they can't focus in the following afternoon.

91
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,480
What about we headteachers check the surroundings out?

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,400
To find somewhere for relaxation,

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,130
and have students there together and just have fun.

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,800
This way students get enough relaxation,

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,450
and the Bureau's requirements are completed.

96
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,580
This is a good idea, Director Zhang.

97
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,160
Okay then?

98
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,950
How's your relationship with Li Shu now?

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,200
Just the same.

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,380
I don't even know whether he's available.

101
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
Why not just ask him?

102
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Then why don't you ask your dear Jiang Chen?

103
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,920
My... my situation is different from yours.

104
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,730
He knows that I like him.

105
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,680
But Li Shu doesn't know your feelings.

106
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,180
True enough.

107
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,940
What about...

108
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,340
I give him some hints?

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
I think it would work.

110
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,800
The charming and glittering Lu Yang

111
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,070
becomes a little message dove,

112
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,970
and brings everyone an ultimately good news.

113
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,810
Can the little dove roast itself please?

114
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,240
My mouth is dripping.

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,570
Let's go then.

116
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,170
I don't want that.

117
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,080
Then I'll take it. I want to eat it.

118
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,350
Why you give them all to me?

119
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,520
So what's your ultimately good news?

120
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,150
That's right.

121
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,600
The thing is that,

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,330
we are to have an outing!

123
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,000
In Senior Three?

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,470
That's true!

125
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,910
The school has finally come to realize

126
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,090
the necessity of an outing!

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,480
Where did you know this from?

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,670
I passed the teachers' office

129
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,010
and heard Liu Xinxia saying it.

130
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,040
It seems to result from the incident in No.1 High.

131
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
So in the afternoon after the physical examination,

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
we can all hang out!

133
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,600
Where are we going to?

134
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,820
I didn't hear the exact place.

135
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,620
I still think you are just lying.

136
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,320
No matter where we go, as long as we escape the school,

137
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,720
I am willing to go to the end of the world.

138
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,920
And I will accompany you.

139
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,930
I don't have the money.

140
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,900
Just finish your meal.

141
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,310
Too much bullshit.

142
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
So above is the content of the physical-examination.

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,920
Tomorrow morning the whole class will take a bus together,

144
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
you should eat no breakfast before the physical examination.

145
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,040
Listen to the doctor's instructions in the hospital.

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
Most importantly, don't miss anything on the checklist.

147
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,170
Why are you all so depressed?

148
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,360
The school has agreed

149
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,230
after the examination,

150
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,290
we will go to the Riverside Park nearby,

151
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,760
and have a campfire party in the evening.

152
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,760
Wang Dazhuang, why open your mouth so wide?

153
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,930
Class's dismissed!

154
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,810
Luter's news,

155
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,970
always the front news.

156
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,240
So that I can look into Jiang Chen's eyes

157
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,610
beside the flickering fire.

158
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,780
It's so romantic.

159
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,200
You can make it even more romantic,

160
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,080
by setting off fireworks.

161
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,290
You two stare up,

162
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,600
enjoying the beauty of it.

163
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,270
That's so right.

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,850
I was only talking the talk.

165
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,610
Look into your pocket.

166
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,180
I bet there's no more than ten yuan.

167
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,440
I will figure it out.

168
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Okay, okay.

169
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,680
- I have to go now, bye bye. - Bye.

170
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,710
What's up, bro?

171
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,930
Any trouble for me to fix?

172
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,300
Can... can you lend me some money?

173
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,640
I'll pay you back when I get my pocket money next week.

174
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
This is not lending. Just take it.

175
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,020
Take it.

176
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,880
This will do.

177
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,860
What's it for?

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,380
I want to buy something,

179
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,920
for the campfire party.

180
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,250
Let's go shopping together! I know many places.

181
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,090
Besides, I can get personal discount.

182
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,310
Won't you go for training?

183
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,630
Your things are more important.

184
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,700
Okay then.

185
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,570
Bye.

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,630
Hello.

187
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,060
I want a ticket for "Hannibal Rising."

188
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,160
Okay. Please choose your seat.

189
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,420
This please.

190
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,710
Hello.

191
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,800
- Hello. - Hi,

192
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,680
That tall boy, which film did he choose?

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,870
- "Hannibal Rising." - I want a seat next to him.

194
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,270
Next to him... this one?

195
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,520
That's 25 yuan.

196
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
What are you watching?

197
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,430
Why are you here?

198
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,400
To watch movie of course. What are you watching?

199
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,350
I... I... I didn't come for movie.

200
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,010
- I want a ticket next to her. We're together. - OK.

201
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,640
No no... I will not watch.

202
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,310
- Don't buy it. I will not watch! - Two, thanks.

203
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,720
Two for "Hannibal Rising," that's 50.

204
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,710
Thanks.

205
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,240
No... You... you... you... come with me.

206
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,720
Lin Jingxiao, Lu Yang!

207
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,770
Mr Li! You are here also for the movies?

208
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,700
What are you watching?

209
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,380
"Hannibal Rising."

210
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,270
- We too! - Really?

211
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,260
No, no. Sir, I'm just passing. I'm not watching.

212
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,990
I've bought the tickets. They are expensive.

213
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,130
Just watch it. Keep me company.

214
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,120
Let's go.

215
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,030
Sir, our seats are in a row.

216
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,430
Yeah I know. Sit down quickly. Don't affect others.

217
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,710
Take seat. Take seat.

218
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,110
Jingjing, this is our first movie.

219
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,800
I assume it must be very interesting.

220
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,000
This is more comfortable.

221
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,940
Calm down. Calm down!

222
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
Why are you hitting me?

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Sir?

224
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,160
Sir!

225
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,770
- Do you sell fireworks? - Yes. Which one do you want?

226
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,850
I want the most beautiful and expensive ones.

227
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,020
No, no.

228
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,790
The fifty-yuan kind is alright.

229
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,630
Fifty?

230
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,870
You can find something you like,

231
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,770
and I'll tell you the price.

232
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,110
Sir,

233
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,610
later when she comes to you, whatever she holds,

234
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,650
please tell her it's under 50.

235
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,930
I'll pay you the rest.

236
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,010
As long as you don't cheat me.

237
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,720
I know which school you're from.

238
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,690
Sir, how much is this?

239
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,720
That's a hun...

240
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,790
... ten bucks.

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240
Ten bucks.

242
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,680
Chenxi High School.

243
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,840
What... what about this one?

244
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,910
- This one? - That's twenty.

245
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,660
This one?

246
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,810
That's thirty.

247
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,050
Then I'll buy these two.

248
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,510
Okay, I'll go fetch you these two.

249
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
I'll go get it.

250
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,300
Your babies.

251
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,240
Sir, you guys don't earn much?

252
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah, we do earn little.

253
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,970
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

254
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Take note, I know where to find you.

255
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,560
Let me buy you some more sparkle sticks.

256
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,920
How much altogether?

257
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,460
Two hundred and ten.

258
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,530
I'll take one more box of sparkle sticks. How much altogether?

259
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,300
Take it as a gift, then.

260
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,800
Thank you, sir.

261
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,880
See, he gave it to me as a present!

262
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,530
Personal discount!

263
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,580
So good to be a national champion.

264
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,730
Hello? What's wrong?

265
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,320
Where are you?

266
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,480
Mr. Xie from the national team has arrived!

267
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,470
This soon?

268
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,320
He will only stay for two days!

269
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,520
Many kids are waiting to see him.

270
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,060
Where are you? I'll come at once.

271
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,200
Yangkou Town's fireworks shop.

272
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,600
Xiaoxi, there's an emergency.

273
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,360
I have to go first. I can't send you back.

274
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,890
That's fine. Suit yourself.

275
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,090
Such a heavy box. Can you carry it back?

276
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,410
That's fine. I have some cash.

277
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,720
I'll get a taxi.

278
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,840
Will you hang out with us tomorrow?

279
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,970
Of course. I'll help you set off the fireworks.

280
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,320
Okay.

281
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,600
I'll go first.

282
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,520
Can we finish it today?

283
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,760
We have the physical examination tomorrow.

284
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,990
Hard to say. It's depend on them.

285
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,390
Physical examination is no problem at all.

286
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,230
I can tell them to spare another time for you.

287
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,480
Bosong, are you nervous to meet the national team's head coach?

288
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,600
- No. - That's right.

289
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,910
Just swim as usual.

290
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,890
Your ability is known to them. They are quite satisfied.

291
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,120
- I have the confidence. - Good.

292
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,500
What are you doing?

293
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,120
What is this?

294
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,160
Nothing.

295
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,400
What on earth are you doing?

296
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,170
Counting the wires.

297
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,680
Can't I?

298
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,440
Of course you can.

299
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,120
I thought the bulb in your house has went down,

300
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,130
and you are fixing it.

301
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,060
I'm insane.

302
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,280
Please be a day of fine weather.

303
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,120
Please please don't rain.

304
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,400
There's no rain!

305
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,230
She's so early today.

306
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,400
Jiang Chen, this is Li Wei.

307
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,530
Li Wei?

308
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,780
Chen Xiaoxi, I'll wait for you on the bus. Be quick.

309
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,940
Jiang Chen, can I sit beside you?

310
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,920
I can help you pour acid on her.

311
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,530
Never mind. I've got something more romantic.

312
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,810
The box you were carrying, was it full of fireworks?

313
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,540
Yes, it's very heavy.

314
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,240
Where did you get the money?

315
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,160
Wu Bosong lent me.

316
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,280
On your feet. Beside Jingjing is always my seat.

317
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,480
Get ready.

318
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,010
He's got something.

319
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,820
Even though he jumps rather slowly,

320
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,600
he has the ability to catch up and surpass later.

321
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,840
- Is the name Wu Bosong? - Yes!

322
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,980
Not bad!

323
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,970
So many champions for so young a boy.

324
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,510
Lack some stability though, losing some minor contests.

325
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,120
He's still in school. Things may be delayed.

326
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,840
=Qianjiang Hospital

327
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:23,850
You five come in.

328
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,610
=Male Surgery Department
You five come in.

329
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:25,640
=Male Surgery Department

330
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,440
Take off your clothes and pants.

331
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,710
Come and take your chest measure here.

332
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,000
That's 92cm.

333
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,580
Now I'm afraid to take off pants in the public.

334
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,180
That's 82cm.

335
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,350
- What's your name? - Lin Jingxiao.

336
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,330
That's 89cm.

337
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,440
One minute fifty-nine seconds and forty-six.

338
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,490
Quite good, young man.

339
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,950
A new generation is rising.

340
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,400
- Do you want to join the national team? - Yes!

341
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,120
Good. Then you're on my list.

342
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,920
But, there's one more condition.

343
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,490
It depends on your confidence.

344
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,960
I sure have it!

345
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,420
Very ambitious.

346
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,040
I have told Coach Wu already,

347
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,380
that there will be a national championship next year.

348
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,950
If you win the prize, you'll be part of the national team.

349
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,760
OK! I can do that.

350
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,820
- Mr. Xie, he is absolutely competent. - Yeah, not bad.

351
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,560
=To Chen Xiaoxi, I may probably join the national team!

352
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,630
Dad, I have to go to the school now.

353
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,720
- Okay. - Thank you, coach.

354
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,490
See you.

355
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,920
My family is calling for me.

356
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,530
I have to leave early. Can you take my shift after this?

357
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,440
What do they want? Did they arrange you another date?

358
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,600
Stop being ironic.

359
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,120
Please get in.

360
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,660
Your heart rate reaches 134. Did you run?

361
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,340
=Heart rate: 134

362
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Where to?

363
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,990
- Riverside Park. - It's quite a long way.

364
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,110
Are you sure you have enough money?

365
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,560
- I'm sure. - Okay.

366
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,110
To the park!

367
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,520
Just so so.

368
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,760
- Don't trouble yourself here then. - I'd like to.

369
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,060
So you dare piss me now?

370
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,560
I promise no more of it!

371
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,840
- Do you apologize? - I apologize!

372
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,930
Take it!

373
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,030
Be quick!

374
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,440
Take it well!

375
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,200
This is too boring!

376
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,200
I prefer going back to all the tests.

377
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Not for me.

378
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,170
I'd rather become a stone in this park.

379
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,350
You mean the stone looking for her lover?

380
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,980
Let's play a game!

381
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,020
- Have you guys ever played Duudle? - Yes! I can draw!

382
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,970
No, but we're going to use body language this time.

383
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,490
I'll just take it as an in.

384
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,180
- Who wants to play? - Me, me!

385
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,200
Me too.

386
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,280
Great! Wang Dazhuang,

387
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,030
come and help us do some writing!

388
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,690
Guys, come here!

389
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,460
Snake.

390
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,440
- How can it be? - It's obviously tiger!

391
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,120
Wait, how did you know the answer?

392
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,360
Guess I've grown too tall. I spotted it, accidentally.

393
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,990
You cheat!

394
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,720
Please gather, students!

395
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Come here, please.

396
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,560
Drop the things on your hand now and listen to me.

397
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,540
The teacher just informed me that

398
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,840
the first group is to prepare the fire and other things,

399
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,780
and the rest three groups are to pick branches.

400
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,730
Take note you should pick the dry ones.

401
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,550
- Now you can get on with it. - Let's go.

402
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,440
Gosh.

403
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,280
You said you were going to talk to Li Shu the other day.

404
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,380
How's it going?

405
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,760
Don't mention it.

406
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,600
Lu Yang jumped out of nowhere and ruined it all.

407
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,090
But you,

408
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,670
you prepared such a scene. What's your plan?

409
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,840
Nothing special.

410
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,140
I just want to create a beautiful memory with Jiang Chen.

411
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,640
Let me tell you something.

412
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,910
You go to him and do the Damsel in Distress,

413
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,490
and make some body touch.

414
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,030
- It's not appropriate. - How so?

415
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,110
Sorry, Jiang Chen.

416
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,760
Take care.

417
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,010
Thank you.

418
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,420
Stop messing around, you two.

419
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,540
Thanks.

420
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,320
Wang Dazhuang!

421
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,540
- Are you too weak to hold a  bottle? - Say it again?

422
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,830
Wang Dazhuang...

423
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,380
weak, weak, weak...

424
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,290
- buy one and get you five! - You noisy sparrow.

425
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,670
Show me what you can do.

426
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,310
I do what I please. All on the ground!

427
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,800
Wang Dazhuang, the teacher asked you to light the fire for us.

428
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,470
- Light it. - Yes, sir.

429
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,120
Since when did you become so tough, Lu Yang?

430
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,880
I have my Jingjing supporting me.

431
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,680
Let me do that.

432
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,720
Help me, then.

433
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,130
Jiang Chen, I...

434
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,120
I can't open this.

435
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,100
Can you help me?

436
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,080
Thank you, Jiang Chen.

437
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,340
Jiang Chen, come and help us!

438
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,550
Don't take too long.

439
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,380
Chen Xiaoxi,

440
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,360
cheers!

441
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,170
- Still not the place? - Come on,

442
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,640
I've already told you when you got on. It's a far place!

443
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,860
This is not a spaceship.

444
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,670
What about I give you three hundred yuan more?

445
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,440
Good deal!

446
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,380
I shall now make a light speed spaceship out of it.

447
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,740
Sit tight, and here we go!

448
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,070
- What is it? - Later I'll ask Jiang Chen to come here.

449
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,020
Can you set the fireworks for me?

450
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,220
I hide them there.

451
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,020
O... Okay. No problem.

452
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,720
Then as soon as we come, you set off the fireworks.

453
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,030
What do you want?

454
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,900
Jiang Chen,

455
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,820
I have something to show you.

456
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,190
Come to the space in front of the forest.

457
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,670
Wait a second.

458
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,380
This, when Chen and Jiang appear,

459
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,670
- set them for me. - Why me?

460
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,080
- We are slaves for their relationship! - Will you do it or not?

461
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,690
I dare not.

462
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,610
Because I don't dare, so I ask for your help.

463
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,770
Okay then.

464
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,440
It's your mission now.

465
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,830
See you soon.

466
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,880
Jiang Chen!

467
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,480
Set it off and I'll just run.

468
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,040
Do your family know?

469
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,560
Jiang Chen...

470
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,600
Jiang Chen...
