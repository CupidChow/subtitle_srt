My dad fell down, and he's in the hospital now.

Dr. Jiang,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,300
I can't believe you came back.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,380
It's been a long time.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,100
Back then, when you dated my daughter Xiaoxi,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,610
I had not have sat down for a chat with you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

14
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,100
I was too young to cherish Xiaoxi back then.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

15
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
Nonsense.

It must be a nightmare.

30
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,820
Jiang Chen, listen to me!

31
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,260
It doesn't matter why you kissed me last night,

32
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,210
but you did exactly.

33
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,380
I must say what you did is so wrong!

34
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,130
You have a girlfriend now.

35
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,130
And your kiss is forcing me to be a bitch.

36
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,850
I don't want to spoil your relationship inexplicably.

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,930
Why... Why do you keep silent?

38
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,850
I'm Dr. Su.

39
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,540
I saw his phone had been ringing for a long time,

40
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,380
and the call was from you, so I...

41
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,620
Why didn't you say anything when you picked up?

42
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,690
Once I picked it up, you just poured out without a break.

43
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,300
There was no time for me.

44
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,930
Well, I'm just gonna hang up.

45
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,970
Okay, fine.

46
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,180

When Dr. Su made the rounds of the wards today,

58
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,838
I forgot to ask her when your dad should be taken out stitches

59
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,650
and discharged from the hospital.

60
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,250
Why don't you go to the outpatient clinic and ask her?

61
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,060
Sure.

62
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,410

Hello.

70
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,220
Aren't you on business now?

71
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,300
I...

72
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
What's going on?

73
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,740
It's a bad day for me.

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,340
Zhuang Dongna is one of my patients.

75
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,690
And she happened to be Jiang Chen's fake girlfriend.

76
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,740
Fake girlfriend?

77
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,300
Jiang Chen would like to know if you have anything for him.

78
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,780
So I told him the best thing to test your love is jealousy.

79
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,090
So...

80
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,940
Here we are now.

81
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
He must be crazy.

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,620
Do you know Jiang Chen has suffered from gastric disease?

83
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,500
It's because he once swallowed sleeping pills for you

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,850
and pumped his stomach.

85
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,220
Just kidding!

86
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,780
You can't get my sense of humor.

87
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,570
Finally get here!

88
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,850
Which one is she trying now?

89
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,300
The first one.

90
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,090
Lu Yang, you must have saved the earth in your previous life!

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,850
I think it's the galaxy that I've been saved.

Chen Xiaoxi.

93
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,500
Come on.

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,570
You should try one.

95
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,650
It's free anyway.

96
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,940
Go, go, go!

97
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,460
Call someone.

98
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,370
Make a phone call!

99
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,090
To whom?

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,900
Either Jiang Chen or Wu Bosong.

101
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,220
They should come and have a look.

102
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,460
Give them some push.

103
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,900
Otherwise being like this, when is the end for them.

104
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,690
Hurry!

I admire you so much!

112

You can do it, too.

113
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,250
The other day, you and Jiang Chen...

114
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,060
Do you think this fits for me?

115
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,370
Just fine.

116
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,410
Don't try to interrupt.

117
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,570
Now that Jiang Chen is back, what's your plan?

118
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,060
What plan could I have?

119
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,500
It's been such a long time.

120
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,180
I'm old enough to not show excessive passion to a cold person.

121
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,410
What about Jiang Chen?

122
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,900
What's his plan?

123
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,410
He kissed...

124
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,060
He found himself a fake girlfriend to see my reaction.

125
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,300
The Zhuang Dongna we saw last time is fake?

126
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,850
No wonder.

127
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,090
Jiang Chen has been used to your kind of plain dishes,

128
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,410
so the splendid feast seems so unusual.

129
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,690
You know I always speak like this.

130
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,300
Here's my suggestion,

131
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,620
you two have got to talk it over.

132
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,010
Chen Xiaoxi.

133
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,300
This is it.

134
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,140
It quite suits you.

135
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,740
Would you please fetch it for her?

136
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,010
OK.

137
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,740
Thank you.

138
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,410
So I'm going to be with Lu Yang.

139
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,010
OK.

140
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,330
I bet on Wu Bosong.

141
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,180
Then you mustn't know that Jiang Chen has asked someone

142
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,940
to be his fake girlfriend for Chen Xiaoxi.

143
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,650
And you mustn't know that Wu Bosong is gonna propose.

144
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,620
Really?

145
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,060
You can guess.

146
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,210
What're you doing here?

147
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,210
Are you wearing this to make me propose for you?

148
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,850
Piss off. OK?

149
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,500
OK.

150
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,090
How expensive is the wedding dress nowadays!

151
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,330
What the hell?

152
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,180
Take it away!

153
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,060
Calm down. It's my new pet.

154
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,580
Take it away!

155
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,620
Just look at it. It's so cute!

156
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,060
No way!

157
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,010
Just look.

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,330
It's kind of, cute...

159
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,180
I call it Xiaoxi, "xi" from "lizard" in Chinese pronunciation.

160
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,820
Xiaoli, say hello to Xiaoxi.

161
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
Why do you want a lizard so tiny?

162
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,970
It's not manly at all.

163
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,140
I just like it tiny.

164
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,620
Come on, take it.

165
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,580
Put it in the box.

166
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,820
Xiaoli, let's get off.

167
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,770
Where are we going?

168
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,380
The hospital.

169
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,090
Dr. Jiang.

170
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,300
The patient of Bed 8 has no reactions.

171
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,650
Shall we continue changing the dressing?

172
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,210
What's the number of EF?

173
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,010
And the pulmonary hypertension?

174
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,060
Let's observe for a while.

175
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Otherwise we'll seek for medication.

176
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,140
Dr. Jiang, you mean the man of Bed 3?

177
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,620
And you signed Chen Xiaoxi on your outpatient clinic form again.

178
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,770
Who is she?

179
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,850
Let's go and check the patient of Bed 8.

180
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,090
You've been eating already?

181
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,820
Yes.

182
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,300
Jiang Chen has asked someone to deliver these to us.

183
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,140
So delicious!

184
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,410
Now that you've bought some food, why not take it to Jiang Chen?

185
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,410
You two can eat together.

186
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,500
What are you talking about?

187
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,180
Have you not heard from the nurses?

188
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,300
Jiang Chen is on duty today.

189
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,890
When he is on duty, there's no time for him to eat the whole day.

190
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,890
We often say that it's not easy to be a doctor.

191
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,500
They may suffer from gastric perforation nine out of ten.

192
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,850
It's a bit exaggerated.

193
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,580
The operation room is just here.

194
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,380
It's so convenient to take them in to sew and mend.

195
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,890
Do you think they're just clothes? Really?

196
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,180
Come in.

197
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,890
I have bought too much, so my mom asked me to give you some.

198
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,850
Thanks.

199
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,330
What are you laughing about?

200
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,060
It seems that you've never changed a bit.

201
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,010
I don't know why you are being so awkward.

202
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,260
You've always been doing this,

203
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,650
making others to guess what's exactly on your mind.

204
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,620
Your kiss last night, and your playacting with Zhuang Dongna.

205
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,530
I just don't care at all.

206
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,260
Because I have absolutely no intention to guess your mind.

207
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,820
It was you who decided to break up 3 years ago, right?

208
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,410
The reason was that you thought I would abandon you

209
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,180
to take the training class in Beijing, right?

210
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,330
Yes.

211
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,450
And no.

212
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,010
I might want to be a little petulant.

213
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,820
Then I waited for you to come back.

214
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,850
But you didn't.

215
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,450
Anyway, now it doesn't matter at all.

216
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,890
My first patient passed away

217
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,500
during the operation on the same day you broke up with me.

218
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,740
On that day,

219
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,820
I was looking for a place to move in,

220
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,180
and was almost insulted by the realtor.

221
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,620
I went to the hospital to see you,

222
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
only to know that you would go to Beijing.

223
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,010
Actually, I wasn't going to Beijing in the first place.

224
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,580
I regretted after a few days.

225
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,060
So I took a flight back,

226
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,090
only to see that you were hugging Wu Bosong at the airport.

227
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,140
So you thought that I'd like to be with Wu Bosong

228
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,970
as soon as you left?

229
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,300
I didn't mean that.

230
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,650
I mean...

231
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,330
It's okay.

232
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,410
He and I are more or less a couple now.

233
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,300
Don't fool me around with that nonsense...

234
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,300
Hello.

235
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,260
Dr. Jiang, hurry up to the emergency room!

236
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,380
OK, be right there.

237
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,700
Emergency call.

238
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,210
Wait for me right here.

239
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,940
Cerebral concussion?

240
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
Internal bleeding?

241
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,580
Jiang Chen, Jiang Chen!

242
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,850
Come out!

243
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,890
It's Chen Xiaoxi!

244
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,770
Do you know this is a hospital?

245
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,700
Would you please get Jiang Chen for me?

246
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,890
Dr. Jiang has gone for the rounds of the wards.

247
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,450
Chen Xiaoxi!

248
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,620
What happened to you?

249
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,890
I fell down...

250
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,820
And bumped my head.

251
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,010
It hurts!

252
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,820
Here's a bump.

253
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
As big as a quail's egg.

254
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,450
It feels like harder than a shelled and boiled egg.

255
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,450
What else hurts?

256
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't move your head.

257
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,210
I would have let you in and sit here

258
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,700
if I knew you were Dr. Jiang's friend.

259
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,260
I'll go and fetch the medicine.

260
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,940
What's your relationship with Dr. Jiang?

261
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,010
Let me.

262
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,180
Turn around and turn your back to me.

263
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,970
My God! Careful!

264
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,010
It seemed like you nearly stuck my brains out!

265
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,330
Dr. Jiang, why not let me do it?

266
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,970
It's okay.

267
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,380
Be still.

268
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,530
Well, Dr. Jiang.

269
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,940
I'll leave it to you and make the rounds.

270
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,490
Be still.

271
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,060
Xiaoxi, you have left your bridesmaid dress in my car.

272
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,730
I'll take it to your office tomorrow.

273
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,010
Chen Xiaoxi.

274
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,460
Let's make it up.

275
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,460
Make it up?

276
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,860
And the last 3 years seem to be just a long fight in your eyes?

277
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,770
Have you been with Wu Bosong now?

278
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,490
It's none of your business.

279
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,610
Chen Xiaoxi.

280
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,890
We'll make it up.

281
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,700
No, we won't.

282
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,130
Now lie down and close your eyes.

283
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,410
See if you're dizzy or not.

284
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,460
What are you doing?

285
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,980
You shouldn't be emotional if you have cerebral concussion.

286
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,770
Lie down and rest for a while.

287
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,820
Don't moan like that, OK?

288
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,580
It's not like we are performing colonoscopy on you.

289
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,860
It hurts a lot!

290
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,980
Dr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

291
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,610
I couldn't find Dr. Li, so I have to bother you.

292
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,370
Jiang Chen...

293
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,340
What are you doing out?

294
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,650
Go inside.

295
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,370
Are you a moron? What are you looking at?

296
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,010
My God!

297
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,580
It hurts!

298
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,890
Watch your mouth.

299
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,890
I see, doctor.

300
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,010
Are you still dizzy now?

301
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,530
No, I'm not.

302
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm going home now.

303
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,980
Let me drive you home.

304
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,180
No, thanks.

305
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,250
Doctor, she must be your girlfriend.

306
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,250
Nice!

307
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,130
She looks quite lovely.

308
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,940
Doctor, easy!

309
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,820
I think the cartoon character you are drawing could be more sexy.

310
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,730
Remember, boss, I'm drawing a cartoon character

311
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,100
for an language-study machine now.

312
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
Conservative.

313
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,650
You are being conservative!

314
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,890
The girl who uses the machine could be sexy and pretty.

315
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,730
Well, well, well.

316
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,650
You draw one, come on.

317
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,770
How did you speak to your boss like that?

318
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,890
Boss, the salary of last month...

319
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,700
Miss Chen, what I meant is to let you draw whatever you like.

320
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,180
I meant nothing else.

321
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,010
Here comes the superstar!

322
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
It's takeout.

323
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,940
Let's have dinner after work.

324
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,980
No, I can't make it.

325
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,250
I have to pick up my dad for his discharging from the hospital.

326
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,580
He has been crying for home everyday.

327
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,370
Then I can go with you.

328
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,490
Do you have so much time to spare?

329
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,580
Yes, quite a lot.

330
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,700
Have you had your cap and sunglasses with you?

331
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,300
Sure.

332
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,060
OK, then.

333
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,300
Now I can save the money for the taxi.

334
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,180
Anyway, I haven't received my salary this month.

335
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,130
Let's go!

336
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,770
What time is it now?

337
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,530
Tell Xiaoxi to hurry up, or we won't catch the bus.

338
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,300
Jiang Chen, it's you!

339
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,010
Come here and sit down, please.

340
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,460
Come.

341
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,220
Mr. and Mrs. Chen, the discharge forms are completed.

342
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,770
OK.

343
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,460
Your medicine is ready to be taken away,

344
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,060
and you can pick it up at the payment office later.

345
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,460
Thank you.

346
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,560
- It's okay. - Mom, dad.

347
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,770
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Chen.

348
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,820
Hello to you, too!

349
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,860
Well, hello.

350
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,340
Mrs. Chen, I got to go if there's nothing wrong.

351
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Take care on your way home.

352
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,730
Right, see you then.

353
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,580
See you.

354
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,300
What now?

355
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,730
Your hair is a little messy.

356
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,130
Careful.

357
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,650
Let me take it.

358
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,410
Thanks a lot!

359
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,180
Be careful!

360
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,180
Careful.

361
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,580
Sorry to bother you.

362
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,130
Mrs. Chen, it's my pleasure!

363
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,820
I'll come to visit you later.

364
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,530
No need to bother.

365
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,700
Xiaoxi, we got to go.

366
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,980
And you'd better go home now.

367
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,610
Don't just hang around.

368
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,220
I know. You take care of yourselves.

369
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,370
Let's go.

370
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,980
"No need to bother." What did she mean?

371
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,490
Chen Xiaoxi.

372
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,650
I don't think your mom likes me.

373
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,730
She's just like that.

374
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,650
She saw your advertisement on TV

375
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,060
and said you were always rubbing oil on girls.

376
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,060
I was not!

377
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,650
There are other advertisements where I'm not always rubbing oil.

378
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,610
You mean the beer advertisement where you and a bikini girl

379
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,770
feed each other with cherries in a beer pool or that...

380
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,340
Where do you want to have dinner?

381
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,820
Wherever.

382
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,820
Right, Lu Yang has asked you to fetch his wedding rings.

383
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,250
We can have dinner nearby after that.

384
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,650
There's a lot of good choice around there.

385
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,010
I-I have something to do now and couldn't have dinner with you.

386
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,060
I'm going to turn down the new ad of the rubbing oil company.

387

=The Lus and their sidekicks

388
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,700
Chen Xiaoxi, are you back now?

389
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,770
How stupid you are!

390
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,580
You just left the bouquet at your office?

391
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,980
OK, I know.

392
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,860
I'm already at my office.

393
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,100
Don't try to fool me around.

394
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,490
Are you really at your office?

395
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,740
=Location

396
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,300
Well, hurry up back if you pick up the bouquet.

397
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,770
What else are you waiting for?

398
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,730
I think you just want to spoil my wedding.

399
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,610
Lu Yang, it's just your persecutory delusion!

400
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,770
My office is closed and I don't have the key.

401
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,180
I have asked Fu Pei to send me the key.

402
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,610
Don't worry.

403
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,610
I'll come to pick you up.

404
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,220
=Zhongrui Building

405
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,340
Want to see a magic trick?

406
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,940
No!

407
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,060
Then how about a song by me?

408
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,650
No!

409
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,300
Nothing is what you want. Who are you, Jiang Chen?

410
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,770
Well, I want to ask you a significant question.

411
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,180
What question?

412
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:05,770
Between Jiang Chen and I, who do you think is more handsome?

413
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,180
You.

414
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,820
Good taste!

415
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,730
Please find your own seat have a seat in the front.

416
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,410
OK.

417
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,300
Xiaoxi!

418
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,820
Liao Chenxuan! Wang Songsong!

419
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,650
It must be your second pregnancy!

420
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,530
It's so painstaking when pregnant.

421
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,490
Well, go inside and have a seat.

422
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,590
- OK. - Let's go.

423
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,860
It's been a long time.

424
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,940
It's been a long time.

425
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,610
You didn't come to the reunion party last time.

426
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,220
Are you going to live in America in the future?

427
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,770
Yes, I'm leaving again soon.

428
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,820
Then thanks to Jingjing's wedding,

429
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,860
otherwise they don't know when to see you again.

430
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,820
Right.

431
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,410
How happy they are!

432
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,300
Yes.

433
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,220
I'm so jealous of them.

434
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,770
What are you jealous of?

435
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,250
You and Jiang Chen should catch up!

436
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,180
Actually, Jiang Chen and I have already...

437
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,490
Now look back and we were so awkward.

438
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,700
You remember the campfire party in our senior year?

439
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,410
Jiang Chen, can you keep the secret that

440
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,300
I have suffered from depression?

441
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,730
And your family haven't known?

442
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,250
I don't dare to tell my mom.

443
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,130
I'm afraid she will consider me incompetent if she knows.

444
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,250
But I really have no idea whom to tell.

445
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,490
Back then, I really liked him a lot.

446
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,650
Jiang Chen.

447
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,580
I like you.

448
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,130
I like Chen Xiaoxi.

449
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:05,530
However, I didn't realize that he was so into you.

450
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,940
Remember to not send me the invitation

451
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,340
if you and Jiang Chen are going to be married.

452
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,770
It would really upset me.

453
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,770
Jiang Chen and I are not made for each other.

454
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,860
We actually broke up long before.

455
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,010
Gso inside and have a seat.

456
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,980
Please welcome our bride and bridegroom to the middle of the stage.

457
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,656
Now, bride and bridegroom,

458
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:34,220
please step on the stairs that stand for your love.

459
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,890
Now the bride may say the wedding vows.

460
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,250
Lu Yang.

461
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,220
Yes!

462
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,250
You, have sent love letters to all the girls in our school.

463
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,340
No, I haven't.

464
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,300
I have never sent one to you.

465
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,730
But you once gave me a star as a present.

466
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,460
And you gave me a scarf.

467
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,410
Don't try to interrupt.

468
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,530
It wasn't for you at first.

469
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,180
You...

470
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,460
You have dyed your hair for me.

471
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,154
You have been with me

472
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,860
when I gave a speech after hoisting the national flag.

473
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,820
You are always fun-loving and annoying

474
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,370
and often fail to do things you have promised to me.

475
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,650
Now at this point, just don't blame me.

476
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,730
Do you remember the story of Rosetta and Philae that I told you?

477
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:41,370
Long ago in 2004, the spaceship named Rosetta was launched in Europe.

478
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,460
It took Philae to the space.

479
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,980
Then Philae landed, but lost contact with Rosetta forever.

480
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:56,490
They have just been waiting for each other in the vast universe.

481
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,730
Are you just reciting?

482
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,340
I have learned to recite it since the high school

483
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,650
and been waiting for you to ask.

484
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,650
You know what?

485
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,610
Finally, Rosetta found Philae.

486
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,580
And I found you, Lu Yang.

487
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,370
Lu Yang.

488
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,770
Thank you.

489
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,770
Lin Jingxiao.

490
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,860
It's really okay.

491
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,940
Lin Jingxiao.

492
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,770
I... love you.

493
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,730
Now you may exchange your rings.

494
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,010
Hey, bro, where are the rings?

495
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,340
Have they been with me?

496
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,700
Just find them!

497
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,770
What's wrong?

498
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,250
Found them!

499
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,250
Well, everybody.

500
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,180
Well, look at me!

501
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,460
Today is my day.

502
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,250
It seems that our bridegroom can't wait for too long.

503
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,580
Then, bride and bridegroom, you may exchange your rings.

504
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:44,130
Now, bridegroom, you may kiss your beautiful wife.

505
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,340
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

506
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,770
Next, the happy bride will pass her happiness

507
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,860
to every single lady here.

508
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,770
Whoever gets the bouquet of happiness will be the next happy bride.

509
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,450
It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!

510
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Now, let's count down from 3.

511
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,010
3! 2! 1!

512
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,420
Congratulations to the beautiful bridesmaid!
