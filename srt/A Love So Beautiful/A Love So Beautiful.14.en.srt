00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,560
Li Wei and him played the Piano Duet on the stage,

The speech under the Flag

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,590
Morning!

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,280
How's your hand?

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,750
All good.

45
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,800
And the knee?

46
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,110
It's okay now, the swelling has gone down.

47
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,360
Jiang Chen,

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,000
I need to talk with you.

49
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,640
What are you doing here so early today?

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,230
Didn't want to ride the bike,

51
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,470
so I came here by bus.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,830
I'm gonna fetch water.

53
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,990
Thinking about life?

54
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,590
Don't you have training today?

55
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,030
What're you guys doing here?

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,560
Hey, love birds,

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,800
meeting in the corridor, aren't we?

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,550
Your condition has been improved lately,

59
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,200
your physical state is basically adjusted.

60
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,710
What's the matter?

61
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,920
Anything else?

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,030
My sleep quality is getting worse,

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,680
Dr Li,

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,150
could you prescribe more diazepams for me?

65
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,990
No, I couldn't.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,550
The dosage of diazepam should be strictly controlled

67
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,840
and the dosage I'm giving you every week is enough.

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,590
But I can't sleep.

69
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,030
Don't you worry,

70
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,030
insomnia is a problem that can be adjusted,

71
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,920
do some exercise during the day,

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,550
have a glass of milk at night,

73
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,430
listen to the light music.

74
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,240
Dr Li,

75
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,870
you really couldn't provide me with more diazepam?

76
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,960
No can do.

77
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,590
Your belly hurts again?

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Not really,

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,310
I'm having a sore throat.

80
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,750
Get your mind off meds,

81
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,680
go back and put this in the water and drink the solution,

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,080
and have a good rest.

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,430
Thanks, Dr Li.

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,240
Sure thing.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,960
What's in your hand?

86
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,590
I'm not telling you.

87
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,960
I saw it.

88
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
Could you just give me one of those?

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm not feeling well.

90
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,430
Go and buy your own meds if you are not well,

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,680
why are you trying to take mine?

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
I won't give it to you.

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm dead.

94
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,640
Rest in peace then.

95
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,310
Full blood resurrection,

96
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,360
but my heart hurts,

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,080
because my good friend doesn't care about me at all.

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,470
I am a tough man, even though I have a heart problem,

99
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,710
but I tell no one about my suffering,

100
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,640
as I only want to ask my deskmate

101
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,550
for a vitamin C tablet

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
if she could give me one...

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,520
Shut up,

104
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,200
you're so annoying!

105
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,080
Just stop it.

106
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,520
Dawdler,

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,680
just one tablet, all right?

108
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,590
What a waste.

109
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,030
Do you want me to fetch water for you by the way?

110
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,870
No, thanks.

111
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,360
Master Lu can't watch this anymore.

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
Chen Xiaoxi,

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,200
would you accompany to the library at noon?

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,240
What for?

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,430
To...

116
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,990
borrow books.

117
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,400
No, I don't want to. You can go there yourself if you like.

118
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,430
I will break off with you if you don't go!

119
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,120
Fine!

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,520
Chen Xiaoxi, I'm gonna...

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,750
I'm gonna take a vitamin C tablet.

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,360
Give it to me.

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,360
What did you do?

124
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,590
Why is she nagging all the time?

125
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,840
What's wrong?

126
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Why on the earth are you bringing me here?

127
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,550
Sit here.

128
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,200
Sit.

129
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Well...

130
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,750
you stay here and solve the math problems,

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,240
and I'm gonna borrow books.

132
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,200
Bye!

133
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,750
Why do I have to come here to do the math?

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,240
Why are you so absent-minded?

135
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,270
Sit.

136
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,910
Let me solve the problem for you.

137
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,790
Because 0 is less than X, and X is less than or equal to 1,

138
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,350
and 1 is less than half of the Pi,

139
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,910
therefore, 3X over X is

140
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,640
greater than the square of its own.

141
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,480
Let's try and solve it yourself.

142
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,990
Jiang Chen,

143
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,600
the things about Li Wei,

144
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,550
I won't ask any questions anymore

145
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,750
if you don't want to tell me,

146
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,640
but could you stop hanging out with her?

147
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,280
Let's go, I'm gonna take you someplace.

148
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,990
We still have a self-study class.

149
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,910
Skip it.

150
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,400
Why are you buying so many snacks? Go outing?

151
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,400
You need to buy stuff if you're in a bad mood.

152
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,160
Are you in a bad mood?

153
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,720
Well, it's me in a bad mood.

154
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,080
78 yuan.

155
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
That's okay, let me pay.

156
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,400
Xiaoxi,

157
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,550
it is very immature to vent your feelings with shopping spree.

158
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,230
I'm looking for Li Shu.

159
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,520
And I find my Dr. Li.

160
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,310
Give him the seed.

161
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,110
Then we'll be together.

162
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,520
Have you gone to the library?

163
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,840
Have you made your peace with Xiaoxi?

164
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,110
Then I'm running out of ideas

165
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,430
literally.

166
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,480
=For love

167
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,500
What is this?
=For love

168
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,480
What is this?

169
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,670
Canned plant,

170
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,200
it'll sprout if you plant it.

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,790
See, there're words on the leaves.

172
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,310
Lots of students are buying it.

173
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,870
It could be used for declaration of love?

174
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,960
Of course.

175
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,550
I'd like to take one.

176
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,310
Our little seed of love.

177
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,080
Please take a good care of it.

178
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,350
No, Jingjing.

179
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,110
You should let the man say it.

180
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,430
Please, little seed.

181
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,480
Li Shu.

182
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,350
Are you out of your mind, Lu Yang?

183
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,040
That's right,

184
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
I am!

185
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
Go.

186
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,670
Lu Yang.

187
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,910
You all know that Lin Jingxiao likes Li Shu, don't you?

188
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,910
You just watch me following her around everyday,

189
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,430
is it funny to watch me make a fool of myself?

190
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,200
Lu Yang, calm down.

191
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,990
How could you know how I feel?

192
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,990
You're always cool as a cucumber.

193
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,870
Were you waiting long, bro?

194
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,790
Come on!

195
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,720
I wasn't waiting...

196
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,840
Let's go home!

197
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,350
Let's go!

198
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,310
Have you made your peace with Jiang Chen?

199
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,270
What about you and Lu Yang?

200
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,790
Don't even get me started on Lu Yang,

201
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,030
I'm so angry about him.

202
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,150
Li Wei!

203
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,080
Li Wei, don't move!

204
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,030
Li Wei...

205
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,270
you stay there, don't move, don't move!

206
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,760
Li Wei, get down!

207
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,480
What's wrong?

208
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,760
Mrs. Liu...

209
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,550
What's going on?

210
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,600
Li Wei,

211
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,390
Don't move!

212
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,880
Li Wei, don't move, I'm coming up for you!

213
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,960
Qiao Lu!

214
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,360
Calm her down.

215
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,910
Be careful.

216
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,200
Li Wei!

217
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,630
Jiang Chen.

218
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,430
Li Wei!

219
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,910
Dr. Li.

220
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,840
Don't move,

221
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,960
calm down,

222
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,030
and think about something that makes you happy.

223
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
You think...

224
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm gonna kill myself, aren't you?

225
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,080
No, we didn't.

226
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,790
It's just, I never been here before

227
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,000
never thought...

228
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,150
the scenery is so beautiful.

229
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,840
Li Wei, don't move...

230
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,150
I really didn't...

231
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,630
What's wrong with Li Wei?

232
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,910
Has Jiang Chen dumped her?

233
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,760
Jiang Chen is so worried.

234
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,550
He hasn't been back yet.

235
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Li Wei's acting weird lately,

236
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,120
I saw her went to Li Shu's office the other day.

237
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,510
Guys,

238
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,480
Li Wei's mom is here,

239
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,360
she is quarreling with Liu Xinxia now.

240
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,910
What's wrong with your school?

241
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,600
How could you provide this kind of meds to kids?

242
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,910
I will sue you

243
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,790
if anything happens to Li Wei.

244
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,630
Mom...

245
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,510
Shut your mouth,

246
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,000
you are such a disgrace.

247
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Weren't you all right in junior high school?

248
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,790
Yet you never come top in the exam in high school, not even once!

249
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,790
And you cheated in exam!

250
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,200
You really deserve that!

251
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Calm down, please.

252
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,360
Calm down.

253
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,390
Calm down?

254
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,630
How am I supposed to calm down?

255
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,880
My kid is okay at home,

256
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
how come she gets depressed when she comes to your school?

257
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,150
And you give her this kind of meds!

258
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,430
People die because of it!

259
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,720
Well,

260
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,550
Ms. Li

261
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,910
please calm down,

262
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,390
I'm Director of Academic Affairs,

263
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,600
you can rest assured,

264
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,790
this matter is definitely gonna be investigated and clarified.

265
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,150
And I will give you an explanation.

266
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,000
Li Wei,

267
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,480
let's talk.

268
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,790
I don't know.

269
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,550
You don't know?

270
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,760
Fine,

271
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,630
I'm calling the cop,

272
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,790
and let them to investigate this matter.

273
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,960
Mom, mom...

274
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,960
It was Dr. Li who prescribed diazepam for me.

275
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,840
He said,

276
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,120
it won't hurt so much if I just take a few.

277
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,200
Okay,

278
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,630
you can rest assured,

279
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,480
I will give you a satisfactory answer.

280
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,240
Li Shu,

281
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
you'd better get on the ball if you want to keep this job,

282
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,790
otherwise, you can just get the hell out of here!

283
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,360
Stop creating troubles for school!

284
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,480
Go back to your class.

285
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,310
Over there.

286
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,360
Li Shu didn't give you the diazepam, didn't he?

287
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,550
You stole it, didn't you?

288
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,790
You need to go and tell Zhang Shiliang the truth.

289
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,270
Say something,

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
say something!

291
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,630
Fine,

292
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm gonna tell him if you don't.

293
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,000
No!

294
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,360
Let go, let go of me!

295
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
Hand me the meds.

296
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,910
19,

297
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,840
20,

298
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,600
21,

299
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,510
22.

300
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,550
There're 22 pills in the bottle.

301
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,550
The list says 30 pills.

302
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,670
The evidence is certain, is there anything you want to explain?

303
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,550
Why aren't you telling the truth?

304
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,430
It wasn't you!

305
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,120
Go back to your class.

306
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,360
I saw it,

307
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,760
It was Li Wei who stole the diazepam,

308
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,310
it has nothing to do with you!

309
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,240
Stop it,

310
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,430
and go back to your class.

311
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,550
I'm not leaving if you don't tell me why.

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,760
Fine,

313
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,430
you just saw Li Wei's state of mind, didn't you?

314
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,080
She can no longer take any pressure.

315
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,790
You're classmates,

316
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,790
and it's a very difficult time for her,

317
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,720
help her if you can,

318
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,150
but you can't give her any pressure.

319
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,670
There's more,

320
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,030
try to persuade her if you can,

321
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,880
tell her that she needs to go to a real psychology clinic.

322
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,550
In this class, we're going to talk about reducing agent.

323
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,760
During the redox reaction,

324
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,310
the reducing agent will be oxidized.

325
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,510
That's why someone said that

326
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,880
the reducing agent is so great,

327
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,910
it can offer you as many electrons as it wants,

328
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,240
as long as you stay with it stably.

329
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,200
Look at this formula on the blackboard,

330
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,430
and keep it in mind.

331
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,840
Director, take a look,

332
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,150
there're so many mistakes in the standard answer.

333
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,840
How could this happen?

334
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,910
Mrs. Liu,

335
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,430
I'm the one who stole the meds,

336
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,080
Dr. Li has nothing to do with it.

337
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,550
What on earth are you talking about?

338
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,030
Hurry up,

339
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,790
go back to your class.

340
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm talking about the truth,

341
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,760
it was me.

342
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,240
I saw Li Wei didn't feel good,

343
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,080
so I took the meds for her,

344
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,390
it's just...

345
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,120
I didn't know it could be so serious.

346
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,600
You didn't know?

347
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,390
So you just go there and stole the meds for her?

348
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,480
That's medicine,

349
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
not some other stuff!

350
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,720
She's just a kid,

351
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
she was trying to help

352
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,430
Fine, fine,

353
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,430
stop protecting her!

354
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,310
I'm sorry.

355
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,670
Lin Jingxiao of your class

356
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,120
stole medicine from the infirmary,

357
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
the school decide to

358
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,310
give her a major demerit record,

359
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,630
moreover,

360
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,030
tell your parents to come to school!

361
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,550
People could die because of it, do you even know?

362
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,390
What's going on?

363
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm asking you a question!

364
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,240
What's going on?

365
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,150
It was me.

366
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,150
You? Do you even know what diazepam looks like?

367
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,200
It's on the bottle.

368
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,240
Lin Jingxiao,

369
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,550
what's going on?

370
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,200
I said it was me.

371
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
It's okay.

372
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,240
I don't know...

373
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,000
how I am supposed to tell my mom?

374
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,630
I'm coming with you.

375
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm coming with you.

376
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,480
No.

377
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,200
All your dishes are served.

378
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,480
Jingjing,

379
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,840
what are you doing here?

380
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,480
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

381
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,630
Mom.

382
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,510
What's wrong?

383
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,960
You look unwell.

384
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,480
Got bullied in school?

385
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,120
Or not feeling well?

386
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,310
Running out of money?

387
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,270
Mrs. Zhang,

388
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,880
what are you doing?

389
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,960
The kitchen needs help,

390
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,390
quit talking!

391
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,030
I'm sorry,

392
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,960
just two more words,

393
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,240
back in a minute.

394
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,360
Jingjing,

395
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,910
tell me what's going on?

396
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,880
Jingjing...

397
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm alright,

398
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,630
I'm just hungry,

399
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,120
I want to eat dumplings.

400
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,720
Just afraid you're too busy to make dumplings.

401
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,630
You scared the hell of me!

402
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,600
You want to eat dumpling,

403
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,080
then I will make dumplings tonight.

404
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,360
I want dumplings with pork and Chinese chives.

405
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,480
Fine,

406
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,390
go back to school now, don't be late.

407
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,120
I am gonna go back to work.

408
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,360
Stop shoving! The bus is too crowded to get on!

409
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,670
Such a bad temper.

410
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,430
So...

411
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,760
you knew Li Wei had depression.

412
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,430
Dear passengers,

413
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,520
we are arriving at Langzhen Plaza.

414
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,950
Please get ready

415
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,070
to get off from the back door

416
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,520
and take all of your belongings with you.

417
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,070
There is still room,

418
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,520
get on the bus,

419
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,310
and go home early after work.

420
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,710
Lu Yang...

421
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Li Shu is back.

422
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,190
It was Lin Jingxiao,

423
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,000
and yet she tried to frame Li Shu.

424
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,470
Stop it.

425
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,400
Lu Yang,

426
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
where are you going?

427
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,230
No, you can't, I forbid you!

428
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,280
What was the line you're always saying?

429
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,520
None of your business!

430
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,350
Lu Yang!

431
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,590
Lu Yang!

432
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,230
Lu Yang!

433
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,760
What do we do?

434
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,800
Let's go to the infirmary.

435
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,350
Let's go.

436
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,590
Lu Yang!

437
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,760
Lu Yang!

438
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Jiang Chen, go get the oxygen mask!

439
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,920
Give me the cellphone.

440
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,950
Hello,

441
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,190
this is Chenxi High School.

442
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,040
One of our students is having a heart attack and collapsed,

443
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,920
he is 16 years old,

444
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,070
he has congenital heart disease,

445
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,640
no other symptom at the moment.

446
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,590
Yes, how long will it take for you to get here?

447
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,230
Okay, please hurry.

448
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,110
Okay.

449
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,110
What the hell is going on?

450
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,560
Why is he collapsed?

451
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,310
Lu Yang!

452
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,830
Lu Yang!

453
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,560
What happened to Lu Yang?

454
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,400
How is he?

455
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,190
Lu Yang!

456
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,160
No, time is running out,

457
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,190
I have to give him an injection now.

458
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,880
No, you can't,

459
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,430
it's too dangerous.

460
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,560
The school can't take responsibility for this!

461
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,430
Mr. Zhang,

462
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,760
let's listen to Dr. Li, all right?

463
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,710
The point is the time is running out!

464
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,520
Lin Jingxiao,

465
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,560
go get the epinephrine.

466
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,680
Hurry up, it's over there.

467
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,640
No, no, no!

468
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,710
How do we handle this kind of problems?

469
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,110
Are you sure about this?

470
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,760
Wu Bosong,

471
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,110
stop him!

472
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,680
Have you ever came across such situation?

473
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Have you ever handle it before?

474
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,070
You can't just give treatment as you like!

475
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,830
What if you failed?

476
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,920
What's gonna happen next?

477
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,830
Get your hands off me!

478
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,110
You are messing things up!

479
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,760
Keep him away from the bed.

480
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,000
You're never been treated this kind of disease before!

481
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,350
You're merely a school physician!

482
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,640
This is nonsense!

483
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,430
Lu Yang...

484
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,110
Lu Yang...

485
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,830
Lu Yang...

486
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,880
It's okay. It's okay.

487
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,190
It's okay.

488
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,560
It's okay now.

489
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,830
There he is!

490
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,710
Your parents went to go through the formalities for you.

491
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,760
You're okay now,

492
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,350
but you're gonna do a complete physical checkup later.

493
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,680
The doctor said

494
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,920
that you'd better stay in hospital for observation

495
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,000
and get the surgery done early.

496
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,350
Mr. Zhang said

497
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,430
you don't have go to school until College Entrance Examination,

498
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,830
and he has already gone through the formalities for you.

499
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,760
Having a sore throat again?

500
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,230
Do you really need to go?

501
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,590
The formalities has been completed,

502
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,800
I'm no longer your Dr. Li.

503
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,310
Well...

504
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,400
I already told Mr. Zhang

505
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,070
it was me who gave her diazepam,

506
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,280
and it had nothing to do with you.

507
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,830
Mr. Zhang said

508
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,160
you won't get a major demerit,

509
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,680
however,

510
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,230
you still need to make a mea culpa in front of all students.

511
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,470
It's a good thing that you have the intention to help others,

512
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,230
but you must protect yourself

513
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,150
before sympathizing with the weak.

514
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,000
But it is not entirely your fault.

515
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,670
Sometimes the truth isn't necessarily the most important thing,

516
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,390
and don't you forget,

517
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm not just a doctor,

518
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,870
I'm also your teacher,

519
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,840
and it's my duty to protect all of you.

520
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,150
Well,

521
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,430
so where are you going?

522
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,520
Are you still gonna be a doctor?

523
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,080
I'm going to Africa

524
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,390
and join the Doctors Without Borders.

525
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,230
I've always wanted to go there,

526
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,080
but I just couldn't make up my mind.

527
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,670
Well, this incident just gave me a push,

528
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,280
I guess I should be grateful.

529
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,630
And do not always come to the infirmary

530
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,910
if you're okay.

531
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,840
Other teachers won't be tolerant as I do.

532
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,600
All right,

533
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I'm gonna go.

534
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,280
Come on.

535
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,600
Why are you all here?

536
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,740
We come to see you off.

537
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
Don't be so sad.

538
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,040
It's not a big deal.

539
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,000
You'll have a new doctor.

540
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,560
But you're so handsome and gentle,

541
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,760
there would be no school physician like you in school.

542
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,840
Well, that's true.

543
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,120
Where are you going next, Dr. Li?

544
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,910
I'm going to Africa

545
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,320
and join the Doctors Without Borders.

546
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,950
Then I will visit you when I go to Africa for competition.

547
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,000
No, please don't.

548
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,800
They don't even have enough drinking water,

549
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,280
just don't go Africa for swimming.

550
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,520
Guys,

551
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,520
thank you for your continued attention.

552
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,080
Study hard!

553
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,870
Bye!

554
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,280
Bye!

555
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,800
It's time for class, let's go.

556
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,390
The third-grade of senior middle school is very important,

557
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,230
but some students

558
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,190
just are unwilling to study.

559
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Lin Jingxiao,

560
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,150
come over here,

561
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,670
hurry up!

562
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,360
Lin Jingxiao,

563
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,040
Li Wei has suspended her schooling.

564
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,040
She asked me to say sorry to you.

565
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,410
What are you talking over there?

566
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,720
Get over here!

567
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,470
Lin Jingxiao of the Class 8 Grade 3,

568
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,150
seriously violated the regulations of the school.

569
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,210
Right now, she is going to make a mea culpa

570
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,390
in front of all students.

571
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,840
I hope all of you can take lessons and warning from her,

572
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,840
avoid making the same mistake again.

573
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,520
Who's there?

574
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,450
What's going on?

575
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,910
Lu Yang.

576
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,080
It's you!

577
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,000
What's wrong with your hair?

578
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,420
Do you really believe that I will turn a blind eye to you

579
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,320
just because you have heart disease?

580
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,840
Dye your hair back to its original color, and do it fast!

581
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,430
Calm down, Mr. Zhang.

582
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,710
Mr. Zhang,

583
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,430
I've made a mistake.

584
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,870
And I'd like to make a mea culpa.

585
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,150
Don't be afraid,

586
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,600
I go first.

587
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,760
Well,

588
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,430
Hello, everyone.

589
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,560
I'm Lu Yang of the Class 8 Grade 3.

590
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,080
I'd like to make a mea culpa in front of you all.

591
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,000
I was wrong.

592
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,470
I shouldn't like a girl so much.

593
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,080
She is so beautiful,

594
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,600
she has quite a smile on her face,

595
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,520
and she looks really pretty when she is angry.

596
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,430
This is going too far!

597
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,310
Mr. Zhang, someone is looking for you.

598
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,090
- Too far! - Take it easy!

599
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,130
In the three years' time of high school,

600
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,360
I liked her for three years,

601
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,630
even though

602
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,630
my affection for her has never been taken seriously.

603
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,840
But today,

604
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,280
I would like to stand right here

605
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,230
and talk turkey, and let her knows that

606
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,520
I like her,

607
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,760
I like her.

608
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,870
Stop, stop, stop,

609
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,840
Get down!

610
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
Lin Jingxiao,

611
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,040
I really like you!

612
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,150
Come on,

613
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,630
Tuck in if you enjoy the food.

614
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,760
Thank you, Mrs. Lin.

615
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,320
Slow yourself down.

616
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,710
Mrs. Lin,

617
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,630
Lin Jingxiao is doing fine in school

618
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,040
and she takes special care of us all,

619
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,840
everyone likes her.

620
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,870
Then you must be all good to her.

621
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,120
Jingjing barely brings classmate home.

622
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,360
It's my first time to see her classmate.

623
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,910
Mrs. Lin,

624
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,320
it doesn't matter if you haven't met others,

625
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,670
I'm the best looking guy anyway.

626
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,120
Funny kid.

627
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,000
Come on, let me help you.

628
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Thank you, Mrs. Lin.

629
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,120
You are welcome to visit here anytime.

630
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,200
I like to chat with you.

631
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,710
Mrs. Lin,

632
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,480
can I get a discount if I come here?

633
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,190
What are you talking about?

634
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,040
Just say the word if you want to come,

635
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,230
on the house.

636
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,080
Oh, hell no.

637
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,670
I must pay for the meal,

638
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,670
Otherwise, she would kill me if Lin Jingxiao knows.

639
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,230
No, she won't, cause I got you.

640
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,840
Tuck in!

641
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,430
Thank you, Mrs. Lin. Let's eat together.

642
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,280
Slow down, slow down.

643
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,190
Here.

644
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,120
That's enough.

645
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,190
Slow down, slow down.

646
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Lu Yang.

647
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,190
Jingjing,

648
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,040
your classmate is here, come and join us.

649
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,230
You're home.

650
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,000
Let me tell you something,

651
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,870
Mrs. Lin's cooking is better than my mother's.

652
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,760
Come on, let's eat together.

653
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,980
You are welcome to visit anytime.

654
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,670
Okay.

655
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,160
I won't be happy if you do not.

656
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,080
Okay, I will come to visit, Mrs. Lin.

657
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,190
Lu Yang.

658
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,150
It's the last time for me to accompany you.

659
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,600
I won't come to school any more.

660
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,780
I promised my mom,

661
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,320
and I'm gonna review my lessons at home.

662
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,950
Today, you...

663
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,430
Do I look particularly handsome today?

664
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,430
Yep.

665
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,520
Lin Jingxiao,

666
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,800
Bye.

667
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,870
Bye.

668
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,760
Lu Yang.

669
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,870
Get out of here, you're hurting my business!

670
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,950
I really am Lin Jingxiao's classmate, Mrs. Lin!

671
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,600
Nonsense!

672
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,120
My Jingjing

673
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,710
has no classmate with preposterous hair like this!

674
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,630
I only dyed my hair for a stage play.

675
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,910
You get out of here right now!

676
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,150
Mrs. Lin!

677
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:43,560
Are you leaving or not?

678
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,710
No, I'm not.

679
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,390
You just won't leave, huh?

680
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,390
You have to get out of here!

681
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,390
No, I won't!

682
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,390
Would you rather die than leave?

683
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,520
No!

684
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,600
I'm exhausted.

685
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,040
Are you tired, Mrs. Lin?

686
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,630
Can we have supper now?

687
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,630
I'm dead beat.
