Now that Jiang Chen is back, what's your plan?

3
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,790
What plan could I have?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

4
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,830
It's been such a long time.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

5
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,940
I'm old enough to not show excessive passion to a cold person.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

6
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,620
Here's my suggestion, you two have got to talk it over.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,710
I bet on Wu Bosong.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

9
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,470
Then you mustn't know that Jiang Chen has asked someone
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

10
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,620
to be his fake girlfriend for Chen Xiaoxi.

Chen Xiaoxi, did you hear it?

29
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,540
Honey, you're gonna be successful!

30
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,510
The mascot for language-study machine you designed last time

31
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,310
was sent to a contest by the company.

32
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,380
And guess what?

33
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,380
The first place!

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,790
Is it true?

35
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,820
Is there any bonus?

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,710
You just think about money.

37
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,100
Are you so secular?

38
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,740
Then what should I think about?

39
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,260
Dream.

40
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,670
Then my dream is to create comics that is popular worldwide,

41
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,590
like "Doraemon".

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,380
Then continue dreaming if you like.

43
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,100
Dr. Jiang, are you ready?

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,380
Dr. Jiang.

45
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,460
What?

46
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,620
Ready for the surgery?

47
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,950
We have been waiting for so long.

48
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,350
What do you want to eat, my brilliant cartoonists?

49
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,380
Huoguo or Japanese food?

50
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,670
I prefer Huoguo.

51
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,620
Why do we have to listen to you?

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,980
Who is the boss, you or I?

53
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,710
Why can't we eat Huoguo?

54
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,510
Careful that I dock your pay!

55
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,310
No argument!

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,510
It's deal! Huoguo!

57
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,070
When did you come back?

58
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,820
It has been a while.

59
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,020
The sound of the waves as usual!

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,950
Stop it!

61
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,670
We are going to eat Huoguo tonight

62
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,510
to celebrate the winning of Xiaoxi's work.

63
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,230
Would you like to come?

64
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,070
Let's drink tea as wine,

65
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,270
and congratulate Chen Xiaoxi on her work's winning the first place

66
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,020
and her first successful step to her dream.

67
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,740
What first step to her dream?

68
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,420
Why don't I know it?

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,670
You really don't know our dear Xiaoxi.

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
Her dream is to publish comic books

71
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,420
which are famous all over the world like "Doraemon".

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,900
Nice, Xiaoxi!

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,740
Momo, sweetheart, pass me the sauce, please.

74
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
Piss off!

75
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,990
Don't call me sweetheart!

76
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,620
Get it by yourself.

77
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,700
Honey!

78
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,180
Pass me the sauce, please.

79
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,510
Honey!

80
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,900
You are the best, Jiang Chen!

81
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,860
Well, where are you working now?

82
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,670
We all thought you would stay in Beijing and not come back.

83
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,700
Qianjiang Hospital.

84
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,830
It's a great hospital!

85
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,420
You locals really have advantages to work locally at great places.

86
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,070
We are not locals.

87
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,830
Then where are you from?

88
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,950
A small county town next to Qianjiang.

89
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,580
How about your hometown?

90
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,460
It has beautiful views...

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,950
We are from a small town

92
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,420
where we don't call others honey so casually.

93
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,670
Hello.

94
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,460
Are you with Chen Xiaoxi now?

95
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,550
I'm looking for her but I can't get through to her.

96
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,860
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,070
I'll give her my phone.

98
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,180
It's Wu Bosong. For you.

99
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
What's going on?

100
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm looking for you for dinner.

101
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,740
I'm having dinner now.

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,830
Then I'm picking you up now.

103
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
It's something very important.

104
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,580
You must come.

105
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,950
What exactly?

106
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,860
You'll see.

107
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,670
OK, then.

108
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,990
I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,420
I have something to do and I go to go.

110
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,070
But you haven't finished your dinner.

111
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,900
I got to go, too.

112
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,860
You...

113
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,580

You can leave now.

117
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,070
You don't need to wait with me here.

118
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,550
I don't think this is your property.

119
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,070
I can buy it for Xiaoxi if she likes.

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,230
Let's go.

121
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,460
Goodbye.

122
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,350
Let's have some steak. My treat!

123
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
Isn't there something important you want to tell me?

124
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,700
It's Xiaowei.

125
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,580
Xiaowei's birthday.

126
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,900
Wasn't his birthday just a few days ago?

127
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,830
It's his lunar birthday this time.

128
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,020
Well, it's Xiaowei's birthday. Where's he?

129
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,110
Xiaowei said we could celebrate his birthday by only two of us.

130
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Are you crazy?

131
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,740
I have to find some reasons every time I want to buy you dinner.

132
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,350
You're always like this.

133
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,390
It's my treat this time.

134
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,230
Then I want to have steak. Can you afford it?

135
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,700
No.

136
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,070
So what should I have?

137
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,950
Dr. Jiang, you got a minute?

138
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,300
Dr. Jiang.

139
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,510
This is my examine report a few days before.

140
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,020
Would you please have a look at it for me?

141
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,950
Sure, let me see.

=Hu Yuning
Hang Jiang Publishing House

143
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,790
Nothing serious.

144
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,020
The problem of pericardial effusion

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,670
has been dealt very well in the surgery

146
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,830
and there has been no signs of recurrence.

147
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,550
Do more exercise everyday, eat lightly and do not get too tired.

148
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,990
OK.

149
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,510
Thank you, doctor.

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,390
Mr. Hu.

151
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,900
I have something to ask for your opinion.

152
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,870
Dr. Jiang.

153
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,500
Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.

154
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,380
It's okay. I came a little earlier.

155
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,790
Thank you.

156
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,700
Mr. Hu.

157
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,190
These are comics that my friend drew during high school.

158
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,060
They are quite good.

159
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,310
I can see your friend's potential.

160
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,500
And they are quite creative.

161
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,900
But these are not the point at all.

162
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,380
We are a big publishing house that usually publishes

163
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,230
works of somewhat famous writers or cartoonists.

164
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,230
So we barely publish this kind of comics of a pure rookie cartoonist.

165
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,430
I see.

166
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,380
So is it possible to publish at our own expense?

167
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,630
At your own expense?

168
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,110
We've barely met this situation, besides the expense will be high.

169
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,260
Mr. Hu.

170
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,550
I know maybe I have made it difficult for you.

171
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,900
But at all costs, would you please help me just this one time?

172
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,140
Fine.

173
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,110
I will contact you later.

174
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,140
Thank you.

175
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,750
You are getting tanner.

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,110
If it's going on like this,

177
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,350
I will have to buy your foundation from southeast Asia.

178
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,630
Look, look!

179
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,230
So how about me applying a whitening mask?

180
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,680
It looks like our superstar

181
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,870
really thinks much of the photobook this time.

182
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,870
Sure I do.

183
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,990
I'll be a man of culture if I have a photobook published.

184
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,940
Stop it!

185
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,140
A man of culture for just one photobook?

186
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,230
It's not just that.

187
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,700
We'll have meetings with the publishers a few days later.

188
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,260
And they have said our brilliant Bosong

189
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,430
just need to write some poems or essays, whatever he likes,

190
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,630
that will be illustrated with pictures.

191
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,190
Xiaowei, what about the things that I have asked you to prepare?

192
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,060
Don't worry.

193
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,870
Dr. Jiang.

194
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,900
We have discussed several times about Miss Chen's comic book.

195
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,630
Now the reason we invite you here today

196
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,990
is to discuss something with you.

197
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,190
Please go ahead.

198
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,900
You know, the publishing industry has been in downturns nowadays.

199
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,750
We have to do full market researches

200
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,500
every time we'd like to publish a new book.

201
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Miss Chen has never published any serials on Internet

202
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,140
and has no base of fans at all.

203
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,820
We'll have to risk a lot to publish her comic book.

204
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,060
So is it true that it will be okay with you

205
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,820
if I would like to take the risk for you.

206
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,630
Here is the thing.

207
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,630
You mentioned to publish at your own expense the other day.

208
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,700
But later on, I evaluated accurately all the necessary costs

209
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,060
and found out, if you want to publish the comic book,

210
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,110
apart from the essential costs for printing, labors and publicity,

211
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,820
what's the most important is

212
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,310
our publishing house still needs to make money.

213
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,750
Please tell me how much exactly.

214
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,230
400,000.

215
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,260
No problem.

216
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,990
I can afford it.

217
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,260
Jingjing is busy now and will come later.

218
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,900
Listen, I have been so exhausted because of the games recently.

219
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,060
You'd better have something really important.

220
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,750
I know a publishing house that's interested in Chen Xiaoxi's work.

221
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,700
And I'd like to help her publish a comic book.

222
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,750
Why do you come to me for her comic book?

223
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,260
Want me to be the hero of the book?

224
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,430
The copyright royalty would be high.

225
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,640
It's just because Chen Xiaoxi doesn't want to talk to me

226
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,490
- since I've come back. - You deserve it!

227
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,630
So I want you and Lin Jingxiao

228
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,310
to help the publishing house contact with Chen Xiaoxi.

229
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,870
I don't want her to think too much because of me.

230
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,140
Why do you always bother our Jingjing

231
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,550
for these kind of things between you two?

232
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,230
By the way, I want to sell my car.

233
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,750
Do you know someone who is on this?

234
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,900
What for?

235
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,260
I want to buy a new one.

236
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,630
Fine, I'll ask for you.

237
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,990
What are you doing here?

238
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,350
I have good news for you.

239
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,430
What?

240
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,310
Have you sent your winning work in our chatting group once before?

241
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,790
And?

242
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,870
Lu Yang had nothing to do,

243
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,140
so he remade it funnier and sent it everywhere.

244
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,900
He has a friend who is working on comics.

245
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,900
And after seeing your work,

246
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
he just recommended it to a publishing house

247
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,060
because he thought your drawing style was so interesting.

248
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,140
Now the publishing house wants to contact with you

249
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,630
to publish a comic book for you.

250
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,700
Is that so exciting?

251
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,110
Miss Chen's work is really interesting.

252
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,820
So today we want to have this meeting with Miss Chen

253
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,670
to decide the theme of your book as soon as possible.

254
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,940
And how about Miss Chen's own idea?

255
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,870
I want to create a story

256
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,260
about an alien girl's accidental journey on earth.

257
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,020
But Sci-Fi comics are not so popular in China nowadays.

258
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,700
Well...

259
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,790
How about a modern version of Strange Tales of a Lonely Studio?

260
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,430
I think this type of school life theme will be better for you.

261
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,350
Why not choose this theme?

262
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,310
Make the most of this opportunity.

263
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,110
You can watch it carefully if you like.

264
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,790
My greatest benefactors!

265
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,190
OK, fine. Don't touch my Jingjing.

266
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,790
I'm coming to give you some supplement of vitamin.

267
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,230
The box of pitayas you brought last time are still rotting now.

268
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,310
Come and have a seat.

269
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,310
I'd like to have a pear.

270
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,230
Have you bought pears?

271
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,750
Piss off!

272
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,750
I told you last time that I'll create a story about us

273
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,260
based on our lives during high school.

274
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,230
So I ask you to come and take some pictures for my characters.

275
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,630
Wu Bosong and I, we are so well-known now.

276
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,430
Is it possible that you can use our pictures as you like?

277
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,190
Go away!

278
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,430
Come, come. You can take whatever you like.

279
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,430
Right?

280
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,230
Well...

281
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,940
I have asked Jiang Chen to come.

282
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,350
He's an indispensable part of our school lives, right?

283
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,630
Hey bro, have you come by a time machine?

284
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,670
I thought we must be the same as what we looked like at school.

285
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,060
And you are wearing this and taking a taxi here?

286
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Isn't this popular in your e-sports world?

287
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,110
What?

288
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Cosplay?

289
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,750
I may have known something between your couple.

290
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,900
Wu Bosong, I'll kill you!

291
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
I'll kill you!

292
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,670
You actually...

293
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,460
Pose for one of your games.

294
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,770
You have barely worn clothes during high school.

295
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,670
Take it off.

296
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,750
Off!

297
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,900
All right!

298
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,140
It's so embarrassing!

299
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,750
Come on! How should I pose?

300
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,060
Look at his abdominal muscles.

301
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,380
What pictures do you want to take?

302
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,260
It's done.

303
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,060
"It's done"?

304
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,310
He just took off his shirt!

305
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,670
Can you be a little more cute?

306
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,870
Or active?

307
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,380
No.

308
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,870
Lu Yang.

309
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,580
Teach him.

310
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Make way.

311
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,700
Shoot! Come on.

312
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,420
I'm so tired!

313
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:10,910
Alright.

314
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,660
It's your turn.

315
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,750
Jingjing, give me a hug!

316
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,270
OK, OK!

317
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,540
I really can't do it.

318
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,230
Then why do you come here?

319
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,030
You don't need to if you don't like.

320
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,990
Do more! More! More!

321
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,300
You, you, you...

322
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,900
="Descendants of the Sun: Wu Bosong"
Arrangement Plans for the photobook

323
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,700
- Hello. - Hello.

324
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,060
This is the director of our publishing house, Director Cai.

325
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,230
Hello, Director Cai, I'm Wu Bosong.

326
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,180
OK, please have a seat.

327
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,420
About Mr. Wu's photobook "Descendants of the Sun: Wu Bosong",

328
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,030
we want to discuss the arrangement plans.

329
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,630
We have selected pictures for a round.

330
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,630
And now we want to know

331
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,580
when the final text part could be done.

332
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,510
You can check the pictures with Xiaowei.

333
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,390
As for the text part, I haven't finished a word yet.

334
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,820
So is it possible that you only print pictures in it?

335
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,540
If there are only pictures, the layout would be weird

336
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,180
and the marketing would not be high-class.

337
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,420
I have a friend who is a professional cartoonist.

338
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,030
So maybe she can draw something for me to fill the blank.

339
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,270
It may be a solution.

340
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,510
However, our publishing house

341
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,910
has its own cartoonists who are constantly working with us.

342
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,420
I can find their information for you

343
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,750
to see if there is anything you like.

344
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,180
And this Chen Xiaoxi is...

345
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,510
=Chen Xiaoxi
And this Chen Xiaoxi is...

346
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,180
=Chen Xiaoxi

347
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,460
Well, she is our new cartoonist
=Chen Xiaoxi

348
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,300
Well, she is our new cartoonist

349
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,990
who hasn't published official comics now.

350
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,230
I'm afraid she is not good enough for you.

351
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,630
But she is about to publish her comic book.

352
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,940
Her book is published at their own expense.

353
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,820
We can't see if it could sell well.

354
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,150
At their own expense?

355
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,510
It's true.

356
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,660
I have a friend who has so much expectation for her work

357
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,300
that even wants to publish her comic book at his own expense.

358
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,750
And he doesn't want her to know.

359
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,870
It would cost so much.

360
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,540
I heard he has even sold his car.

361
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,460
I don't know what he's up to.

362
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,060
Please excuse me,

363
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,660
is your friend Jiang Chen?

364
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,870
Do you know him?

365
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,230
We have known each other for a long time.

366
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,780
What a coincidence!

367
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,420
Sure it is.

368
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,390
OK, cut. Very well.

369
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,110
Next scene.

370
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
Here I am.

371
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,660
What can I do for you?

372
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,230
Xiaoxi, here is the thing.

373
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,150
We suddenly can't reach the actress

374
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,300
who acted with Bosong in the play.

375
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,420
She was Bosong's junior teammates back in the swimming team

376
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,300
and was introduced by Bosong at first.

377
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,150
Stop.

378
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,580
What do you want me to do exactly?

379
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,180
Just want you to enter the show business.

380
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,990
No, no, no!

381
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,540
What do I know about acting?

382
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,820
No, you don't need to act.

383
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,630
Just need your figure from back and only one line.

384
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,580
If you don't help us this time,

385
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,910
Bosong and I would be damned.

386
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,110
So just my figure from back.

387
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,420
I don't want to be known.

388
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,510
Never mind.

389
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,660
Will you marry me?

390
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,150
Yes, I do.

391
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,780
You really mean it?

392
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,180
Actually,

393
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,910
I'd like to wait for a while to propose.

394
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,460
Until you truly accept me.

395
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,390
Then we will date for years and be married.

396
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,110
However,

397
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,150
you know,

398
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,750
I don't feel really safe when I see someone.

399
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,780
I'm afraid I couldn't wait any more.

400
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,270
Don't do this.

401
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,180
Listen to me first.

402
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,910
I have actually known your answer,

403
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,350
but I still want to give it a try.

404
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,110
It's been so many years, Chen Xiaoxi.

406
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,060
Your taste for guy still sucks.

407
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,390
And so do you.

408
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,580
Have a look again.

409
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,750
This diamond is so big and you're sure not to take it?

410
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,910
It's quite big.

411
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,940
Can you get a refund?

412
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,390
Let me ask later.

413
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,510
As a superstar, you'd like to drink at this stall?

414
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,990
Don't you worried that you would be photoed?

415
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,780
Maybe you want to have some affairs with me?

416
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,820
Stop your nonsense, okay?

417
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,150
Just drink with me.

418
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,300
No way. If Jingjing catches me drinking,

419
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,510
I will have to sleep at bathroom.

420
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,660
What for? What for? What's wrong with you?

421
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,690
The patient of Bed No.9

422
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,870
has just been through the coronary artery bypass surgery.

423
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,820
Observe the patient more after the surgery.

424
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,030
OK.

425
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,870
Hello.

426
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,940
Jiang Chen, let's have a talk outside.

427
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,180
I'm on duty at hospital.

428
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,150
Come on, come!

429
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,940
Wu Bosong is here, too.

430
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,110
OK.

431
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,270
I have something to do out.

432
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,390
Call me if there's anything wrong.

433
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,630
Let me escort you back home.

434
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,940
I have a surgery tomorrow.

435
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,940
You're quite calm.

436
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,030
You are drunk.

437
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,060
Jiang Chen.

438
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,510
Please give Chen Xiaoxi back to me.

439
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,270
She's always been mine.

440
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,060
I heard you had sold your car

441
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,420
for publishing Chen Xiaoxi's comic book, right?

442
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
How much?

443
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,150
I'll pay for her.

444
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,750
It's between she and I

445
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,420
- and none of your business. - It's totally my business!

446
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,150
Where have you been during the past 3 years?

447
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,660
Where were you when Chen Xiaoxi laughed?

448
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,780
Or when Chen Xiaoxi cried?

449
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Or when Chen Xiaoxi was ill?

450
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,700
You don't like her as much as I do!

451
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,580
Jiang Chen.

452
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Please let me have her.

453
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,630
Everybody think Chen Xiaoxi likes me more than I like her.

454
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,750
Doesn't she?

455
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,540
I'm not like you guys.

456
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,390
I've always thought I can live on my own since I was a little boy.

457
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,820
When I was a little boy, my father passed away.

458
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,700
My mom chose to work in another city

459
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,300
and took my younger brother with her instead of me.

460
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,420
So it doesn't matter to me

461
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,780
because everybody could leave.

462
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,180
But Chen Xiaoxi is different.

463
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,940
She has always been there.

464
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,420
Then I got to find out

465
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,110
that I couldn't help to look back to see

466
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,230
if she was following me secretly on the way to school.

467
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,820
When at home, I couldn't help to draw back the curtains

468
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,180
to see what she was doing.

469
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,870
When I did the homework, I thought it's so difficult

470
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,700
that she would be crying.

471
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,460
So what?

472
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,910
You just left her anyway.

473
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,270
When I left, I thought she would come for me for sure

474
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,580
because she had always been doing so.

475
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,780
But she didn't.

476
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,300
I suddenly didn't know what to do.

477
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,110
Actually I came to find her later

478
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,180
only to see she was with you.

479
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,390
I thought maybe she had finally found out

480
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,660
that I wasn't as good as she thought,

481
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,350
and that I wasn't the best for her.

482
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,300
So I had to tell myself

483
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,300
that she was so stupid, noisy

484
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,230
and she ate so much,

485
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,510
and that I would live better without her.

486
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,630
But I found out I couldn't convince myself.

487
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,580
I would like to listen to her voice

488
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,630
and have dinner with her.

489
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,230
I would like to...

490
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,990
I think I can't live without her.

491
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,580
Actually,

492
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,990
I can make changes if she hates me for any reasons.

493
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,960
But I don't even know what she liked me for once before.

494
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,460
=Xiaoxi

495
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,540
Chen Xiaoxi.

496
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Did you hear it?

497
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,780
It's the first time I hear you say so much for all these years.

498
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,150
Right.

499
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,600
Want a fight, right?

500
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,990
I'll fight with you.

501
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,300
I will...

502
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,030
kick your ass...

503
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,750
Don't fight!

504
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,910
I'll take these two back.

505
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,110
You...

506
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,630
It's okay, nothing else. We got to go.

507
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,820
You have sold your car?

508
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,700
I will manage to pay you back.

509
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,870
How?

510
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,700
You don't need to do this for me.

511
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,820
Answer it.

512
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,390
Hello.

513
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,420
Dr. Jiang, the patient of Bed No.9 has a little rapid heart rates.

514
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,940
First do an ultrasound scan for him and tell me the result later.

515
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,990
You should go.

516
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,980
I really know I was wrong.

517
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,500
Would you forgive me?

518
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,500
Give me more time to think it over.

519
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,540
Ready for thoracotomy.

520
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,950
Ready to clean the blood in pericardial cavity.
