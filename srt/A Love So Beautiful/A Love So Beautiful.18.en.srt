=September, 2009

54
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,970
Do you know

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,090
how to set up the mosquito net?

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,780
It's easy.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,880
Just tie the corners.

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,200
Corners?

59
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,370
I can't find them.

60
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,980
Where are they?

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,080
Let me help you.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,580
Look,

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,860
there is a hook on each corner.

64
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,140
Have you cleaned the bed plate?

65
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,700
No.

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,970
I think

67
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,620
you should clean it first.

68
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,490
I'll call my boyfriend to help me.

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,210
All right.

70
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,860
In the beginning of school year,

71
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,890
I should let him show his love to me.

72
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,580
Jiang Chen, let me help you clean your bed plate.

73
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,930
Hello.

74
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,820
Hello.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,460
All right.

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,820
I'll come back soon.

77
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
The department notifies everybody to attend the meeting.

78
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,480
Jiang Chen,

79
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,000
we will welcome freshmen with department of nursing tonight.

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,680
Are you going there?

81
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,520
It depends.

82
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,180
Welcome Party?

83
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,160
Can I join you?

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,160
Of course.

85
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,740
Okay.

86
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,840
I'm going back.

87
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,660
See you tonight.

88
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,300
Bye.

89
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,720
This girl is lovely.

90
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,700
Who is she?

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,600
My girlfriend.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,850
In Zhejiang University, I will protect you.

93
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,600
Have a drink!

94
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,410
Okay.

95
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,450
Everyone,

96
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,840
freshmen,

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,850
today we are having

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,530
our annual Welcome Party.

99
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,530
A toast to everyone.

100
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,720
Cheers.

101
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,300
Cheers.

102
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,770
By the way,

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,960
what is your major?

104
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,620
My major is...

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
A major forbids drinking.

106
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,050
My major doesn't forbid drinking.

107
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,480
In fact,

108
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,280
alcohol inspires us.

109
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,450
But I don't drink.

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,290
Come on, have a drink.

111
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,380
Freshmen,

112
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,740
We've finished eating.

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,920
We've drunk enough.

114
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,300
Let's play games.

115
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,400
What game?

116
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,100
Truth or Dare.

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay.

118
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,200
Let's clean up the table.

119
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,120
I choose "truth".

120
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,140
Okay.

121
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,330
Do you have a boyfriend?

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,130
Do you have a crush on someone? Who is he?

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,850
The question is too simple.

124
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,330
He should ask her

125
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,330
the color of her underwear.

126
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
I...

127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,100
It seems like...

128
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,770
you have a crush on Jiang Chen.

129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,570
Say something.

130
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,300
Come on, it's okay.

131
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,800
Come on, say something.

132
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,500
Come on.

133
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,850
Forget it.

134
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,700
Come on, say something.

135
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,240
Save me.

136
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,600
Come on, say something.

137
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,500
Come on, say something.

138
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,200
My stomach hurts.

139
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,220
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,660
My girlfriend has a stomachache.

141
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,240
I'm sending her to the hospital.

142
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,380
Sorry.

143
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,130
Sorry.

144
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,050
Come on. Let's continue.

145
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,610
Come on. Don't be a buzzkill.

146
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,700
By the way,

147
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,740
I seemed to...

148
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,340
hear that...

149
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,940
you said girlfriend.

150
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,690
Yes.

151
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,700
You have a problem with it?

152
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,180
No, not at all.

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,640
Not at all.

154
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,170
Well,

155
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,090
thank you for being my boyfriend.

156
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,440
Jingjing.

157
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,220
What's the matter?

158
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,720
Your confession of love get turned down again?

159
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,370
No.

160
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,200
Jiang Chen,

161
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,120
Jiang Chen says I am his girlfriend.

162
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,980
What?

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
It's true.

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,280
Chen Xiaoxi,

165
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,060
Your path to love finally comes to the end.

166
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,900
What's going on?

167
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,000
Firstly,

168
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,720
thanks to my parents,

169
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,540
I have matching looks with Jiang Chen.

170
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,370
Secondly, thank you,

171
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,210
my dear friends.

172
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,180
You are always there supporting me,

173
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,920
guarding me,

174
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,850
encouraging me.

175
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,880
Hello, can you tell me your name?

176
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,880
What are you doing?

177
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,220
Sorry.

178
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
My boyfriend is a little jealous.

179
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,960
Why are you coming back again?

180
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,730
How do you get into our library?

181
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,720
So easy.

182
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,820
Do not always follow me, okay?

183
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I miss you so much.

184
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,920
Then stay quiet. Don't bother me.

185
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,100
Yes, madam.

186
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,580
What's wrong?

187
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,400
Look.

188
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,010
Gao Zhiwei, QQ:30269.

189
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,460
Sun Ting: "You are a dimly bright cloud."

190
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,000
He dares to write love letters?

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,480
How dare he?

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,240
"The night gives me black eyes,

193
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,180
with them I look for the light."

194
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,060
From Shen Tianyi...

195
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,850
Stop reading them.

196
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,100
I'll throw them away.

197
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,770
Why don't you call me?

198
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,490
Do you regret it?

199
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,800
Maybe I should call back.

200
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,660
No, I can't.

201
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,420
He'll think me rather forward.

202
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,540
Maybe I should call him.

203
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,900
I could be that kind of girl.

204
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,600
Hello, Jiang Chen.

205
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,840
What are you doing now?

206
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,020
I'm studying.

207
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,740
I see.

208
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,330
I wanted to ask you out.

209
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,890
Now that you are studying...

210
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,850
I'll go.

211
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,020
Okay.

212
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,360
I'll wait for you at five thirsty under your dorm building.

213
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:28,930
Okay.

214
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,880
You have a boyfriend?

215
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,300
Yes.

216
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,580
He is very handsome.

217
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,420
Jiang Chen,

218
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,370
have you listened to a song?

219
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,240
What song?

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,130
Let me sing it for you.

221
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,380
Hold hands.

222
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,900
Hold hands.

223
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,410
Don't talk much.

224
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,700
Jiang Chen,

225
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,420
do you want to try buckling our fingers?

226
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,500
No.

227
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,220
Can I call it a date?

228
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,930
Or what?

229
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,860
We are just Meal partner?

230
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,170
Your way of talking makes me feel it's not true.

231
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,880
How should I talk to you?

232
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,800
Call you sweetie?

233
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,020
Really?

234
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,930
No.

235
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,720
Are you free tonight?

236
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,560
Yes.

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,660
Stay with me tonight...

238
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,400
Jiang Chen,

239
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,730
Let's break up.

240
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,890
I'll never cling on you.

241
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,170
Let's break up.

242
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,090
It's okay.

243
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,160
I didn't see anything.

244
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,620
I want you to accompany me to study at night.

245
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
I've got Pathology exam tomorrow.

246
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,340
It's very difficult.

247
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,580
Many students had to make it up.

248
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,940
What did you think of?

249
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,740
Jingjing.

250
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,640
Call me upperclasswoman.

251
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,920
Upperclasswoman.

252
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,880
I have something to share with you.

253
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,130
Speak.

254
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,490
I...

255
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,080
had a hug...

256
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,740
with Jiang Chen...

257
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,130
on Monday.

258
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,570
But...

259
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,800
lowerclasswoman...

260
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,000
I calculate that...

261
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,580
you've been together for half a month.

262
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,090
Just a hug and you are on cloud nine?

263
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,220
I thought our progress was fast.

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
Do you want to hear about Lu Yang's?

265
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,570
No.

266
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,140
Forget it, I can't even say it.

267
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,090
Chen Xiaoxi,

268
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,100
I don't ask you to be like...

269
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,120
this...

270
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,980
At least...

271
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,350
you should be like this.

272
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you think that...

273
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,920
I kind of lack personal charm?

274
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,930
Turn around.

275
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,660
Just a little bit.

276
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,810
What should I do?

277
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,930
Maybe...

278
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,320
you should wear a sexy skirt.

279
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,740
And wear high heels

280
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,880
to make you taller.

281
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,530
Let's go.

282
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,610
I heard that an upperclassman of your department

283
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,900
stole the lamb leg for lab use

284
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,220
and put it in the hot pot.

285
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,940
Did you eat that?

286
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,420
The lamb leg was injected with anaesthetic.

287
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,180
So he and his roommates ended up with sleeping for two days.

288
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,900
Are you wearing perfume?

289
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,810
No.

290
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,880
But I smell something.

291
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,020
Maybe...

292
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,600
it is...

293
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,410
It's the smell of Florida Water.

294
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,900
The mosquitoes bit me in the leg.

295
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,360
But it doesn't smell like Floral Water.

296
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,940
Floral Water isn't cold enough.

297
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,940
So I put on some essential balm.

298
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,300
Chen Xiaoxi, come here.

299
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,820
Why?

300
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,980
Let me kiss you.

301
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,220
Come on.

302
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,180
Close your eyes.

303
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,820
Why are you in a daze?

304
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,680
I'm thinking about...

305
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
the reason...

306
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,320
why you kissed me.

307
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,340
Is it because...

308
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,010
I look charming...

309
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,690
in the skirt?

310
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,130
No.

311
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,560
Your calves are thick.

312
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,080
Or is it because...

313
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,210
the smell of Floral water and essential balm...

314
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,970
has some...

315
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,260
aphrodisiac effect?

316
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,930
No, it smells like Formalin.

317
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,980
Is it because...

318
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,210
the insects make you feel aroused?

319
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,480
I just wanted to know

320
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,920
the difference of tactility

321
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,920
between lip skin and general skin.

322
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,820
=September, 2009

323
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,980
=December, 2009

324
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,760
Jiang Chen,

325
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm bored.

326
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,170
I want to go back to sleep.

327
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,210
Lowerclasswoman.

328
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,440
Hello.

329
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,600
I'm Su Jia from school newspaper.

330
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,570
I'm a Journalism junior.

331
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,260
Hello.

332
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,040
Be seated.

333
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,340
Let me tell you something.

334
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,320
The school newspaper is planning an event

335
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,940
seeking beautiful love in campus.

336
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,970
One day I went into the library,

337
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,300
found you and your boyfriend really love each other.

338
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,610
So I took some photos

339
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,900
and planned to use them as the subject of this event.

340
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,520
It's not okay.

341
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,520
My boyfriend keeps a low profile.

342
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,730
Maybe you don't know that

343
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,420
in Journalism,

344
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,980
using others' portraits as news illustration

345
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,890
doesn't need another party's agreement.

346
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,290
So why do you come here?

347
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,250
Because we have taken photos of other lovers.

348
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,170
We'll hold a voting contest,

349
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,450
and pick out the most fantastic campus lovers.

350
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,690
What's your point?

351
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,730
As far as I know,

352
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,160
you are a famous Photoshop master

353
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
in your department.

354
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,280
I...

355
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,410
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

356
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,640
If you lose only because of bad photo editing,

357
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,480
it's really a shame.

358
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,500
You are right.

359
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,880
I have kept all your photos here.

360
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,420
Keep up the good work!

361
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,290
What are they looking at?

362
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,640
Let's take a look.

363
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,890
Chen Xiaoxi,

364
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,010
what's going on?

365
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,160
I don't know.

366
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,860
What's going on?

367
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,530
They are way out of line.

368
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,570
Xiaoxi,

369
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,020
photos edited by you

370
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,300
is far more superior than others'.

371
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,340
It's true.

372
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,890
Let's go.

373
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,760
Excuse us.

374
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,860
Are you still mad at me?

375
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,370
Don't be mad at me.

376
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,160
We'll be the champion of campus lovers, I promise.

377
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,420
Let's go.

378
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,340
Roast sweet potato, roast sweet potato.

379
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,200
How about treating you a roast sweet potato?

380
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,120
It's tasty.

381
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,880
No.

382
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,880
It's carcinogenic.

383
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,960
Nonsense!

384
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,180
It's tasty.

385
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,600
Sweet and tasty.

386
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,050
I'm pretending to kick your ass,

387
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,080
so that he will not throw charcoal fire at you.

388
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,840
Hello,

389
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,460
I'll buy a sweet potato.

390
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,700
Okay.

391
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,360
Thank you.

392
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,170
Here it is.

393
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,180
=December, 2009

394
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,380
=May, 2012

395
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,410
Come on, cut it out.

396
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,620
You got to do something.

397
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,530
You are about to graduate, not a kindergarten student.

398
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:29,940
Yes.

399
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,220
You shouldn't be so childish.

400
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:41,600
Lin Jingxiao,

401
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,370
marry me.

402
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,290
What do you say?

403
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,800
Am I mature enough?

404
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,730
Stop being crazy.

405
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,090
I mean it.

406
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,450
If you think it is not romantic enough,

407
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,410
I'll pick some flowers for you.

408
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,180
Lu Yang,

409
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,440
I warn you...

410
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,530
I'll buy you a ring if I have enough money.

411
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,680
As many karats

412
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,370
as you want.

413
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,770
Lu Yang, how can you propose like this?

414
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,580
Jingjing.

415
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,680
That's how you make her shut you out?

416
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm good at driving her mad.

417
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,890
This time,

418
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,440
she won't talk to me for a month, I guess.

419
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,600
So you've decided to have the surgery?

420
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,720
You've told me once

421
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,960
I shouldn't think too much.

422
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,060
However,

423
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,860
I'm graduating soon.

424
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,580
I can't dodge anymore.

425
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,360
I've contacted with my tutor,

426
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,480
he will perform your surgery.

427
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,330
Don't worry.

428
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,000
He is an expert in cardiac surgery.

429
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,090
You've got all the documentation.

430
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,890
I'll take you to the director.

431
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,800
I'll go myself.

432
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,340
You can go.

433
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
You really don't want to tell Lin Jingxiao about it?

434
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,080
All she can do is worrying about me.

435
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,600
Though she looks tough,

436
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,450
she can cry hard.

437
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,960
The surgery will be successful.

438
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,540
So enthusiastic.

439
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,890
Haven't seen you for long.

440
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,640
You seem to live in the hospital.

441
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,740
He is so handsome! She is her girlfriend?

442
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,540
Yes. She looks general.

443
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,570
How does she catch up to him?

444
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,690
How?

445
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,650
She chased after him.

446
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,940
I have something to tell you.

447
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,530
Speak, I can hear you.

448
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,220
Lu Yang is gonna have a heart surgery.

449
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,660
He doesn't want Lin Jingxiao to know this.

450
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,020
But heart surgery is highly risky.

451
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,620
Lin Jingxiao should know about this.

452
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,560
I see.

453
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,040
Good afternoon, everyone.

454
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,520
This is the Sports News Studio.

455
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,660
We are starting today by focusing on

456
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,370
the 17th FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.

457
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,370
Yesterday is the antepenultimate match day.

458
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,860
Why are you here?

459
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,130
Making two records in the Men's 100m Freestyle.

460
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,340
Two swimmers from China

461
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,020
reach Men's 100m Freestyle Final,

462
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,300
I shouldn't be here?

463
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,740
Jiang Chen is so unreliable!

464
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,360
meanwhile setting a new record with the performance of 50:05.

465
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,540
This is also the second gold medal

466
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,060
Wu Bosong gets in individual sports

Let's review the exciting moment.

472
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,100
Wu Bosong is so incredible.

473
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,690
Now he is the champion.

474
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,020
Look at him, all dressed up on TV.

475
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,360
But still worse than me.

476
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,380
Here we come!

477
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,960
You take me as monkey for watching?

478
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,410
We bought you bananas.

479
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,490
Chen Xiaoxi, look.

480
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,720
Wo Bosong wins!

481
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,490
In addition to thank my coach,

482
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,720
who is also my father,

483
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,740
I want to thank my friends.

484
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,540
They encouraged me to keep swimming.

485
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,540
I know you are watching me in front of the television.

486
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,080
He says us.

487
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,560
Thank you.

488
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,520
There is also a friend.

489
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,020
I promised her that if I get the gold medal,

490
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,570
I'll exchange a silver medal for her.

491
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,570
Now I can fulfil my promise.

492
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,130
As to the friend I barely know,

493
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,380
don't worry.

494
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,980
You won't die.

495
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,930
It's embarrassing.

496
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,160
Look at you.

497
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,160
As if I'm going to distribute the estate.

498
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,890
I have no money in my bank card.

499
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,040
Wu Bosong,

500
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,210
why are you so upset?

501
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,250
I'm thinking about how to take care of my Jingjing.

502
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,380
Then I'll haunt you after becoming a ghost.

503
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,700
You just come back alive.

504
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,690
You can get in.

505
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,640
Lu Yang.

506
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:51,780
=A month later

507
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,820
What are you looking at?

508
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,810
Where do you keep it?

509
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,760
What are you talking about?

510
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,210
I don't understand.

511
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,860
Take it out.

512
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,210
Anything else?

513
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,220
Anything else?

514
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,720
I want braised eggplant slices,

515
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,290
red-cooked spareribs,

516
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,570
fried squid with green pepper,

517
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,860
and fried pork in scoop.

518
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,410
You order too much. Can you eat them all?

519
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,610
Of course.

520
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,800
Order whatever you want.

521
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,540
It's on me.

522
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,840
Let me tell you something.

523
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,620
I've found a summer job.

524
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,960
In this summer vacation,

525
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,810
I'll stay at school for a month.

526
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,680
Therefore I can be with you

527
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,770
when you do your medical internship in hospital.

528
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,080
Why take a summer job?

529
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,800
All my roommates have a job,

530
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,840
except me.

531
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,740
I can also gain working experience.

532
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,860
Besides my boss is an upperclassman in my department.

533
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,890
It's safe.

534
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,660
Quit the job.

535
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,130
Why?

536
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,260
I don't want you to go there.

537
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,300
But...

538
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,770
The upperclassman has paid us,

539
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,000
worrying about we don't have enough money.

540
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,600
I'll pay it back.

541
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,500
But I want to take the job.

542
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,760
I told you to quit.

543
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,680
If you need money, I can give you.

544
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,980
It's not your money.

545
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,570
I have internship salary and scholarship.

546
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,890
My ways of making money is faster than you.

547
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,360
Your ways...

548
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,050
I can make money myself.

549
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,970
Maybe it's slow, but so what?

550
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,260
Is it embarrassing?

551
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,780
It's up to you.

552
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,250
Sending out flyers is useless.

553
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,780
Nobody comes to the shop.

554
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,410
You lose the finger-guessing game?

555
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,520
There you go.

556
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,040
You are so lovely.

557
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,460
Can we take a photo together?

558
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,440
Beauty, can you help us take a photo?

559
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,800
Of course.

560
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,650
Thank you.

561
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,730
The doctor at the entrance of the hospital,

562
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,970
is from our school.

563
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,970
Yes. His name is Jiang Chen.

564
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,860
Many people talk about him in the school forum.

565
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,730
They said that his girlfriend isn't good enough.

566
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,340
Really?

567
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,810
Yes.

568
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,980
I'll take him over.

569
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,160
Me too.

570
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,760
Take a photo.

571
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,890
Thank you.

572
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,010
You are so lovely.

573
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,420
Let's go.

574
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,320
Joke on me in a group.

575
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,050
Lovely,

576
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,890
and taller.

577
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,400
We target on primary and secondary school students.

578
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,570
Primary and secondary school students on vacation.

579
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,650
Why are they all pretty girls?

580
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,740
Maybe...

581
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,740
you should wear the dinosaur head,

582
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,410
to improve promotional effect.

583
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,660
=July, 2012

584
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,500
=August, 2012

585
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,970
Hello.
=August, 2012

586
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,100
=August, 2012

587
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,540
When do you go home?

588
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,130
About eleven.

589
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,330
What about picking you up at the station?

590
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,580
No.

591
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,080
I'll come to you tomorrow.

592
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,380
No.

593
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,380
I want to see you earlier.

594
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,930
What about meeting you downstairs

595
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,570
when you are back?

596
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,440
Is that okay?

597
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,720
Yes.

598
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,170
You might not come down as well.

599
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,650
How dare I?

600
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,140
I just fell asleep.

601
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,380
I put my cellphone on mute.

602
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,960
Come closer.

603
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,880
Have you had dinner?

604
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,500
Yes.

605
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,810
Why laugh?

606
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,020
Nothing.

607
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm happy to see you.

608
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,840
It's for you.

609
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,220
What is it?

610
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,690
A graphics tablet.

611
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,460
Why send me a graphics tablet?

612
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,380
I thought you want to buy one with your salary.

613
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,810
No.

614
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,700
Do you want it or not?

615
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,420
Of course.

616
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,570
Go back.

617
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,250
But...

618
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:35,530
Go back.

619
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,400
I'm going up.

620
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,680
Pay attention to safety.

621
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,040
Bye.

622
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:47,850
There is a bad guy here, Jiang Chen.

623
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,400
I'm angry.

624
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,290
My sweet potato...
