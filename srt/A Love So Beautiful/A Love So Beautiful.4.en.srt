00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,230
Our last class monitor, Zhang Beibei,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

2
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,200
has transferred to a school in Beijing.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

3
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Jiang Chen, you'll be the new class monitor.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,160
Ms. Liu, I'm not a good fit for the position.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

5
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,710
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

6
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,480
Maybe you can choose someone else.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,120
Jiang Chen, how come you didn't run for class monitor?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

8
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Too messy.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Jiang Chen, let me help you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Raise your hands if you want to run for class monitor.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,520
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,950
Chen Xiaoxi is so not qualified for the position,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,480
she makes mistakes all the time.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

14
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,030
Don't be mad. It's a free election.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

15
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,520
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Can I count on your vote?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,350
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,160
What do you think?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
Li Wei has 14 votes. Chen Xiaoxi has 15 votes.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,910
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

21
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,720
Jiang Chen, who would you vote for?

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,150
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

23
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,070
Li Wei.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

24
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,070
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

25
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,760
Jiang Chen,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
thank you for your vote yesterday.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,870
Enlighten me.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

31
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,150
Why didn't you vote for Chen Xiaoxi?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

32
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,560
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
She's not fit for the job.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
Why am I not fit for the job?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,030
Then Li Wei is fit for it?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,920
You two, hand in our class fee.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,640
You really lost the class fee?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,920
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,150
Just resign if you can't do the job.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,760
Who knows if the money is really lost or she took it?

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

Ms. Liu,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,280
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,430
I have the class fee.

=Episode 4
Run with the wind and follow your passion

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,200
You're good, little girl.

48
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,870
There's something I wanted to tell you.

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,950
I couldn't remember.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Right!

51
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,000
I have a good news and a bad news.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Which one would you like to hear first?

53
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,160
The good news.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,070
Jiang Chen's birthday is coming.

55
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,620
What about the bad news?

56
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,110
I have no idea what to buy for him.

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,430
Have you heard about the sayings like,

58
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,438
"Having quick wits in an emergency",

59
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,980
or "In the end things will mend"?

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,820
Not to mention,

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,780
you have me, a wonderful counsellor.

62
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,840
I'll take you shopping after school.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,560
Everyone, listen to me.

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Few students signed up for the sports meeting,

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
can't you be a bit more proactive?

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,200
Morning.

67
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,720
Xiang Shaolong moved away from her lips.

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,230
Then he gently took her glass...

69
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,400
...pouring the wine into her...

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,360
...gasping mouth.

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,200
He said gently:

72
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,760
"Half of this wine belongs to me.

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,950
I won't let your beautiful stomach has it."

74
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,280
Chen Xiaoxi and Lin Jingxiao,

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
do you want to sign up for the sports meeting?

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,750
Bro, you're not late today.

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,600
We know that you're on time today.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,910
No need to brag.

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,720
We have hurdle race this year.

80
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,230
No one signed up for it.

81
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,880
No students knows how to hurdle.

82
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,350
I blame Liu Xiang for that.

83
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,280
Don't you bad-mouthing my dearest Liu Xiang.

84
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,910
Love rivals.

85
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,470
Liu Xiang is so lucky.

86
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,400
When can I be my bro's dear?

87
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,230
You switch idols like daily meals.

88
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,320
Yesterday you love Chunchun, today it's Liu Xiang.

89
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,160
His performance in the recent match is worse than Beijing Olympic.

90
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
How about you try it?

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,070
Fine.

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,350
What do you have here?

93
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,630
Chocolates.

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,910
Ferrero Rocher.

95
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,910
Who wants all that sugar?

96
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm not a girl.

97
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,510
I want that.

98
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm a girl.

99
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
Give it to me.

100
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,190
Give it to her.

101
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Jiang Chen sent me chocolates.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,790
Lame.

103
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,190
Let's go get some ice cream.

104
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,040
Pass.

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,470
I'm off to buy Jiang Chen his birthday present.

106
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,070
Excuse me.

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,400
How much is this watch?

108
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,160
1300 yuan.

109
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,120
Excuse me.

110
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,470
How much is this belt?

111
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,120
980 yuan.

112
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
How much is this wallet?

113
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
580 yuan.

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
How much is this?

115
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,190
270 yuan.

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,670
We should get out of here.

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
To where?

118
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,350
Chen Xiaoxi,

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,040
how much money do you have?

120
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,230
About

121
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,400
128.3 yuan.

122
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,160
Let's go buy him some exercise books.

123
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
Excuse us.

124
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,790
There's a letter for you.

125
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,560
From overseas.

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,670
Thank you.

127
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,950
Jingxiao,

128
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,910
I'll guide a group tour to China in early October.

129
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,280
And I'll make time to see you in the afternoon on the 11th.

130
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's meet at the Starlight Hotel at 5:00 PM.

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,280
I didn't send too much money,

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,070
because postal service might lose it.

133
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't tell your mother.

134
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,630
Buy some nourishing food for yourself.

135
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,560
Focus on your study.

136
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,400
Miss you, Dad.

137
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,670
I heard that no one signed up for the...

138
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
...3000 meter run or the hurdle race.

139
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,910
Do you know why they call us Chinese...

140
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,350
...the "sick man of east Asia" back then?

141
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,400
It's because of people like you.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you know why Mr. Lu Xun gave up medicine for literature?

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,790
It's to save people like you.

144
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,790
I don't know how you could laugh about this.

145
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,280
Right now,

146
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,720
I'll have to sweeten the deal.

147
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,880
The award for the 3000 meter run...

148
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,600
...is a pair of Adidas Originals sneakers, limited edition.

149
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Worth 3000 yuan.

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,190
The award for the hurdle race is a watch.

151
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,670
The ones who don't sigh up will be cheerleaders automatically.

152
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,880
Wear pink hair rings.

153
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,320
Why?

154
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,510
Run two laps first.

155
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,000
The ones who want to sign up can do some exercises.

156
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,910
Listen up.

157
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,040
Here are the ones who signed up for sports meeting.

158
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,190
Women's sprint race.

159
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,070
Li Wei, Qiao Lu and Wang Xiaojie.

160
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,280
Men's relay.

161
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,440
Wang Dazhuang and Feng Zhe.

162
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,630
Anyone wants to sign up for the 3000 meter run?

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,400
So, Jiang Chen it is.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,430
She's clearly abuse her power for personal gains.

165
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,990
How about women's hurdle race?

166
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,510
Chen Xiaoxi and Lin Jingxiao.

167
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,550
That's it.

168
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,510
Extraordinary women who signed up for hurdle race

169
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,990
surely can eat twice as much as others.

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,990
Stop exaggerating.

171
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,240
I didn't eat much.

172
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,510
Give me your egg if you don't plan on eating it.

173
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,240
I need to have more protein.

174
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,190
Have mine.

175
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,630
I'll die for you.

176
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
No thanks.

177
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,840
I'll have it.

178
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,310
Lu Yang, this is so not fair.

179
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,960
Lu Yang.

180
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,040
You snatched my egg in broad daylight.

181
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,190
My bro, have some more.

182
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,750
Jiang Chen,

183
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,750
I heard that you practiced hurdle when we were in middle school.

184
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,840
I won't teach you.

185
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,510
You like shaking your head so much...

186
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,190
...why not just be a car doll?

187
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,310
Chen Xiaoxi.

188
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,260
What?

You don't know that.

194
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,040
You can't win even if I just have one leg.

195
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,600
Why did you sign up for that?

196
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,630
For Liu Xiang, obviously.

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,430
He's so hot.

198
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,550
What's that book underneath?

199
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,720
Something I picked up on the way.

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,360
So what's it about?

201
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,160
About you.

Show me what you got.

206
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,990
I think we should start with theories first.

207
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,160
Are you Lin Jingxiao's spy?

208
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
That won't be me.

209

Those who resist shall perish!

213
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Jingjing.

214
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,550
Shut up.

215
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,880
My feet are like the golden sword.

216
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,180
They are over 48 inches long, and weigh over 11 pounds.

217
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,250
They conquer all.

218
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,550
Yet you're preoccupied with other matters.

219
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,030
You can't win if you're preoccupied.

220
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,210
Jiang Chen.

221
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,920
You're taking advantages of me.

222
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,040
You flatter me.

223
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,480
Doing papers?

224
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,760
Nope, I'm coloring them.

225
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you need to know the time when you're doing papers?

226
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,840
Or what? Looking at you?

227
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,050
That would be embarrassing.

228
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,600
I mean if you have a watch,

229
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,160
would it be easier for you?

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,210
You and I are different.

231
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,210
My brain is actually doing all the heavy lifting.

232
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,190
I practiced on hurdle just now.

233
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,030
I feel like I was doing something wrong.

234
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,630
I get tripped a lot.

235
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,500
Maybe it's my balance.

236
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Can you help me figuring out where the problem is?

237
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,200
We'll see.

240
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,280
Wait for me, bro.

241
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,180
Tell Jiang Chen I'll be waiting for him at the playground.

242

243
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,360
What for?

244
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm going home.

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,680
What?

246
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,310
Is your father coming back?

247
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,990
So that's true.

248
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,840
Why did you sign up for the sports meeting?

249
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,280
We should be preparing for your father's arrival, right?

250
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,630
You don't understand.

251
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,840
I have my reasons.

252
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,950
Why? Tell me.

253
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,040
Does your father have a sport dream waiting for you to fulfill?

254
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,240
None of your business.

255
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,680
Where's Jiang Chen?

256
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,870
He went home and asked me to help you.

257
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,990
Went home.

258
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,430
Relax, I got you.

259
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,240
But you have swimming practice.

260
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
That's fine.

261
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,040
Give me a moment.

262
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,360
You should keep leaning forward,

263
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,430
swinging your leg then push it down.

264
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,070
Try to maintain your balance at all times.

265
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,400
And remember to coordinate your upper and lower limbs.

266
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Got it?

267
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,960
She is truly gonna compete with me for the watch.

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,160
Remember? Let's try it.

269
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,110
Morning, Jiang Chen.

270
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,200
It's already noon.

271
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,710
Go sleep in your own home.

272
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,710
My mother would make me do my homework.

273
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,160
Why didn't you be there today?

274
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Where?

275
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
To see me practice on hurdle.

276
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,870
You sure that's what you were doing?

277
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't always push the hurdle now.

278
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,830
Then I should thank you on their behalf.

279
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,590
Cool.

280
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200
What's the matter with you?

281
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,470
Have you been starving or not sleeping?

282
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,200
You gave a poor performance these days.

283
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,590
They told me you've been to the track and field team a few times.

284
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,750
What were you doing?

285
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,830
It's not like that, coach.

286
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,800
We have a sports meeting coming.

287
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
And you think you should be part of it?

288
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,920
I need more time to rest.

289
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,400
More time.

290
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,830
You've been rested for the past 30 minutes.

291
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
That's not true.

292
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,960
Whatever you say.

293
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,590
What are you doing here, Jingjing?

294
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,590
Let's race.

295
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,320
If you lose,

296
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,590
you buy me dinner.

297
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,230
What if I win?

298
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,870
I'll buy you dinner.

299
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,440
Get lost.

300
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,160
Let's race for that.

301
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,260
Come on.

302
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,680
I didn't mean to...

303
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,320
Are you all right?

304
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,630
What's the matter with you?

305
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,280
I didn't mean that.

306
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Can you walk?

307
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,800
Move over, let me.

308
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,830
It hurts. Let go of me.

309
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,800
Move over.

310
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,040
Take the medicine twice a day after meal.

311
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,510
You might get sleepy after.

312
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,350
Just hang in there.

313
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,470
Okay. Thanks, Dr. Li.

314
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,230
You're welcome.

315
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,320
Doctor, please come here.

316
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,350
Hurry.

317
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,110
How did that happen?

318
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,320
She twisted her ankle while practicing.

319
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,590
Let me see.

320
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,230
Doctor,

321
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,230
I'm fine.

322
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,560
I can recover in no time.

323
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,040
I just need to rest for a few days.

324
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,630
Gentle, please.

325
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,830
You call this fine?

326
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,400
I'll manage that first.

327
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,680
Don't run for the next few days.

328
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,800
I can't do that.

329
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
I signed up for the sports meeting.

330
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,230
You're in no condition to run.

331
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,920
Why the hell not?

332
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,990
Jingjing,

333
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,080
just listen to the doctor.

334
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,680
And do what he says.

335
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
=Chen Xiaoxi is calling

336
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Hi, Jiang Chen.

337
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,230
Nothing important.

338
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,830
I just thought it's been a long time since we went home together.

339
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,920
Can you not talking like we're living together?

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,320
Do you want to open your window to see me?

341
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,510
Am I crazy?

342
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,470
Listen, Lin Jingxiao hurt her ankle today.

343
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,990
Dr. Li said that she couldn't take part in the sports meeting.

344
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,990
But don't worry, it's not that bad.

345
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,560
And something hilarious happened today.

346
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,440
After Lin Jingxiao hurt her ankle,

347
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,110
Lu Yang tried to carry her and he just failed.

348
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,040
We all laughed our asses off.

349
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,440
You know what?

350
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,990
We thought Dr. Li is quite nice,

351
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,800
and he really surprised us today.

352
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,110
Jiang Chen, you still there?

353
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,230
Dr. Li told Jingjing she can't take part in the sports meeting.

354
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,960
She's so worried.

355
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,280
Chen Xiaoxi,

356
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,630
are you admiring the hurdles?

357
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,470
Just leave.

358
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,280
Your dearest can't take part in the race,

359
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
why are you still here?

360
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
That's why I came.

361
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,800
My dearest Lin Jingxiao,

362
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,040
she is beautiful and thoughtful.

363
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,510
Don't go. I'm serious.

364
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,870
I wanted to talk to you about Lin Jingxiao's father.

365
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,160
What about him?

366
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,990
I thought he lives abroad.

367
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,160
Her father is coming back,

368
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,870
and she wanted to give him the watch as a gift.

369
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,590
That's why she signed up for the race.

370
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,400
So,

371
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,440
playing the family card, huh?

372
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,410
I swear that everything I just said is true.

373
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,160
If I lied, I'll never be with Lin Jingxiao my whole life.

374
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,010
There's an old saying goes like this.

375
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,500
"If you can trust Lu Yang,

376
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,880
sow can climb the tree".

377
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,160
Permission to enter.

378
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,470
Come in.

379
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,990
I'm sorry for my attitude last time.

380
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,920
How about you examine my ankle again? I feel a lot better.

381
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,560
Put it up.

382
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,990
You are still in on condition to run.

383
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,990
I feel fine right now, doctor.

384
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,680
Could you please tell Ms. Liu that I can run again?

385
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,440
I can't do that.

386
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,830
Why not?

387
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,870
I'm fully aware of my own conditions.

388
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,470
I can run for sure.

389
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,200
Just go back to your class.

390
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,350
Thank you.

391
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,710
I really just have one good leg now.

392
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,280
You must win the race and give Jiang Chen the watch.

393
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,230
I never ask you to do that.

394
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,320
You did it on purpose cause you're afraid of losing.

395
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,990
I'll let you win without honor this time.

396
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,080
But you must win.

397
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,280
Yuan Manxiao﻿, I sent you a love letter, remember?

398
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,960
Song Taotao,

399
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,750
who are you?

400
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,750
Zhongxiao,

401
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,470
I sent you a love letter, remember?

402
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,960
Can you do me a favor?

403
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,080
Can you sign up for the hurdle race for me?

404
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,350
Jiang Chen.

405
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,710
Be careful, the staircase is slippery.

406
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,320
Just cut to the chase.

407
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,110
You know me so well.

408
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,630
I want to ask you for a favor.

409
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,200
You'll say yes, right?

410
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,350
Nope.

411
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,350
You don't think of me as a friend, is that right?

412
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,920
So, Lin Jingxiao hurt her ankle,

413
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,590
but participating in the race mean a lot to her this time.

414
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,320
Her father is coming to see her,

415
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,510
surely she wants to win the watch for him.

416
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,560
So,

417
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
she loves her father so much, we have to help her, right?

418
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,560
I don't suppose you want me to sign up for the women hurdle race.

419
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,400
You're so funny.

420
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
We still have Xiaoxi, right?

421
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,750
I want you to convince her to run for Lin Jingxiao.

422
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,680
She looks up to you, and she'll do whatever you say.

423
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,040
I believe she had her reasons to be in the race.

424
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,270
Don't bullshit me.

425
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,540
We are suppose to help our friends.

426
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,780
Forget it.

427
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,210
I'll think of something else.

428
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,040
Do you think I should help him?

429
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,520
Don't think too much,

430
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,450
your brain can't take it.

431
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,750
This is tasty.

432
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,040
Give it.

433
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,200
Let me have some.

434
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,920
Does your ankle still hurts?

435
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,710
I can run and jump around.

436
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,560
And Dr. Li still won't give me the all clear.

437
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,960
He is quite dependable.

438
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,200
Listen to me, just let it go this time.

439
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Right.

440
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,280
Put your hands down.

441
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,320
I'm angry with him.

442
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,960
Lu Yang, you're quite the ladyboy.

443
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,750
Shut up.

444
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,590
I'm angry with you as well.

445
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,920
You can't talk to my bro like this.

446
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,870
That's right.

447
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,080
What are you angry about?

448
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,470
She said Jiang Chen is cuter than me.

449
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,660
That's so true.

450
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,280
You don't have practice today?

451
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,660
I do.

452
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,750
But I can't do it right, so I'm asking you to be my coach.

453
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,490
Why are so passionate about the race?

454
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,160
It's a secret.

455
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,410
Get up, I'm going home.

456
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,560
Will you please teach me?

457
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,080
Nope.

458
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,800
Pretty please?

459
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,800
What are you talking about?

460
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,510
He won't teach me how to hurdle.

461
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,440
How about I teach you?

462
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,510
Get up, you're blocking my bike.

463
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,990
Bye.

464
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,830
Jiang Chen.

465
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,590
Wait!

466
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,350
Can you help Chen Xiaoxi?

467
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,230
She wanted to win the watch to give it to you as a birthday gift.

468
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,290
Chen Xiaoxi, even your warm-up exercise is messed up.

469
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,210
Wu Bosong,

470
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,140
show her how it's done.

471
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Been there, done that.

472
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,470
Then I'll try.

473
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,690
Don't mind her, there's no way she's gonna win.

474
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,530
Lu Yang, you jerk.

475
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,830
Cheering for her, hurry.

476
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,760
I'm cheering.

477
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,440
Wu Bosong, don't block the way.

478
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,210
Wrong position. Start again.

479
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,510
Breathe regularly.

480
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,280
Take your hinder leg in when you're crossing the hurdle.

481
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,590
Keep your balance.

482
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,870
You'd rather be slower than tripped.

483
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,080
Eat.

484
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,710
Forget it.

485
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,080
How about you just push them down?

486
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,080
That's crazy.

487
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,110
Based on my observation,

488
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,560
no one who signed up for the race can actually cross the hurdle.

489
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,160
So, even your legs are short,

490
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,200
they can't do it either.

491
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,710
Just focus on your speed.

492
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,870
You don't have to insult me while coaching.

493
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,400
What do you say?

494
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,560
All right.

495
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,030
=The 21st Sports Meeting in Chenxi High School

496
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,160
Our hairstyles are cool, our dispositions are elegant.

497
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,960
I say Class Eight, you say hurray!

498
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,990
Class Eight!

499
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,080
Hurray!

500
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,160
Class Eight!

501
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
Hurray!

502
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Class Eight!

503
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,230
Hurray!

504
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,230
Good! That's inspiring!

505
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,230
Next, women hurdle race.

506
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,800
It's fine.

507
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,080
Don't worry.

508
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,110
Just relax.

509
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,400
Chen Xiaoxi, you should go line up on the track.

510
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,840
Deep breathe, don't forget it.

511
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,850
Don't worry. Relax!

512
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,590
Come on, Chen Xiaoxi.

513
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,560
You can do this!

514
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,280
Today is the autumn day with blue sky and yellow leaves.

515
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,320
What's wrong with the radio people?

516
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,630
Why didn't they read my notes?

517
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,280
Mine too.

518
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,680
Let's go find them.

519
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Go.

520
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,350
Flowers are blossoming.

521
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,560
In the field, you are smiling...

522
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,870
Where are our notes? and why won't you read them?

523
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,280
You guys must from Class Eight.

524
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,960
Teachers told us to only read the good notes.

525
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,280
What did you just say to me?

526
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,350
Everything I wrote, I looked it up in the book!

527
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,280
If you won't read it, let us.

528
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,590
Jingjing, here they are.

529
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,110
Just wait here.

530
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,800
100 meter hurdle is short,

531
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,920
athletes' spirit is high.

532
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,710
Mulan fought in the battlefield in the past,

533
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,230
today our Xiaoxi is a Liu Xiang to be!

534
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,870
A Liu Xiang to be!

535
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,080
There they are.

536
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,320
What are you doing!

537
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,040
Kick them, Lu Yang.

538
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,590
Chen Xiaoxi, you can do it!

539
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,160
Jingjing.

540
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,110
I can walk.

541
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,870
I saw my classmate in the game.

542
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,800
I can walk on my own.

543
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,080
Don't be nervous.

544
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,320
Women 100 meter hurdle race is about to start.

545
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,800
Please be prepared.

546
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,280
On your mark.

547
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Where did Wu Bosong go?

548
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,870
Come on.

549
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,590
Come on.

550
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,070
Chen Xiaoxi, you are the best.

551
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Wang Songsong, thank you.

552
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,870
Thanks.

553
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,520
It's all my fault.

554
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,830
I have to go to the bathroom.

555
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,760
It's kind of fun.

556
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,830
Give it to me.

557
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,520
Here.

558
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,720
Why, bro?

559
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,110
You fought so hard for this.

560
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,760
Why would you give it to me?

561
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,350
Lu Yang said you wanted to give the watch to your father.

562
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,920
But you wanted to...

563
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,160
Stop talking.

564
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,680
Xiaoxi wanted to give it to you.

565
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,070
Take it.

566
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,240
Let's take a look.

567
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
How could it be a pink watch with diamonds?

568
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,350
Oh, crap.

569
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,550
My father said to meet him at 5 o'clock.

570
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,920
It's already 4:30. What should I do?

571
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,870
Wait.

572
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,520
Didn't the principle say there would be a class meeting after?

573
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,630
What should I do?

574
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,520
The gate must be closed.

575
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,030
What are you gonna do?

576
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,350
You can climb over the wall on the south gate.

577
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,870
Where are you going?

578
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,790
That's Meteor Hammer, crap.

579
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,240
You go, we'll distract him.

580
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,920
Where are you going?

581
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,920
Stop!

582
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,760
Jingjing, run!

583
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,310
- Stop right there! - Hurry!

584
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,920
Stop!

585
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,030
Jingjing, go!

586
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,310
Stop!

587
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,270
Where is she going?

588
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,400
Dean.

589
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,030
Dogs!

590
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm afraid of dogs!

591
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,440
I'm afraid of dogs!

592
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,680
Get off me.

593
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,550
Stop! It's dangerous!

594
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,070
Dr. Li.

595
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I have to go.

596
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,550
As a teacher, I have to ask,

597
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,520
you're not gonna do anything bad, right?

598
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,790
Absolutely not.

599
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,440
I swear.

600
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,000
Your trousers were torn.

601
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,160
Tie it up.

602
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,000
You're not allowed to go home

603
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,270
until I'm satisfied with your confession.

604
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,480
A thousand words,

605
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,920
not one less!

606
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,480
So where did your father take you to dinner?

607
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,630
He's too busy, we didn't go to dinner.

608
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,110
But he complimented me.

609
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,070
On what?

610
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,270
He said that I made progress on my academic record.

611
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,350
But you're already at the top of the class.

612
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,720
Unlike you, who has endless potential for making progress.

613
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,290
I won't be happy if you keep saying these things about my bro.

614
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,400
I almost forgot.

615
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,310
My father said he would take you all to dinner someday.

616
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,130
That's so nice of him.

617
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,200
I gotta go.

618
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,270
Thank you guys.

619
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,760
My father would take you all to dinner.

620
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,480
Gotta go.

621
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,630
- Bye. - Bye.

622
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,830
=From Lu Yang: Don't be upset. I'll send your father a watch
as soon as I save enough money.

623
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,870
Why didn't you take your bike to school today?

624
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,790
My shoulder hurts.

625
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,310
Where?

626
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,200
Let me see that.

627
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,480
That's all right.

628
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,830
My shoulder hurts as well.

629
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,030
I used some of my father's plaster yesterday.

630
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,160
How about I get some for you?

631
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,110
Wear it.

632
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,240
Everyone is wearing it

633
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,200
except you.

634
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,200
Please.

635
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,220
I'm so nervous even to think about the hurdle race.

636
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,000
Work with me.
