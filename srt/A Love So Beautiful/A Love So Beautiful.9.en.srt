if Chen Xiaoxi and Wu Bosong are really being dating.

00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:53,447
At least there is a couple between us, right?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

10
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,288
This is for you.

you are not the only one I will love.

I really got angry this time.

Good morning.

38
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:33,368
What a big periorbital dark circles.

39
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,407
Did you become a thief last night?

40
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,127
No. I didn't.

41
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:41,447
I studied until late last night.

42
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,768
So you don't have to copy my homework today.

43
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,127
No.

44
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:01,368
Absent again.

45
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,368
It's so good to be an athlete that you don't have to go to class.

46
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,088
Are you still angry at me?

47
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:19,407
Be quiet. I have something to tell you.

48
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:25,527
Some leaders will come to inspect our school next week.

49
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,127
We want to organize an activity

50
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,888
to show off everybody's talents.

51
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:31,687
I have no talents.

52
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:32,208
But you have.

53
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:32,888
No, I haven't.

54
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:36,127
But other activities

55
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
can be helpful for learning?

56
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,567
So I arranged a debate contest for you.

57
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,608
To exercise your critical thinking skills.

58
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,527
This will be put in the charge of the monitor for the time being.

59
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,247
Li Wei, have you already finished listing the participants?

60
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,808
Teacher, Qiao Lu and I are make sure to attend.

61
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:57,527
But I haven't asked Jiang Chen and Zhao Jinhan yet.

62
00:05:58,287 --> 00:05:59,928
Jiang Chen. Zhao Jinhan.

63
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,488
You two go to communicate with Li Wei later.

64
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,888
Are there any others interested in it?

65
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,447
Join Jiang Chen's team. Hurry up.

66
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:10,368
Ok.

67
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:13,287
If anyone interested in it, just let Li Wei know.

68
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,247
You've been keep silent for the whole day.

69
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,127
It's unlike you, Chen Xiaoxi.

70
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,368
Failed in the weekend dating?

71
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,168
No.

72
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:28,527
Then for what?

73
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,527
I made a mistake.

74
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:31,648
What mistake?

75
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:35,727
I thought this note belonged to Jiang Chen.

76
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,488
But it belonged to Wu Bosong.

77
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,648
What?

78
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,048
It is so unexpected.

79
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,488
It made me so agonising.

80
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,727
Okay.

81
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,127
So what are you going to do?

82
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,768
I don't know.

83
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,847
Let me think about it.

84
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:01,648
What should you do?

85
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:02,808
What's wrong?

86
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:03,567
Don't look back.

87
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:05,168
Wu Bosong is there.

88
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,127
Are you gonna keep hiding from him all the time?

89
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,888
You are classmates.

90
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:12,967
Meet regularly or frequently.

91
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,527
How can you?

92
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,928
Besides, I don't think it's a good idea.

93
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,328
I know.

94
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,287
But if I speak frankly,

95
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,287
maybe we are not friend anymore.

96
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:26,808
Or else,

97
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:27,847
you can try to date with him.

98
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,608
Look at him.

99
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,648
He is a handsome boy.

100
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:32,699
And he also has a good body shape

101
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,648
with winning dozens of thousands yuan for a single competition.

102
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,287
You know what that means?

103
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,727
Almost can be a contractor of a store.

104
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,727
One competition for one store.

105
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,847
Do you think I am that kind of woman?

106
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,447
Countless stores.

107
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,527
Then let me think about it.

108
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,208
Screw you.

109
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:54,608
But in my mind, Liu Xinxia is a big supermarket.

110
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,808
Okay. Class is over.

111
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:01,447
Dismiss.

112
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:14,208
See you.

113
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,567
Let's go back home together.

114
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,808
Li Wei is waiting me in the lecture theatre.

115
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,847
We are going to discuss something about the debate competition.

116
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:33,048
Okay. Then I go back home first.

117
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:39,168
You don't know what I've given up for you.

118
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,847
Let's go. Go back home.

119
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,087
My supermarket is leaving with another one.

120
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:10,128
What a couple.

121
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,647
Don't you dare say it again.

122
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:14,767
The hostess of the supermarket has changed.

123
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,847
How dare you!

124
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:27,688
Bosong.

125
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:32,608
Why are you staying here everyday?

126
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,287
Did you have a fight with your little girlfriend?

127
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,568
See you.

128
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,806
- Jiang Chen. - You forgot your draft book there just now.

129
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:54,488
Thank you.

130
00:09:56,608 --> 00:10:00,688
I think we should readjust the order of the debate.

131
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,327
Can we go to the lecture theatre for

132
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,647
further discussion after school?

133
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay.

134
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,767
It has been so long time I haven't go back home with Jiang Chen.

135
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:09,407
Are you envious?

136
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,168
Just join the debate team.

137
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:12,647
How can I?

138
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,808
I even can not argue with others.

139
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:16,688
You can be a support crew.

140
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,368
Dealing with the water serving or something like that.

141
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,488
Make Jiang Chen can see you everywhere.

142
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,767
Do you need someone to help you

143
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,407
to do some notes as record,

144
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:30,928
to serve you water or something like that?

145
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:31,967
Don't bother.

146
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,527
Did I ask you?

147
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:36,327
Let Chen Xiaoxi join you.

148
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:37,767
She has never attended debate competitions before.

149
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,368
She is so curious about it.

150
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:40,368
Okay.

151
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,488
Okay.

152
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,087
Is there any problems?

153
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:46,008
It's okay.

154
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:47,448
Zhao Jinhan.

155
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:50,847
Let Chen Xiaoxi join you to do some record.

156
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:51,448
Okay?

157
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:52,527
Okay.

158
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:14,647
Chen Xiaoxi.

159
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,327
Why don't you have a try?

160
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:20,847
Me?

161
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,168
How about this?

162
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,527
Let me start with my opinion.

163
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,128
We are arguing against this time.

164
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,168
My opinion is,

165
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,368
although the school record is very important to students.

166
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:34,808
But what more important is personal quality.

167
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:36,808
Just like our famous litterateur,

168
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:37,727
Qian Zhongshu.

169
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:40,048
He only scored 15 on his math test.

170
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,928
But he still becomes a great litterateur.

171
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,887
That's right.

172
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,527
For example,

173
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,847
the best Wu Bosong in our class.

174
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,527
He only scored 9 on his math test last time.

175
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,048
But he won the nationwide champion.

176
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,207
I think Chen Xiaoxi's point is good.

177
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,248
Continue.

178
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,048
And...

179
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:04,368
Now he becomes a nationwide champion.

180
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,847
It's already very successful.

181
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,808
It also means...

182
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:12,647
There is no need for him to worry about his life anymore.

183
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,448
It's not that he doesn't need to worry about it.

184
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:20,207
It is he's going to have a great career.

185
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,967
Because he has a good start.

186
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:25,527
A good start.

187
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:26,928
I'll go first.

188
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,128
Jiang Chen, wait for me.

189
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:30,527
See you.

190
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,008
Jiang Chen, wait for me.

191
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,727
Why did you suddenly say you wanted to go home?

192
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:39,928
Are you mad?

193
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,287
No.

194
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,207
Is it because I mentioned about Wu Bosong,

195
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:46,727
then you got mad?

196
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:49,808
No, I haven't.

197
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,008
Dad, here.

198
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:15,727
Have you ever attended debate competitions?

199
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:16,647
What?

200
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:18,128
Debate competitions.

201
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:19,647
Debate competitions?

202
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:23,647
To be frankly,

203
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,248
my eloquence is unexceptionable.

204
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:29,847
I did a great job all the time.

205
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:33,847
Do you have any key to success?

206
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,008
Stand up.

207
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:38,727
What happened? You can't find the TV remote?

208
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:41,287
Key to success. Firstly,

209
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:46,527
to take action at unawares.

210
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:53,248
What's wrong?

211
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,168
Key to success. Secondly,

212
00:13:56,688 --> 00:14:00,168
overwhelming your fellow debaters with vigour.

213
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:04,568
Key to...

214
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:06,488
Don't go.

215
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:12,727
Mum.

216
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,327
Why my socks are not pairs?

217
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:18,048
None.

218
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:19,527
Hurry up!

219
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,568
You are going to be late.

220
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,207
Forget the socks.

221
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:26,887
Now I will play the positive side to open debate.

222
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,448
We think that...

223
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,688
The one and only task for students

224
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,168
is study.

225
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:33,928
Scores

226
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:36,448
is the only criterion for inspecting this task.

227
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:38,608
And also the most basic task.

228
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:00,608
Not go back home yet?

229
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,407
I am ready to go.

230
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:22,608
You wanna go back home on foot?

231
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,248
Yeah.

232
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,568
Do you want to go somewhere for a ride?

233
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,168
This is Jiang Rui's new bike.

234
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,048
I help him to try it.

235
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,327
I want to go to the riverside.

236
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,767
Let's go.

237
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,568
Will you go to the lecture theatre tomorrow?

238
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,488
No, I won't.

239
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,767
Why?

240
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,248
No reason.

241
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:00,688
Chen Xiaoxi.

242
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:02,887
Be careful.

243
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:11,887
Chen Xiaoxi.

244
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,767
Can you ride a bike by carrying people?

245
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:17,448
Yeah.

246
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,767
Let's change if you can.

247
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:22,488
Your legs are so long. It is hard to ride you.

248
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,207
Be careful.

249
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:26,647
Blue ocean. I am coming.

250
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:28,367
This is river.

251
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,168
What are you doing?

252
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:38,208
Taking off my shoes.

253
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,647
It must be very comfortable to get into the water.

254
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:46,527
What's wrong?

255
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:50,048
I think maybe it is not a good idea.

256
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:52,127
So I...

257
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,647
Why there's such a big hole on your sock?

258
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:15,088
I couldn't find my socks this morning.

259
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,407
I've already said it wasn't a good idea.

260
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:55,968
Hey! You're going too far.

261
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,007
Isn't it the time when a well-mannered boy

262
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,647
should give his coat to a girl?

263
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:26,887
Look, Jiang Chen.

264
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,287
I have no arms.

265
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,568
Jiang Chen.

266
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,448
Wait.

267
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:02,647
Wait.

268
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:34,407
Wu Bosong.

269
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,168
Wu Bosong.

270
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:40,728
Bosong.

271
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:43,247
Are you finding me?

272
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:45,728
Xiaoxi.

273
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,088
Are you okay?

274
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:53,968
Let me have a look.

275
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:56,367
Oh no.

276
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,448
I am not a doctor.

277
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:58,688
Let's go.

278
00:20:58,688 --> 00:20:59,968
Let's go to the medical room.

279
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:03,968
It's okay.

280
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:05,088
Just a bruise.

281
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:05,647
It's not a big deal.

282
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,487
But he is going to run prizes few days later.

283
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:08,887
Is it okay?

284
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,208
Just a bruise on the forehead.

285
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,448
It's not a big deal.

286
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,767
You can back to the classroom later.

287
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,287
Excuse me, I still have something to deal with.

288
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:26,767
Wait.

289
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,487
I've seen the note you wrote.

290
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:33,887
Sorry, I am not into you.

291
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:43,287
I can understand if you hate me for this.

292
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,808
Please don't.

293
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,088
Do you take it seriously?

294
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,247
I just wrote it for fun.

295
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:03,328
Really?

296
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:05,848
No one will play such a silly game seriously.

297
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,127
Do you know how many gifts from girls I will receive

298
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,127
everytime I finish my competition?

299
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,328
You scared me out of my wits.

300
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:14,487
What?

301
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:15,607
Is it really so horrible?

302
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:16,328
Yes!

303
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:18,088
I will be ripped by your fans.

304
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,367
I guarantee that you won't be ripped by them.

305
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,647
Don't touch my hair.

306
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:21,527
Watch out my hair style.

307
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:22,407
Don't worry.

308
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,728
You will always be my bro.

309
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,048
See you.

310
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:07,487
Xiaoxi.

311
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:09,928
You mentioned about Wu Bosong last time.

312
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,487
I think that is a good point.

313
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,208
You are more familiar with him.

314
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,607
Could you please do me a favor?

315
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:16,088
To collect materials as much as you can.

316
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:17,367
Then we can get to this debating point much deeper.

317
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,848
Maybe it will be helpful in the competition.

318
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:21,247
Okay.

319
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:26,928
How about you and Wu Bosong?

320
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,208
We've talked about that. It's fine now.

321
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,287
That was a big mistake.

322
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:32,007
However, I feel something wrong about it.

323
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:33,688
What's wrong?

324
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:34,887
It's fine.

325
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:41,568
What do you think about Wu Bosong

326
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,448
as you two are deskmate?

327
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,568
I think...

328
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,568
Wu Bosong...

329
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:49,287
is very nice.

330
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:50,928
Why?

331
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,247
Because he doesn't need to attend classes.

332
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,568
As you sit in front of Wu Bosong,

333
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,448
what do you think about him?

334
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:00,688
The hero of youth. Starting from scratch.

335
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,647
How highly you think of him!

336
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:02,808
It's none of your business.

337
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,527
It's none of your business.

338
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,168
Shut up!

339
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,007
How dare you!

340
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:08,088
Lu Yang.

341
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,088
Wu Bosong is specialize in swimming.

342
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:11,487
And you?

343
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:15,048
Are you a coquettish cat?

344
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:21,208
Miaow.

345
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:25,527
Miaow.

346
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:38,527
Wu Bosong.

347
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:40,367
Come here.

348
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:47,208
Let me ask you some questions.

349
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:50,208
You start learning swimming when you are six, right?

350
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,367
Were you swimming by crying at that time?

351
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,048
Even couldn't confound water and tears.

352
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,208
No.

353
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,328
I felt comfortable in the water when I was a kid.

354
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:04,007
Maybe you were too young to remember at that time.

355
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:19,247
Were you broke your legs at ten?

356
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:22,048
And thought that you could no longer swim?

357
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:23,848
And then with your own perseverance,

358
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:25,607
you are back to the top.

359
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,287
No. I didn't break my legs before.

360
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,168
How about arms?

361
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:39,848
Have you ever suffered from phobia or something like that?

362
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,287
Feeling sick at the sight of water.

363
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:43,887
Or want to knock your head against walls when you hear a shot.

364
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:45,688
Bulimia.

365
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:47,328
Anorexia.

366
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,887
Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:53,168
Let me think about it.

368
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:54,127
Okay.

369
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:58,928
Hurry up!

370
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,887
I will get cramps if the water is too cold.

371
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:14,168
Well, I do not bother you.

372
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,247
I will be rooting for you.

373
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:24,887
Would you like some water?

374
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,007
Just put it there, thanks.

375
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,208
Yesterday, teacher said the topic of this debate is quite common.

376
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:41,287
She hoped we can prepare it from some new perspectives.

377
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:43,048
I think what Xiaoxi proposed last time...

378
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,328
the point about Wu Bosong is good.

379
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,448
He is famous in the national wide.

380
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,088
And he is also our classmate.

381
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:51,688
It's more closer to our lives.

382
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:54,287
So I asked Xiaoxi to prepare some materials.

383
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,968
Xiaoxi, have you prepared?

384
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:58,127
In my opinion,

385
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,168
it is better to take historical celebrities as example.

386
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,168
Wu Bosong can't even get there.

387
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:03,647
What?

388
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,287
Are you talking about historical celebrities?

389
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:06,808
Wu Bosong will be a historical celebrity

390
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,367
after a hundred year.

391
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:11,088
And you are just a name on a tombstone.

392
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,688
It's our debate competition. None of your business.

393
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:13,407
So what?

394
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:14,367
It's fine.

395
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,328
Let's hear more from everyone.

396
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:23,328
I think this point is quite good.

397
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:25,887
But we can take it from different perspectives.

398
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:29,007
Listing some historical celebrities as examples.

399
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:30,527
Then we can make a good comparison.

400
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,048
What's wrong? Collywobbles?

401
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:37,208
There is something wrong...

402
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,647
with this drink.

403
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:39,808
Stop drinking.

404
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:42,328
Xiaoxi, it was you!

405
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,848
I don't know what's going on.

406
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:46,127
It doesn't matter who bought these drinks.

407
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,168
Take her to the medical room.

408
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,527
Take her to the medical room first.

409
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:51,767
Chen Xiaoxi.

410
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,287
Take that bottle of drinks with you.

411
00:27:58,568 --> 00:27:59,808
It's not your problem.

412
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:06,487
Qiao Lu asks for leave for poor health.

413
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:09,968
But the debate competition is coming tomorrow.

414
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:15,287
Which one can take Qiao Lu's place?

415
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:17,568
Chen Xiaoxi.

416
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:24,928
She helps them do the preparatory work all the time.

417
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,168
She can do it.

418
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,607
Okay, Chen Xiaoxi.

419
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,247
Get ready for it.

420
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:35,647
Jiang Chen.

421
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,647
You can coach her after classes.

422
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:38,527
Okay?

423
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,688
I will try my best, teacher.

424
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:54,688
Lu Yang.

425
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:57,448
What are you running for?

426
00:28:59,048 --> 00:28:59,968
Come back!

427
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,208
What are you running for?

428
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,247
What are you running for?

429
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:07,007
You've learned how to run away now, Lu Bien.

430
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:09,968
Where's Da Lei?

431
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:11,928
You and Da Lei are no more friends now?

432
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:12,808
Zhao Yue.

433
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:15,127
I've gave you money already.

434
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:17,127
It was not enough.

435
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,328
You have to pay me more this time.

436
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:21,088
I have no money.

437
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,487
Are you kidding me?

438
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:24,968
Not enough.

439
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:39,007
Who's he?

440
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,287
Who are you?

441
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:45,887
I will show you who I am if you dare to come over.

442
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:47,568
I tell you what...

443
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:50,527
I never strike a woman.

444
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,848
I will let you leave today.

445
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:54,848
Let's go!

446
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,607
Hurry up! Let's go!

447
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:02,928
Lu Yang.

448
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:05,527
Give me a hand please.

449
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:11,313
Let's go.

450
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:20,728
You have to confess right now.

451
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:22,808
Yeah.

452
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,688
It's not a big deal.

453
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:34,448
There's no need to make everyone here.

454
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:36,568
Cut the crap.

455
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:41,607
I was in poor health when I was a child.

456
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,688
My mom wouldn't let me go out for fun.

457
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:47,487
Then I just played games at home by myself.

458
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:49,208
I liked Contra so much.

459
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,607
Like, I've played it again and again.

460
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,407
I was very thin and weak at that time.

461
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,048
And they always bullied me at school.

462
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,688
Zhao Yue was one of them.

463
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:02,007
I was so scared at that time.

464
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:03,247
Then I've got an idea.

465
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,808
There are two characters in Contra.

466
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,048
One is called Lu Bien.

467
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:10,367
And the other one is called Lei Ze.

468
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:14,127
And then I called myself as Lu Bien.

469
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,088
Lei Ze as Da Lei.

470
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:17,287
When Zhao Yue was bullying me,

471
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,328
I told him that Da Lei would get back at him.

472
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:22,887
I didn't know how Zhao Yue known that

473
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,247
Da Lei was a figment of my imagination.

474
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:27,568
And he always mock at me with this

475
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,407
by saying there was something wrong with my mind.

476
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,848
People were even less willing to play with me since then.

477
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:36,168
There once they took off my pants,

478
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,848
and threw me into ladies' room.

479
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:42,407
I just feel too embarrassed to tell you.

480
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:45,968
I didn't have many friends when I was a child.

481
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,887
But I am so happy that I can make friends with you now.

482
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,808
It's just a piece of cake.

483
00:31:59,808 --> 00:32:02,767
Sounds like you've killed someone in your childhood.

484
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:05,048
Everyone has a friend from imagination when he was young.

485
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:08,407
I used to imagine Hua Lun was my boyfriend.

486
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:10,448
Bought me something delicious every day.

487
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:13,887
Yeah. I also had a fantasy that I was Bai Niangzi.

488
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,527
By sticking a broom on my butt as a tail.

489
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:18,728
And finally got a good beating by my dad.

490
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,088
By contrast, I'm so embarrassed.

491
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:23,088
My pants were taken off by others.

492
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:24,647
It's not a big deal.

493
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,647
Everybody has experienced that before.

494
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:33,407
Young man,

495
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:36,767
tell your story.

496
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,728
I was changing my clothes in the dressing room last year.

497
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,407
And went out for training.

498
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:49,568
And then...

499
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:54,088
I found out myself without swimming trunks.

500
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:00,487
Awesome.

501
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,247
And you?

502
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,247
It was a summer vacation in my childhood.

503
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:11,568
I drank my mother's osmanthus wine slinkingly.

504
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:12,527
And then I was drunk.

505
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,328
And rang neighbor's doorbell.

506
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,848
Stayed at their house by singing "Mr. Black" all day long.

507
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,527
Whose house?

508
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:23,048
Yours.

509
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:25,048
Why I wasn't at home?

510
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,808
What did you want to do if you were at home?

511
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,767
What did you want to do to our Jiang Chen?

512
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:08,168
Thank you.

513
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:12,528
Hello.

514
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:16,688
Curiosity kills the cat. Just one.

515
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,047
Here.

516
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:20,887
Thank you.

517
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,127
Hello.

518
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,728
Which movie did that boy choose?

519
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,047
Eh...

520
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:47,367
Here is the thing.

521
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:50,567
He is my big brother.

522
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:53,647
And his mental state is not so good recently.

523
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,647
My mom asked me to watch over him.

524
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:57,448
I can't...

525
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,407
Fine. Just choose a seat.

526
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,367
This one.

527
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:05,327
25 yuan.

528
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:11,728
Thank you.

529
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:12,887
You are so beautiful.

530
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,448
Excuse me.

531
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:36,448
Thank you.

532
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:17,168
I feel like vomiting

533
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:19,248
at the thought of going on stage this afternoon.

534
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:20,647
Don't worry.

535
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:22,448
I'll clap for everything you say.

536
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:24,127
Don't you have a competition this afternoon?

537
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:25,928
Yeah.

538
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,807
What's wrong with you today?

539
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,607
Your smile seems like you are going crazy.

540
00:36:33,248 --> 00:36:37,208
I went for a date yesterday.

541
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:41,728
How about that?

542
00:36:41,728 --> 00:36:43,448
Tell me about it.

543
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:05,008
What's wrong?

544
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:06,208
I am so nervous.

545
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:07,488
I want to pee.

546
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:08,488
Nervous for what?

547
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,768
You're not the ostrich.

548
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:11,768
Let's have a try.

549
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:13,768
The score only can prove that...

550
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:14,807
What's next?

551
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,127
The score only can prove that...

552
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,047
I'm so nervous.

553
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:19,528
I want to pee.

554
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:25,288
Good job.

555
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:29,567
Hello, coach Wu.

556
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,127
We are reporters from Metro Sports.

557
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:33,327
We would like to do a interview with Bosong, is that okay?

558
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:34,728
Sorry, not today.

559
00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:36,248
Dad, I gotta go.

560
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:47,807
I still failed to catch the competition.

561
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:49,288
Why are you here?

562
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:50,047
Are you okay?

563
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,288
Are you asking me?

564
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:52,248
It's all because of you.

565
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:54,248
Because you put diet pills in the drinks.

566
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:55,688
Be careful next time.

567
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,528
The other two arguing. Do you want to go to the college?

568
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,407
Do you need a good grade to go to college or not?

569
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,807
Have you prearrange that...

570
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:05,528
you will have a bright future if you go to college.

571
00:38:05,528 --> 00:38:07,127
You will sure to succeed in the future.

572
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:10,288
We think...

573
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,887
go to college can not...

574
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:14,968
No.

575
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,688
It's hard to say go to college will be successful or not.

576
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:20,607
No.

577
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:37,127
The people who obtained great achievement,

578
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,367
were always good in studying when they were young.

579
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,367
Such as the father of aviation in China, Qian Xuesen.

580
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,087
The father of cloning, Tong Dizhou.

581
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,248
And the founder of phenology, Zhu kezhen.

582
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,288
And so on.

583
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:49,127
They were all got high score in study when they were young.

584
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,008
So we can definitely figure out that,

585
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:55,288
One's school record is a great impetus to one's achievement.

586
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:57,528
Excuse me. The other two arguing,

587
00:38:57,528 --> 00:38:59,288
what's your opinion about this?

588
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:07,327
We think...

589
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:10,928
We think...

590
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,954
=Wu Bosong

591
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:28,847
Let me give you an example.

592
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,168
My classmate, Wu Bosong.

593
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,728
I think everyone knows him.

594
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:36,847
What's the score does he usually get in the exam?

595
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,887
The math paper was just handed out this morning.

596
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,208
He only got 5 points.

597
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,768
But how about his score in the 100-meter freestyle?

598
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,087
Fifty second eighty-four.

599
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:54,528
How many national championships has he won?

600
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,528
27 times.

601
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,127
Compared with him,

602
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:00,127
all of you can get a higher score.

603
00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:01,728
But who can say that...

604
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:04,807
I will be more successful than Wu Bosong in the future?

605
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,327
So...

606
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:11,887
Everyone has his strengths and weaknesses.

607
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,928
Judging someone by school records

608
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:14,768
is very...

609
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:17,087
is very...

610
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:19,647
one-sided.

611
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:22,248
It's very one-sided.

612
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,208
In our opinion,

613
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,728
school records can't decide

614
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,928
if you will be successful or not in the future.

615
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:33,248
Instead, the key point should be...

616
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:34,768
the students themselves.

617
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:47,647
Wu Bosong.

618
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:50,248
Have you won 27 times of national championships?

619
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,488
No, just 7 times.

620
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:59,488
Mr. Black.

621
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,127
Mr. Black.

622
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,887
Forester say hello to you.

623
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:09,087
Salute to you.

624
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:12,968
Your eyes are as wide as bells.

625
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:16,488
Your ears are like antennas.

626
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:20,647
Mr. Black.

627
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:24,567
What's going on?

628
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,607
He is so drunk.

629
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:30,728
Salute to you.
