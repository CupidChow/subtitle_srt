The school has agreed after the examination,

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,300
we will go to the Riverside Park nearby,

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,720
and have a campfire party in the evening.

Let's go shopping together! I know many places.

Xiaoxi.

23
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,860
Come back.

24
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,390
- What's wrong? - No idea.

25
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,220
- This is my home. - Okay.

26
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,630
I like her.

27
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,080
And I know she likes you.

28
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,080
Good that you know.

29
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,580
- That won't be long. - Try me.

=To Chen Xiaoxi, Xiaoxi...

31
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,360
Hey!

32
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,300
Jiang Chen, you rank the first again.

33
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,480
132 points... what did I do wrong?

34
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,360
Xiaoxi, how's your exam?

35
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,380
Don't hide it! We two are about the same level.

36
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,710
What about...

37
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,970
we ask Jiang Chen and Jingjing to help us?

38
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,460
Can you do it, Jiang Chen?

39
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,840
- Sure. - It's only 64.

40
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,910
It's no use.

41
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,810
I'd better do some basics.

42
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
Jingjing,

43
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,800
So intense, it scares me. What can we do?

44
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,840
Can you please be quiet for a while?

45
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
Hey,

46
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,780
what's going on between you and Jiang Chen?

47
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,490
Don't hide your feelings. I can feel it.

48
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,690
I want to give up.

49
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,090
But... what... what happened?

50
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,890
Nothing.

51
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,320
I just think...

52
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,360
he already has someone on his mind.

53
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,710
So it's Li Wei's deeds again, huh?

54
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
No.

55
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,580
Let's go.

56
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,840
What's troubling you, Jiang Chen?

57
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,000
Are you just leaving?

58
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,450
Why not wait for us?

59
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,680
You haven't paid for the chips.

60
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,200
I don't want it anymore.

61
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,040
Hey!

62
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,200
- What's wrong? - It has been opened!

63
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,030
I'll buy it.

64
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,150
You... say something. Don't just cry.

65
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,000
He really doesn't care about me!

66
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,080
He must have had another girl on his mind.

67
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,580
I feel bad for you.

68
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,700
I have tried so hard...

69
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,530
why can't he love me back?

70
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,780
I feel so helpless.

71
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,440
I want a milk soda.

72
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,370
Hey, let me teach you how to please your girl.

73
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,050
I think you are desperately in need.

74
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,800
Attaboy.

75
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,330
Hey.

76
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,340
Chen Xiaoxi, this is for you.

77
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm back!

78
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,420
It's his.

79
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,240
Here you are.

80
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,660
Lu Yang.

81
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,720
Lin Jingxiao, do you want a fortune-telling on your romance?

82
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,040
- No, thanks. - I'm very good at it!

83
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,930
I have done it for every girl except you and Chen Xiaoxi.

84
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Tell me how many strokes your boy's name has.

85
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,290
Fourteen... and thirty-two.

86
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,490
A perfect match!

87
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,540
You've made a nice choice!

88
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,880
- You see here. It's really... - What are you doing?

89
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,130
Fortune-telling. You want one?

90
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,720
Treat you with a drink.

91
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,290
Okay. Tell me the strokes of you two's name.

92
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,310
Thirty-two and fourteen.

93
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,240
Thirty-two... Fourteen...

94
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,190
A match of destiny!

95
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,920
- But the strokes you said are the same with Ling's. - How' that?

96
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,040
Both are thirty-two and fourteen.

97
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,720
- You two... - Don't, don't.

98
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,280
She's shy. Don't tell anyone else.

99
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,050
Jiang Chen, Ling Jingxiao, Li Wei,

100
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,920
Miss Liu is calling for you.

101
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,930
=Teachers' Office

102
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,920
You are the top students of our class,

103
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,770
also of the school.

104
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,480
Soon the independent recruitment is about to start.

105
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,400
I have discussed with Mr. Zhang.

106
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
- We will give the chance to you. - Madame,

107
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,440
how are we going to prepare?

108
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,480
To the independent recruitment,

109
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,360
the grades of major exams are the most important.

110
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,830
The mid-term is around the corner.

111
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,980
You should take good care of it.

112
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,560
Li Wei, you seem very stressed recently.

113
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,540
Your grade is unstable recently.

114
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,450
You have fallen out of the top ten last time.

115
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,200
You can do better than this.

116
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,920
Next mid-term is very crucial to you.

117
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,430
You must do it well.

118
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,900
Jiang Chen, Ling Jingxiao,

119
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,200
if Li Wei has any trouble in study, you should help her.

120
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Okay.

121
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,680
Can you do it?

122
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,330
None of it.

123
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,230
Yang, can you?

124
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,330
I... I can give it a try.

125
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm now clutching on you as a straw.

126
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,400
Hey, Jiang Chen, Jingjing, come save this poor girl.

127
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,750
No, I'm fine.

128
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,330
Are you feeling a lot of pressure?

129
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,450
It seemed I'm further behind now.

130
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,850
I can't answer any of the high-score questions.

131
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,880
- Let me help you. - Forget it. You don't even come to the exam,

132
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,520
Don't worry. There's nothing I can't do.

133
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,230
- Sorry! - Can't you be more careful?

134
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,410
- Why are you always so stupid? - What do you mean?

135
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,220
Go back to the classroom.

136
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
I'll help you get into the top university!

137
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,120
Teacher...

138
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,240
... can you teach me these?

139
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes, it's me, Wu Bosong,

140
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,800
and I'm not insane.

141
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,480
Senior Three is indeed hard. I'll teach you.

142
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,930
This one...

143
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,440
If M equals to one,

144
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,000
then A equals to O...

145
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,300
They went to the library after school.

146
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,830
What a dilemma for me.

147
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,220
Fine. I owe you.

148
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,560
Say it aloud.

149
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,850
Okay.

150
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,950
Use your brain. Why did she like you?

151
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,620
- Did? - Yeah. Only did, not does.

152
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,090
Do it again. Use your brain.

153
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,880
Why did Chen Xiaoxi use to like you?

154
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,640
I don't know.

155
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,040
You don't see yourself clearly.

156
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,900
Not like me. I know why Lin Jingxiao likes me.

157
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,020
She seems unapproachable, but she likes me under the cover.

158
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,420
- Why? - Someday, somewhere,

159
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,080
sunshine poured into the room,

160
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,950
lighting up my handsome pretty face,

161
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
and attracted her.

162
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,040
So you see, girls rely on their eyes.

163
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,320
You...

164
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,410
you don't have anything special.

165
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,670
But why did Chen like you?

166
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,600
It's all because of your face! But...

167
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,410
Wu Bosong is also handsome.

168
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,480
- Especially his perfect shape... - Can you come to the point?

169
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,040
We have to make every use of your pretty face.

170
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,260
Seduce Chen Xiaoxi again, and...

171
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,900
re-ignites her passion for you.

172
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,400
And here...

173
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,290
draw a dotted line.

174
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,660
- Then? - Then...

175
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,800
Then...

176
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,260
- Erase it. - Bullshit.

177
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,280
Brother, let me stay here for a while.

178
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,430
Go back to your own room.

179
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,410
No. You can mind your own business.

180
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,410
This can't be read in my room.

181
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,380
Mom is always there hovering.

182
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,060
What are you reading?

183
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,150
A love letter.

184
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,020
But you're such a little boy!

185
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,750
But I am good-looking.

186
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,240
Brother,

187
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,200
haven't you received many of this?

188
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,980
Xiaoxi told me your drawer is full of love letters.

189
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,640
How did you respond?

190
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,270
When did you two become so familiar?

191
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,650
I think she's quite cute.

192
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,700
When I grow up,

193
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,460
I want a girlfriend like her.

194
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,900
"Jiang Rui, do you remember me?

195
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,040
I think you don't.

196
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,650
I actually decided to give up on you,

197
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,770
but when I saw you playing piano on the celebration,

198
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,360
- I..." - No more of it.

199
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,640
Study should be your priority, at this age.

200
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,680
You are no different from mom.

201
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,120
I know what is good for you.

202
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,980
Go back. Go.

203
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,170
I have told Jingjing,

204
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,680
she will fetch Chen Xiaoxi here soon.

205
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,920
You just play this piano,

206
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,590
and with your pretty face, less prettier than mine,

207
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,360
alongside your magnificent piano expertise,

208
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,320
Chen's heart will surely beat fast for you again.

209
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,000
- I don't want that. - Fine.

210
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,680
You just feel uncomfortable that she is being tepid.

211
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,500
I know you.

212
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,720
Remember,

213
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,510
play something romantic.

214
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,370
I have to go to the toilet. You go first.

215
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,040
- I'll go find you later. - Wait...

216
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,900
This tune rings a bell.

217
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,260
Chen sang it when she took part in the "Supergirl" competition.

218
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,660
Even your pretty face can't work this out.

219
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
I'm out of ideas.

220
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,860
Let's just cure it from the root.

221
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,120
What is the cause of you two's trouble?

222
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,270
But then again, what am I doing in your trouble?

223
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,030
My Jingjing,

224
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,810
I haven't had lunch with her for so long a time.

225
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,250
Jiang Chen, can I sit here?

226
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,120
I can't eat anymore.

227
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,000
You've done enough. Jiang Chen has played the piano for you!

228
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,180
What a turn-up for the books!

229
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,640
Let me tell you,

230
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,950
when we were in junior school,

231
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,260
he and Li Wei played duet on stage.

232
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,200
They all said they are the perfect match.

233
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,440
Now I agree.

234
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,960
Where's your bicycle?

235
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,570
I didn't ride school today.

236
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,370
Let me send you home.

237
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,840
No, I'm fine.

238
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,070
Let's hang out!

239
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,590
Okay.

240
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,450
What's this for?

241
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,390
Take it.

242
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,430
There's nothing fun. I just want to show you,

243
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,820
- What's it? - I broke a record during training.

244
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,250
It wasn't a contest so you didn't know. I just want you to know.

245
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,460
I thought you figured that I'm very upset,

246
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,080
- so you decided to do water ballet for me. - Under you command.

247
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,020
Forget it. I don't want to feel sick.

248
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,200
- Go swim. - Alright.

249
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,770
Ready...

250
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,260
go!

251
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,250
You really broke it! You're faster than before.

252
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,110
Tell me what's the record before.

253
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,840
What's wrong?

254
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,510
Call the doctor.

255
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,540
Anyone?

256
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,180
Hey, there! What are you doing?

257
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,980
Walk around.

258
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,770
Let me accompany you.

259
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,980
No, I'm fine. Go upstairs.

260
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,470
- I'll be back then. Bye. - Bye.

261
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,400
What did the doctor say? Is it serious?

262
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,880
Will it influence your training?

263
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,850
It may possibly influence my water ballet.

264
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,980
I shouldn't have had you do that.

265
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,520
You wouldn't get hurt then.

266
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,200
Don't think too much. This is not your fault.

267
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,240
It's just there are too much training recently.

268
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,460
I ask you to hang out, because I want some relaxation as well.

269
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,970
But this is not relaxing.

270
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,430
We'll wait for the doctor's conclusion. Will that convince you?

271
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,960
Don't worry.

272
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm fine now, and my father has come.

273
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,590
You should go home now. It's getting late.

274
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,030
- Let me accompany you. - There's no need. It's not a big deal.

275
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,940
Go review for tomorrow's test.

276
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,030
I'll take leave first, Mr. Wu.

277
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,410
- Wu Bosong's parents? - I am.

278
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,630
Come inside.

279
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,100
Take this.

280
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,790
Xiaoxi!

281
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,810
Be careful. Call me when you arrive.

282
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,320
Wu Bosong have been practising too much recently,

283
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,450
which has surpassed his body's limit.

284
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,780
His muscle was injured. You'd better pay attention.

285
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,540
He should relax for a while.

286
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,400
But he has to join the national championship.

287
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,680
Time is limited, doctor.

288
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,320
Can you... is it really that serious?

289
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,600
Anyway...

290
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,430
you shouldn't strain him this much.

291
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,040
If the problem reoccurs,

292
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,750
things will probably go irrecoverable.

293
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,610
- Hello? - Have you arrived?

294
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,880
Yeah, around the corner.

295
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,600
Good.

296
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,190
Are you alright?

297
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm fine.

298
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,430
You are too worried. Tears are in your eyes.

299
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,400
Nonsense. There's no such thing.

300
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,940
Anyway. My father is calling for me. Bye.

301
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,840
Okay. Take good rest.

302
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,300
Be careful when you swim.

303
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,520
Pack up your desk.

304
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,510
Be quick!

305
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,730
Why are you all so lazy? Idling all day!

306
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,290
How dare you be late for a test!

307
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,920
Get in!

308
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,590
Monitor,

309
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,700
hand out the paper.

310
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,620
Treat every test seriously,

311
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,030
especially for those who aim at independent recruitment.

312
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,780
Your scores will be recorded in documents!

313
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,580
Okay now.

314
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,320
The test begins.

315
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,060
Have a look.

316
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,950
Li Wei,

317
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,160
If this goes into your record,

318
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,080
you can't even take part in the independent recruitment!

319
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,270
Independent recruitment?

320
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,720
That's not a cheater's prize.

321
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,140
You're disqualified,

322
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,950
and we'll give you a major demerit record.

323
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,580
What a monitor!

324
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,640
Such shameful deeds

325
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,630
have embarrassed everyone of class eight.

326
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,230
Come on,

327
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
She is still a learner of cheating,

328
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,700
and so caught by Zhang Shiliang.

329
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,870
So poor.

330
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Unlike me. I'm a master who has never been caught.

331
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,550
How could you brag about that?

332
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,680
Why did she cheat?

333
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,630
If she couldn't do it, why not just leave it be.

334
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,710
Who are you to say that?

335
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,910
Straight A student has straight A burden.

336
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,570
Enough!

337
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,640
Everyone has cheated.

338
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,730
But it's Li Wei,

339
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,550
who is always claiming to have integrity!

340
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,880
- Let's guess how long has she been doing this! - You!

341
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,040
Wei!

342
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,170
The teacher wants yesterday's math paper.

343
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,370
Mr. Li wants you in the clinic.

344
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,760
Stop worrying.

345
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,600
I don't why he wants you there either.

346
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,570
But Chen must be on our side.

347
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,520
Don't worry, I think that...

348
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,420
what if you criticize yourself first?

349
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,310
Maybe they will not record it this way!

350
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,240
What makes Li Wei so confident about herself?

351
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,800
Acting like such a saint.

352
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,030
No one forces her to cheat!

353
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,090
Hey, Chen Xiaoxi!

354
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,440
Let's weed out Li Wei in the dodgeball.

355
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,000
Why?

356
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,580
Chen Xiaoxi!

357
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,000
- When will you stop gossiping about Li? - I wasn't!

358
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,980
And what's your business here?

359
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,930
What did you hear Chen gossiping? Tell me about it.

360
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,940
Since when can't cheaters be talked about?

361
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,080
- You, apologize! - Why should she?

362
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,780
What a blabbermouth.

363
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,120
But no matter what, Chen is always a loser before Li.

364
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,170
I...

365
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,660
will not apologize.

366
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,860
Chen Xioaxi.

367
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,800
Your tears mean nothing to me.

368
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,630
It's no big deal.

369
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,880
Chen Xiaoxi!

370
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,880
Stop crying.

371
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,520
I'm so pissed.

372
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,430
Such a bitch.

373
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,370
Are you fine?

374
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,940
I'm fine.

375
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,510
From now on,

376
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,240
study should be my only priority.

377
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,040
Can you tell me all about it?

378
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,520
I'm a doctor.

379
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,600
I'm obliged to keep secrets for patients.

380
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,690
Therefore, you can tell me everything.

381
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,630
My mom...

382
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,220
she sets the bar too high.

383
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm afraid I can't satisfy her expectation.

384
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,770
I can barely sleep.

385
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,500
Miss Liu,

386
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,040
please have a look.

387
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
=Symptoms: mild insomnia, upset, retardation of thought.
Diagnostic impression: mild depression, physical weakness

388
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,160
This...

389
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,000
According to my judgement,

390
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,800
Li Wei is now with mild depression.

391
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,560
She has too much pressure on her mind.

392
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,540
Teachers and classmates shouldn't add any more of it.

393
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,560
We have discussed this week's teaching plan.

394
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,450
Now we shall talk about Li Wei from Senior Three, Class Eight.

395
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,450
Her problem is not only cheating,

396
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,370
but also depression.

397
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,160
If we keep her at school,

398
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
it may cause more trouble.

399
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,650
I don't mean that, Director...

400
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,280
She only has some signs of mild depression.

401
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,670
It's not very serious.

402
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,730
As long as we balance her feelings,

403
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,010
she will recover soon.

404
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,510
How can you ensure there will be no other incidents?

405
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,400
- Director... - I think Dr. Li has his points.

406
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,900
I suggest that,

407
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,530
let she stay in school for a little while.

408
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,940
If it deteriorates and starts to affect others,

409
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,790
we can talk about suspension then.

410
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,200
What if something happens...

411
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,130
I can counsel her.

412
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,880
If anything happens,

413
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,320
I'll shoulder the responsibility.

414
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm their headteacher.

415
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,500
The responsibility is mine.

416
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
Where's the injury?

417
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,590
Don't move.

418
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,000
It's scraped by sand.

419
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,320
I have washed it away.

420
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,680
Apply some medicine to it. It will do.

421
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,810
Any other injuries?

422
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,150
Try to make a move to see if you've hurt your bone.

423
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,880
No.

424
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,970
I can walk.

425
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,070
Come up.

426
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,760
The thing with Li Wei,

427
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,610
it's not what you imagined.

428
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,110
Since it's another person's secret,

429
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,240
I can't tell you all about it.

430
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,330
But I tell you everything.
