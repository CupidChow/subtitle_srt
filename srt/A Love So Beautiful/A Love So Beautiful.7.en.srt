Teachers and students,

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,930
The new semester begins.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,120
A fruitful academic year has passed in a flash.

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,930
Students,

65
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,400
is there anybody else who wants to change seats?

66
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,420
Please hurry.

67
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,400
The teacher will be here any minute.

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,880
Chen Xiaoxi,

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,680
come here.

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,460
I miss you so much.

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,440
I miss you so much too.

72
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,650
It's so good of you to occupy a seat for me.

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,580
Of course.

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,130
Get up! Get up!

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,060
Jiang Chen is coming.

76
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,020
Jiang Chen,

77
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,140
please sit here.

78
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,530
No.

79
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,290
You're kind of all alone in this.

80
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,580
Jiang Chen,

81
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,810
you can also sit here.

82
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,120
No.

83
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,100
Jiang Chen, I want to ask you a question.

84
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,530
Come here.

85
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,200
He doesn't want to sit beside you.

86
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,260
Why? Is there a problem?

87
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,380
The seat isn't occupied, is it?

88
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,720
Yes.

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,330
Who sit here?

90
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,960
Who sit here?

91
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,930
Nobody sits here. I'll sit here.

92
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,260
Wait a second.

93
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,650
I sit there.

94
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,400
Are you thirsty? I'll get you some water.

95
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,840
I feel regretful.

96
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm kidding.

97
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,970
Jiang Chen,

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,140
I want to go to the bookstore at noon.

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,610
The teacher asks me to buy some test paper.

100
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,280
Can you help me carry it?

101
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,040
I can't carry it on my own.

102
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll help you.

103
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm strong.

104
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,520
Jiang Chen often goes there.

105
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,100
If he goes with me, we can receive a discount.

106
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,400
Okay.

107
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,770
We will go there in the lunch break.

108
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,920
Thank you.

109
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,000
"If he goes with me, we can receive a discount."

110
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,620
Sometimes I want to lock Jiang Chen at home.

111
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,100
I will call the police if you keep acting like that.

112
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,570
Get up! Get up! Get up!

113
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,140
Class begins.

114
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,900
Students,

115
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,170
now you are in the eleventh grade.

116
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,980
How time flies!

117
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,930
One year closer to take the college entrance examination.

118
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,610
Today we review last term's final exam paper.

119
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,080
I'll talk about the composition part first.

120
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,380
The title of the composition is "If I were..."

121
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,380
although the grade of his composition isn't high,

122
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,650
it is innovative.

123
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,850
We used to say writing a composition should follow the pattern.

124
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,130
But when you have a feeling in your heart,

125
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,400
have a thought in your mind,

126
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,860
you should write freely.

127
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,340
The title of Lu Yang's composition is

128
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,640
"If I were the chaos".

129
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,020
The chaos.

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,880
I'll read it to you.

131
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,200
What is the chaos?

132
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,810
Not something to eat.

133
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,380
You understand her so well.

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,040
Night is falling.

135
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,810
The waning moon is hanging in the sky.

136
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,040
As the fierce

137
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,860
and terrifying blue chaos,

138
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,120
After eighty thousand years' waiting

139
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,340
in the heaven,

140
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,660
I fell into a new world.

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,170
The night was deep, the darkness became complete.

142
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,440
It was too dark to see anything.

143
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,170
But it's not quiet up on the mountain.

144
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:55,820
I...

145
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,960
I just wrote freely.

146
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,970
I am a little shy

147
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,730
to share with others.

148
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
If you really want to read it,

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,760
I...

150
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll make a sacrifice.

151
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,280
Don't worry about it.

152
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,660
Liu Qingshan hasn't read any fantasy novels.

153
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,700
They just follow the same pattern.

154
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,330
You guys...

155
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,330
Come on, I'm kidding.

156
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,160
Jiang Chen,

157
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,360
let's go to the bookstore.

158
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,920
Okay.

159
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,320
Jiang Chen,

160
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,100
you promised to read my composition.

161
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,410
Wu Bosong.

162
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,620
I've finished. I am going back to training.

163
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,960
Let's go.

164
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,090
I haven't finished my lunch.

165
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,920
Just go.

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,050
Help me take my plates.

167
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,320
No, please don't go.

168
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,010
We should just walk straight into it.

169
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,410
Why are we sneaking around?

170
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,170
This is exciting.

171
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,720
My composition is much more exciting.

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,820
Jiang Chen, thank you so much.

173
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,940
By the way,

174
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,410
I hear you have a younger brother.

175
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,500
I want to buy a storybook for my younger brother.

176
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,840
But I don't know what kind of book they like.

177
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Can you help me pick one?

178
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,520
Who told you about it?

179
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,140
Chen Xiaoxi.

180
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,780
She lied.

181
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,560
Bitch!

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,370
I don't know much about storybooks.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,060
You just look around.

184
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,410
I'm afraid...

185
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm afraid I buy something wrong.

186
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,660
My parents...

187
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,300
got divorced when I was a kid.

188
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,960
Then my dad got me a step-family.

189
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,500
A few years ago, my stepmother had a son.

190
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,930
He is going to have a birthday.

191
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,940
My dad asked me to buy him a present.

192
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,900
My parents are on bad terms.

193
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,900
Growing up,

194
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,600
my mum is always strict with me.

195
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,160
I am working so hard

196
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,410
to cheer my mom up,

197
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,250
to improve their relationship.

198
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,780
All right. I'll help.

199
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,620
She comes off delicate, doesn't she?

200
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,020
Does boys tend to like

201
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,730
girls with tragic life?

202
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,800
Who doesn't have divorced parents?

203
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,880
Everything is ready,

204
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,170
except the public-health license.

205
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,260
It takes time to go through the process.

206
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,450
All you know is going through the process.

207
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,780
What's the use of worrying about it?

208
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,120
You have a classmate

209
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,920
who works in the board of health.

210
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,320
You have a school reunion a few days later.

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,650
You can ask him for help.

212
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,330
You are asking for back door.

213
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,060
You want him to abuse his position.

214
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,780
I won't do that.

215
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Am I asking for abuse of power?

216
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,200
People do it all the time.

217
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,490
I just want you to ask.

218
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,740
No way.

219
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,440
Chen Guowei,

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,340
you never think for the family.

221
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,050
I...

222
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,140
Come on.

223
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,960
Get out of my way.

224
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,820
Ignoring my masterpiece,

225
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,680
not my real friends.

226
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,260
When I get rich,

227
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,520
I'll make new friends with good taste.

228
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
A platform for making great fortune overnight.

229
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,380
Macao gambling for making millions in a month.

230
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,560
Overseas ladies pay a lot of money for a son.

231
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,940
What the hell?

232
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,970
Have fun making calls and answer easy questions.

233
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,890
A luxurious and quality Hainan tour is waiting for you.

234
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,560
I feel bad.

235
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,140
You didn't write your homework, did you?

236
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,050
Jiang Chen,

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,360
=A character of "Dream of the Red Chamber"
what do you think of Lin Daiyu?

238
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,090
Is she so delicate

239
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,680
that you want to protect her?

240
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,680
Protect?

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,680
I'll protect you.

242
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,700
Don't interrupt.

243
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,240
What on earth do you think of her?

244
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,500
Much better than you.

245
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,050
At least she eats less than you.

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,340
I don't eat much.

247
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,170
Sometimes I think I resemble her.

248
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,370
Resemble what?

249
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,650
You vomit blood too?

250
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,420
Or that something goes wrong with your flowers?

251
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,560
My flowers are fine.

252
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,690
Don't keep asking Chen Xiaoxi.

253
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,840
Ask me. Ask me please.

254
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,000
Ask you what?

255
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,600
You rented a dirty book,

256
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,280
then you find every wonderful page was torn up.

257
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,090
Let me finish.

258
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,080
Don't say I don't share with you.

259
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,580
Take a look at it.

260
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,340
It's the final preview of Xiao Qing's answering game.

261
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,010
If we answer the last few questions correctly,

262
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,700
we can have a trip to Hainan.

263
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,780
Lu Yang, you idiot.

264
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,380
It must be a fraud.

265
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,460
Tell me how much you spent.

266
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:08,900
Not too much.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,970
Stop talking about money.

268
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,290
If we end up winning,

269
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,130
we could have all the money back.

270
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,860
Oh, yeah.

271
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,210
Chen Xiaoxi, are you in?

272
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:17,800
I'm in.

273
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,570
Sounds good.

274
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,540
Jiang Chen, I still have something to tell you.

275
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,200
I don't want to hear it.

276
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,460
It's true!

277
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,250
My parents had a quarrel yesterday.

278
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,800
Everyday.

279
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,360
I feel they are having a marriage breach.

280
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,370
They may end up in divorce.

281
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,160
If they divorced, who I should go with?

282
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,730
My mom is mean.

283
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,000
My dad is a bad cook.

284
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,320
I may have to move,

285
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,240
leading a vagrant life.

286
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,940
At that time, I couldn't be your neighbor anymore.

287
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,980
I hear about children of divorced families are miserable.

288
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,330
What if they marry again

289
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,930
and don't give me something to eat?

290
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,960
That's obviously because of your big stomach.

291
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,280
Trust me!

292
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,220
They were throwing stuff.

293
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,540
That was a fierce fight.

294
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,620
Tell me

295
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,160
what they threw.

296
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,290
The refrigerator.

297
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,370
What a fierce fight.

298
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,220
I have spent all my allowance for this month on it.

299
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,490
Don't let me down.

300
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,620
Are you ready?

301
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
You've come to the ultimate guessing session.

302
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,300
Please answer the questions when you hear them.

303
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,570
Are you ready?

304
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,210
Yes.

305
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,640
Listen.

306
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,860
Zu Qianqiu gives Ling Huchong life-extending eight pills.

307
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,550
=From Jing Yong's novel "The Legendary Swordsman"?
How long does it take ancestor of the Yellow River to make them?

308
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,860
You always read novels in class, Lu Yang.

309
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,520
You don't even know this?

310
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,660
I don't read serious literature.

311
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,460
Come on, answer the question.

312
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,320
Twelve years.

313
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,090
Incredible. That is correct.

314
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,650
Jiang Chen, you are awesome.

315
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,840
You read more books than I do.

316
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,210
Listen.

317
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:47,160
In "Sailor Moon", what's the name of Usagi Tsukino's daughter?

318
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,340
Why are you looking at me?

319
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,810
Do I seem like that kind of guy watching "Sailor Moon"?

320
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,980
I know the answer.

321
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,080
I know.

322
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,500
The one with pink hair.

323
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,440
She is very small.

324
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,120
I don't remember.

325
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,770
I don't remember her name.

326
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,180
Five seconds.

327
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,460
Do you know the answer?

328
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,540
Come on, almost out of time.

329
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,500
Come on.

330
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,780
Three.

331
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,260
Two.

332
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,410
I really don't remember.

333
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,130
Chibi Usa.

334
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,250
Great. That is correct.

335
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,580
You really are a "Sailor Moon" guy.

336
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,680
In the name of Moon, I'll praise you.

337
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
She told me.

338
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,480
You remember my words quite well.

339
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,800
Last question.

340
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,120
Which kind of force plays a leading role in a Galaxy?

341
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,850
Gravitation.

342
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,490
Why so fast? Think twice.

343
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,840
That's correct. You are the smartest guy in the world.

344
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,220
We'll send you the award address through the phone.

345
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,250
We succeed!

346
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,480
They've sent the address.

347
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,360
Look.

348
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,880
It's in the suburbs. Too far from here.

349
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,820
What's the purpose of this?

350
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,930
We have to go a long way and then get deceived.

351
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,970
Don't take it seriously.

352
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,840
Come on. I spent all my money on it.

353
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,610
Exactly. Let's go.

354
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,580
That is so much fun we going out together.

355
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,240
We can make it to Hainan.

356
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:11,940
She can't lie.

357
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,400
All right. I'll go.

358
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,380
We go get the prize together on Saturday.

359
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,380
Cheers.

360
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,010
Cheers.

361
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm sorry.

362
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,410
I'm late.

363
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,880
Fuhua, sit here.

364
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,100
Your goblet.

365
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,890
Here it is.

366
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,610
Liu,

367
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,770
you are doing very well now.

368
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,010
The number two in the board of health.

369
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:58,970
I'd like to propose a toast.

370
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,500
I'll empty it. Be my guest.

371
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,060
By the way, Guowei, what did you want to tell me?

372
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,100
It's no big deal.

373
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,890
Just keep up on your life.

374
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,690
Cheers.

375
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,240
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

376
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,290
Fill it up.

377
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,240
Have a drink.

378
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,210
Eat something.

379
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,620
Cheers.

380
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,540
Chen,

381
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,610
you've drunk too much.

382
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,560
Come here.

383
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,660
Why drank so much?

384
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,540
Did you ask him?

385
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,450
What?

386
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,560
Did you ask your classmate?

387
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,200
No.

388
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,660
Why?

389
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,020
We agreed on that.

390
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,800
Agreed?

391
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,440
I told you we can't do this.

392
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,760
If you want to start a store, you have to follow the rules.

393
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,370
Rules.

394
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
Rules.

395
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,960
Chen Guowei,

396
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,500
is it so difficult for you to ask?

397
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,620
How much does it cost you?

398
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,260
Let me tell you.

399
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,480
It's not a matter of money.

400
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm not that kind of guy.

401
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,460
I can't do that.

402
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,050
All right. Do what you like.

403
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,490
I won't start the ham hock store.

404
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,860
I won't.

405
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,080
You stick to your dead rules.

406
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,000
My parents had a quarrel again.

407
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,020
My mom asked dad whether he asked.

408
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,380
He said no.

409
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,360
Then my mom said not live with him any more.

410
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm really worrying about their marriage.

411
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,890
What if they get divorced and

412
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,060
my dad find me a stepmother?

413
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,810
What if they have a new baby,

414
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,100
and not love me any more?

415
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,580
Don't make fun of divorce.

416
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:50,900
It's not funny.

417
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,800
What's going on?

418
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,170
Are we going out tomorrow?

419
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,080
Have you prepared snacks?

420
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,940
Let's go buy some.

421
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,450
Xiaoxi.

422
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,180
Xiaoxi.

423
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,260
I'm not worrying about money.

424
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,280
We can't eat them all if we buy so much.

425
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,050
What's wrong?

426
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,220
Things you don't understand.

427
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,500
I got to take a leak.

428
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,850
Dad.

429
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,420
What's going on, Xiaoxi?

430
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,800
Nothing.

431
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,260
I just want to ask where you are.

432
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,380
Are you coming home for dinner tonight?

433
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,770
I have to stay late at the office.

434
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,920
Don't wait for me.

435
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,940
You have it first.

436
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,560
That's all. I'll get working.

437
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,540
Hey.

438
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,800
What's going on?

439
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,880
I won't talk boloney any more.

440
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,840
My parents are going to divorce.

441
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,360
It's dirty,

442
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,720
but it's okay.

443
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,880
You're back.

444
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,610
What's going on?

445
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,410
Nothing.

446
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,740
You should tell me if someone bullied you.

447
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
I'll help you.

448
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
It's okay. It's just windy outside.

449
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,490
Just got some dust in my eyes.

450
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,900
Really?

451
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,570
You and your dad

452
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,850
never come home early these days.

453
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,800
I can't help worrying.

454
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,160
I cooked a ham hock.

455
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,340
You should try one.

456
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,280
Come on.

457
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,660
Is it delicious?

458
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,610
Eat slowly.

459
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,240
I've cooked a lot of them.

460
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,290
Chen,

461
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,980
did you drink?

462
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,520
No.

463
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,020
Go do your homework.

464
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,220
I won't.

465
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,980
You are unreasonable.

466
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,050
I am unreasonable.

467
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,900
You don't come back for dinner these days.

468
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,840
What on earth are you doing outside?

469
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,760
Xiaoxi.

470
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,740
=To: Chen Xiaoxi
What are you doing?

471
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,500
=Send

472
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,740
=Chen Xiaoxi

473
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,040
Bro,

474
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,680
mom sends me up for your laundry.

475
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,120
On the bed. Take them.

476
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,220
Bro,

477
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,580
why the sleeve of your school uniform is wet?

478
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,130
It was licked by a dog on my way back.

479
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,840
What kind of dog?

480
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:19,860
Is it cute?

481
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,980
Maybe.

482
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,300
But it's a little loud.

483
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,370
Can you take me to see it sometime?

484
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,570
Okay. It's near our home.

485
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,860
It often shows up.

486
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,300
I'll go see tomorrow.

487
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:51,820
Hello.

488
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,890
I'm almost ready.

489
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,650
Ready to leave.

490
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,620
Are you ready to go out?

491
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,940
That's okay. I'll wait.

492
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,250
I see.

493
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,890
I know.

494
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,960
Meet you in the afternoon, Fuhua.

495
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,010
It is locked.

496
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,060
Mom.

497
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,800
Mom.

498
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,520
Who to call?

499
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:18,760
Jiang Chen.

500
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,940
Jiang Chen, please answer the phone.

501
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,840
The number you dialed is power off.

502
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,980
Hello.

503
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,000
Jingjing.

504
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,760
What's going on? I just go out.

505
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,640
Don't rush me.

506
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm locked at home.

507
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,380
All right. I'll come get you out.

508
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,860
- What to do? - What to do?

509
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,760
Let me think about it.

510
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,490
I'll tell you what.

511
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:05,890
I'll go find your mom.

512
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,850
Wu Bosong go to the locksmith.

513
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,810
Jiang Chen.

514
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,400
Jiang Chen will

515
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,360
stay here with you.

516
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,490
I'm a stranger here.

517
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,500
Why don't you let Jiang Chen go there?

518
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,090
No reason.

519
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,180
It's embarrassing to look at you through the door.

520
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,560
Makes me want to feed you.

521
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,140
Why?

522
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,450
Chen Xiaoxi, I can't find your mom.

523
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,810
I can't find the locksmith too.

524
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,280
What should I do? I have to go out today.

525
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,770
Chen Xiaoxi,

526
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,680
don't tell me you forget to look for your key.

527
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,520
Yeah!

528
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,120
Chen Xiaoxi.

529
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,490
Come on.

530
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,010
Don't worry.

531
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,570
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

532
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,450
Let's go and find out.

533
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,740
I heard he would go to Fuhua.

534
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,080
Let's go there.

535
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,600
Right now.

536
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,320
Fuhua...

537
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,410
Where is Fuhua?

538
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,170
There are too many places named Fuhua.

539
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,940
There is a Fuhua furniture near the school gate.

540
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,860
Right. There is a Fuhua game room downstairs of my house.

541
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,580
There is a Fuhua sauna near the natatorium.

542
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,680
Can you think of other clues?

543
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,520
I can't.

544
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,820
Xiaochengzhichun Restaurant.

545
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,850
Qingfeng Restaurant.

546
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,700
Dongpo Restaurant.

547
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Chen Xiaoxi,

548
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,130
Does your family often go out for dinner?

549
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,440
That's right. We go separately to the three places.

550
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,520
Keep in touch on the cellphone.

551
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,930
What about me?

552
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,700
You follow me.

553
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,130
Then I'll follow you.

554
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,640
He follows me.

555
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,880
You go with me.

556
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,280
Let's go.

557
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,810
Living alone is difficult.

558
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,540
Take care of yourself.

559
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,540
Thank you for helping me with the lawyer.

560
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,930
Come on, we were old classmates.

561
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,570
Why not go in?

562
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,980
I don't dare.

563
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,340
By the way,

564
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,740
why are you divorced?

565
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,000
A couple should compromise each other.

566
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,260
If you can't,

567
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,360
the marriage can't last.

568
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,290
That is the way marriage works.

569
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Chen, don't end up like me.

570
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,000
I don't know it until know.

571
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,680
Nothing is more important than a home.

572
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,770
Hello, Liu.

573
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,460
This is Guowei.

574
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,050
Hear me out.

575
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,850
I need you to do a favor.

576
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,920
My wife wants to start a grocery store.

577
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,040
But the certification of public-health licence

578
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,540
takes a long time.

579
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,650
So I want you to do a favor.

580
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,360
It only takes a month?

581
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,090
Thank you.

582
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,040
Okay.

583
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,420
Guowei,

584
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,360
I'll ask the lawyer you introduce to me out tomorrow.

585
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,960
Thank you so much.

586
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,090
You're welcome.

587
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,530
Talk to him.

588
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,810
Just come to me if you need anything.

589
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,050
I'm familiar with him.

590
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,890
Guowei,

591
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,890
give your wife my regards.

592
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,920
Okay.

593
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,970
See you later.

594
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,500
Goodbye.

595
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,860
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

596
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,020
You seem to be disappointed.

597
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,450
Chen Xiaoxi, have you found him?

598
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,530
What's going on?

599
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,660
It's all right. Just a misunderstanding.

600
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,160
It freaked me out.

601
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,490
Ohh!

602
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,060
We forget Lu Yang.

603
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,060
=Lu Yang
I go to get the prize. Don't come.

604
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,140
Old man, it is clear in the message.
=Lu Yang

605
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,700
Old man, it is clear in the message.

606
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,780
This place is No.382.

607
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,250
Why people come to get some prize

608
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,650
every once in a while?

609
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,490
This is an old school and there is no prize.

610
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,160
There is no way.

611
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,900
You open the gate. I'll see for myself.

612
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,920
Get out of here! Don't bother me.

613
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,770
You won't open the gate?

614
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,720
All right.

615
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,140
I'll see for myself.

616
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,090
I've answered all the questions correctly.

617
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,480
What are you doing?

618
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,920
Alas.

619
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,010
Lu Yang.

620
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,600
Lin Jingxiao.

621
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,490
Who humiliate you?

622
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,770
It's fake. There is no prize.

623
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,500
I was cheated.

624
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,250
School kids,

625
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,860
there is no prize.

626
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,120
It is all a trick.

627
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,880
I told you...

628
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,450
Come on, we have come here.

629
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,700
The scenery around is not bad.

630
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,260
Take it as a picnic.

631
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,690
Yeah! Better than dip in the pool.

632
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,380
Old man, please close the gate.

633
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,740
Don't keep going forward, you two.

634
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,690
There is no car. It's no use going forward.

635
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,780
Jingjing, let's listen to him.

636
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,820
Go back and live there for one night.

637
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,620
No. My mom will worry about me.

638
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,530
There is no where to live, and it's getting dark.

639
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,340
It's not safe if we keep going.

640
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,850
You just want to stay over with Jiang Chen.

641
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,220
That's not true.

642
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,520
Let's vote.

643
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,290
All in favor?

644
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,290
Come on.

645
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,810
We can watch the sunrise together tomorrow morning.

646
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,580
It will be fun.

647
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,820
Come here.

648
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,330
Wow.

649
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,320
Let's play here tonight.

650
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,260
Come here.

651
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,280
Look, there are beds.

652
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,640
Is that okay?

653
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,700
What else can I say?

654
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,210
But we should call our family.

655
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,570
That's right.

656
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,040
Make a call.

657
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,140
Hey, mom.

658
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,440
I'm at Lin Jingxiao's home.

659
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,980
She is helping me with my study.

660
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,940
Hey, mom.

661
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,090
He is the best student in my class.

662
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,450
Yes.

663
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,210
We'll take a break early.

664
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,140
Don't worry. Lu Yang is at my home.

665
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,860
Bye, mom.

666
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,100
Don't worry.

667
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,170
Bye.

668
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,140
Why hasn't Jiang Chen come back from the toilet?

669
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,570
In the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere,

670
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,500
let's make this interesting.

671
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,320
What interesting?

672
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,900
I won't take off my clothes.

673
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,600
What a dirty mind.

674
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,560
Get a pen.

675
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,080
Have you found one?

676
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,740
Watch out.

677
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,450
Here it is.

678
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,440
= A horror film.
Let's play Bunshinsaba.

679
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,540
No, I am not playing.

680
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,810
Come on, I'll protect you.

681
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,340
I'll protect you too.

682
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,090
No, I am afraid.

683
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,300
Chen Xiaoxi,

684
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,380
if you are the only one here

685
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,620
who don't join this game,

686
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,620
when the Bunshinsaba comes in

687
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,570
and finds out you don't respect him,

688
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,020
he will strangle you.

689
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,730
All right, count me in.

690
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,860
Come on.

691
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,940
Let's do this.

692
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,850
You freak me out!

693
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,260
Why don't you make a sound when coming in?

694
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:19,930
Don't let go.

695
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,040
Don't.

696
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,760
If we let go, he will get mad.

697
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,320
Your Bunshinsaba gets angry easily.

698
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,020
All right. Let's stop here.

699
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,490
Bunshinsaba, Bunshinsaba,

700
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,620
take a rest, we don't bother you.

701
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,300
Wish the best for you.

702
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,370
Wish the best for you.

703
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,560
Where have you been?

704
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,370
I was freaked out.

705
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,700
They forced me to join.

706
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,200
I think you had a great time.

707
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,170
Xiaoxi,

708
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,920
I realized you like this very much from our last snack shopping.

709
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,820
I'll come back for it.

710
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,340
You think Bunshinsaba doesn't exist, don't you?

711
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,860
Many things can't be explained by science.

712
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,210
What you haven't met doesn't mean its inexistence.

713
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,660
Don't scare me.

714
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,170
What questions did you ask?

715
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,130
Lu Yang asked

716
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,000
whether his future girlfriend has long hair.

717
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,850
Bunshinsaba answered yes.

718
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,970
Lin Jingxiao asked

719
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,380
whether some Ta will find some Lae.

720
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,120
Bunshinsaba answered yes.

721
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,500
Wu Bosong asked...

722
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,840
Did you ask the most important question?

723
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,860
I was too shy to ask...

724
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,210
What kind of question?

725
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,980
I am afraid if I ask him

726
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,010
whether you like me,

727
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,680
he answers no.

728
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,690
Then I could never like you any more.

729
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,120
Why?

730
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,980
That kind of "like" makes me sad.

731
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,380
You know he doesn't care about you at all,

732
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,380
but still have to pretend to be optimistic.

733
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm afraid if I tell you someday,

734
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,980
you will tell me that

735
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,720
you will never like me,

736
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,690
and let me give up.

737
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
That was grief talking.

738
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,740
Don't take it personally.

739
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,800
Don't tell me you will never like me someday.

740
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,560
What I wanted to ask,

741
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,610
the question you asked Bunshinsaba,

742
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,240
isn't what you thought.

743
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,660
What did you want to ask?

744
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,770
You little fool.

745
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,730
What is Rosetta and Philae you asked about?

746
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,060
In 2004, Europe launched a probe named Rosetta,

747
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,250
it went into the universe carrying Philae.

748
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,080
Later Philae landed on the comet,

749
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,120
and lost contact with Rosetta.

750
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,290
They kept waiting for each other's message

751
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,860
in the vast universe.

752
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,540
Don't you think it's moving?

753
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,450
That's why I love astronomy.

754
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,210
I think stars are beautiful.

755
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,620
So do I.

756
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,650
Lin Jingxiao,

757
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,860
do you have a crush on someone?

758
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,090
No.

759
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,060
I see.

760
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,460
I see.

761
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,610
Why do you ask that?

762
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,770
Just suddenly come to my mind.

763
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,280
What you like is classy.

764
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,090
Not like me.

765
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,360
I only like playing video games.

766
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,130
I have a problem with my heart.

767
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,530
I can only play video games.

768
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,900
Come on.

769
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,210
Have fun with it.

770
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,800
That is a blessing in disguise.

771
00:42:59,170 --> 00:42:59,970
I can't sleep.

772
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,780
Let's play one more game.

773
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,250
Let us sleep. It's the middle of the night.

774
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,100
=I have a crush on someone, but I can't tell you.

775
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,220
I'll see first.

776
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,500
=Rosetta will find Philae.

777
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,180
=I like the girl with longest hair.

778
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,700
=I like Xiaoxi.

779
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,660
We should keep secrets.

780
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,960
Don't tell others.

781
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,290
How do you feel?

782
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,260
Not worse than Hainan, isn't it?

783
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,170
Come on.

784
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:23,500
I feel so good. Hear my shout.

785
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,880
Your turn.

786
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,730
My turn?

787
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,000
I hope Lu Yang shut up.

788
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,500
Your turn.

789
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,610
I hope you can all come

790
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,810
to see me win the day after tomorrow.

791
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:44,500
Bro.

792
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,740
I hope Jiang Chen can shout.

793
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:53,480
Your turn.

794
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,810
Long live the Manchester United.

795
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,440
You shouted.

796
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,570
Are you okay?

797
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,250
I don't want to have my homework.

798
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,640
I don't want to go home.

799
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,440
Zhang Shiliang, I'm not afraid of you.

800
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,140
=Public-health license.

801
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,340
You're back.
=Public-health license.

802
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:30,780
You're back.

803
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,540
You should have done it earlier.

804
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,140
It's so simple.

805
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,490
We could have started the store.

806
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,420
Just go online and it's done.

807
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,340
No call is needed.

808
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,300
Now you know,

809
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,120
follow the rules.

810
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,840
You are opening a mom-and-pop store?

811
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:48,640
Back off.

812
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,480
You stayed out all night. Don't shout.

813
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:52,500
Have your lunch.

814
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,490
Yes, sir.

815
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,180
Have lunch.

816
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,780
=Natatorium.

817
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,890
Wu Bosong.

818
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,250
Wu Bosong.

819
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,340
Wu Bosong.

820
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,000
Are you okay?

821
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,600
Relax.

822
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,180
Keep your cool, you'll be the champion.

823
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,420
I'm not nervous.

824
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,440
If you win, I'll treat you a meal.

825
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:21,890
Deal.

826
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,240
Wu Bosong.

827
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,080
There you go, Wu Bosong.

828
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,010
There you go.

829
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,330
Wu Bosong, get rid of them by three laps.

830
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,690
It's a short race.

831
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,340
What do you know?

832
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,280
Don't shout so loudly.

833
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,180
It will start soon.

834
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,080
There you go, Wu Bosong.

835
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,960
There you go.

836
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,980
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

837
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,320
I won't watch his competition again.

838
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,050
Get rid of them, Wu Bosong.

839
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,860
There you go.

840
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,060
I won't watch his competition again.

841
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,060
See? He is my friend.

842
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,740
He is my deskmate. My deskmate.

843
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,980
Wu Bosong, congratulations.

844
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,680
Please talk out your feeling of winning.

845
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,610
What is your motivation

846
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,920
of winning the competition so easily.

847
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:53,440
She is my motivation.

848
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,700
It's all soaked.
