00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,040
=Extra story: Want to sing me to you

2
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:39,839
Let's go.

3
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,880
Jiang Chen, Let's go to play football.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,719
No.

5
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,200
Only you left.

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
Look.

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,119
We are classmates.

8
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,799
But you haven't played with me for one time.

9
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
Just this time!

10
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,719
Be quick!

11
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,600
Stop hemming.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,240
Look.

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,119
You don't even remember the name of other classmates.

14
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
If you play, you will remember.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
Chen Xiaoxi said you've won the VIP?

16
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,240
Really?

17
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,839
What VIP?

18
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,600
It's MVP!

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,879
Are you going to play football?

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
I have some questions to ask.

21
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,839
Then I'd better go to play football.

22
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,879
Let's go!

23
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,200
No matter you are a girl,

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,160
a goddess,

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,520
or a female nerve,

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
we will provide light and stage

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,920
as long as you want to sing

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,759
Sing as your pleasure!

29
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,599
We are waiting for you at auditions of Super Girls.

30
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,920
Chen Xiaoxi.

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,599
A day without effort is a day without comfort.

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
Good morning,judges.

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,399
My name is Chen Xiaoxi.

34
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,679
I'm sixteen years old.

35
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm a senior one student.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
=This champion is owe to his company.
I'm a senior one student.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,160
I like singing very much.
=This champion is owe to his company.

38
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,800
# I'll go on, please be ready. #

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,800
I know that if I go public with my romantic will embitter my fans.

40
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,879
But I have no choice.

41
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,360
My boy friend Jiang Chen has already begged me for one year

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,920
to give him a name.

43
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,479
I do.

44
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,239
Morning.

45
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,920
I'm learning English vocabulary.

46
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,200
Is she out of her mind?

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,959
I think so.

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,160
I've heard that an upperclassman

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,800
degraded her records and went crazy.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,959
Boring. Stupid.

51
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:06,479
Stupid.

52
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,479
s-t-u-p-i-d.

53
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,280
Stupid.

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,159
# I like your mouth and your dimples. #

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,080
Jiang Chen.

56
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,400
Didn't you transfer to another school?

57
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,599
What?

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,719
It was she

59
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,319
who said you transferred to a school in Chang Sha.

60
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,439
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
Are you mad?

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,599
I shouldn't have transferred you to another school.

63
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,240
If I transfer you I will ask your permission.

64
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,759
I will respect your choice.

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
Wait…

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,599
You won't transfer to another school, right?

67
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,599
If you transfer, what about me?

68
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:13,920
No, no, no.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,360
You won't transfer to another school.

70
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,080
You don't even go to your mom's house.

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,920
All right.

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,960
Are we close?

73
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,240
I transfer or not,

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,999
I go to my mom's house or not,

75
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,120
that is none of your business.

76
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,640
Who has a repeater?

77
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,159
Who has a repeater?

78
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,599
Who uses repeaters now?

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,319
It's MP3's world.

80
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:08,840
Chen Xiaoxi.

81
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,800
I'll take it.

82
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,960
# I like your eyes and eyebrows which is your pride. #

83
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,479
# I like your dimples and mouth which is your smile. #

84
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,039
# Everyone in this world know I like you and no joke. #

85
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
# I'll go on, please be ready. #

86
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,960
Chen Xiaoxi!

87
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,719
I'm not off key.

88
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,719
Listen and you will find out.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,520
Pretty good.

90
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,920
What happened?

91
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,319
Burglar?

92
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Your dad can't find his coupon.

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,319
Not seen.

94
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,200
Xiaoxi.

95
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,879
Come here.

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,159
What happened?

97
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,279
Why are you so serious?

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,439
I didn't take your coupon.

99
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,240
Did I say you took my coupon?

100
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,840
You are guilty.

101
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,279
That's what liars look like.

102
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,080
Dad.

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,759
You have no proof.

104
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,920
Ok.

105
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,640
Proof.

106
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:36,800
Tell me.

107
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,920
Has the result of mid-term exam been published?

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,159
Has it?

109
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:43,640
No.

110
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
Liar!

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,719
Can you stop lying?

112
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,800
Your homeroom teacher called me!

113
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,840
You are lawless!

114
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
Lying all the time.

115
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,640
The coupon, it must be her who took it.

116
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm not even interested.

117
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,920
You are wrong.

118
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,960
Wrong.

119
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,159
Xiaoxi.

120
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,479
We are going to attend a lecture.

121
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,159
The breakfast is on the table.

122
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
Remember to eat.

123
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,999
Money is also on the table.

124
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,039
Take it to buy lunch.

125
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,240
Take care of yourself.

126
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,840
Enough.

127
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,720
Leave her.

128
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,480
Nobody can force her to eat except herself.

129
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,600
Let's go.

130
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,480
Xiaoxi.

131
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,119
What?

132
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
She didn't have her breakfast.

133
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,679
Xiaoxi?

134
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,040
Xiaoxi is not at home.

135
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,040
=I didn't take the coupon.

136
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,200
Did she run away from home?

137
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,119
Chen Guowei!

138
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,720
If I lost my daughter.

139
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,119
You are done.

140
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,919
Jiang Chen, have you seen Xiaoxi?

141
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,359
No.

142
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,280
Her dad compliant her last day.

143
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
She ran away from home.

144
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,840
Her phone is power off.

145
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,759
I'm worried about her.

146
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,200
Where did she go?

147
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,439
Tell her to call me if you see her.

148
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,280
Ok.

149
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,840
It's all because of you!

150
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
Can you stop blaming me?

151
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Go find her!

152
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,799
Go!

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,520
I'm sixteen years old.

177
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,119
Are you stammering?

178
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,679
No, no.

179
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm just nervous.

180
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,960
Do you like singing?

181
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,600
Yes.

182
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,040
Ok. You can start.

183
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:18,480
# I like your eyes and eyebrows which is your pride. #

184
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,160
# I like your dimples and mouth which is your smile. #

185
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,640
# Everyone in this world know I like you and no joke. #

186
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,160
# I'll go on, please be ready. #

187
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,319
# I like your shirt and fingers which is your smell. #

188
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:41,799
# I want to be your coat and gloves and heartbeat. #

189
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,200
Ok. Stop. You may leave.

190
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,799
Judge.

191
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm too nervous.

192
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,640
One more chance please.

193
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
I will sing better.

194
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,319
No excuse. Leave.

195
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,600
This is not my usual singing.

196
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,119
Enough.

197
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,359
Don't waste our time.

198
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,999
I want to say something.

199
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,239
Number 36736.

200
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,239
Is Ye Yiqian here?

201
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,679
I have something to say.

202
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Next time when you run away form home,

203
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,679
don't tell me where you go.

204
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,239
But I only remember your number.

205
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,200
Call your mom.

206
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,879
But my phone died.

207
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,239
Hello?

208
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:09,359
Mom.

209
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,720
My dad said they will be here soon.

210
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:23,840
Wait.

211
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,840
Jiang Chen.

212
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,319
Can I borrow some money?

213
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,160
What's for?

214
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,919
I'm starving.

215
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,359
Let's go.

216
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,359
Wait a second.

217
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,400
I need to wash my face.

218
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,280
I want to go to the washroom.

219
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,399
Did you eat all of them?

220
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,080
But, I can have another bowl.

221
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:46,840
Waitress.

222
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,000
Sir.

223
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,159
One fried rice.

224
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:54,760
Ok.

225
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,399
A large one.

226
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,200
Ok.

227
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,720
It's not like that.

228
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,279
I didn't eat anything today.

229
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,600
I don't eat that much.

230
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,360
Just half of Li Wei's appetite.

231
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,720
Who is Li Wei?

232
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
Nobody.

233
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,360
That's not important.

234
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,919
But…

235
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,399
She eats more than me.

236
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,559
Where are we going?

237
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,120
It's near the freeway exit.

238
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,880
Wait your parents here.

239
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,799
Good sense of direction.

240
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,080
Indeed, you are the compass of my life.

241
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,519
Did you come here by bus?

242
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,039
Me too. What a coincidence!

243
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
Guess what I saw on the bus.

244
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,919
I saw a cock.

245
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,159
Alive! Crowing!

246
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,360
Can you please be quiet?

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
Jiang Chen, you like watching this kind of show.

248
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,080
I think other participants are not good

249
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
except for a girl called Ye Yiqian.

250
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,439
She is beautiful.

251
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,540
There's also a girl who dyes her hair in seven different colors

252
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,399
and eight holes in her ears.

253
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,240
What if I get my ears pierced?

254
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,679
What do you think?

255
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,760
I don't like it.

256
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
You don't like me pierced?

257
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,760
I didn't realise you are so strict.

258
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
I said I don't like watching this kind of show!

259
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,399
Hurry up!

260
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,360
Hurry for what?

261
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,919
Why not stay with me?

262
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,120
Hurry!

263
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,480
My foot hurts.

264
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,720
What's wrong?

265
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,639
I twisted my foot when I was dancing.

266
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,240
It hurts a lot.

267
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,840
Can we rest here?

268
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,880
As you like.

269
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,319
Go straight ahead at the first crossing of Qingnian Road.

270
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,000
We are here now.

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,639
Ok.

272
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,840
Is my dad still mad at me?

273
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,559
How could I know?

274
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,519
What's wrong with you?

275
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,880
You almost kill us!

276
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,120
What if you meet bad guys?

277
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,880
Mom.

278
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,279
Why are you angry with us?

279
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,639
Running way from home?

280
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:39,720
How old are you?

281
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,799
Can't you be mature?

282
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,279
Stop!

283
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,760
It wasn't me.

284
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,880
I didn't take your coupon.

285
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,600
I know. I know.

286
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:50,960
Forget that.

287
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,439
But the exam is your fault.

288
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,399
It's ok to get a low score.

289
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,039
But you should not lie to me.

290
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,439
Right?

291
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,159
When will she grow up?

292
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:08,559
If she is only as well as you do.

293
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,000
Thank you for today.

294
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,919
Sorry to trouble you.

295
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,960
It's ok.

296
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,200
You ignore me today.

297
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:32,080
I'll come to you tomorrow anyway.

298
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,559
What do you want to say?

299
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:41,519
I…

300
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,639
I want to say…

301
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,799
I have liked a boy for a long time.

302
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,159
I promised him I will sing this song for him.

303
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,840
I want to say to him.

304
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,799
I…

305
00:22:58,399 --> 00:22:59,840
I like him.
