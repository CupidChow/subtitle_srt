My name is Chen Xiaoxi.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

2
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,910
The most important thing in my life was him.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

3
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,120
I am really into you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,080
I don't.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,270
Jiang,

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,230
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,800
I brought you Baozi.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,080
Stop bringing me that.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,750
=Love letter
What the heck?

10
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:45,950
What the heck?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

11
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,990
What do you know?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

12
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,833
The person sitting before you,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,840
is the famous Casanova in Chenxi High School.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,950
Please tell me more about your love letter writing experience?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

15
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,480
Do me a favor then I'll teach you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,990
You are Wu Bosong, the new kid.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

17
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,950
That's me.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,630
Are you the bro in a gang?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

19
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,160
Yes.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,230
The love letter.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,120
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
They were reading Lu Yang's love letter.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,520
That's one filthy mouth you have. Let me clean that for you.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,910
Zhang Shiliang is coming.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

26
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,200
You wrote love letters, and started a gang fight.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,310
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

28
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,030
Mr. Zhang, reading them out loud is a violation of privacy.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

29
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,030
You shouldn't do that.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

30
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't you know our school has rules?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Mr. Zhang,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,230
there's no rule says you can invade students' privacy.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,790
Stop reading that.

=Episode 2
Can you give me a ride

36
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,870
- Did you finish your homework? - Yeah.

37
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,030
Lend it to me. I want to copy your answers.

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,760
Sure.

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,950
By the way, did you hear the news?

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,280
Someone is planing on attacking Chunchun's post bar.

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,590
And I heard that admin is selecting moderators.

42
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,950
- Really? - Yeah.

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,480
Should we try it?

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Looks like they've already made their decisions.

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,870
How about we send a text to find out more?

46
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,200
They're selecting moderators?

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,790
You can forget it.

48
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,590
What's their job description?

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,640
Stupid.

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,360
Ignorant.

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,280
That's uncalled for.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,920
I don't care that much.

53
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,920
You stood by the side of the road,

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,480
watching him disappear slowly at the corner of the road.

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,369
And his back told you,

56
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,980
there's no need to follow him.

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,610
=From Sincere Yumi: Are you JClove from Chunchun's post bar?
You were amazing last time.

58
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,710
=Others recommended you to be the moderator, are you interested?

59
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,310
there's no need to follow him.

60
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,950
Chen Xiaoxi,

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
you seem to have strong feelings about this paragraph.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,070
Stand up and share your thoughts with us.

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
The article is about your father left and don't follow him.

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,150
Just...

65
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,360
...don't follow him.

66
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,000
He will be back someday.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,230
He's not going to, kid.

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,760
Then he lives in my heart forever.

69
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,720
Fine, sit down.

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
You are too young now,

71
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,280
it's hard for you to get a grip of certain things.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,790
Just like the article says.

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,640
The relationships between father and daughter, mother and son,

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,310
mean that what you have with them,

75
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,790
is to watch them slowly grow apart with you in your life.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,950
So,

77
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,670
you should...

78
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,280
...treat your parents well.

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,120
All right.

80
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,630
Today's assignment.

81
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,750
To write an article about your parents.

82
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,600
Course Reps will collect everyone's article by Wednesday.

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,510
Jiang Chen was acting a bit weird today.

84
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,560
He hasn't said a single word.

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,190
Since when did he speak more than three words per day?

86
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,190
I just thought he was a mute at the beginning of the term.

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,600
All right, you're so protective.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,320
Fill your cup.

89
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you know what a moderator do?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,440
You don't know that?

91
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,840
I don't.

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,510
Do you know how many Yumi we have at Chunchun's post bar?

93
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,790
One thousand?

94
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,840
One hundred thousand!

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,350
The moderator will be the second-most powerful person in post bar.

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,230
Think about the perks you'd be getting.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,400
You can forget to be in power in your lifetime.

98
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,510
You are destined to be a civilian.

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm the new moderator in Chunchun's  post bar.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
What?

101
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,630
Really?

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,000
Xiaoxi, you're the new moderator?

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,320
We are classmates,

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,670
can you grade our messages to the best?

105
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,280
Xiaoxi, let me help you with that.

106
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,790
No need.

107
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,790
Our moderator is not thirsty at the moment.

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,470
Why did they start to treat me so well?

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,950
You poor kid.

110
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,197
Even one clean official,

111
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:04,320
would end up with a load of money pretty soon.

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,670
What money?

113
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,950
Chen Xiaoxi, have you earned money?

114
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,840
That's called bribery.

115
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,790
Wu Bosong and Jiang Chen,

116
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,040
come and sit here.

117
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,320
Jiang Chen, after school...

118
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
Will you two go to the Internet cafe today after school?

119
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
I'm getting married.

120
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,950
No, I'm busy.

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,190
No, I'm busy.

122
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,880
Are you two my bros or not?

123
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
How can I not share my pride?

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
And you two will be getting...

125
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
...your own wives later.

126
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,790
Think about my pride and honor!

127
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,040
I have zero interest of watching you get married.

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,880
See? You're jealous!

129
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,470
Being a guest at my wedding would take no time!

130
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,600
Come on!

131
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,840
Wu Bosong,

132
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,470
come on!

133
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm not going.

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm evoking the bro code.

135
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,750
Let's go.

136
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,750
- We should go. - Go where?

137
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,400
To attend a wedding.

138
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,280
I haven't finished packing!

139
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,160
Come on, guys.

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,880
The ceremony is about to start.

141
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,950
That's her!

142
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,120
Start calling her...

143
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,600
...sister-in-law.

144
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,120
What?

145
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,840
Did you get them married too?

146
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,910
These two, one's level is too low for that,

147
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,720
and the other one is a celibate.

148
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,400
Come on.

149
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,560
Bro,

150
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,790
so is this the famous QQ?

151
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
No way, you don't know that?

152
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,840
I know, it's just I've never used it before.

153
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,040
I have a busy training schedule, and computer is not allowed.

154
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Let me patch up your childhood for you.

155
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,070
Done.

156
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,480
I'll be in this match, will you come to see me?
=Qianjiang Junior Professional Swimming Championship is coming

157
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,990
Do I have to pay?

158
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,400
I'll give you money if you come.

159
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,040
I'll be there to cheer for you.

160
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,240
=Note: Today is Jiang Chen father's death anniversary
I must be there for him

161
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,410
Manager,

162
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,160
have you seen a few students entering this place?

163
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,310
Let's get out of here.

164
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,840
Zhang Shiliang is coming.

165
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,280
Come on, let's go!

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,720
My bike is gone.

167
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Never mind the bike, let's just get out of here!

168
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,110
Bro, hop on!

169
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,950
Go, go, go!

170
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,680
Get your hands off me.

171
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,950
Let me hug you or I'll fall off the bike.

172
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,800
You have a nice figure!

173
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,750
Watch out!

174
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,480
Are you all right?

175
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,750
Chen Xiaoxi.

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,190
Are you all right? Get up.

177
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,110
Are you all right?

178
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,400
No, definitely not.

179
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,800
He's fine.

180
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,040
Get up! And stop acting!

181
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,310
Zhang Shiliang didn't see us back there, right?

182
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
I haven't finished my game.

183
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,550
It's the first game since I got married.

184
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,160
Let's go.

185
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,070
Go.

186
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,600
Your clothes are ruined.

187
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,820
Let's go.

188
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,190
Jiang Chen,

189
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,720
wait for me.

190
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,630
I wanted to tell you something.

191
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,630
Please don't hit me.

192
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,430
Did you lose your bike again?

193
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,430
You have agreed not to hit me, mother.

194
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,550
How did it happen?

195
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,510
I need to buy some test papers,

196
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,280
so I went to the bookstore after school.

197
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,920
Then when I came out of the bookstore, the bike was gone.

198
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,480
Recently, bikes have been stolen all day.

199
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,950
All right.

200
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,510
We'll buy you another one.

201
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,720
Mother,

202
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't really need a bike right now.

203
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,400
I want to walk to the school as doing exercises.

204
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,430
Mother, is Jiang Chen's father...

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,800
Chen,

206
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,600
Jiang Chen father's death anniversary is coming.

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,480
Should we be there for him?

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,840
Yanjun is going to be back for him.

209
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,720
Mother, should we prepare something for Jiang Chen?

210
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
His mother is coming back.

211
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
As a boy,

212
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,360
he must have no idea what to prepare for her.

213
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,160
As his neighbor, we should help out if we can.

214
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,950
- All right. - Right?

215
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,720
Sure.

216
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,680
You can buy some daily necessities for him.

217
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,630
# Jiang Chen is going to take me to school. #

218
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,070
# We are going to school together. #

219
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,480
What?

220
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,720
Doing exercise?

221
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,750
Can I ask you about something?

222
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,510
Hop on.

223
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,110
So,

224
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,950
what do older women like?

225
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,600
Take your mother as an example.

226
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
What kind of gift from you would make her happy?

227
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,870
My mother?

228
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,070
Maybe a new husband.

229
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,840
A new husband.

230
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,480
That maybe out of my reach.

231
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,950
What else does she want?

232
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,480
I'll skip your secret talk.

233
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,360
I'm going to swim.

234
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,510
Bye.

235
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,680
How's your moderator life treating you?

236
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
Not bad.

237
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,870
Deleting and grade messages.

238
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,310
You'll grade their messages whenever they ask you to?

239
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,240
Or what?

240
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,870
Why won't you just listen to me?

241
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,630
What did I say?

242
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,586
Even one clean official would end up...

243
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,310
...with a load of money pretty soon.

244
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,990
Yeah. You need to pull rank.

245
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,600
Or no one would treat you as a leader.

246
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Xiaoxi, this is for you.

247
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,630
Can you grade my message to the best?

248
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,110
Well,

249
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,280
I'm busy defending Chunchun's post bar recently,

250
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,070
I don't have time for that.

251
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,840
Send me a link of your message,

252
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,280
and I'll think about it later.

253
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Take this.

254
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,110
What are you doing?

255
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,240
Our  post bar has rules that

256
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,280
leaders can't take bribes from others.

257
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,040
So,

258
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,480
some students wrote...

259
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,240
...excellent essays in our last assignment.

260
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
For example, Xu Nan,

261
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,800
Li Wei, and Jiang Chen.

262
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,280
Especially Jiang Chen.

263
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,870
His essay was quite touching.

264
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,480
This class, let's listen to their essays.

265
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,160
Jiang Chen,

266
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,280
would you like to read your essay to us?

267
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,110
Give it a go.

268
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,920
Mr. Liu, I don't want to.

269
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,750
All right.

270
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,750
Anyone who would like to read his essay for him?

271
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,190
Mr. Liu, pick her.

272
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,430
Xiaoxi has behaved well in class lately.

273
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,280
It should be noted.

274
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Thank you.

275
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
My father.

276
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,920
Written by Jiang Chen.

277
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:56,310
I don't remember there was any fatherly support in my life.

278
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,430
A man's memory is never complete.

279
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,920
At least mine was.

280
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,480
All I remembered about my father,

281
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,240
was that when I was seven years old,

282
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,510
my little brother accidentally fell because of me,

283
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,920
he cried out loud.

284
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,070
Then my father came over and he shoved me.

285
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,160
I was only seven back then.

286
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,950
That was the first time I tried to run away from home.

287
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,680
I sat by the river all alone,

288
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,240
crying while waiting for him to come and get me.

289
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,240
He didn't come until sundown.

290
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,480
Then he took me to a noodle shop.

291
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,600
I sat on the back of his bike,

292
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,510
passing all these streets and people,

293
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,400
while hearing about the CCTV News along the way.

294
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,800
Maybe that moment was one of the few moments

295
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,360
I ever feel so close to my father.

296
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,990
Are you still angry with me?

297
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Here,

298
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,680
I'll give you my egg.

299
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,680
Eat.

300
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,800
Jiang Chen.

301
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm deeply touched by your essay.

302
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,160
Does your father still treat you like that?

303
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,400
Jiang Chen,

304
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,310
let's go home together after school today.

305
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,430
Okay.

306
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,680
Hey.

307
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,510
You can come and eat at my house tonight.

308
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,310
You can take the bike.

309
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,400
I have other plans.

310
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,110
Leave the key on my doorstep.

311
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,830
Buying all these stuff is useless,

312
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,800
I don't suppose Jiang Chen is gonna marry you for that.

313
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,510
You silly.

314
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,110
Haven't you heard that...

315
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,470
...if you want a man's heart,

316
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,110
win his mother's first.

317
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
What's his mother got to do with you?

318
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,470
You don't understand.

319
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,350
He didn't say much,

320
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,350
yet he definitely wanted his mother to be there for him.

321
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,510
He was so lost these days.

322
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,510
So you're trying to buttering up your mother-in-law.

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,470
That's too far away.

324
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,320
What if we had to live together once we get married?

325
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,680
You're the one to talk.

326
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,990
Tell me,

327
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,280
what's it like to have feelings for someone?

328
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,400
It's like whenever I see him,

329
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,920
everything else just fades away.

330
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,870
He is glowing in the crowd.

331
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,870
So it's like he took the Budda with him.

332
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,680
It's not like that.

333
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,200
Do you remember that time I told you why did I fall for him?

334
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,990
The story of the rich guy buys his books.

335
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,590
Ever since that day,

336
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,870
each time I think about that scene,

337
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,470
I couldn't help to retouch it.

338
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,110
I'd adjusting the screen angle, adding lights and shadows,

339
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,400
and a soundtrack.

340
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Sir.

341
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,830
Can I help you?

342
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,160
I want to buy this.

343
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,800
How much for this?

344
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,040
Ten yuan.

345
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,320
Thank you so much, sir.

346
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,710
Just tell me that you're into him because of his money,

347
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,160
and his books.

348
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,590
Sometimes,

349
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,440
it's so simple to have feelings for someone.

350
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,320
It is?

351
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,710
It's not?

352
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,680
It is?

353
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,280
It's not?

354
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,230
It is?

355
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,280
Xiaoxi, have you considered our proposal?

356
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,080
Well.

357
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,680
I...

358
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,560
post bar's interest should be my top priority, not yours.

359
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,160
Leaders have a lot on their plate.

360
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,960
Don't try to sway me.

361
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,510
Let me think about that.

362
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,590
See?

363
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,160
It feels so cool, isn't it?

364
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,960
Definitely.

365
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,560
They are the ones who like to brag.

366
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,350
Right.

367
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,750
When post bar's attack happens, ditch them.

368
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,960
It's tomorrow, right?

369
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
No way.

370
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,400
What's wrong?

371
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,040
I already have plans for tomorrow.

372
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,240
=To Sincere Yumi: Admin, this is JClove. I just found out that
I have to take extra classes tomorrow.

373
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,800
=I'm so sorry I can't be there to defend our post bar.
But I swear that will never happen again.

374
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,040
=Sending...

375
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,340
=Message sent

376
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,540
=From Sincere Yumi: Thank you for you contribution to our post bar, looks like you're busy studying.

377
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,000
=In order to let you focus on your study, I'm afraid I'll have to revoke your status as the moderator.

378
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,750
You didn't ride your bike today?

379
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,960
Hop on, let me take you home.

380
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,920
Have you considered our proposal?

381
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,750
How about tonight?

382
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,400
I was fired earlier,

383
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm no longer the moderator.

384
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,440
But you've already taken our stuff!

385
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,350
I'll give the stuff back tomorrow.

386
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,870
I'm so sorry,

387
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,800
I'll give them back tomorrow.

388
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Bro, are you waiting for me?

389
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,710
Hop on.

390
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,470
Excuse me.

391
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,630
How could she do that?

392
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,590
That's so mean.

393
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,350
Stop the bike!

394
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,440
I thought it'd be great to be the moderator,

395
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,230
then I got fired right away.

396
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,920
So embarrassing.

397
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,560
Being a moderator is nothing compared to be my bro.

398
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,920
You are the bro of an Olympic gold medalist.

399
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
You can win an Olympic gold medal?

400
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,160
Come to my match tomorrow and see for yourself.

401
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,360
=Natatorium

402
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,052
Today is the third day of the

403
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:00,590
Qiangjiang Junior Professional Swimming Championships.

404
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,750
Sixteen teams took part in this Championship.

405
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,870
After three days and seven matches,

406
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,680
eight swimmers have entered this round.

407
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,990
Such as Wu Bosong and Liu Yang.

408
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,470
The match is about to start.

409
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,400
Here comes Wu Bosong.

410
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
He once won the gold metals of the 200-meter freestyle,

411
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,280
and the 200-meter medley relay.

412
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,320
He is expected to bring home more...

413
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,870
Wu Bosong, you're the best!

414
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,830
On your marks.

415
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,430
=Work hard and show them what you got

416
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,270
Wu Bosong, you're the best!

417
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,670
Wu Bosong, you're the best!

418
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,670
Wu Bosong, you're the best!

419
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,680
Wu Bosong, come on!

420
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,610
Yes, Gao Zhiting is the winner!

421
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,970
=Gao Zhiting 51.24s
Wu Bosong 51.33s

422
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,630
Wu Bosong, you've never been the runner up before,

423
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,750
how does that make you feel?

424
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,080
Actually, sports...

425
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,960
Wu Bosong,

426
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
you're the best!

427
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,040
Bosong, you're the best!

428
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,660
=Wu Songbo, come on!

429
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,870
Being the runner up is fine by me.

430
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,080
Are you all right?

431
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,350
Nope.

432
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,560
You gave a poor performance back there.

433
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,400
See for yourselves.

434
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,800
This is so below your normal level.

435
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,200
Can you win next time?

436
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,630
Jiang Rui is sick.

437
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,960
I can't go back this time.

438
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,590
Take care of yourself,

439
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,230
and I have transferred money to your account for daily use.

440
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,590
Wu Bosong,

441
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,750
though you were only the runner up,

442
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
it's fine.

443
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
Better things are yet to come.

444
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,350
Your bro is going to buy you dinner.

445
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,400
Are you still upset?

446
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,160
Liu Xiang was the runner up before he succeeded.

447
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
Don't worry.

448
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,800
Just guess how many times have I got the first place?

449
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,110
Tell me.

450
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,146
When I was little,

451
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:30,710
I could make a plastic hand rope faster than anyone.

452
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,200
When I was in middle school,

453
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,230
I could draw the most vivid picture of my teacher pick his nose.

454
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,400
And,

455
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,040
that's about it.

456
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,990
See, I've achieved a lot less than you.

457
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,920
Does that make you feel better?

458
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,350
Yeah.

459
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,590
Take me for an example,

460
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,179
I've been suffering setbacks for sixteen years,

461
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,560
and I never stopped fighting.

462
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,470
I'm one tough girl, and that is so touching.

463
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,800
Right, I need to learn from you.

464
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,320
The boy is worth teaching.

465
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,350
Waiter, how long do we have to wait for our noodles?

466
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,680
Could you give that to me?

467
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,830
I misspelled your name.

468
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,470
I'll give you a perfect poster next time.

469
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,630
It's all right, it happens a lot.

470
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,510
That's right, isn't it?

471
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,080
Like my primary school homework to distinguish honey from bees.

472
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,870
Finally I made you laugh.

473
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,200
Seriously,

474
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,960
give that poster to me.

475
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,560
How about I trade you with this silver medal?

476
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,680
That's fine.

477
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,960
I can't have dinner with you today.

478
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,110
I gotta go now.

479
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,710
Right now?

480
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,920
It's kind of an emergency.

481
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,750
Next time, you'll buy me dinner.

482
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,160
I like steaks.

483
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,510
Exchange the token with me.

484
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,750
I could draw you ten posters if you like.

485
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,350
It's the unwritten rule to return the favor.

486
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,440
I'll trade it back with a gold metal.

487
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,800
All right.

488
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,350
I gotta go.

489
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,890
=From mom: Do you need money or anything else?
I'll be back in a few days.

490
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,830
Jiang Chen,

491
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,510
can I come in?

492
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,200
What's that?

493
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,320
I bought them for you.

494
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,470
I thought your mother is about to be back,

495
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,160
so I volunteered to buy her some necessities.

496
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,920
You boys,

497
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,440
always buy the wrong stuff.

498
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,320
So I picked up something not only beautiful, but also practical.

499
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,870
It should fit your mother.

500
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,830
No need. Take them away.

501
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,870
Why?

502
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,630
Did I buy the wrong kind of necessities?

503
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,280
I don't need them, just take them away.

504
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,040
What's wrong?

505
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,710
Have you prepared things for her already?

506
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,870
Why should I?

507
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,590
Then why won't you take mine?

508
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,320
You hate me that much that you wouldn't take my stuff?

509
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,710
That's right, please leave.

510
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,080
I won't.

511
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,920
Why are you trying to keep everyone away from you?

512
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,200
Do you hate the ones who treat you well?

513
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,320
You hate me and your mother.

514
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,230
Your mother has been calling,

515
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,830
asking my mother how is her son doing.

516
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,040
Is he doing well? Sick or not?

517
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,920
Why won't he reply any of her texts?

518
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,710
Can't you see all that?

519
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,710
Or you're just pretend not to.

520
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,470
Leave.

521
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,800
Just shut your doors,

522
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,680
and never let anyone in!

523
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,510
Yanjun won't be back this time.

524
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
I don't understand,

525
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,920
how could she leave her son alone like that?

526
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,160
How old was Jiang Chen when his father died?

527
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,510
His mother was absent at his father's funeral.

528
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,080
Surely he's devastated.

529
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,750
You can't blame everything on Yanjun.

530
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,510
So you're taking her side?

531
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,400
You care about He Yanjun, who's gonna care for Jiang Chen?

532
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,560
All right.

533
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,830
Let's change the subject.

534
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,440
By the way,

535
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,110
Xiaoxi,

536
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,160
the property management company just issued this notice.

537
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,470
Bring it to Jiang Chen after dinner.

538
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,870
=The notice of Premises Liability

539
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,510
With no adults present,

540
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,230
he has to handle every single thing by himself.

541
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,230
I'm full.

542
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,080
What's the rush?

543
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,860
=Medicine to treat cold and fever

544
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,960
Jiang Chen,

545
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,350
I'm here to bring you a notice.

546
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,510
And I'm sorry for earlier,

547
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,110
I didn't know that your mother won't be back.

548
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,000
Welcome.

549
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,160
I'll have one fried noodles and one fried egg.

550
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,960
Sure.

551
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,630
Here,

552
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,160
I'll give you my egg.

553
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,240
Why did you come alone today?

554
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,110
I haven't seen you for quite a while.

555
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,310
By the way,

556
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,830
how's your father?

557
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
He's fine.

558
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,680
That's good to hear.

559
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,720
Come back.

560
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,110
=To mother: I know, take care of Jiang Rui.

561
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,810
=Sending...

562
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,240
Xiaoxi, time to get up.

563
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,590
Father,

564
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,520
how about buying me a new bike?

565
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,480
Morning.

566
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,550
Morning.

567
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,270
The back seat on your bike looks comfy.

568
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,070
Don't know if that's true.

569
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,440
The seat must've been warm in winter and cool in summer.

570
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,070
Well,

571
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,110
can I just hop on?

572
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,550
No, you can't.

573
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,720
I weigh so little.

574
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,240
Mother,

575
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,240
father died a long time ago.

576
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,790
However.

577
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,070
# You don't have a father figure in your family. #

578
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:30,830
# My husband's father died very young, #

579
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:42,160
# leaving a widow and an orphan behind. #

580
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,960
# I'm going to take care of you and your mother. #

581
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,200
Oh, my husband.

582
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,480
Don't...

583
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,400
What the heck are you singing?

584
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,870
What did I do wrong?

585
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,350
Who's the widow and who's the orphan?

586
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
Who's without a father?

587
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,630
Father, I really didn't mean that.

588
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,870
You disobedient fool!

589
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,030
Father, I can explain...
