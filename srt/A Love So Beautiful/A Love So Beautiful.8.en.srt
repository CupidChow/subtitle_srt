He had just won the champion, so, why did they punish him?

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,244
Because of the interview by the girl

Bosong.

40
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,271
Why don't you go and apologize to the coach?

41
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,340
They care about you so much.

42
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,658
I go home now, buddy.

43
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,582
Dad, mom, I'm home.

44
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,922
Look, that date is ok, isn't it?

45
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,390
What're you doing?

46
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:35,421
Choose an lucky opening day for your mom's trotters shop.

47
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,529
Saturday is a lucky day.

48
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,107
let's see it.

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,872
Suitable for funeral and burying.

50
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,364
Funeral, nonsense. Stop interrupting.

51
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:49,989
- We're very busy. - Leave us.

52
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:52,629
They've just been so occupied with their stuff,

53
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:55,043
even forget their daughter's birthday.

54
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,558
No big deal even if becoming "King of Trotters".

55
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:06,103
Doctor, can the child whose father is Jiang Chen be saved?

56
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:18,275
You have to eat some snow lotus stewed for 49 days,

57
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,456
and drink a drop of blood from Kylin's heart,

58
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:25,493
in order to save your baby and yourself,

59
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:28,165
It sounds delicious, doesn't it?

60
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,924
- Why can't you play it seriously? - I'm hungry.

61
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,782
- I want to eat my birthday cake. - Enough.

62
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:39,024
You've reminded me a hundred times of your birthday,

63
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:42,188
and I've already got a good idea for you.

64
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:46,336
Chunchun will have her concert here on your birthday.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,468
- I'll go there with you. - I...

66
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:50,562
want to spend my birthday...

67
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,344
with Jiang Chen.

68
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:02,267
You always take love more seriously than friendship.

69
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,345
- Forget it. - Manchester United's coming to Hangzhou for a game.

70
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,291
I want to watch it with Jiang Chen.

71
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,893
Are you going to buy the ticket for him?

72
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:15,057
- Yeah. - You don't know how expensive the ticket is.

73
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:20,102
You have to sell your internal organs to buy it.

74
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,930
And anyway, it's your birthday, not his.

75
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:26,600
Jiang Chen is a fan of MU which rarely come to Hangzhou.

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,383
It's nothing to do with birthday.

77
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:31,452
By the way...

78
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:35,467
whose slip did you get at that time?

79
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:39,325
I guess it's Lu Yang's, the writing is awful.

80
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,730
Do you know whose one I got?

81
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,026
Jiang Chen's?

82
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,115
Xiaoxi's birthday is coming, do something.

83
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,859
I know. She reminds me of it everyday.

84
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:59,647
Why doesn't she remind me?

85
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:04,233
She maybe worries that you could extravagantly buy her a yacht.

86
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:08,882
- So, what's your gift? - Nothing, she is only a kid.

87
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:11,991
Besides, Wu Bosong's here, so we don't have to give her gifts.

88
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,365
Are we all buddies?

89
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:17,263
Take it, my pocket money for this week.

90
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,115
You and I must help Xiaoxi.

91
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,545
She likes MU now, and wants to get game tickets.

92
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,717
Alright, I've got a buddy who can get tickets.

93
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:28,412
But, how could she suddenly be interested in MU?

94
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:30,974
Handsome players.

95
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,005
Bosong, what happened to you and your dad now?

96
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,919
- No big deal. - But you are kicked out of the house?

97
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,396
How do you know that?

98
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,942
He is "the Flower of School" who is also known as "Big Mouth".

99
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,981
- Stop it. - I'm going for water.

100
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,566
- So where will you sleep at night? - What about my house?

101
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:53,958
My mom is away for work.

102
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,956
I'm going to my grandma's house.

103
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,709
Come on.

104
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,427
- What? - I have a question.

105
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,864
Whose slip did you get at that time?

106
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,194
Lin jingxiao's.

107
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:30,813
- So the slip in my hand is really his. - What're you muttering?

108
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,885
Happiness comes to me so suddenly,

109
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,909
and it almost makes me cry.

110
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:55,208
"Mother", written by Luofu,

111
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:58,348
"Ah, mother!

112

Your greatness created my body,

113
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:05,598
Your greatness shaped my soul,

114
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:09,902
Your life is the voyage of love.

115
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,308
- Ah, mother!" - Wait, wait...

116
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,237
What's going on?

117
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:21,545
Mom, I'm asking for money.

118
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,701
- Mother... - Shut up.

119
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,036
Ok, I buy some quiet with money.

120
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,825
Stop bothering me.

121
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:37,035
- Please give me a little more. - How much?

122
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,727
- 500 yuan. - 500?

123
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:46,867
- Why do you want so much? - I want to see the soccer game.

124
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,742
MU's coming to Hangzhou.

125
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:51,187
It's maybe the only one chance to see them in my life.

126
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,787
I've never seen soccer game before, that's why I want to go.

127
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:58,162
You're a girl who doesn't like sports. Why go to soccer game?

128
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:01,350
You can watch it on TV if you like it.

129
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:12,298
=Good Opening

130
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,665
=Vacancies for Attendants to be Filled
Hourly Wage: 5 yuan

131
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,915
Boss!

132
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,274
Do you need a waitress?

133
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,642
The boss's out.

134
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,572
It's you!

135
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:33,476
Look, tell me the truth.

136
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:35,594
You said you'd go to your grandma's house.

137
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:40,681
- I'm afraid she'd have worried. - So, you plan to stay here.

138
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:42,969
Why do you come here, though?

139
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:44,993
I need money.

140
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,507
- To buy the game tickets? - How do you know?

141
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:51,023
Lin said you like MU recently because of...

142
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,429
their handsome players.

143
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,858
So, are there any vacancies here?

144
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:59,905
No, I'd have torn it off in the morning as the boss told me.

145
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,411
- Can we come in? - Welcome! Come in and take a seat.

146
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,615
- I have to go. - Bye.

147
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:06,467
Wait.

148
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,481
What did you write on the slip at that time?

149
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:16,672
"Huoguo". That's my favorite cuisine.

150
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:21,274
You like Huoguo? It'll be my treat!

151
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,609
As a swimmer, I can't eat anything at will.

152
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,717
Then, I'm gonna go.

153
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:34,051
Boss, is there any vacancy here?

154
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:37,871
- Boss, is there any vacancy here? - No.

155
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:41,785
- Boss, I want to be recruited. - All the vacancies are filled.

156
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:46,144
5 yuan per hour, but you must have the health certificate.

157
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,675
Thanks, boss.

158
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,697
Excuse me, is it the place for checkup...

159
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,798

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,188
Take off your trousers.

166
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:12,289
For anal examination!

167
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,850
Why keep your eyes on ground? Looking for money?

168
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,091
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:31,482
For what?

170
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,551
I can't give you what you want.

171
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,051
Is it right?

176

I always tell you,

177
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:59,499
you have to focus your attention on new words.

178
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:01,704
But, look at your faces now.

179
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,146
=We'll go out for a trip!

180
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:32,774
Is this sentence right?

181
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,930
- Obviously, there is a mistake here, isn't it? - Yes.

182
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,235
What is it?

183
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,170
=- We'll go out for a trip! - Ok.

184
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:50,029
When you do your homework after school,

185
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:55,069
everyone has to remember the new words. It's very important.

186
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:56,974
I'll dictate them next class.

187
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,661
Now I've got some good news to tell you.

188
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,372
Wu Bosong has won a national champion in the race.

189
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,626
Thank you, thank you.

190
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,704
Keep at it, Wu Bosong.

191
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:22,118
Now it's the time to replay the race on TV. Let's watch it.

192
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,748
Very intense. Wu Bosong is rushing to the finish line.

193
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,412
He's a step away from champion.

194
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:32,685
He is swimming excellently. Wu is the champion!

195
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:44,266
What inspired you to win the race so easily?

196
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:47,863
She did.

197
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:01,204
Wu Bosong, "she did".

198
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:03,431
- Wang Dazhuang! - Stop it!

199
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,806
You'd better go to the washroom before next class begins.

200
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,961
Let's go.

201
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:11,039
Awesome!

Have you got the ticket yet?

204
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,880
No, it's sold out.

205
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:39,528
Who's your favorite in MU?

206
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,433
Rooney

207
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,363
I like him, too.

208
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:58,040
Look, is that the girl Wu Bosong mentioned in TV?

209
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,274
- Chen Xiaoxi in Class 8? - I think it's her.

210
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,625
Little girl, are you Lu Yang's friend?

211
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:08,813
The jersey autographed by Rooney, 200 yuan.

212
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,281
Let me see it.

213
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,139
- Chinese writing? - Autographed it specially for Chinese fans.

214
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:21,608
- They're good at ingratiating themselves with fans. - So sweet.

215
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,444
Give me a discount.

216
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,679
Forget it, many people are waiting to buy it.

217
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,421
Wait, we buy it.

218
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:31,171
We buy it.

219
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:36,095
Why do you buy shirt for Jiang Chen?

220
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,568
I originally wanted to buy the ticket for him,

221
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,622
but that's too expensive, so, second best is OK.

222
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:49,086
Is she Wu Bosong's girlfriend?

223
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,500
A plain-looking girl in ugly clothes.

224
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:53,445
She doesn't deserve Wu Bosong, does she?

225
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,539
and isn't good at studying either.

226
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,343
Doesn't deserve?

227
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:01,006
Tell me why.

228
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,590
Yes, I certainly deserve him.

229
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,824
Hey, Jing, it's you.

230
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:17,745
They said I didn't deserve you.

231
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,417
I heard it's Wu Bosong.

232
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,008
We've just arrived.

233
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,891
What? Is he jealous?

234
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:34,554
He isn't.

235
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,953
But maybe he is.

236
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:44,514
The slip I got at the time was from Jiang Chen.

237
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:46,670
Then?

238
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,872
I'm probably going to...

239
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:52,544
What?

240
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,934
... fall in love.

241
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,362
What are you laughing at? Have you got the tickets?

242
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,743
No, my buddy said they're not available now.

243
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:06,736
It's very difficult to get them.

244
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:08,423
So...

245
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,829
- don't squander my money. - I'm not this kind of person.

246
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,516
What's more, the notes are probably not enough.

247
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,017
Maybe we have to pool money if the tickets are available.

248
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,789
So, it's better to give up.

249
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,586
Say it again! Say it again!

250
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,469
OK, OK, I'll call my buddy later.

251
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:30,939
Call him now! Go.

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,562
Hey,  Lu Yang.

253
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:43,217
Where are you recently?

254
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,889
- Still in Chenxi High School? - None of your business.

255
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:49,747
Lu Yang becomes a tough guy,

256
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:51,700
and it seems he's rich.

257
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,981
I just want to talk about old days with you,

258
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:57,762
- Remember that thing when we're kids? - Zhao Yue.

259
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,488
Shall I remind you?

260
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:04,535
What're you doing? I have no money.

261
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,259
Want to run away?

262
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,329
I have no money, Zhao Yue.

263
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,093
Hey, buddies,

264
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:33,937
help yourselves.

265
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,210
Are they delicious?

266
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,342
Bosong, are you living here?

267
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:40,983
Yeah, here is fine.

268
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,983
Earning money without spending it.

269
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:44,749
Why do you want to earn money?

270
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:48,749
You've already won lots of champions and rewards.

271
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:52,030
The rewards were absolutely in his dad's pocket, not his.

272
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,811
But why do you want to earn money?

273
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:58,350
- Buy MU game ticket. - The price is soaring.

274
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,310
It's probably not available even if you've got money.

275
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:06,029
In fact, I want you to ask the soccer team...

276
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:10,098
if they can get the tickets. You've got buddies there.

277
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:12,808
Since you ask me,

278
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,761
and invite us to have barbecue,

279
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:17,065
- I'll do it for you. - Thanks.

280
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:18,588
Help yourselves.

281
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:21,830
- You too. - Ok, drink it.

282
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:26,768

283
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,314

00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,828
I've raised the ideological level of the bulletin.

289
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,398
A girl...

290
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,437
- is reading "yellow press". - Don't move, Xiaoxi.

291
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:47,029
Erase it.

292
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,889
Do you think Chen Xiaoxi and Wu Bosong are really in love?

293
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:53,679
Absolutely, they've already made it public.

294
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,068
Wait, Jiang Chen, we go home...

295
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,271
Give me a minute.

296
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,443
Bye.

297
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,741
I note a certain tension in the room.

298
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,946
- Are you mad at me? - Let me go.

299
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,423
Please don't.

300
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,516
I planned to give it to you on Saturday when we're out.

301
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,616
but... here you are.

302
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,335
- The jersey autographed by Rooney. - I don't want it.

303
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,444
- And I cancel the trip on Saturday. - Why?

304
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,077
We've got an agreement,

305
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:55,045
and it's very difficult for me to buy the jersey.

306
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,515
I wanted to work part-time to get ticket,

307
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,132
- but run into Wu Bosong there, so... - How much it cost?

308
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,327
200 yuan.

309
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:08,913
Enough?

310
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:11,740
Don't follow me all the time.

311
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:14,520
Is it necessary to treat me like this?

312
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:16,544
Is it because I like you,

313
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:20,011
- so you blow up at me at will? - Did I force you to like me?

314
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:22,409
No,

315
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,073
you didn't,

316
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,495
it's me who was too amorous.

317
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,221
That's right.

318
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,791
My whole life is too long and I wouldn't only like you.

319
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:08,373
Bro, may I do my homework in your room?

320
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:11,225
As you wish.

321
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,325

A girl in my class said she liked me.

324
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:26,958
But...

325
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:30,847
next day, she was playing with another boy.

326
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,917
Did she go too far?

327
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,558
Cut the crap, do your homework.

328
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:51,211
Bro,

329
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,554
are you in a bad mood today?

330
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,585
Scratched by the puppy.

331
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:04,717
Why I've never met it before?

332
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:06,234
I'm really mad this time.

333
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:08,629
I'd rather be a dog than talking to him now.

334
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:14,097
But I'm scared he'd really be angry with me.

335
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:16,277
What if he never talk to me?

336
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:20,338
I mean, I'm always scared if someone brushes me off.

337
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:23,010
No, no, Jiang Chen is not someone.

338
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:26,455
I'm just more afraid of him than of anyone else.

339
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,556
What do you mean?

340
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:31,477
I mean...

341
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,938
his anger will make me more nervous than anyone's anger.

342
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,992
Because I don't know if he is angry,

343
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:42,547
so, I don't know if I should be nervous now.

344
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:50,231
Do you think I am a pussy.

345
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,333
How about the tickets?

346
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:01,735
I lost them.

347
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,101
Lost what?

348
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,632
I lost the notes.

349
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,475
- You deliberately lost them, didn't you? - No, Jing.

350
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,405
Do you know that's my breakfast money for several months?

351
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,647
- I buy breakfast for you. - No.

352
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:20,647
I...

353
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:38,066
- Hey, you should do exactly what you said. - Of course.

354
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:39,739
- Have you got tape? - I have.

355
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,512
But not for you.

356
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,713
Don't be messing around, do your job.

357
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:57,816
Chen Xiaoxi,

358
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:00,003
Liu Xinxia's calling you.

359
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:07,663
Jiang Chen,

360
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:10,897
Do you think Miss Liu called Xiaoxi...

361
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:13,195
because of something with Wu Bosong?

362
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,350
I don't care.

363
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:17,849
Yes, it's none of your business.

364
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,341
I care.

365
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,264
Then why you talked about it?

366
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:24,560
Just chatting between classmates.

367
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,223
If Chen Xiaoxi and Wu Bosong really fall in love,

368
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,848
at least we'll have a couple among us.

369
00:25:32,872 --> 00:25:34,684
- There may be another couple. - Shut up.

370
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:41,263
Saturday is Xiaoxi's birthday.

371
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:45,567
If they have a date that day, maybe a relationship will start.

372
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,902
Recently, Xiaoxi's crazy for the soccer game ticket,

373
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,525
but I think it's hopeless.

374
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:55,713
Chunchun'll have a concert here that day.

375
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:59,720
If I give Wu Bosong a hint...

376
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:01,556
I can give him a hint.

377
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,016
and anyway, Wu is so sweet to Xiaoxi.

378
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,695
I don't care about the relationship,

379
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:15,358
Miss Liu,

380
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,108
Wu Bosong should go to the Olympics,

381
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,615
so he can't be distracted by these stuff.

382
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:23,256
I've sent for Xiaoxi and Bosong,

383
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,381
we'll ask them seriously when they come.

384
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:29,077
- Miss Liu, I'm here. - Come here.

385
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:31,663
This is Chen Xiaoxi, and he's Wu Bosong's dad.

386
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,311
- He's the coach. - And his dad.

387
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:37,272
- Where's Bosong? - Are you coming here to catch him?

388
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:40,193
- Is it discovered that he's living in the grill? - What?

389
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:41,904
Living in grill?

390
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:46,973
- I mean... - Xiaoxi, cut the crap, tell us the truth.

391
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:52,613
He's working in a grill and sleep there.

392
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,596
Idling all the day and not seeking advancement.

393
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,675
Uncle Wu, it's not the truth.

394
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,667
Bosong is excellent.

395
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:03,776
Everyone in our class adores him.

396
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,042
On the surface, he looks careless and indifferent,

397
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:11,979
but he's in fact no time to get on with us because of swimming,

398
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:15,697
- that's why he's apathetic. - He must focus on swimming.

399
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:17,659
He's been focusing on swimming.

400
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:19,494
Every time I see him,

401
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,782
he's either coming out of the natatorium,

402
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,674
or is going there with swim gear.

403
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:26,393
Once, we're playing together and everyone wrote their secret,

404
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:29,377
He wrote on the slip that he wanted to eat Huoguo.

405
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:31,401
We didn't get what he meant,

406
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:34,181
he said he couldn't eat anything at will as a swimmer.

407
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,541
So, he's not eaten Huoguo for years.

408
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,135
Maybe you think he should be like this,

409
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:41,243
and no big deal to give up Huoguo.

410
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,204
But, have you ever thought that...

411
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:46,720
he also needs friends and to play with them?

412
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:49,274
He's just a common high-school student.

413
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:53,865
As his teacher,

414
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,723
I too think swimming should not be his whole life.

415
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,629
Yes, he's not a fish.

416
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:12,356
Here you are.

417
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,708
Hi, what do you want?

418
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:47,581
=Send to Jiang Chen:
Jiang Chen, I want to forgive you first.

419
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:19,145
=Lu Yang

420
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,081
Hi, Lu Yang.

421
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:29,268
Do you know where I can get the ticket of the concert?

422
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:39,426
Take it.

423
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,910
A swimmer can't eat Huoguo in restaurants, can he?

424
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:46,612
Today, you can.

425
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,012
Can I use seasoning?

426
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,340
No races recently, of course you can.

427
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:03,930
Bosong,

428
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:07,539
Am I too strict with you?

429
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,655
When I was at your age,

430
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:18,804
I was always occupied with nothing, and didn't know what to do.

431
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:21,748
But, now,

432
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,709
I've just realized...

433
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:27,982
I should have put more efforts then.

434
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:33,265
Pushing you so hard,

435
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,499
because I don't want you to regret in the future.

436
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:41,919
Dad...

437
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,802
Drop it.

438
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,040
Enjoy.

439
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,981
Don't let the boys smell Huoguo when you go back,

440
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:10,878
their noses are as sharp as dogs'.

441
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:15,353
Especially my bro, like a sleuth.

442
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,634
- Chen. - What?

443
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:23,978
Is it possible our shop will open up branches in the future?

444
00:31:24,002 --> 00:31:25,384
Stand a good chance.

445
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:28,494
There'll be a national chain,

446
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:32,704
So, our daughter will be the "princess of trotters".

447
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:35,211
- "Princess of trotters"? - Yeah.

448
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,297
Bull shit.

449
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:40,820
- Wait, What's the date of today? - 26.

450
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:43,288
Tomorrow is her birthday.

451
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:45,538
How do you forget all about it?

452
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:48,132
You forget it, too.

453
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:49,850
No wonder...

454
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:53,350
she asked for 500 yuan a few days ago.

455
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:57,309
She wanted to watch the soccer game of...

456
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,225
MU

457
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,202
- So, you have to buy the ticket quickly. - OK.

458
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,591
- I go there. - Quickly.

459
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:09,771
Xiaoxi.

460
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:14,785
Xiaoxi.

461
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:17,910
Look what dad bought for you.

462
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:20,222
And...

463
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:22,597
there are two.

464
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,521
=The Asia Tour of Manchester United in 2006
Hangzhou, China

465
00:32:25,664 --> 00:32:27,585
Whom do you want to go with?

466
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,155
Thank you, dad.

467
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,091
So...

468
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:36,505
- is your dad great? - Yes!

469
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:38,732
In fact, MU is my favorite soccer team.

470
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:41,638
Speaking of MU, it...

471
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:01,329
Still in "cold war"?

472
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:13,370
Jiang Chen, I've got a problem. Can you help me?

473
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:14,705
What problem?

474
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:20,087
The answer of this one is wrong.

475
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:23,876
No wonder I can't resolve it.

476
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,079
Suppose the iron chloride and ferrous chloride in the liquid...

477
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:28,196
as X and Y,

478
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,641
According to EC method, 3X+2Y=...

479
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:39,031
My gosh, what an easy problem she's asking!

480
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,853
Easy? I can't understand it at all.

481
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:45,861
Hi, Wu Bosong.

482
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:54,556
- Did you go home last night? - Yeah.

483
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:56,196
I met your dad yesterday,

484
00:33:56,258 --> 00:33:59,492
and had a serious conversation with him.

485
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:00,617
He told me.

486
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:04,476
Can you help me? Jin's been brushing me off.

- Can you check them again? - Not necessary.

I bought them from a scalper.

547
00:39:17,532 --> 00:39:18,813

and you must tell me the truth.
