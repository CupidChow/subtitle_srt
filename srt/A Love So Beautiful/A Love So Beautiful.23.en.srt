00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,508
We've discussed a few times about Miss Chen's comic book,

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:42,667
and there're a few issues we want to talk over with you.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

Tell me the expenses.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:49,881
- 400,000. - No problem. I'll bear the cost.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:51,793
Will you marry me?

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:58,216
Did you sell your car to help Xiaoxi publish her book?

17
00:01:58,216 --> 00:01:58,390
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,167

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

- not yours. - Why?

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

A Love So Beautiful

37
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,140
Where're you going?

38
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,322
- To the washroom. - Will you come back?

39
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,330
Yes.

40
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,036
OK.

41
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,682
Come back quickly.

42
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,837
OK.

43
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,730
You've just come back,

44
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,951
how long will you be away again for the show?

45
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,427
- About one month. - Ah!

46
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,523
So you'll miss my final contest.

47
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,323
I need go out to heal my broken heart.

48
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:02,174
Please take care of Xiaoxi for me.

49
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:03,809
Get it.

50
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,721
Go, now.

51
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,888
Airport parking fee is expensive.

52
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:17,132
Bye.

53
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:33,923
Honey,

54
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:36,597
as the agent of a cartoonist,

55
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:39,287
I'll attend a meeting for you at the publishing house...

56
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:40,723
to talk over the paper.

57
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:43,604
Keep going.

58
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:00,873
Jiang Chen.

59
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,452
Are you tired recently?

60
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:06,967
No, no.

61
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,324
What are you taking me to eat?

62
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:12,363
- Hot pot. - Come on,

63
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,442
why always eat Hot pot in summer?

64
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,402
That restaurant is very good,

65
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,473
and its "Couple-Hot pot" is well known.

66
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,505
I can't wait until winter to take you there.

67
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:26,171
- What's wrong? - Hot.

68
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:27,980
My hand is sweating.

69
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,240
Is that OK?

70
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,587
Here is a toast...

71
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:46,491
to my excellent Jingjing who becomes a postgraduate student.

72
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:47,443
Cheers.

73
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,664
- Cheers. - Cheers.

74
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,672
Alcohol isn't good for him. I drink it instead.

75
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:59,037
Xiaoxi, you needn't present the show of affection here,

76
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,299
nobody is forcing Jiang Chen to drink.

77
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,028
But I love to show it.

78
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,242
Go easy on it.

79
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,781
Not today, I'm happy.

80
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,210
Come on.

81
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:13,860
This is for the successful completion of my first cartoon book.

82
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,797
Sounds good, cheers.

83
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,174
And here's to...

84
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:24,365
my electronic sports team...

85
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:28,412
which successfully goes into the WCA final. Cheers!

86
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:35,413
I know WC means water closet,

87
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,485
but what is WCA?

88
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,484
Chen Xiaoxi, are you an illiterate?

89
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,381
World Cyber-Games Association, not water closet.

90
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:45,492
You gonna drink.

91
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:47,516
OK, I drink.

92
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,587
Let's go home, little drunkard.

93
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,614
Smile, please.

94
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:09,097
- Smile. - Why?

95
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:14,122
I want to put my finger into your dimples.

96
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,053
Chen Xiaoxi.

97
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:03,405
Who am I?

98
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,944
My boyfriend.

99
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,173
What's the name of your boyfriend?

100
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:14,204
Jiang Chen.

101
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,037
You want to sleep?

102
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,831
No.

103
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,997
So sit beside me.

104
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:38,187
You're always meek when you get drunk.

105
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,821
Chen Xiaoxi.

106
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:52,741
Is it inappropriate for me to propose to you when you get drunk?

107
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,171
No, it's not.

108
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:15,583
Then, propose.

109
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:21,684
- You? - Exactly.

110
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,874
OK, I accept.

111
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,429
You've just proposed to me,

112
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,683
and I accept you.

113
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,430
Thought you'd have become a runaway bride.

114
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,263
It's breakfast.

115
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:23,580
You proposed to me last night.

116
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,711
I saw your household-register on the desk,

117
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:32,711
and I have mine here.

118
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,464
Why won't we take an hour off and go to the marriage registry?

119
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,758
I don't get what you mean.

120
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,813
Don't pretend nothing has happened.

121
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,472
I know you remember.

122
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:54,580
What?

123
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,476
I can't marry you.

124
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:03,355
What's wrong?

125
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:18,507
Doc. Jiang.

126
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:22,207
Doc. Jiang.

127
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,619
This is the report from Doc. Sun.

128
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,912
Can you do me a favor?

129
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:42,003
Here, this room.

130
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:19,560
Chen Xiaoxi.

131
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,679
Please marry me.

132
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,285
Su Mu told me...

133
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:28,189
you cried because I didn't propose to you.

134
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:32,697
A proposal of marriage should be made first by the gentleman.

135
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,419
So will you marry me?

136
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,718
Thank you, Xiaoxi,

137
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,948
for giving me the love many people can't find.

138
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:00,681
How can you suddenly say such emotional words?

139
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,816
I was told everyone should speak emotionally when proposing.

140
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,204
Will you accept me?

141
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:11,950
- I've got an operation soon. - Or...

142
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,592
You go for the operation now,

143
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:18,346
- Let me think it over. - Don't bother. You'll accept me at last.

144
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,631
So, give me the ring.

145
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,518
All blank!

146
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,224
- What? - No writing. So why did you tie them?

147
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,208
Just a balance weight to make the balloon rise slowly.

148
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:33,937
- An operation is waiting for you. - I lied to you.

149
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,097
When did you prepare all of it?

150
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:45,827
Just now.

151
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,906
Where did you get these ugly balloons?

152
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,351
Rubber gloves with helium inside.

153
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,359
Helium? Is helium harmful?

154
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,120
Do you want to kill me?

155
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,873
Did you learn nothing about chemistry in high school?

156
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,357
Helium is an inert gas...

157
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:07,484
used by nuclear magnetic resonance equipments in big hospitals.

158
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,650
- Sounds like an amazing gas. - Stupid girl.

159
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,509
I'm gonna go to work. You take a rest.

160
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,382
- After work we'll go home together. - OK.

161
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:31,590
Jiang Chen.

162
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,582
- What? - My ring.

163
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,184
- I bought it. - Yes.

164
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,079
Are you a puppy?

165
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:56,547
Close to me, I won't bite you, I promise.

166
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,183
- Be careful on your way there. - I've got no shift today.

167
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,834
So go home and take a rest.

168
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,842
I'm thirsty.

169
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,666
- There's a shop downstairs. - I'm hungry.

170
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,015
There's a very good noodle shop there, too.

171
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,228
If you want to stay here...

172
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:28,268
on the first day after your proposal,

173
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:29,791
I'll be a little shy.

174
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:33,402
- I'd stayed here before. - It's different.

175
00:17:33,592 --> 00:17:37,036
Go back to your home, bye.

176
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:57,819
- What do you want? - Let me take a rest.

177
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:15,254
2... 3... 4...

178
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,612
- Xiaoxi. - Hi, mom.

179
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:30,644
- What're you doing? - Sleeping.

180
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,541
Don't spend all your time on sleeping.

181
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:35,175
When will you find a boyfriend and bring him home?

182
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,064
What do you mean?

183
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,294
I mean, I have a good friend,

184
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,151
who has a son about your age and he works in your city.

185
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:48,053
-  He owns a big company... - Mom, straight to the point.

186
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:51,697
The point is that I want you to meet him,

187
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:52,705
then both of you...

188
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,616
can alleviate the loneliness of being away from home.

189
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:59,529
Anyway, you won't be in the future with Jiang Chen...

190
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,307
or that dark-skinned boy.

191
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:05,673
Mom, is this the way you arrange a blind date for me?

192
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:06,823
I won't go.

193
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,354
I'm Jiang Chen.

194
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:12,489
Xiaoxi and I are already together.

195
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,997
I'll visit you soon.

196
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:18,171
- She's gonna talk to you. - OK.

197
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,686
Chen Xiaoxi, did you say you were sleeping?

198
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,083
Mom, the connection is bad. I'm gonna hang up.

199
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,329
No big deal.

200
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:39,955
Look, it's very late. You'd better go home, quickly.

201
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:42,296
Give me a glass of water.

202
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:10,698
He...

203
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,174
is going to take a shower?

204
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,223
Leave the sofa to me. I want to sleep.

205
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,019
- What're you thinking? - If I had to live without you...

206
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:14,798
then you can find another girl who is taller, thinner...

207
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,852
prettier, tender, more intelligent...

208
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,836
more sensible than I.

209
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,634
That's right.

210
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,506
Why crying again?

211
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,749
You bastard, I would haunt you if I were a ghost.

212
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:42,430
Bastard!

213
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,542
Where are you going?

214
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,796
What're you doing?

215
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,431
- Brush teeth. - Don't touch it. It's my brush.

216
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,795
No teeth-brushing, bastard.

217
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,635
- Is it enough? - No.

218
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:05,873
Ungrateful bastard.

219
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:10,079
If you want to find a better girl, go to find her now.

220
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:13,031
Release me, I'm gonna get hurt.

221
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:15,055
You deserve it.

222
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,522
I'm falling down.

223
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,886
What?

224
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:31,639
Chen Xiaoxi.

225
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:34,852
Wipe your face.

226
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,511
- Wipe your face. - No.

227
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:45,679
Get up.

228
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:49,806
Look at you,

229
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:53,083
your eyes were swollen with tears.

230
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:54,813
None of your business.

231
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,368
OK, sleep now.

232
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:04,193
My skin's almost scraped.

233
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:06,574
Needn't disfigure me if you want another girl.

234
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:38,208
You OK?

235
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:45,108
They always make noise upstairs, and I'm used to it.

236
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:49,599
What time is it now?

237
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:52,627
2:00 am.

238
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,293
I can't sleep.

239
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,772
Lie down. When you sleep, I'll go out.

240
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,061
Jiang Chen.

241
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:13,680
What?

242
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:22,302
Did you really propose to me today...

243
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:26,730
or just felt sorry because I was crying?

244
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,497
Really proposed.

245
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,949
Jiang Chen.

246
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,980
Are you really gonna find another girl...

247
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:45,298
who is taller, thinner, more intelligent...

248
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:47,495
more sensible than I.

249
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,852
Is the world just small like your bathroom?

250
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:55,281
I've found you,

251
00:25:58,205 --> 00:25:59,371
and it's not easy.

252
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,254
I don't get it.

253
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:08,278
My bathroom is not small.

254
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:13,824
Sleep.

255
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:15,784
Jiang Chen.

256
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:19,450
What's wrong again?

257
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,148
I want to brush my teeth, which I forgot.

258
00:26:25,972 --> 00:26:26,995
Sleep.

259
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:30,614
I'm sure it's not the first time you forgot to do it.

260
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:32,582
But I don't forget now.

261
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:39,891
Then why do you always forget how much I love you?

262
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:47,950
I love you so much.

263
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,648
So, even if there are girls who are taller, thinner...

264
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,251
prettier, tender and more sensible than you,

265
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,696
that's nothing to do with me.

266
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:15,977
In this world,

267
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,724
there's not another girl who is taller, thinner,

268
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:22,295
more intelligent, prettier, more sensible than I.

269
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:23,779
Non-existent.

270
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:30,623
Sleep,

271
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:35,943
or I'll be rude to you.

272
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:37,497
So, be rude to me.

273
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,902
Don't regret it.

274
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,005
Who will regret it?

275
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:44,705
- Did you wash your hands after peeing? - No, so what?

276
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:08,101
Get up.

277
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:11,885
Come on.

278
00:29:17,347 --> 00:29:19,609
I don't want to have breakfast.

279
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:23,703
- Don't you want to eat the breakfast cooked by me? - I'm sleepy.

280
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:28,536
- You've slept for a long time. - But I was tired last night.

281
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:40,102
What are you blushing at?

282
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:43,515
You're a doctor who knows human body best.

283
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:46,840
You too have drawn so many models, so what are you blushing at?

284
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:48,792
Anyway, you've seen more bodies than I.

285
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:50,966
- Will you eat it? - I will.

286
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:54,268
Open your mouth.

287
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:05,888
Are you choked?

288
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,113
- Still want to sleep? - Yeah.

289
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,057
Go back to it.

290
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,399
Jiang Chen!

291
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:32,999
Take it easy,

292
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:37,044
I just want to tell you that I wake up and I'm hungry.

293
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,576
And carry me into the bathroom for teeth brushing.

294
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:48,817
Only carry you to the living-room.

295
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:53,955
Let's go.

296
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:02,169
Go to the kitchen. I want to drink water.

297
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,954
- You've got no feet? - Yeah.

298
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,700
I've got no feet.

299
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,432
- Why am I so hungry? - It's afternoon now.

300
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,931
What shall we have for supper?

301
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:31,726
First...

302
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:34,297
we need an apron.

303
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:57,614
- What's the first dish? - The soup?

304
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:00,185
- It may take a long time to be simmered. - How to simmer?

305
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:03,017
- Cut it into pieces, then simmer it. - You cut it,

306
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,803
- you're a surgeon using a knife. - Scalpel.

307
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:07,756
- Is there a scalpel in your bag? - Yes.

308
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,073
With a knife in your bag, you're so perverted.

309
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,358
I can be more perverted, want to see it?

310
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:13,874
No.

311
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:28,405
- Is the water too much? - It's OK.

312
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:29,627
Or...

313
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,651
let's go to a restaurant.

314
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:34,610
We stay at home.

315
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,270
Give you a flower.

316
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:14,434
You didn't put salt in the dishes?

317
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,061
All the salts are put by you.

318
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:18,513
Yeah, salty food could cause hypertension.

319
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,504
I am full, I can't take soup now.

320
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,626
- Are you feeling bored now? - No.

321
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,125
What if I lie still on the floor and you kick me at will?

322
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,680
Your insanity is always beyond my imagination.

323
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,512
Yes, that's right.

324
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,352
- I didn't do the laundry. - I washed my clothes last night.

325
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:14,804
- You've got clean ones to change? - I have clean ones in my bag.

326
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:18,193
I wonder if you have a body in your bag.

327
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:21,027
You hang the clothes out, and I'll go out to buy something.

328
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:24,360
I don't want to hang clothes.

329
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,677
OK, I hang them out.

330
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:29,089
Good girl.

331
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:38,510
Why didn't you bring a key with you?

332
00:34:43,857 --> 00:34:44,707
Mom?

333
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:47,792
Dad?  It's very late, why do you come here?

334
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,856
Your dad is coming for his physical reexamination.

335
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:53,483
We just ran into Jiang Chen downstairs, so we come up together.

336
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,998
Don't stand still. Get some water for your dad.

337
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,534
Hide Jiang Chen's belongings here, don't let your dad see them.

338
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:09,256
His clothes are still hung on the balcony, what shall I do?

339
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,351
You go there, pretending to take back your clothes,

340
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,359
and throw his clothes downstairs.

341
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:15,922
Good idea!

342
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:23,483
- Dad, where do you get the liquor? - Don't worry about it.

343
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:30,839
Xiaoxi,

344
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:32,624
- What? - Where are you going?

345
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:35,060
Mom said there is more dew outside at night,

346
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:37,377
so I want to take my clothes inside.

347
00:35:45,716 --> 00:35:47,311
Let's have a drink.

348
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:50,294
We've been watching Jiang Chen growing up.

349
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:54,310
Today, we'll drink and talk. Come on.

350
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,960
- Look... - Good, take it.

=An hour later...

352
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,284
Enough.

353
00:36:03,284 --> 00:36:03,910
Enough.

354
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:07,172
Jiang Chen,

355
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,640
let's take this one.

356
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:16,041
Jiang Chen, my daughter...

357
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:19,541
our Xiaoxi is...

358
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,223
perfect.

359
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:23,896
Yes, uncle.

360
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:26,594
- Perfect. - You're already drunk,

361
00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:30,141
so how could you test your "son-in-law" with liquor?

362
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:32,680
My capacity for liquor...

363
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:36,624
Xiaoxi, your dad's capacity... is it large?

364
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,577
Are you OK, Jiang Chen?

365
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,783
You look...

366
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:44,838
Stop drinking,

367
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,592
and go to bed.

368
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:50,011
I tell you, I'm OK.

369
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:51,503
- Let's go. - Be careful.

370
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:52,915
- Take care of him. - OK.

371
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,559
Are you drunk?

372
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,062
Lie down for a while.

373
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:05,341
What?

374
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:07,182
I want to tell you a story.

375
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:10,626
Late at night,

376
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:14,030
it's quiet in the forest.

377
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:16,998
Stars are blinking...

378
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:19,902
and flashing.

379
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:25,434
We're sleeping soundly.

380
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:29,704
The guards are marching in a perfect formation,

381
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:33,433
protecting our beautiful life.

382
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:38,155
- Do you know who's their leader? - Who?

383
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:44,154
# He is the Sheriff Black Cat. #

384
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:49,693
Stop singing. Just sleep, sleep.

385
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:55,881
What's wrong again?

386
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:59,873
- I'm looking for Chen Xiaoxi. - I'm Chen Xiaoxi.

387
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,650
You look familiar to me.

388
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,483
Go to sleep.

389
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:16,474
- Are you really Chen Xiaoxi. - I'm Chen Xiaoxi, really .

390
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,378
Chen Xiaoxi,

391
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:24,830
I miss you very much.

393
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:40,928
Please autograph it for me. My niece wants to show it off.
=A Love So Beautiful

394
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:43,056
Please autograph it for me. My niece wants to show it off.

395
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,143
No, my handwriting is too awful.

396
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:47,452
It's no problem for me.

397
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:53,619
At present, Xiaoxi can't casually sign her name anymore.

398
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:54,436
Why?

399
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:57,673
Xiaoxi will have a book signing.

400
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,530
- What? - The book has been sold so well...

401
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:03,427
that a book signing will be held.

402
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:07,101
- Congratulate you. - Really?

403
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,482
- is it possible people will come? - I promise.

404
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:12,257
It'll be a sea of people and very crowded.

405
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:15,202
So I'm gonna call everyone to join us.

406
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:24,043
Probably PDA, arrange an examination for him.

407
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,042
Yes, doctor.

408
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:36,813
- Hi. - Jiang Chen.

409
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:39,678
- I'm gonna have a book signing next Saturday. - Really?

410
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,321
Yes, so you have to come then.

411
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,398
The first one is at Xueyou bookstore.

412
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:49,166
I''ll be out of town next weekend for a symposium.

413
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:52,506
Since I chose to come back,

414
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,442
- I've decided to study astronomy seriously. - Sounds good.

415
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:58,283
But, scientific research is a hard job,

416
00:39:58,378 --> 00:40:00,274
you should talk to your family first,

417
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:02,591
- and enlist their supports. - OK.

418
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:06,757
Excuse me, sir, I've got a call.

419
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,725
- Hi. - Jingjing.

420
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:12,407
- What's up? - Tell you some good news.

421
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:15,502
My book is a success, and the publisher will hold a book signing.

422
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:17,176
- Really? - Yes.

423
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,168
You have to come this weekend.

424
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:21,802
Xiaoxi,

425
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:23,579
Are you booked up at weekend?

426
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,483
I'll go to the weather station...

427
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,824
on the mountain with my tutor on Sunday.

428
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:30,784
I see.

429
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,688
- Then show me the photos of it, OK? - OK.

430
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:35,997
That's all right.

431
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:39,346
- I want to take a rest after this show. - Buddy,

432
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,139
You're popular now,

433
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:44,021
so taking a rest is too expensive.

434
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:47,052
By the way, I just want to take another show for you,

435
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:49,512
talking about your romance, something you and Xiaoxi...

436

Hi, Bosong, I've got a book signing at weekend. Will you come?

we're grown up now...

and have our own business, so it's difficult to be together.

and I didn't understand either...

488

why she could run so fast...

489

with such short legs when she wants to catch up with me.

490

- Wait. - Wait for your kicking?

I usually and deliberately went faster...

492

to see if she could catch up with me.

493
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:01,354
Unexpectedly, she could.

494
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,061
Later, I spontaneously started to wait for her,

495
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:05,918
and watch her.

496
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:07,735
Chen Xiaoxi,

497
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:09,306
quickly.

498
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,631
OK.

499
00:45:10,655 --> 00:45:16,020
"Xiang Shaolong stopped kissing her and took away her wine cup."

500
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:19,512
Then I found that Chen Xiaoixi was a big problem.

501
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:20,535
Chen Xiaoxi.

502
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,067
I always had to deal with the aftermath of her troubles.

503
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,901
No, no...

504
00:45:32,038 --> 00:45:32,942
Miss Liu,

505
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:35,727
there's no term allowing privacy violation in the school rules.

506
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:36,965
To get her off the hook,

507
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,147
I wrote the first "self-criticism" in my life.

508
00:45:39,242 --> 00:45:42,710
But, She's indeed better than I on writing a self-criticism.

509
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,043
What's wrong?

510
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:47,367
Such a big stack of class-fee,

511
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,256
could it be thrown into the toilet?

512
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:51,486
To help her get back the class-fee,

513
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:53,152
I copied the report for the teacher.

514
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:56,223
I copied it in class and after class,

515
00:45:56,493 --> 00:45:58,754
so I learned nothing in school that day.

516
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,572
Miss, I've got the class-fee.

517
00:46:06,968 --> 00:46:07,563
Bro...

518
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:10,507
However, she sometimes doesn't deserve my sympathy.

519
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:11,483
Hey, bro...

520
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:16,331
I think Xiaoxi is lovely.

521
00:46:16,355 --> 00:46:17,902
My girlfriend should be like her.

522
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:20,569
You wish.

523
00:46:20,593 --> 00:46:23,219
I'm busy with my graduation project, I can't...

524
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,584
Stupid.

525
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:38,891
Chen Xiaoxi,

526
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:41,095
What a shame you had today.

527
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,604
I start to be jealous.

528
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,239
Transfer to a boarding school.

529
00:46:49,326 --> 00:46:50,611
Want to transfer?

530
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:52,174
I couldn't sleep all the night...

531
00:46:52,468 --> 00:46:54,229
when I heard she'd be transfer to another school.

532
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:55,975
I'm suddenly afraid of her leaving.

533
00:46:56,578 --> 00:46:59,371
So I had to choose to forgive her unilaterally first,

534
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:01,744
to prevent the other school from being ruined by her.

535
00:47:01,768 --> 00:47:04,053
- She wants to transfer. - Transfer?

536
00:47:04,077 --> 00:47:05,045
Let me go to ask.

537
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,187
I won't transfer.

538
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:10,980
Our school is good, so are our teachers.

539
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:16,664
Gradually, I'd found she was in fact very lovely.

540
00:47:17,315 --> 00:47:20,957
I couldn't help smile inexplicably at the thought of her.

541
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:23,783
- Licked by a puppy on the way home. - What puppy?

542
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:26,100
It's dirty.

543
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:28,884
As you wish.

544
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:32,304
A little noisy.

545
00:47:35,034 --> 00:47:37,137
Sometimes, you couldn't help taking care of her,

546
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:37,731
Move.

547
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:39,643
Sometimes, you couldn't help picking on her.

548
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:42,802
- This one? - Yes.

549
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:50,526
Every time I wanted to do something for her,

550
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:52,596
she always made me mad.

551
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,524
- Why can't I be the monitor? - You can't be.

552
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:57,103
I didn't vote for her deliberately when choosing a monitor,

553
00:47:57,214 --> 00:48:00,610
because her running after someone on the field made me sick.

554
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,983
I hadn't realized I'd fallen in love with her then.

555
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:09,507
My whole life is too long and I wouldn't only like you.

556
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:13,252
She cried badly that day.

557
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:15,227
It struck me suddenly...

558
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:17,450
that I shouldn't make her cry like that in the future.

559
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:19,862
But it seemed that I failed.

560
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,083
We were usually not at the same page.

561
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:25,821
- Why do you want to do summer job? - Accumulate my experience.

562
00:48:25,845 --> 00:48:26,924
I don't like it.

563
00:48:32,686 --> 00:48:36,630
- Let's break up. - Do you know what you're talking about?

564
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:41,439
At that time, I just thought she's mad with me,

565
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:43,200
and she would calm down.

566
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:47,081
Then, I realized I was wrong.

567
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:00,068
- Hi. - Why do you call me?

568
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:01,377
Just wrong number.

569
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:04,352
So I can change a phone.

570
00:49:08,076 --> 00:49:11,560
The 3 years in the UMCH seemed to have passed very quickly.

571
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:14,226
- Have you got a girlfriend? - Yes.

572
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:14,670
=Doctor: Chen Xiaoxi

573
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,145
But nobody knew my feeling.
=Doctor: Chen Xiaoxi

574
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:16,916
But nobody knew my feeling.

575
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:19,972
It's like I was in my pullover back to front every day.

576
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:21,782
I felt uncomfortable...

577
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,916
and out of breath.

578
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:25,059
Chen Xiaoxi.

579
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:29,431
Therefore, I have to find her again,

580
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:31,411
no matter who is beside her.

581
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:36,301
- The noodle was too salty. - Why don't you open the door?

582
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:38,634
You idiot, take the front seat.

583
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,006
- Can I have my ears pierced? - I don't like it.

584
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:43,815
You're too strict with me.

585
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,005
Was this 3-year period just a long fight?

586
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:47,259
We'll be fine.

587
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:48,742
I know I'm selfish,

588
00:49:49,107 --> 00:49:51,210
but, she's so kind.

589
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:54,050
Not only can she tolerate my indifference, eccentricity...

590
00:49:54,217 --> 00:49:55,463
and difficult character,

591
00:49:56,264 --> 00:49:57,724
but find pleasure in them.

592
00:49:57,819 --> 00:50:01,914
So she is either a character specially set for me in a game,

593
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:03,738
or a crazy girl.

594
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:15,391
And I'm lucky enough to get this crazy girl back,

595
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:17,415
Xiaoxi,

596
00:50:18,112 --> 00:50:20,485
thank you so much for coming back.

597
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:23,762
We can return to what we have been.

598
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:29,214
Whom do you like most in "A Love So Beautiful"?

599
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,841
Wu Bosong is certainly the best one.

600
00:50:30,865 --> 00:50:32,904
After all, his diamond ring is big enough.
