and then you can go back home.

No, just pick one randomly.

Jingjing doesn't like garish ones.

83

My dad hurts his bones.

He's waiting for an operation.

122
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,840
No rush.

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,960
Orthopedic surgery has been fully booked.

124
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,330
You have to wait for a week at least.

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,440
Can you arrange the surgery ahead for me?

126
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,230
Nurse, help us, please.

127
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,790
I am not in charge.

128
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,110
Let's pay first.

129
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,390
Do me a favor.

130
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,800
The boss just said he would fire you.

131
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,570
Really?

132
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,410
Boring. You would never be cheated.

133
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,980
Do me a favor.

134
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,240
My friend's father hurt his waist.

135
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,120
It's might be spinal compression of nerves.

136
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,070
Why should I help you?

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,470
We're just on speaking terms.

138
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,270
I will do your duty for a week.

139
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,550
Price of friendship.

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
Two weeks.

141
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,970
Deal.

142
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,580
Chen Xiaoxi

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,950
hasn't told us the room number.

144
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,600
OK, thank you, Dr.

145
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,410
Dr. Jiang,

146
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,990
I can't believe you have come back.

147
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,920
It's been ages.

148
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,330
I thought you have been ghosting.

149
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,840
You just broke up with Chen Xiaoxi.

150
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,670
Does it mean that you broke up with all of us?

151
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,030
I thought if I contact you,

152
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,990
you will be in a dilemma.

153
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,200
Why is that?

154
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,970
Tell us.

155
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,180
Have they been together?

156
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,370
Who?

157
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,200
Do you think that Chen Xiaoxi and Wu Bosong have been dating?

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,390
Don't they?

159
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,560
I won't tell you.

160
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,820
Go.

161
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,040
I don't wanna see him any more.

162
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,970
I hate you, too.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,670
Where are you going?

164
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,670
Go back home to get something.

165
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,220
Let me give you a ride.

166
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,990
No.

167
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,650
It's very convenient to get a taxi.

168
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,010
Where do you live now?

169
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,010
I said no.

170
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,740
Hurry up.

171
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,690
Don't stay on my way.

172
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,540
Chen Xiaoxi.

173
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,940
Fasten your seat belt.

174
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,400
What are you doing?

175
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,920
Find the hydrotalcite chewing tablets for me.

176
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,410
Take out two tablets for me.

177
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,850
Don't you feel well?

178
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,190
I didn't have time for eating.

179
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,040
My stomach ached.

180
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,490
Eat something now.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,900
I will make some noodles at home.

182
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,090
Thank you.

183
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,800
Or else,

184
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,270
you come to my home,

185
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,390
and I make you some noodles.

186
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,530
Ten minutes are enough.

187
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,870
It takes 30 minutes to my home.

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,190
But it takes 1 minute to my home.

189
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,720
OK.

190
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,670
Drink some hot water.

191
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,480
Warm your stomach.

192
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,670
Jiang Chen.

193
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,810
The noodles are ready.

194
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm leaving now.

195
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,860
Take care.

196
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,870
Chen Xiaoxi.

197
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,400
The noodles are too salty.

198
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,140
Jiang Chen.

199
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,300
I haven't seen you for ages.

200
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,100
You look so handsome now!

201
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,170
Xiaoxi has told me.

202
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,500
Thanks for your help.

203
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,360
No worries, aunt.

204
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,630
Let me introduce the surgeon of Uncle Chen to you.

205
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,270
Dr. Su.

206
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:12,960
Su Mu.

207
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,820
So young you are.

208
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,200
No, no.

209
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:19,900
I mean,

210
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,200
you are young and promising.

211
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,920
Do you afraid that I am not experienced?

212
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,520
No, no.

213
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,360
I didn't mean that.

214
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,620
Aunt, I have a legend in this hospital,

215
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,310
that someone came to illegally make trouble here,

216
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
I beat him to the dislocation of shoulder.

217
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,980
And then I cured his shoulder by the way.

218
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,230
In short,

219
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,980
I am great.

220
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,150
You are great.

221
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,400
Good.

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,480
=Patient passage

223
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,900
=Wu Bosong

224
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,540
Hello.

225
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,760
Xiaoxi.

226
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,000
Does the operation begin?

227
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,240
I am on the way.

228
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,110
You don't need to come.

229
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,330
It's a simple operation.

230
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,400
It will finish soon.

231
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,030
It's better for me to visit uncle.

232
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,260
Or else I can't be relaxed.

233
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,490
Let it be.

234
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,790
If you are here,

235
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,890
The ward will be crowded with nurses.

236
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,640
Alright.

237
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,890
It's so hard for us.

238
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,450
When you were dating

239
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,520
with Xiaoxi,

240
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,080
I never thought that we should have a conversation.

241
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,880
But now...

242
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,270
The destiny makes fool of the people.

243
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,580
I was naive at that time,

244
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,020
I didn't cherish her.

245
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,530
Nonsense.

246
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,270
Actually it's because

247
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,790
Xiaoxi wasn't lucky enough.

248
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,000
How's your dad?

249
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,720
Mom, take it easy.

250
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,290
The operation is successful.

251
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,670
Dr. Su.

252
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you!

253
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,020
Thank you very much.

254
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,070
I know that you are young and promising.

255
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,960
I know that you are great.

256
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,390
How can I express my gratitude?

257
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,530
If you don't drag your mom away,

258
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,900
the hands of Dr. Su will be disabled.

259
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,870
Mom!

260
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,600
Let's see my dad.

261
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,150
Your dad hasn't recovered from the anaesthesia.

262
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,400
We don't need to see him.

263
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,880
Dr. Su performed the operation so successfully.

264
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,810
We should thank her.

265
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,670
Aunt, aunt.

266
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,850
This is my job.

267
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,760
I have another operation. I should leave now.

268
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,030
Dr. Su.

269
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,420
When do you come to my house to be a guest?

270
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,670
My pork knuckle is very delicious.

271
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,180
I will make it for you.

272
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,320
Jiang Chen.

273
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,770
I...

274
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,270
Save me.

275
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,880
Mom.

276
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,950
Jiang Chen has to work then.

277
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,650
Let's go to see my dad.

278
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,490
He's coming out.

279
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,410
Chen.

280
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,750
Chen, wake up.

281
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,180
Chen.

282
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,700
Thank you for today.

283
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,480
I have something else to do.

284
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,370
I should go now.

285
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,310
I have to work.

286
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,950
You are here.

287
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,100
Does uncle fall asleep?

288
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,970
How did you meet Dr. Jiang?

289
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,620
We are classmates.

290
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,680
What kind of classmates?

291
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,690
Kindergarten.

292
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,130
Primary school.

293
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,250
Middle school.

294
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,510
High school.

295
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,390
University.

296
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,470
Friendship formed in the childhood.

297
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,420
You have seen each other's genital organ since the childhood.

298
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,100
So chemical.

299
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,590
Do you know about Dr. Jiang's girlfriend?

300
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,730
Girlfriend?

301
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,960
He didn't tell you?

302
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,260
No.

303
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,170
Of course.

304
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,460
He must be ashamed of this.

305
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,280
Because

306
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,280
he falls in love with married woman.

307
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,760
I'm kidding you.

308
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,640
You don't get my humor.

309
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,150
Xiaoxi,

310
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,890
give the fruit to Jiang Chen later.

311
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,350
and treat him for dinner.

312
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,690
I will reimburse you.

313
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,950
Here you are.

314
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,940
Don't be mad.

315
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,540
Maybe you will be together again.

316
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,780
Xiaoxi.

317
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,850
Don't listen to your mother.

318
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,280
You should have backbone.

319
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,230
A good horse will not turn back to crop the old grass.

320
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,470
Moreover,

321
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,780
The boy who is a star

322
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,020
is quite good.

323
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,080
I don't think so.

324
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,740
He is so tanned.

325
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,700
It reminds me.

326
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,560
I've seen him on TV the other days.

327
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,960
He ogled with a pretty girl,

328
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,800
and also help her wear sunscreen.

329
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,910
It's so disgusting.

330
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,780
Mom, that's his job!

331
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,140
Yes, that's his job!

332
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,020
How can I find a job that can help handsome boy wear sunscreen?

333
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,900
I want to go, too.

334
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,810
Not a chance!

335
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,040
Xiaoxi!

336
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,300
I just like Jiang Chen!

337
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,690
Take a seat.

338
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,920
My mom asked me to bring the fruit to you.

339
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,480
Thank aunt for me.

340
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,200
I have visited uncle this morning.

341
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,430
His situation is quite stable.

342
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,360
Maybe after two or three days' observation,

343
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,270
he could be discharged.

344
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,350
You are so busy now.

345
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,010
I won't disturb you.

346
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,400
Thanks for your help.

347
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,240
Chen Xiaoxi.

348
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,690
Have you ever regretted?

349
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,750
No.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Chen Xiaoxi

351
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,640
Director.

352
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,140
Dr. Jiang.

353
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,940
What's wrong with you

354
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,010
about the election of the vice-director?

355
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,330
I was temporarily unavailable.

356
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,390
So I left.

357
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,930
What kind of the matter was it?

358
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,910
I just didn't understand you.

359
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,450
Studying at UMCH

360
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,120
takes four years for other people.

361
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,460
But you just finished all the course in three years,

362
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,410
which proves that you are talented in it.

363
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,770
But you just

364
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,200
give up a great chance this time.

365
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,380
I know, Director.

366
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,840
I have heard

367
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,540
that UMCH wanted you to stay there.

368
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,860
But you just came back in a hurry.

369
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,290
Do you regret now?

370
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,730
Do you want to go back there?

371
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,420
Take it easy.

372
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,760
I won't leave.

373
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,540
I ask you a personal question.

374
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,770
UMCH is the top hospital nationwide.

375
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,420
Why did you give up

376
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,970
such a good chance?

377
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,900
There's someone here I can't let go.

378
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,430
Nowadays young people are so odd!

379
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,480
Director, I am occupied now...

380
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,970
Alright, Go ahead with what you are doing.

381
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
Tonight is my bachelor party.

382
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,540
You are invited. But I am with reluctance.

383
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,860
Hold her waist.

384
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,210
That's right! OK!

385
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,970
Bosong.

386
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,740
=Crazy Lu Yang

387
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,660
Bro!
=Crazy Lu Yang

388
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,100
=Crazy Lu Yang

389
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,340
Tonight
=Crazy Lu Yang

390
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,500
=Crazy Lu Yang

391
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,520
is my bachelor party!
=Crazy Lu Yang

392
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,560
=Crazy Lu Yang

393
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,110
Come with Xiaoxi.

394
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,050
I won't join the dinner with advertisers tonight.

395
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,770
No, you can't.

396
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,940
I can't explain to them.

397
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,900
Wei!

398
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,320
If you can't cope with this,

399
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,520
why do I employ you?

400
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Damn!

401
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,360
No, you are popular!

402
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,300
# I will marry you tomorrow #

403
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,780
# I will marry you tomorrow #

404
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,350
# If it had not been for heavy traffic #

405
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,060
# which disturb me what #

406
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:37,260
I am reading book.

407
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,400
# I will marry you tomorrow #

408
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,180
Chen Xiaoxi, Wu Bosong!

409
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,890
It's my bachelor party!

410
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,600
How dare you to be late!

411
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,980
Don't drink so much!

412
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,930
One bottle!

413
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,230
No Problem!

414
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,160
Why do you pretend straight A student here?

415
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,090
If you know who Lu Yang has invited,

416
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,330
you won't be as happy as now.

417
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,520
I take my girlfriend with me.

418
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,060
Do you mind?

419
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,730
No, never mind.

420
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,550
Does your girlfriend eat much?

421
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,450
She used to eat a lot.

422
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,700
What are you talking?

423
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,980
I never eat a lot.

424
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,180
Or else I can't keep fit!

425
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,620
Hello, everyone! I am Zhuang Dongna.

426
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,750
You can call me Nana.

427
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,810
Sorry! We are late.

428
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,900
He insisted to pick me up. So it's a little far around.

429
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,320
Don't worry!

430
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,970
We are not busy!

431
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,370
Take a seat.

432
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,940
Chen Xiaoxi!

433
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,770
Go and sit there! Don't be so closed with my Jingjing!

434
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,520
Go go go! Sit next to Wu Bosong.

435
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,880
I don't think you need to keep fit.

436
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,360
You are not like her.

437
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,540
Do you want to eat something?

438
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,390
No.

439
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,110
Keep acting!

440
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,290
Feed me a tomato.

441
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,670
Quickly!

442
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,140
Su Mu didn't tell you that I have myotenositis?

443
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,130
Do you want to eat, too?

444
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,770
Here!

445
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,440
No!

446
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,770
Eat it!

447
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,950
Delicious?

448
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,920
Why don't you request a song?

449
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,780
Go go go. Sit there!

450
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,920
Let's request song!

451
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,910
Excuse me! Thank you!

452
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,140
# The blossom in spring take away the sadness in winter #

453
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,180
Xiaoxi.

454
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,570
Pick away the tangerine pith.

455
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,970
I don't like that.

456
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,150
I don't peel for you.

457
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,810
No.

458
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,860
The orange is especially sweet today!

459
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,560
No!

460
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,400
What are you doing?

461
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:29,980
Wipe your hands.

462
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,060
I don't need it.

463
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,780
We will leave first.

464
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,980
Don't you really need me to give you a ride?

465
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,410
No.

466
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,330
It's so far. I don't wanna move.

467
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,210
Why do you pinch me?

468
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,210
They are going in the same direction.

469
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,590
We are in the opposite direction. Do you remember?

470
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,600
Jiang Chen will give them a ride.

471
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,770
We are leaving!

472
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,880
Keep in touch then!

473
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,680
Bye bye!

474
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,800
You are drunk.

475
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,280
Tell Xiaowei to pick you up.

476
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,730
It's so late.

477
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,930
Let's give you a ride!

478
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,600
No, thanks.

479
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,740
His assistant will pick us up.

480
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,190
Nobody answers.

481
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,110
Let's go.

482
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,470
My BF will give you a ride.

483
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,850
He is drunk, too.

484
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,640
Let's go.

485
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,760
Honey.

486
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,930
Let's give them a ride.

487
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,230
OK.

488
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,070
What's wrong?

489
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,920
Are you waiting for me to open the door?

490
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,940
let's go.

491
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,570
My Jiang Chen has to go to work tomorrow.

492
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,150
I want him to have a rest early.

493
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,650
Then first Bosong.

494
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,650
Then me.

495
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,150
The last is Xiaoxi.

496
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,190
It's the shortest way according to the GPS.

497
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,840
I want to get off with Xiaoxi.

498
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,180
Bosong.

499
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,030
It's getting your home.

500
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,510
You don't need to take my home.

501
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,550
Take Xiaoxi first.

502
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,940
Here we are.

503
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,090
It's OK.

504
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,850
I will accompany Xiaoxi to her home.

505
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,200
Don't worry.

506
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,010
Jiang Chen and I will ensure Xiaoxi's safety.

507
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,690
Bye bye.

508
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,470
Chen Xiaoxi, don't pretend that you don't know anything!

509
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,440
The car stalled.

510
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,550
Push it.

511
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,190
Chen Xiaoxi.

512
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,780
Get in the car.

513
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,390
Hurry up! I have to work tomorrow.

514
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,030
Jiang Chen! Don't you be so evil!

515
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,440
If you don't wanna pick mu up, tell me.

516
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,190
What do you mean by locking the door?

517
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,370
Chen Xiaoxi, are you idiot? Take the front seat.

518
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,440
I was just joking with you.

519
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,750
But it's wrong that you swore at me.

520
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,240
You can drop me off

521
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,010
at any bus station.

522
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,290
We are here.

523
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,770
Thanks for driving me home.

524
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,000
=Wu Bosong

525
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,790
Hello!

526
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,080
Are you home?

527
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,950
Yes, I am downstairs.

528
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,820
I am so happy that

529
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,990
you peeled the orange for me.

530
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,770
I am finding my keys.

531
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,950
Let's talk later.

532
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,330
You are drunk.

533
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,420
Remember to take the chasers.

534
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,350
OK.

535
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,620
Why do you come back?

536
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,320
You left your keys on my cars.

537
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,530
Thanks.

538
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,580
Chen Xiaoxi, I am so busy. I have so many things to do.

539
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:58,280
Do you know?

540
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,440
Yes, I do.

541
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,950
I am so sorry to make you come back.

542
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,620
You know that I don't mean this.

543
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,570
I don't know.

544
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,880
Do you have to make me say it so clearly?

545
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,970
Say it clearly.

546
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,870
You really don't know what I'm talking about?

547
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,560
I

548
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,510
really don't know.

549
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,160
Why do you know nothing?

550
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,000
If you know everything,

551
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,160
tell me then.

552
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,350
- Apologize to me. - What?

553
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,790
Apologize to me.

554
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,110
Apologize.

555
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,260
Sorry.

556
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,440
It will never happen again.

557
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,020
Get it?

558
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,350
Come closer.
