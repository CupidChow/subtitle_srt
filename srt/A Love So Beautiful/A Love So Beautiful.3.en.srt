Jiang Chen is acting a bit weird today.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

3
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,270
He hasn't said a single word.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

4
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,670
Will you two go to the Internet cafe today after school?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

5
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,880
And you two will be getting your own wives.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
- Let's go. - Go where?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,590
To attend a wedding.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

8
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,760
I haven't finished packing!

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,800
Anyone who would like to read his essay for him?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,283
Maybe that moment was one of the few moments
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

14
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:55,160
I ever feel so close to my father.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,440
He didn't say much,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,760
yet he definitely wanted his mother to be there for him.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,840
So, you're trying to buttering up your mother-in-law.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,590
That's too far away.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

20
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,400
Bro, are you waiting for me?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,870
You can win an Olympic gold medal?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

22
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
Come to my match tomorrow, and see for yourself.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,480
Wu Bosong, you're the best!
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

Please vote for me

36
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,790
Everyone, we'll start learning the article

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,870
"Zou Ji Remonstrates King Wei Of Qi".

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,920
Mr. Liu, excuse me.

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,400
I wanted to make an announcement.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,030
Everyone, listen to me.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,510
Our last class monitor, Zhang Beibei,

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,480
has transferred to a school in Beijing,

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,720
so the position is vacant since then.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,510
I'll cut to the chase.

45
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,310
Jiang Chen, you'll be the new class monitor.

46
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,560
Then you'll be Mrs. class monitor.

47
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,230
Ms. Liu, I'm not a good fit for the position.

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,510
Maybe you can choose someone else.

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,760
Ms. Liu.

50
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,870
I want to be the class monitor.

51
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,280
Ms. Liu, I want to be the class monitor as well.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Me, too.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,070
Ms. Liu, I...

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,840
Stop it.

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,120
How come you don't put that much passion into your study?

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,280
Ms. Liu,

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,360
it's a good thing that they want the position.

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,590
It shows that they aim high.

59
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,070
The quality-oriented education is been advocated lately.

60
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,230
Everyone thinks he or she is the best fit for the position.

61
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,510
Let them run for the position!

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,560
Figuring things out through democracy.

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,360
Good!

64
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,510
Mr. Liu,

65
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,200
I have no idea where this will lead us.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
That's all.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Continue your class.

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Mr. Liu, sorry for the interruption.

69
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,030
"Zou Ji Remonstrates King Wei Of Qi".

70
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,726
=Zou Ji

71
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,870
How did he become a Chinese teacher with terrible hand writing?

72
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,320
Wang Zhiyong, you really know this stuff.

73
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,320
After I become the class monitor, I'll make you guys commissaries.

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,190
You could be the commissary in charge of studies.

75
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,190
I'm good at studying.

76
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,160
You could be the commissary in charge of sports.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,630
How come everyone wants to be the class monitor?

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
You don't know the perks of power cause you haven't tasted it.

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,280
I once received yogurt and crystal sugar plum.

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
Fool.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,470
That's just one in the million.

82
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,630
Jiang Chen, let me help you.

83
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,670
It's fine.

84
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,720
How could they make him clean the blackboard?

85
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,070
He's not the emperor of the nation.

86
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,720
Why couldn't he do it?

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
It's not that, he caught a cold.

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,790
The chalk dust would do him no good.

89
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,720
Your heart aches for him.

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,320
So melodramatic.

91
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,630
Listen to me.

92
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,070
If your heart truly aches, go run for the class monitor.

93
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,400
This is what I won for you. From then on,

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,510
Jiang Chen doesn't need to clean the blackboard ever again.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,040
Jiang Chen,

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
how come you don't run for the class monitor?

97
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
Too messy.

98
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,520
Right.

99
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,350
Chen Xiaoxi, you copy our homework in class.

100
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,120
Wu Bosong often skips school classes.

101
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,350
Lin Jingxiao likes to fight.

102
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,350
What would you expect Jiang Chen to do about all that?

103
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,560
I...

104
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,070
I read novels in class.

105
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,510
Inappropriate novels.

106
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,040
Don't ask me to lend you novels the next time.

107
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,510
Jiang Chen,

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,190
this is a draft of my campaign speech.

109
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,880
Can you give me some advice?

110
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,510
Leave it here.

111
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,160
Thank you so much.

112
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,440
Why are you helping her? I thought you said it was messy.

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
So you two are really...

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,510
Lu Yang, stop your wild guesses.

115
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,600
What wild guesses?

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
That's our leader's private business.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
How can you be sure she'll win the election?

118
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,840
That's right.

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
If she can't win,

120
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
can you?

121
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Why can't I?

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,750
Ignorant.

123
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,440
Fine, you can.

124
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,720
Raise your hands if you want to run for class monitor.

125
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,280
Zhu Qiaoqiao, Zhang Hai, Li Wei.

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,280
Ms. Liu.

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,120
Ms. Liu.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,120
Me, me, me.

129
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,670
Put your hands down, Wang Dazhuang.

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,630
Anyone else who's interested?

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
Xiaoxi, raise your hands.

132
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,000
Go ahead, my leader.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,350
You can't win anyway.

134
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,950
Anyone else?

135
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,350
Raise your hands.

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,600
Chen Xiaoxi.

137
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
All right. We have four candidates.

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Go prepare your campaign speech.

139
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,510
Put your mind to it.

140
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,630
I mean it.

141
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,600
My hands, I can't control them.

142
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,440
How about I chop that for you,

143
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,280
then have your mother cook it, so we can sell it for money?

144
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,750
Chen Xiaoxi is so not qualified for the position,

145
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,350
she makes mistakes all the time.

146
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,320
Don't be mad. It's a free election.

147
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
Forget it, let's go back.

148
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,160
How could I get trash talked behind my back for that?

149
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,040
My grades are not that bad.

150
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,230
It seems like you have a huge misunderstanding about yourself.

151
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,470
The 37 score on math test was a one time thing.

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,000
Right.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
A girl with a 37 score on math test,

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,510
is the best fit to be class monitor.

155
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,670
You're making fun of me.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,510
Should I withdraw from the campaign,

157
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,950
or just runaway?

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,880
You should apply for political asylum.

159
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,720
I think you should run.

160
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,790
Show them your advantages so that you two may actually click.

161
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,470
I've tried so hard for nothing.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,840
How about you give me some advice for my campaign speech?

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Don't torture me.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,070
Jingjing.

165
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,190
Have faith in yourself.

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,800
My father is an honest coal worker.

167
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,550
He digs the coal all year round,

168
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,840
that's why his hands are always black.

169
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,920
He used to tell me that

170
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,040
he invested all his dreams and hopes in me.

171
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,110
And if I could ever become class monitor,

172
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,870
he would be so proud of me.

173
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,630
I would be the joy and inspiration of his life.

174
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm deeply touched.

175
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,190
Hello everyone,

176
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,510
my name is Chen Xiaoxi.

177
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,920
Hello everyone,

178
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,840
my name is Chen Xiaoxi.

179
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,870
Hello everyone,

180
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,680
my name is Chen Xiaoxi.

181
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,190
Hello everyone,

182
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,160
my name is Sofia snow sakura purple,

183
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,920
please vote for me.

184
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,430
Sofia snow sakura purple,

185
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,680
is that your stage name?

186
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,110
Nonsense.

187
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,310
Hello everyone,

188
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,510
my name is Chen Xiaoxi.

189
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,800
With my continued efforts,

190
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,310
I wish I could be our teachers' right-hand man.

191
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,240
What should I do?

192
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,950
I don't know how to do something like that.

193
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,190
Now I have to compete with others.

194
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,480
Don't sell yourself short.

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,510
I wish we were in a TV series.

196
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,310
The camera moves, many years later,

197
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,110
Chen Xiaoxi has become a successful class monitor.

198
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,800
Bro, I'll be there for you.

199
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,990
I'll help you.

200
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,920
I want every student to focus on their study,

201
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,190
and to love socialism.

202
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,720
When you grow up, you can make contribution to our country.

203
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Bro, do you think you possess any advantages?

204
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm pro-people.

205
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,310
You're pro-people.

206
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,800
What the heck does that mean?

207
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,160
Sincere! You are sincere!

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,240
Sincere!

209
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,280
You need to show them that even you're nobody right now,

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,720
you're willing to work hard to become a wonderful class monitor.

211
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,430
Your campaign speech should focus on your strength.

212
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,510
Humorous.

213
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,510
Your back story could be a bit more tragic.

214
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,920
Are your parents still around?

215
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,840
Now you're just being a jerk.

216
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,350
Fine.

217
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,110
Say what you want to say the most.

218
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,310
I want to be the class monitor.

219
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,680
I can't hear you.

220
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,750
I want to be the class monitor.

221
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Louder!

222
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,920
I want to be the class monitor.

223
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,850
Chen Xiaoxi is going to be the class monitor!

224
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,510
I'm going to be the class monitor!

225
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,110
Chen Xiaoxi is going to be the class monitor!

226
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,410
I'm going to be...

227
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,510
Hello everyone.

228
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,070
My name is Chen Xiaoxi.

229
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,190
Though I don't always excel at test scores,

230
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,160
and sometimes I break the class rules.

231
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,400
However,

232
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,070
I'm sincere and I'm willing to serve.

233
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
Don't I?

234
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,920
Can I count on your vote?

235
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
What do you think?

236
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,070
Of course you will.

237
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,400
If I were to be elected class monitor,

238
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
I would serve you all with devotion.

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,400
I would be our teachers' right-hand man,

240
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,680
and work hard to be a good class monitor.

241
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,920
Thank you.

242
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,400
Next.

243
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,310
Come on.

244
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,630
What are you laughing at?

245
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,070
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk.

246
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,110
Stop talking, everyone.

247
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,990
Hello everyone.

248
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,800
Some of you may think that

249
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,400
the fact I'm standing here today is ridiculous.

250
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,110
And to most of you, I've never been a good student.

251
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,950
Sometimes I even screw up, or make a fool of myself.

252
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
However,

253
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,870
=You're the best

254
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,990
I want to change for you.

255
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,040
We have three years ahead of us.

256
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,310
During that time, we may fight,

257
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,160
we may get angry with each other.

258
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,190
Nevertheless,

259
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,190
we'll be working together.

260
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,360
I wish I could be someone

261
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,950
who can actually help you guys.

262
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,510
Not some one

263
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,680
who's always screwing things up or dragging you down.

264
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,870
I wish I could be the class monitor who can work with you.

265
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,480
I would really appreciate everyone's guidance.

266
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,950
Good.

267
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,720
All right.

268
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,800
Let's start counting the votes.

269
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,870
Li Wei, one vote.

270
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,040
Chen Xiaoxi, one vote.

271
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,110
Chen Xiaoxi, one vote.

272
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,430
Zhang Hai, one vote.

273
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,600
Li Wei, one vote.

274
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,680
Zhu Qiaoqiao, one vote.

275
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,280
Li Wei, one vote.

276
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,630
Chen Xiaoxi, one vote.

277
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,720
Li Wei, one vote.

278
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,190
Chen Xiaoxi, one vote.

279
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,310
Li Wei, one vote.

280
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,190
Li Wei, one vote.

281
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,750
Li Wei, one vote.

282
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,870
Chen Xiaoxi, one vote.

283
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,550
Chen Xiaoxi, one vote.

284
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Ms. Liu, Li Wei has 14 votes.

285
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,950
Chen Xiaoxi has 15 votes.

286
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,070
Zhu Qiaoqiao has 4 votes, and Zhang Hai has 3 votes.

287
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,600
Ms. Liu.

288
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,280
What's the matter?

289
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,870
Jiang Chen hasn't vote yet.

290
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,510
He went to get the exercise books.

291
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,070
We should just skip his vote.

292
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,160
All right then.

293
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,360
Ms. Liu, here are the exercise books.

294
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,510
Sure, put them here.

295
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,630
Jiang Chen,

296
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,630
who would you vote for?

297
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,190
Li Wei.

298
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,070
How could he turn his back on Xiaoxi?

299
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,430
Then it's a tie.

300
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,950
You all gave good speeches.

301
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,800
Since it's a tie, then we'll give them a trial run for a week.

302
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,160
They will both be our class monitor.

303
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,840
Everyone can see for themselves,

304
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,920
and we'll do a re-election next Friday.

305
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,870
The sports meeting is coming.

306
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,510
You two should divide up, and collect our class fee.

307
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,720
Turn it to me on the next class meeting.

308
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
That's all. Go sit down.

309
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,920
Let's open the book,

310
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,630
turn to lesson seven.

311
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,870
Morning.

312
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,190
Jiang Chen,

313
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,950
thanks for your vote yesterday.

314
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,550
It's fine. Plus I've had breakfast.

315
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,160
I bought two of them, don't let them go to waste.

316
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,190
Take it!

317
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,360
Save them for dessert.

318
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,990
Leave it here.

319
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,870
The unfaithful bastard.

320
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,750
Stop that.

321
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,190
Be quiet, the first bell has rang.

322
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,250
=Endurance

323
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,110
Chen Xiaoxi, switch your crush to some other guy.

324
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,920
I won't.

325
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,990
Then express your disappointment and make him change.

326
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,870
I wouldn't dare.

327
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,680
If Li Wei gets him, don't cry.

328
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,560
What should I do?

329
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,400
Chin up, lift your chest. Let's go.

330
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,810
Show me you are the queen to that emperor.

331
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,660
Jiang Chen, how come you didn't run for class monitor?

332
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,590
If you're the class monitor,

333
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,920
Li Wei would be the assistant class monitor,

334
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,140
you two would make such a cute team.

335
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,140
But I'm no queen.

336
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,000
There's no need to run the election.

337
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,160
The last vote is so embarrassing on Chen Xiaoxi.

338
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,130
What do you mean?

339
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm just telling the truth.

340
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,380
She's absolutely not qualified to be class monitor.

341
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,430
What are you doing?

342
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,990
That's right.

343
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,000
You do look like you weigh a lot than my bro.

344
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,710
The class is about to begin.

345
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,800
Enlighten me.

346
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
Why didn't you vote for Chen Xiaoxi?

347
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,470
Right, why didn't you?

348
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,010
She's not fit for the job.

349
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,200
Jiang Chen,

350
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,750
why am I not fit for the job?

351
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,230
I'm just telling the truth.

352
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,800
Then Li Wei is fit for it?

353
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,510
Better than you.

354
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,040
You're crazy.

355
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,200
What did you do with Jiang Chen?

356
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,510
Let's get out of here.

357
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,230
Chen Xiaoxi.

358
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,400
Chen Xiaoxi.

359
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,590
What's wrong?

360
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,470
What's the matter?

361
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,470
Was he mean to you?

362
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.

363
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,310
Come with me, I have to collect the class fee.

364
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,400
What?

365
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,230
You kicked him?

366
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,750
Lower your voice.

367
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh my god, Chen Xiaoxi,

368
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I didn't know you had it in you.

369
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,680
I thought you're the doormat,

370
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,110
and yet if someone pushes you too hard,

371
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,510
you're gonna kick them where it hurts the most.

372
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,560
What should I do?

373
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,440
Will he be mad at me?

374
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
Should I go and apologize to him?

375
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,830
Jiang Chen,

376
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,110
I don't believe it.

377
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,750
How dare Chen Xiaoxi kick you?

378
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,990
Oh my god.

379
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,710
She has balls.

380
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,160
I need to compliment her later.

381
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,870
What's wrong? Are you angry?

382
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,990
You're the one who kicked him.

383
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,960
And somehow,

384
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,280
I feel so satisfied.

385
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,040
I'm so worried.

386
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm afraid to ask him for class fee!

387
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,110
What's to worry about?

388
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,470
Just finish counting and start eating.

389
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,230
Wait a moment.

390
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,160
I haven't finished.

391
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,750
How much do you have there?

392
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,710
=Class fee: 1000 yuan

393
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,800
One thousand yuan.
=Class fee: 1000 yuan

394
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,250
=Class fee: 1000 yuan

395
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,750
There he is. I'll escort you to collect his class fee.

396
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,470
Bro,

397
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,680
shaking down people for money?

398
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,560
Jiang Chen.

399
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,870
Give me my change.

400
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,350
Jiang Chen,

401
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,040
Mr. Liu wanted me to ask you to copy his report for him.

402
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,960
He said you are good at hand writing.

403
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
I see.

404
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I agree with him.

405
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,920
Have you practise on the copybook before?

406
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,080
I always write the words too small and it's not easy on the eye.

407
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,630
I can recommend my copybook to you.

408
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,110
Really?

409
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,350
Bro,

410
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,600
you're getting better at shaking people down for money.

411
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,510
- Chen Xiaoxi. - What?

412
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,680
How much money did you shake down?

413
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,810
Why are you interested?

414
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,080
Don't tell him. He's the weasel who tries to pay hen a visit.

415
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,440
I'm not the weasel!

416
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,830
Wu Bosong is right.

417
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,620
You need to be careful.

418
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,090
Count the class fee, and we'll hand it in this afternoon.

419
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,010
Roger that.

420
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
What's wrong?

421
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,990
Don't tell me...

422
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,870
Lower your voice!

423
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,800
You really lost the class fee?

424
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,750
God, it's over.

425
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
How much money is there?

426
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,870
This is just your trial run,

427
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,400
and Ms. Liu has strict rules about everything.

428
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,960
I don't suppose she's gonna ask you to quit school, right?

429
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,160
Don't say that.

430
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,870
If that happens, I'm the least-educated person in my family.

431
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,080
What's wrong?

432
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,160
What's the matter?

433
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,960
My stomach hurts.

434
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,470
Don't tell others.

435
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,400
I know.

436
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,470
Have you looked everywhere?

437
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,110
Even in my pen cap.

438
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,040
I couldn't find it.

439
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,470
Think about it.

440
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,960
Where did you go?

441
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,200
Well,

442
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,440
we had milk tea and grilled potato for lunch, right?

443
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,710
We've been to the cafeteria and snack counter.

444
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,830
Then we returned to the classroom.

445
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,830
That's all.

446
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,630
Just try and think about it, we can find it.

447
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,710
Where did I go?

448
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,590
I truly can't remember.

449
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,630
It's over.

450
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,560
My bro said that her stomach hurts.

451
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,630
Drink boiled water.

452
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,320
It's not that.

453
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,110
Just something you can say to a girl at a time like this.

454
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,510
Your bro,

455
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,680
she won't need it.

456
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,830
What do you mean? How is my bro less a girl?

457
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,800
Fine, my mistake, all right?

458
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,160
Did you bring any medicine?

459
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,630
Beside my dearest Jingjing,

460
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,160
I couldn't care less if the Pope had a stomachache.

461
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,870
You want medicine, go see Dr. Li.

462
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,510
He's in the far right office on the first floor.

463
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,800
Doctor,

464
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,990
my stomach hurts like crazy.

465
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,710
Please give me some medicine.

466
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,990
Let me guess.

467
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,870
You are new here.

468
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,800
Your acting skill needs a bit more touching.

469
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,560
It's not that.

470
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,230
One of my classmates had a stomachache.

471
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,680
I wanted to find some medicine...

472
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,560
...for him.

473
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,510
The medicine to treat boy's stomachache is different from girl's.

474
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,200
Can you give me something to treat a girl's stomachache?

475
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,080
=Brown sugar

476
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,680
Thanks.

477
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,440
Kids.

478
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,510
The money is not at the cafeteria or the snack counter.

479
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,440
Maybe she lost it in the bathroom?

480
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,870
No way.

481
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,710
It's too huge a pile to be lost in there.

482
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,230
What are you doing?

483
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,350
Trying to solve a crime.

484
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,440
Leave me alone.

485
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,230
Solving a crime?

486
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,080
Is it Detective Conan's new game?

487
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,800
Let me see that.

488
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,550
=Classroom/Playground/Toilet/Snake Counter/Cafeteria
Teaching Building

489
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,870
That's our school, right?

490
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,590
Based on your IQ, there's a good chance you can't understand it.

491
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,870
Nowadays, solving a crime depends on surveillance cameras.

492
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,870
Don't you watch legal programs on TV?

493
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,160
Wow, you're really good at this.

494
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Finally, all these years of your TV-watching is worth something.

495
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,870
Head, I'm having diarrhea.

496
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,510
Tail, I'm having a fever.

497
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,280
If it stands upright, then I'll cut class.

498
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,830
Abracadabra.

499
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,080
Your stomach, it still hurts?

500
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,680
Not at all.

501
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,160
Take this.

502
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,960
Did you lose our class fee?

503
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,200
No, I didn't.

504
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,440
Yes, I did.

505
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,750
Help me.

506
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,080
Why should I?

507
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,080
After I become class monitor,

508
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
I'll treat you well.

509
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,710
Pretty please?

510
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,750
How did you lose it?

511
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,710
I can't remember.

512
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,040
Think about the last time you saw the money.

513
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,870
I've been thinking for a whole day,

514
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,750
I can't remember a single clue.

515
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,160
Keep trying.

516
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,400
You collected my fee in the afternoon.

517
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,200
Then what did you do?

518
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,280
Then...

519
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,920
I...

520
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
I remember!

521
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,400
I put it in my exercise book!

522
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,870
Liu Qingshan took it to the office.

523
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,080
Please help me.

524
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,160
You're good at kicking people, go kick him.

525
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,750
Jiang Chen.

526
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,470
Mr. Liu, I understand this is all my fault.

527
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,630
I promise I won't do it again.

528
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,320
Please don't tell Ms. Liu about this.

529
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,590
Mr. Liu, this is all my fault.

530
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,200
Please don't tell Dean about this.

531
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,870
I'm a nice teacher, but don't expect me to cover for you.

532
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,680
Stand straight, I'll take you to Dean's office later.

533
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,870
Did you hear that?

534
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,630
Li Wei,

535
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,470
I need to go to the bathroom.

536
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,750
She's having diarrhea.

537
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,160
Can you describe your symptoms?

538
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,230
Just grab some medicine that treat diarrhea.

539
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,160
Get in.

540
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,590
No one is here.

541
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,440
You're right, Mr. Liu.

542
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,510
We shouldn't cover for them, they need to be punished.

543
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,400
Why are you here?

544
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,350
Well,

545
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,200
Mr. Liu wanted to see me.

546
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,830
Right.

547
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,990
Jiang Chen has good hand writing skills,

548
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,200
so I wanted to ask him to copy a report for me.

549
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,990
- Jiang Chen. - Go.

550
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,110
What about you?

551
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
What are you doing here?

552
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,710
I...

553
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,630
Ms. Liu,

554
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,830
there's something on my mind.

555
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,870
Say it.

556
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,280
Ever since I became acting-class monitor,

557
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,230
I couldn't sleep at night for a few days.

558
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,710
I was thinking,

559
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,630
I'm holding so much power,

560
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,800
I need do the job right.

561
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,200
I can't embarrass my teachers or classmates.

562
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,750
So I feel upset.

563
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,110
But, I want to make contributions to my class,

564
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,040
to help my fellow classmates,

565
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,630
and to be an exemplary class monitor.

566
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,750
Do you believe me?

567
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,200
If you do, I'll be your class monitor for life!

568
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,750
I believe you.

569
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,920
Thank you so much.

570
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,280
I'll work harder on that, Ms. Liu.

571
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,830
I gotta go.

572
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,110
Goodbye.

573
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Is she...

574
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,920
...all right?

575
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,710
Someone's coming.

576
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,710
I don't think I can hear anything.

577
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,110
Is he gone?

578
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,470
I'm sure he's still here.

579
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,470
I'll check.

580
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,710
He's still there.

581
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,630
Step aside.

582
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,990
No one is here.

583
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,280
I'll count to three, then run like hell.

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,440
Run!

585
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,550
Who are you?

586
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,110
Take the medicine and you'll be fine.

587
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
Thanks.

588
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,030
What should I do?

589
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,550
The class meeting is about to start.

590
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,310
What about the money?

591
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,720
Liu Xinxia walked into the office, there's nothing I can do.

592
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,520
If everyone knows that I put class fee in my exercise book,

593
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,790
they would laugh their asses off.

594
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,030
How about I hide in the bathroom later?

595
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,030
You can call in sick for me.

596
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,960
I'll ask my mother for money to pay her back tomorrow.

597
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,440
This is an excellent idea.

598
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,070
You are an excellent class monitor.

599
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,270
You are so fit for the job.

600
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Do you need me to cover for you?

601
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,350
I haven't decided yet.

602
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,700
Everyone has behaved well lately,

603
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,630
our two class monitors did a good job.

604
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,250
Especially Chen Xiaoxi, she made huge progress lately.

605
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
She came to me this morning to tell me how she felt about the job.

606
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,720
You should learn from her.

607
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,320
Think more about the bigger picture than yourselves.

608
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,360
You two, hand in our class fee.

609
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,470
What should I do?

610
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,720
Ms. Liu, here is 1000 yuan.

611
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,760
Chen Xiaoxi and I each collected two groups' fee,

612
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
the total amount should be 2000 yuan.

613
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,470
Chen Xiaoxi.

614
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,660
Go ahead.

615
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,380
Chen Xiaoxi, hurry up.

616
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,960
Ms. Liu,

617
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,120
I lost the class fee.

618
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,130
What?

619
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,760
Mr. Liu,

620
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,150
I finished your report.

621
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,280
That was fast.

622
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,070
=Class Eight Grade One
Chen Xiaoxi

623
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,070
This is such beautiful hand writing.

624
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,000
You must've worked really hard on that.

625
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,440
Mr. Liu.

626
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,000
I gotta go.

627
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,720
Already?

628
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,070
Thank you for this.

629
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,730
Don't mention it.

630
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,920
Just resign if you can't do the job.

631
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
Who knows if the money is really lost or she took it?

632
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,400
Qiao Lu, you'd better watch your mouth.

633
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm not the one who lost the class fee.

634
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,920
Ms. Liu, I have the class fee.

635
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,530
She left it with me.

636
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,680
Ms. Liu,

637
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,670
I did lose the fee,

638
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,380
and it was Jiang Chen who found it.

639
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,960
I'm truly sorry about that.

640
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,390
I'm not fit for the position.

641
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
Listen to me.

642
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,400
You are still young.

643
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,240
I don't know if you remember Chen Xiaoxi's campaign speech.

644
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,300
She said,

645
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:40,480
"We have three years ahead of us.

646
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,590
During that time, we may fight or get angry with each other."

647
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,960
Well said.

648
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,030
Xiaoxi, I want to add something to that.

649
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:52,680
These three years is the time you could truly become an adult.

650
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,920
The meaning of that time,

651
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,590
is not about how much chemistry equations you learned,

652
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,000
or if you know the answer to the last question on the math test.

653
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What you need to learn is how to be an adult.

654
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,000
If you made a mistake,

655
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,010
you need to have the courage to own it.

656
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,000
Ms. Liu,

657
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
I'm so sorry.

658
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,760
This is entirely my fault.

659
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,440
Besides courage,

660
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,830
you also need to be...

661
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,070
...tolerant with others.

662
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,310
To embrace their mistakes.

663
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,720
It's fine, Chen Xiaoxi.

664
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,440
It's no big deal, Xiaoxi.

665
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,550
You were great!

666
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,070
Thank you guys.

667
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,030
But it was my fault this time.

668
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,630
Ms. Liu,

669
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,030
I'm willing to resign.

670
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,250
All right then.

671
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,800
Enough for that small incident.

672
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,270
I want you to really think about what I said.

673
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,200
Now sit down.

674
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,620
Let's continue our class.

675
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,730
Wu Bosong.

676
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,920
You see,

677
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,390
I never really had a stomachache this afternoon.

678
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,630
That's all right.

679
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,200
But you bought all these medicine for me.

680
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,550
It's fine, I'm happy to spend my money for my bro.

681
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,870
You should keep it,

682
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,180
they have no use to me.

683
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,910
I'll buy you steak some other time.

684
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,180
You were right.

685
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360
I was never fit to be a class monitor.

686
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,830
Actually, you did a good job.

687
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,720
Wait for me.

688
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,240
Why should I?

689
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,320
For you to kick me again?

690
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,790
Are you Sailor Moon?

691
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,360
The legend of Japan.

692
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,610
You know nothing about power.
