=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:42,049
Teacher, could you give me more diazepam?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:42,848
No.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,754
You watch me stay with Lin Jingxiao in that way everyday.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

10
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:54,831
You think I am so funny?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

11
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,023
So stupid?

Our child is good at home.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

20
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,651
Why does she get depression as soon as she goes to school?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

21
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:06,137
She might die after eating such medicine.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,906
It is Mr. Li who gives me diazepam.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

Teacher, I help Li Wei steal diazepam.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

26
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:14,607
Mr. Li has nothing to do with this.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

27
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:15,709
Li Shu is back.

You wake up.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

32
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:24,071
Doctor says
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

33
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,839
you'd better stay a while at the hospital for a while.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

34

Hope to Stay with You

41
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:01,048
Morning.

42
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,199
Sorry, sorry.

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,040
I miss Lu Yang so much.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,480
I wonder if he dyes his hair black again.

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,760
Lu Yang was so cool that day.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,919
Have you been touched?

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,480
It's halftime.

48
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,919
I have drunk it.

49
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,160
The half is yours.

50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Do you want some water?

51
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,160
I want this one.

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
This...

53
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,515
=The countdown to the college entrance examination
Integrated test in science

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,880
Jiang Chen performs well

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,200
as usual,

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,719
performs well in all the subjects,

57
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,800
especially in math.

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
His performance is indeed excellent,

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,360
so we are thinking about

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,679
consulting with Mr. Guo to see

61
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,920
whether it is possible

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,999
to send Jiang Chen to attend a competition.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,559
Don't bother.

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,959
I have talked about that with Jiang Chen.

65
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,559
I want him to attend the independent recruitment of Tsinghua.

66
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,800
I trust him.

67
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
He can make it.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Yes.

69
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,920
If he makes it,

70
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,480
it will be the honor of our school.

71
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,439
Jiang Chen.

72
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,439
Come here.

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,959
Your mom and I talked about your performance just now.

74
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,040
Your mom says

75
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,360
you are going to attend the independent recruitment of Tsinghua.

76
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,080
I have told my colleague there.

77
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,399
He will take care of you when you go there.

78
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,760
I have not decided yet. Talk about it later.

79
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,279
What do you mean by having not decided yet?

80
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,439
We have talked about it, haven't we?

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,399
We talked about it one year ago,

82
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,439
but now I want to reconsider it.

83
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,880
Reconsider it?

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,679
Where do you want to go except Tsinghua?

85
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,480
Don't worry.

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,519
That's normal.

87
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,760
The Child always needs time.

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,839
After all, it's about his future.

89
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,439
He should think it over.

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll go back to the classroom.

91
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,559
Still thinking of Dr. Li?

92
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,360
I don't know.

93
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,200
I think it seems that I should be sad,

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,160
but,

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,920
it is a little bit weird recently.

96
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,239
I know.

97
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,719
It's mainly because Lu Yang is so romantic.

98
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,719
If you still think of Li Shu,

99
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,959
you will feel that you are kind of wanton?

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
You are wanton.

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,920
Stop it.

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,999
Jiang Chen.

103
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,080
Well,

104
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,279
let's go to see Lu Yang this afternoon.

105
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,480
He must be bored at hospital.

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes.

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,480
He will flirt with nurses when he gets bored.

108
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,719
You should discipline him.

109
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,600
He is right.

110
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,399
Lu Yang will be crazy,

111
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,920
if he sees you.

112
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,119
I won't go.

113
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,279
Your pants are torn.

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,640
Use this as a cover.

115
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:35,719
Ok.

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,640
I will go.

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Bye.

118
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,360
You watch horror movie again.

119
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,439
I don't want to watch it.

120
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,399
Go back then.

121
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,360
No.

122
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,680
Lin Jingxiao.

123
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,160
I picked a star

124
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,000
for you.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,160
I love Lin Jingxiao only.

126
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,560
During the three years in senior high school,

127
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,639
I loved her all the time.

128
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,680
Lin Jingxiao.

129
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,719
Goodbye.

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,800
Number 36, it's time to draw blood.

131
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,199
I have been drawn this morning.

132
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,719
I don't have so much blood for you to draw.

133
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,040
Drawing blood in the morning is for testing.

134
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,719
Be quick.

135
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't prick yet.

136
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Nurse.

137
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
Be quick.

138
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,480
I want to talk with my friends.

139
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,719
Draw.

140
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,360
Draw hard. I have enough blood.

141
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,199
You cried and said you are blood phobia this morning.

142
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,800
Where is the vigour that you have when you read fantasy novels?

143
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,040
Heaven and earth is boundless. The weather changes.

144
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,160
All of a sudden, lightening flashes and thunder rumbles.

145
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,680
You, Lu Yang, appears at this time.

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,040
Enough.

147
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,440
Jingjing has something else to do,

148
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
so she doesn't come here.

149
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,079
I'm not asking about her.

150
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,279
Jingjing.

151
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,199
Don't you say you will not come?

152
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,360
Jingjing, you must spend a lot of money.

153
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Lu Yang.

154
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,560
You have been touched?

155
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,719
Jingjing cried all the day,

156
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,519
after you went to hospital.

157
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,120
That's because she missed you.

158
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,800
Well,

159
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,279
I copied the notes

160
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,800
for you.

161
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,800
I'm afraid that you will be left behind,

162
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:19,120
because you are not in class.

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,959
Don't bother.

164
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
My parents find teachers to teach me.

165
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,879
Forget it.

166
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Jingjing.

167
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,800
I will go home.

168
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,959
What should we do?

169
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,680
Don't worry about that.

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,360
How about...

171
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
Watch out the car.

172
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,800
There is no car.

173
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,719
Let's go to play.

174
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,879
You need to have some checkups.

175
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,759
You can't eat these health care products.

176
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,759
I put these away for you.

177
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,519
You can start the game.

178
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,920
What are you looking at?

179
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,879
Go back.

180
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,719
I also want to play after watching for a while.

181
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,240
You can only be taught by me.

182
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
After all, you have seen Jiang Chen's poor skill.

183
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,160
I will go home.

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,279
I'm going home. Let't play next time.

185
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,279
Bye.

186
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,000
Jiang Chen, I don't know you can play billiards.

187
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,959
It's dirty.

188
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,959
I don't think so.

189
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,519
However,

190
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,879
I don't imagine that you are so handsome when you play it.

191
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,639
Although you lost this time,

192
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,440
it's not because you are bad at it.

193
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,639
It's because

194
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,120
Wu Bosong is so good at it.

195
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,759
I mean it.

196
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,879
You must win if you play with common people,

197
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,279
but Wu Bosong is not a common one.

198
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,519
Thus, don't be sad for losing this game.

199
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:18,680
You are back.

200
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,440
Good evening, aunt.

201
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,800
Good evening, Xiaoxi.

202
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,240
Bro.

203
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,839
Mom said that you would go to Tsinghua

204
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,480
to attend the independent recruitment.

205
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,199
I will go home. Goodbye, aunt.

206
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,959
Give my regards to your parents.

207
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,759
Bro,

208
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,199
you haven't told me yet.

209
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,079
Whether will you go to Tsinghua?

210
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,920
Of course your brother will go to Tsinghua.

211
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,480
Your don't need to worry about that.

212
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,040
Let's go to buy some fruits.

213
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,079
Do your homework as soon as you get home.

214
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:47,519
Ok.

215
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,079
Bye.

216
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,040
I don't do well in study.

217
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,680
What if I can't go to a university in Beijing?

218
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,399
Are you alright with such intense practice?

219
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,599
Dad.

220
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,279
Doctors like to make a fuss.

221
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,119
If I don't practice now, I can't attend the national competition.

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,639
Okay.

223
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:28,920
Then I will put forth my strength.

224
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,879
What's wrong?

225
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,320
Are you alright?

226
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,119
Doctor.

227
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,840
Doctor.

228
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,599
Mr. Wu, have a seat.

229
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,999
Mr. Wu.

230
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
It's not very optimistic.

231
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,960
What's the matter?

232
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,320
Lie down, lie down. Have a rest.

233
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,479
Recently,

234
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,759
you need to have a good rest.

235
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,359
Have a good health.

236
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,960
What about the national competition?

237
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,200
It doesn't matter.

238
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,040
Health is more important.

239
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,359
It's all right.

240
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,639
You said I need to have intensive training before the competition.

241
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,960
Why do you suddenly ask me to have a rest?

242
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,759
I'm okay.

243
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,680
Obey to the order of the team.

244
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,119
Lie down, lie down.

245
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,040
Have a rest.

246
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,279
You don't need to have training recently?

247
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,920
Why do you have time to come to school?

248
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,080
My father is busy with something else recently.

249
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,239
He asks me to have a rest.

250
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,999
For me, coming to school is suffering,

251
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,080
while for you, is having a rest.

252
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,440
You made such a loud noise when you rested.

253
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Your snores actually have a rhythm.

254
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,999
Liu Qingshan is mad at you.

255
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,720
He called you several times, but didn't wake you up.

256
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
This kind of rhythm?

257
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,359
The wind is roaring, the horse is neighing.

258
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,320
Wu Bosong is sleeping, Liu Qingshan is shouting.

259
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,680
What's wrong?

260
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,759
Nothing.

261
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,279
My shoulder is a little bit hurt.

262
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,239
I have applied a plaster.

263
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,359
You are so tired recently that

264
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,800
you got a stiff neck

265
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,040
for your uncomfortable sleeping posture in class.

266
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,879
What are you talking about?

267
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,160
Chen Xiaoxi,

268
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,560
Liu Xinxia asks you to go to her office.

269
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,440
Ask me?

270
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,759
Why ask her?

271
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,479
Right, why?

272
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,440
I did't make any trouble recently,

273
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
and did't sleep in class, either.

274
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,119
My homework has been finished on time.

275
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,279
Why ask me?

276
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,359
She said you didn't focus on study.

277
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,759
How did she know that?

278
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,759
You come to chat with others as soon as the class is over.

279
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,599
Either drinking water or going to the toilet in the self-study class.

280
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,040
It's easy for her to know that you don't focus on study.

281
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,160
Right.

282
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,639
My English exam paper is not finished.

283
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,800
I have to go.

284
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,320
Your ability of lying

285
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,040
is as good as your performance in study.

286
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,239
Come in.

287
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:32,720
Miss Liu.

288
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,239
Chen Xiaoxi.

289
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:33,840
You asked me to come here?

290
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:34,999
No.

291
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,080
Jiang Chen said you asked me.

292
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,479
Ok, probably I did,

293
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,080
but I forgot.

294
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,479
Miss Liu, the thing is that

295
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:45,399
I like to drink since I was young.

296
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:47,359
I of course need to go to toilet after drinking water.

297
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,040
My mother said drinking water can relieve stress.

298
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,440
I am in twelfth grade and have lots of pressures.

299
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,639
But don't worry.

300
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,920
I will not waste the time for study.

301
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,879
Chen Xiaoxi.

302
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,119
I think you behave well recently.

303
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,479
That owes to your efforts.

304
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,999
Anything else?

305
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,040
Yes.

306
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,960
I want to know that

307
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,759
is it possible for me

308
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,800
to go to a university in Beijing.

309
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,119
You want to go to Beijing?

310
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,599
Let's put it that way.

311
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,160
According to your performance now,

312
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,519
if you go to a university in Beijing,

313
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,680
it at best will be a third-tier university.

314
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,080
However,

315
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,279
if you go to a local university,

316
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,759
you can go to a second-tier one.

317
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Thank you, teacher.

318
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,720
What should I do?

319
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,680
Liu Xinxia said my performance in study is not very ideal.

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,599
I can only go to a third-tier university if I want to go to Beijing.

321
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,119
Are you surprised?

322
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,519
You chat with others as soon as the class is over.

323
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,720
No wonder your performance is not ideal.

324
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,359
That's not true.

325
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,200
Since Lu Yang left school,

326
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,399
Lin Jingxiao has been in a bad mood.

327
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,840
I can speak with Wu Bosong only.

328
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,920
How about teaching me in your free time?

329
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,720
So that I can go with you to Beijing

330
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,440
when my study is improved.

331
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,440
Why will I go to Beijing with you?

332
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,560
You want to go with other people?

333
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,479
Or you don't want to go to Beijing?

334
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,080
Where do you want to go if not to Beijing?

335
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,320
Anyhow, I will go with you.

336
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,359
You smiled?

337
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,140
That means you agree to teach me after class, do you?

338
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,320
I didn't smile.

339
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,920
I see you smile.

340
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,560
You are happy to teach me.

341
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:38,639
You see, this is plane α and this is plane β.

342
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:42,080
M is a point out of the plane α and plane β.

343
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,171
Straight line P which goes through point M

344
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:48,779
has common points Point A B with plane α β respectively.

345
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:51,690
Yes, memorize this.

346
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,519
It's late today.

347
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,519
How about stopping here?

348
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,639
Ok, thank you, teacher.

349
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:07,519
All right. Keep working.

350
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,560
You will do well if you keep studying hard.

351
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,320
You will improve quickly.

352
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,160
Thank you, teacher.

353
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,320
Come on.

354
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,160
Goodbye, teacher.

355
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,560
Bye.

356
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,239
You finished?

357
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,479
Why don't you ask your classmate to come in?

358
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,040
She doesn't want to bother you

359
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,840
and has been waiting quite a while outside on the bench.

360
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,080
You don't know?

361
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,599
Over there.

362
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,680
Sister nurse.

363
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,200
Yes?

364
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,160
You tell her that

365
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,999
I have left the hospital.

366
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:51,759
Why?

367
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,440
I am so handsome that

368
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,320
girls in my school always come to me

369
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,239
and bother me. I am so tired.

370
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
Thank you, sister nurse.

371
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,239
You are Lu Yang's classmate?

372
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,239
Yes.

373
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,440
He has gone home.

374
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,040
Don't wait. Go home.

375
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,320
Lu Yang.

376
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,440
Wu Bosong doesn't come to school once again.

377
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,279
Lu Yang, either.

378
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,759
I feel the back is empty.

379
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,200
I don't get used to that.

380
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,759
Isn't Wu Bosong in the rest period?

381
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,040
Yes, I don't know why.

382
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,800
Xiaoxi.

383
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,359
You ask me?

384
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,440
You don't have dinner yet?

385
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:41,639
Come on. I'll treat you.

386
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Who is that guy?

387
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,479
Wu Bosong's dad.

388
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,920
Uncle.

389
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,960
Why do you ask me to dinner today?

390
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,960
Try this.

391
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,519
Ok.

392
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,519
Xiaoxi.

393
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,960
I want you to do me a favor.

394
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,639
Ok. Please go ahead.

395
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,639
Bosong.

396
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:28,639
He has some troubles recently.

397
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,479
His shoulder is injured again recently

398
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,560
and his injury is worse than we have thought.

399
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,639
The national team called me.

400
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,160
They said

401
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,320
forget it.

402
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:56,279
I worry that he may be in a bad mood.

403
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:57,920
You are his good friend.

404
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,599
He has every confidence in you.

405
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,560
Please persuade him.

406
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,040
Persuade him to cheer up.

407
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,759
At least,

408
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,239
he can attend the college entrance examination.

409
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,639
Don't worry.

410
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:16,599
I will try.

411
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,239
We, his friends, will accompany him.

412
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,399
Jiang Chen,

413
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,519
where are you going?

414
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,639
It's late. Where have you been?

415
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,479
I have something to do.

416
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,599
Something that can't be told to me.

417
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,680
You didn't tell me that

418
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
you would attend the independent recruitment test of Tsinghua.

419
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,639
Well, you know that at last.

420
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,639
You will go whether I know or not.

421
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,599
Probably not.

422
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,080
Maybe I will not go.

423
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,879
Really?

424
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:55,160
Then I will not go, either.

425
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,080
Where are you going?

426
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,560
Take out the garbage. Don't you see that?

427
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:03,359
You take it out when it's not full?

428
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,960
My mom always fills up the garbage can.

429
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,359
Daxue.

430
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,279
Xiaojie is here.

431
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,080
Eat an apple.

432
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,440
Thank you, granny.

433
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,279
Eat grapes.

434
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,399
Thank you.

435
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,599
Eat bananas.

436
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,920
Ok, I'll eat.

437
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Ok.

438
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,999
Eat.

439
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,239
I'll eat.

440
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Have more.

441
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,560
I'll go to get the watermelon for you.

442
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,599
Ok.

443
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:29,999
Be careful, granny.

444
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,800
Give you more. I can't hold all these.

445
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
You can.

446
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,320
Xiaojie comes here.

447
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,239
You begrudge her even a watermelon.

448
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,160
It's not true, granny.

449
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,200
Xiaojie come to our home.

450
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,160
You begrudge her a watermelon.

451
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:56,999
I don't, granny.

452
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,359
I never begrudge her anything.

453
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,080
Who is Xiaojie?

454
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,040
My mom.

455
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,320
Do you look like her?

456
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,479
We look exactly alike.

457
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:05,479
I am not that black.

458
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:08,920
Young people like to whisper.

459
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,080
You are going to marry him.

460
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,359
Afterwards,

461
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,440
you can whisper whole night when you get married.

462
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,879
Now I will cut the watermelon for you.

463
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,720
Ok.

464
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:22,359
Be careful.

465
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,639
Come on, wife.

466
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:29,279
Eat some fruits.

467
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,639
Don't be kidding.

468
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,239
You look good.

469
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,160
What's wrong?

470
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,320
Wu Bosong.

471
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,999
Do you still consider me as your bro?

472
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,399
Then you should tell everything to your bro.

473
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,080
It's not that serious.

474
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,160
I woke up late these two days.

475
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,080
I will go to school this afternoon.

476
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,759
Don't deceive me.

477
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,119
Your shoulder injury is serious.

478
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,087
Your dad has told me.

479
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,800
Your old injury recurred and you can't attend the competition.

480
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,560
You can't enter the national team.

481
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,160
You knew.

482
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,599
Let's go out.

483
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,320
Granny, we are going to school.

484
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,560
Probably I will give up swimming.

485
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,680
I need to relearn the textbook of the tenth grade.

486
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,999
This time I will be a hard-working student.

487
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,840
Actually, I think what kind of person you will be is not important.

488
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,599
You are a brilliant guy anyway.

489
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,759
Thus, once you decide,

490
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,440
everything can be done well.

491
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,599
The way you praise me

492
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,160
is really like my mom.

493
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,720
Son, believe mom.

494
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,560
I really think you are great.

495
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,160
Really.

496
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,680
Because knowing you

497
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,879
is like making a great fortune.

498
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:57,999
Every time I walk on the street,

499
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,200
I want to tell the passersby,

500
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,840
look,

501
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,759
this is my friend,

502
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,359
the national champion.

503
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,440
Lu Yang always does the same thing.

504
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Yes.

505
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,119
We have already been so proud

506
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,800
just because we know you.

507
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,720
Thus you should be more confident.

508
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,759
Once you are determined

509
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,080
and make a decision,

510
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,119
no matter what it is,

511
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,080
we will give you unconditional support.

512
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,960
No.

513
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,200
Not unconditional support.

514
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,639
Sometimes,

515
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,080
I can get a discount through your fame,

516
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,040
so it is conditional support.

517
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,720
Ok.

518
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,879
Whether it is with condition or not,

519
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,759
I can have your support.

520
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,119
First, teach me how to be a good student.

521
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,279
Don't worry.

522
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,320
Don't you remember that?

523
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
I am an expert in that field.

524
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,359
Then you teach me

525
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:48,127
what is trigonometric function.

526
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,799
This is a little bit difficult.

527
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,289
Let's go back to the classroom first.

528
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,359
Anyhow, now for you,

529
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,599
you have two strings to your bow,

530
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,920
preparing the college entrance examination

531
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,399
as healing you shoulder injury.

532
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,239
If your shoulder is healed,

533
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,040
you can become the national champion.

534
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,200
If you are prepared for the college entrance examination,

535
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,119
you will be the best one in the exam.

536
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,599
You are good at bragging.

537
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,160
Of course.

538
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,639
You succeed in bringing him back to school.

539
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,639
Jiang Chen.

540
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,519
Could you help fetch water?

541
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,840
Listen to me,

542
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,479
Zhang Shiliang said before that some people fall in love in our class.

543
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,200
I think they must be Wu Bosong and Chen Xiaoxi.

544
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,599
Probably.

545
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,440
I saw they were together just now.

546
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,119
Definitely, Chen Xiaoxi go to find him first.

547
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,399
I think so.

548
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,639
Did you find that?

549
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,599
Liu Xinxia asks you to go to her office.

550
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,559
Water.

551
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,639
I'll go to the toilet.

552
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,879
Look at this exam paper carefully.

553
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,280
You must let me know how to finish it.

554
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,319
I don't know, either.

555
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,000
Did you say that you would not go there?

556
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,520
Why not? It's such a good opportunity.

557
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,680
Well,

558
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,000
hope you can make it.

559
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,639
Jiang Chen.

560
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,920
Everything is packed?

561
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,240
Check it carefully.

562
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,960
Put the important things together.

563
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
Don't left anything.

564
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,879
Ok.

565
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:56,119
You go with your brother first.

566
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,799
I'll fetch some other things for you.

567
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,319
Sister Xiaoxi,

568
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,559
my brother will go to Beijing to attend an exam.

569
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,760
I know,

570
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,160
so I come here to see him off.

571
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,480
My mom said that there should be an auspicious start before the exam.

572
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:26,319
Look, his clothes,

573
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,920
pants and shoes are all new.

574
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,160
Very handsome.

575
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,639
You can make it.

576
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,920
Maybe I can't.
