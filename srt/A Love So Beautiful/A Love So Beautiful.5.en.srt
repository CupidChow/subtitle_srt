How about women's hurdle race?

Chen Xiaoxi and Lin Jingxiao.

Are you Lin Jingxiao's spy?

That won't be me.

I'll manage that first.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

26
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,290
She wanted to give him the watch as a gift.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

27
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,290
That's why she signed up for the race.

The hit TV show in summer vacation

38
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,500
I made a promise to never speak to you again.

39
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,570
You should be focusing on your injury, not staying angry with me.

40
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,570
Why?

41
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,170
Princess or angel,

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,290
no one is nearly as wonderful as you.

43
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,370
That's right.

44
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,450
That silly Li Wei.

45
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,620
She's not nearly as wonderful as me.

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,620
Father, you're home.

47
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,260
Right.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,340
You're watching TV.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,150
Do you want some watermelon?

50
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,520
No, it's fine.

51
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,860
Go finish your homework first.

52
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,840
All right.

53
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:52,980
Look.

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,170
A famous Italian tailor

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,700
worked on my school uniform yesterday.

56
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,860
Look, this is the work of Chinese designer Chen Xiaoxi.

57
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,680
You win.

58
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,170
Everyone, listen to me.

59
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,060
The third period has changed to English class from Music class.

60
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,090
Be prepared.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,820
What's the matter with them?

62
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,380
We're not seniors.

63
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,010
Why would they take our Music class?

64
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,010
I don't know.

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,170
I heard that other schools have been doing this a lot sooner.

66
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,130
This is wrong.

67
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,380
They're gonna suppress students from discovering their talents.

68
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,690
You're right, Secretary of Education.

69
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,410
I can hear you protest in the hallway.

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,410
Did you tell them about the English class?

71
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,380
Yeah.

72
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,060
You can have your Music class back.

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,340
No switching to English class.

74
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,760
I have an announcement to make.

75
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Our school is going to host a drama contest on Friday.

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,850
Yet we'll have our own contest inside our class first.

77
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,250
My attitude towards these events is the same.

78
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Study should always be your priority.

79
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,940
If I don't go to college,

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,540
I'll open one Xueyou bookstore.

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,250
Sell books and stationeries on the surface,

82
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,220
while operating a secret paid student dating center on the side.

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,340
I'll just stand there,

84
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,100
counting the money while watching the kids dating.

85
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,570
That's dreamy.

86
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,290
You should just focus on yourself first.

87
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,690
How did things go with Jiang Chen?

88
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,130
Nothing new.

89
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,620
I'm like the dripping water, one day I'll wear through a stone.

90
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,570
Don't take too long, or others might take your stone.

91
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,820
Who dare to take my stone?

92
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,820
For instance.

93
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,410
Li Wei offered Jiang Chen a part in "Thunderstorm".

94
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,500
He won't say yes.

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,660
He's so arrogant.

96
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,290
It's hard to say.

97
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,900
Maybe if she begs him for a few times he'd say yes.

98
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,900
Then what about me?

99
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,500
What about you?

100
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,410
You beg as well.

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,010
You can play the "Romance in the Rain".

102
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,010
Shuhuan﻿, don't move,

103
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,060
I'll run to you!

Stop covering.

106
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,900
Lin Jingxiao is more like a bossy Dao Mingsi than you.

107
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,900
It's called versed role playing.

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,970
Stop struggling...

109
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,060
...and join my team.

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,100
Why should I?

111
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,550
Because we have Lin Jingxiao.

112
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,100
Team leader, I'm at your service.

113
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,450
Right now, we're one person short.

114
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,650
Jiang Chen,

115
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,440
I have a good news for you.

116
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,520
I don't take advantages of others.

117
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,420
Then help me out.

118
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,050
Just spit it out.

119
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,940
We'll play a drama.

120
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,010
Right now, me, Chen Xiaoxi, and Lin Jingxiao are a team,

121
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,620
What's missing is you.

122
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,450
Will you join us?

123
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,100
You...

124
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,820
...and you.

125
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,780
No, thank you.

126
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,380
Don't say no that fast.

127
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,540
Our drama show...

128
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,900
...has great producers and actors.

129
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,290
We're putting the classic back to the stage.

130
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,290
You'll be famous.

131
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,540
What drama will you be playing?

132
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,540
Director,

133
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,540
what drama are we playing?

134
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,250
We...

135
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,540
...will play...

136
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,130
...the hit TV show in summer vacation.

137
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,130
"Princess Pearl".

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,970
It is a hot classic TV show...

139
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,690
...in many years.

140
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,410
So good.

141
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,520
Jiang Chen, are you willing to join us?

142
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,320
Come on, I'll tell you about your part.

143
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,400
Well.

144
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,770
After thoroughly consideration,

145
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,130
we've decided for you to play Erkang.

146
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,170
Wait a second.

147
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,780
Why would he be Erkang?

148
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,130
Because I'll be Ziwei.

149
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,170
I'm the director and I can play who I want.

150
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,250
Sure, whatever you say.

151
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,010
Besides,

152
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,410
I'm sweet and decent,

153
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,250
I am Ziwei.

154
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,180
Let's continue.

155
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,810
Erkang has a signature move.

156
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,100
Ziwei, don't go!

157
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,930
That.

158
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,860
All of his emotion is in the nostril.

159
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,180
Lu Yang.

160
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,010
Show us.

161
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,610
Just like that. See?

162
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,490
No, no, no.

163
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,810
Just join us.

164
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,020
So sorry for bothering you.

165
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,060
Excuse me.

166
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,810
Sure, let me help you.

167
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,810
No, don't.

168
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,570
No.

169
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,050
Don't help me.

170
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,010
I'm blind.

171
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,580
You can't help me for the rest my life.

172
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,240
I'll hate myself for being useless.

173
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,420
That's called dramatic tension.

174
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,420
=The script of "Princess Pearl"

175
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,320
=The script of "Princess Pearl"

176
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,370
Erkang.

177
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,370
Here's your script.

178
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,340
Don't give them to me.

179
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,650
Don't touch my bro.

180
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,750
Director,

181
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,570
I'd like to discuss the scene which I want to play.

182
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,370
Which one?

183
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,900
The huge breakout.

184
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,490
Hero saves the beauty.

185
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,780
The huge breakout.

186
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
We don't have extras.

187
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,300
I figured it all out.

188
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,780
You two will play the part I choose.

189
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,860
Xiao Yanzi﻿ and Yongqi ride horses then roll down the meadows.

190
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,690
Roll down the meadows, that sucks!

191
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,010
I quit! You go play that part.

192
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,010
Don't touch me.

193
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,450
It has a kiss scene.

194
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,570
Wonderful.

195
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,100
Lin Jingxiao,

196
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,220
I'll be playing Yongqi, and you are Xiao Yanzi.

197
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,100
No way.

198
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,050
Riding a horse is so cool.

199
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,900
See?

200
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,190
We'll bring bikes to the stage as the horses.

201
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,180
See? Thoughtful!

202
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,140
I'll lead.

203
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,220
Go back.

204
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,050
Director,

205
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,740
I feel so passionate about our drama.

206
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,180
I'll put in 120 percent efforts to do it.

207
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
And I'd like to ask my director...

208
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,980
...to extend the time of our scene.

209
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,900
It's just...

210
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,740
Talk later.

211
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,780
Fine.

212
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,780
Dr. Li.

213
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,860
Your ankle still hurts?

214
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,930
How about you take a look for me?

215
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,740
Sure.

216
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,900
That hurts! Ouch!

217
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,130
It's weird.

218
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,490
By the looks of it, you should be all right by now.

219
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,010
But it hurts like crazy every step I took.

220
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,010
How about you prescribe me some medicine?

221
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,490
The ones you gave me the last time will do.

222
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,490
If you can still feel the pain,

223
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,370
that means the medicine might not be working.

224
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,740
I'll give you something else.

225
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,300
Try these.

226
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,130
What's wrong?

227
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,450
Dr. Li, my name is Lin Jingxiao.

228
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,740
I know, it's on your medical records.

229
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,690
Try these when you get back.

230
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,050
Stop using them when you feel better.

231
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,220
By the way,

232
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,010
here's your shirt.

233
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,810
All right.

234
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,540
I'll just leave it here.

235
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
- Sure. - Thank you, bye.

236
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,660
Bye.

237
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,300
Hurts like crazy?

238
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,130
What are you, a mermaid?

239
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,250
Chen Xiaoxi, listen to me.

240
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,010
Don't touch me.

241
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,660
I don't know you that well.

242
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,490
No, you do.

243
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,130
I tell you all my secrets.

244
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,540
And you keep everything from me.

245
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,050
If you do that again, we should stop being friends.

246
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,420
I'll tell you.

247
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,740
I didn't put words in your mouth.

248
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,250
You said that yourself.

249
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,190
I couldn't wait to tell you.

250
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,610
Remember when I climbed over the wall after the sports meeting?

251
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,660
Dr. Li, I have to go.

252
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,220
You're not gonna do anything bad, right?

253
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,420
Absolutely not.

254
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,980
I swear.

255
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,300
Your trousers were torn.

256
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,010
Tie it up.

257
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,340
Wow.

258
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,100
So romantic.

259
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,690
If Jiang Chen ever gives me a shirt,

260
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,810
I'd worship it everyday.

261
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,100
You made me realize something.

262
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,180
I kind of have a crush on him.

263
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,010
Crush is love's prelude.

264
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,610
Don't tell others.

265
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,370
Or I'll tell the whole school you love Jiang Chen.

266
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,370
Mutual destruction.

267
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,180
Fine.

268
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,780
Let's go prepare the lines.

269
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,490
Are you serious about playing "Princess Pearl"?

270
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,780
Li Wei plays "Thunderstorm",

271
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,490
yours is "Princess Pearl", not even close.

272
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,980
Besides, did you get Jiang Chen on board?

273
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,010
They put on a serious drama, we have a funny one.

274
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,860
Different target audience.

275
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,860
As for Jiang Chen, even if he won't join us,

276
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
he won't join Li Wei's team either.

277
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,780
Anyway, no one can have him.

278
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,810
Don't help me!

279
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,810
If I'm blind one day,

280
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,570
I can't let you help me for the rest of my life.

281
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,130
I'll hate myself for being useless.

282
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,250
Erkang, is that you?

283
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,490
No.

284
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,660
Who are you?

285
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,300
Why do you sound just like my Erkang?

286
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,340
What did you do to him?

287
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,930
I killed him.

288
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,610
Then you should be my prince.

289
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,690
Nice try.

290
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,010
Watch where you're going.

291
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,540
Ziwei.

292
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,860
You're the one who's blind.

293
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,100
That's blackmail.

294
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,010
She's not.

295
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,450
Can you just go?

296
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,490
I'll go.

297
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,780
Come on, all right.

298
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,180
Find your seats.

299
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,310
You're passionate about the drama contest.

300
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,750
Yet from what I just saw,

301
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm not sure if you are good enough.

302
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,800
How about this?

303
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,460
Jiang Chen, Li Wei,

304
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,900
Lin Jingxiao, Qiao Lu, and Wang Songsong,

305
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,140
you guys are easy on the eye and you have good academic records.

306
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:54,930
Ms. Liu, I'm...

307
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,880
Put your hands down.

308
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,660
The five of you form a team, and prepare for the contest.

309
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,860
The rest of you can form teams at your free will.

310
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,780
We'll have an inside competition on Thursday.

311
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,710
Erkang, are you really gonna join Li Wei's team?

312
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Jiang Chen,

313
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,930
how about we discuss roles later?

314
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,970
Form your own team or shut your mouth.

315
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,970
I will.

316
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
I'll be there later.

317
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,090
Erkang, are you walking out on me when I'm blind?

318
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,820
You're not gonna be my eyes?

319
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,490
I'll be your eyes.

320
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,180
Eat.

321
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,700
What's the difference?

322
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,090
You are blind.

323
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,660
Go watch them for me,

324
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,060
Jingjing.

325
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,060
Bro,

326
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,730
I'm here.

327
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,330
Train me.

328
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,010
How about we three form a team?

329
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,210
They say three people can be a tiger.
=Meaning a repeated rumour makes others believe

330
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,610
We are the tiger team.

331
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,490
No tiger in the world is gonna make up for Xiao Yanzi.

332
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,730
My Xiao Yanzi!

333
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,490
I have an idea.

334
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,250
Wait, Xiao Yanzi!

335
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,460
Can you help me to run my lines?

336
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,370
Lu Yang, I'm not your Xiao Yanzi!

337
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,420
And I'm busy.

338
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,700
Go play with your new partner.

339
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,210
See, you're jealous.

340
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,460
I have way more feelings for you...

341
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,660
...than her.

342
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,180
Beside,

343
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,420
you're gonna be my Xiao Yanzi sooner or later.

344
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,970
Lu Yang.

345
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,370
You two make a cute couple.

346
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
Where are you going?

347
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,940
To see the doctor.

348
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,700
Dr. Li, I think I may have left my book here.

349
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,490
I was wondering if you saw it.

350
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,490
This one?

351
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,730
Yes.

352
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,330
"Norton's Star Atlas and Reference Handbook."

353
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,660
So you like astronomy?

354
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,700
Well,

355
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,300
Dr. Li.

356
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,900
Yello.

357
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,730
I mean, hello, Dr. Li.

358
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,660
Why are you here?

359
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,370
We are classmates.

360
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,900
You twisted your ankles as well?

361
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,250
No, no.

362
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,970
I, uh...

363
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,010
I have a heart disease ever since I was born.

364
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,420
So bad.

365
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,820
I went to the emergency room a few times in middle school.

366
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,460
Then...

367
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,130
Dr. Li, if there's nothing else, I'm gonna go.

368
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,130
Ping, come here.

369
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,300
Your birth mother is not dead.

370
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,460
She's still alive.

371
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,580
Not her.

372
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,660
Tell me it's not her! Father!

373
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,780
Ping.

374
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,460
Mother.

375
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,060
Ping, I could never have imagined.

376
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,250
Chen Xiaoxi.

377
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,970
Stop eavesdropping.

378
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,420
I have no interest in fornication.

379
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,060
What fornication?

380
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,300
You haven't read "Thunderstorm"?

381
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,610
Ignorant.

382
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,010
That's enough. Continue.

383
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,700
Let's read the lines.

384
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,330
Director,

385
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,730
I can't do this.

386
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,580
What's wrong?

387
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,660
How about my kiss scene?

388
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,660
I thought we had a deal.

389
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Once we won the inside contest, you can still be Yongqi.

390
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,820
Your Xiao Yanzi will be waiting for you.

391
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,460
Right.

392
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,180
Give me a moment for mental preparation.

393
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
To get into my character.

394
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,130
No need. You'll be playing yourself.

395
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,780
This scene is about I'm dying after getting stabbed.

396
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,780
Then I'll entrust you,

397
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,850
...Jin Suo...

398
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,660
...to him.

399
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,490
No, Miss, I won't marry him.

400
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,940
Stick to the script.

401
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,610
Your bro is the one who likes to go wild.

402
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,300
She is blind and she is stabbed, ridiculous.

403
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,660
That's because I have great acting skills.

404
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,250
- That's right. - You're scheming.

405
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,900
You don't want to give me Erkang.

406
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,330
My bro is dying, and you're still thinking about me.

407
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,490
She's just weak.

408
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,420
Stop fighting.

409
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,460
There's a knife stabbed in my body.

410
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,540
- Shut up. - Shut up.

411
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,610
- I quit. - Suit yourself.

412
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,490
Wu Bosong.

413
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,970
I...

414
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,660
Lousy teammates.

415
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,820
The thought of Jiang Chen and Li Wei playing a couple...

416
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,490
...makes me so sad.

417
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,580
How hard it must've been for my dear.

418
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,090
That's straight up arranged marriage.

419
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,730
I have to help him.

420
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,300
Come on.

421
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,970
How can you help him?

422
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,970
I'm gonna win the inside contest and to be

423
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,780
the representative of our class to the school contest.

424
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,180
To free him at last.

425
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,940
It's easier to just count on me.

426
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,730
I play Jiang Chen's mother in the show.

427
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,130
Marriage is something your parents decide for you.

428
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,730
I'll arrange your marriage.

429
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,660
Arrange marriage is the best!

430
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,180
I like that!

431
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,370
You silly.

432
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,780
Erkang, wait for me!

433
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,540
I'll come and rescue you.

434
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,420
Where are you going?

435
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,130
To buy a light bulb.

436
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,460
Yours is burnt out?

437
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,010
Of course! I'm not gonna eat them!

438
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,330
Then it must be dark in your house.

439
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,660
Are you scared?

440
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,330
Do you need me to keep you company?

441
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,580
That would scare me more.

442
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,490
How's your script?

443
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,250
Wu Bosong has joined our team.

444
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,850
Lu Yang is cross-dressing as Jin Suo.

445
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,580
It's a fantastic script.

446
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,610
Maybe we'll beat you.

447
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,420
If we do, I might let you join my team.

448
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,250
Thanks, Director Chen, I'm good..

449
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,700
Who are you?

450
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,540
My kid left his medicine in my car.

451
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,940
I want to give it to him.

452
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,540
I'm be out in no time.

453
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,010
No strangers are allowed to go in, it's school policy.

454
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,010
My kid's condition is serious.

455
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,330
He has to take the medicine...

456
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,780
...strictly after each meal.

457
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,460
Please let me in.

458
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,360
I can't.

459
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,490
What should I do?

460
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,730
Hello.

461
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,730
Do you know

462
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,780
Lu Yang? He's in Class Eight, Grade One.

463
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,900
Yes, we're classmates.

464
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,490
I'm his father.

465
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,060
He left his medicine in my car.

466
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,180
I wanted to give it to him, the doorkeeper wouldn't let me in.

467
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,820
I was wondering if you can bring it to him.

468
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,540
Sure, give it to me.

469
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,090
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

470
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,400
See you.

471
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,260
- Thanks. - It's all right.

472
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,010
If Lu Yang knows, he's not gonna shut up about it.

473
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,010
=Medicine to treat heart disease

474
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,540
I have a heart disease...

475
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,610
...ever since I was born.

476
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
So bad.

477
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,970
I met your father and he asked me to give this to you.

478
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,090
Lu Yang, what're you eating?

479
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Give me some.

480
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,370
Food is all you can think about.

481
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,010
Jin Suo, save me.

482
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,460
Lin Jingxiao, keep going.

483
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,900
Didn't you ask me to run the lines with you?

484
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Do you still want that?

485
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,060
Yes, yes.

486
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,010
Which scene?

487
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,610
That.

488
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,460
Erkang.

489
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,060
Jin Suo, don't get me wrong.

490
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,490
You're lovely and perfect,

491
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:30,090
I would never ask you to be my concubine.

492
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,510
Mr. Erkang,

493
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,300
please stop.

494
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,790
If you keep saying things like that,

495
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,680
I would be so embarrassed.

496
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,900
Go play with yourself.

497
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,090
Mr. Erkang, don't go.

498
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,490
I want to be your concubine.

499
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,700
Bro,

500
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,820
we haven't run our lines today,

501
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,580
should we do it?

502
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,360
I'm confident with my acting skills,

503
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,180
while yours is not so good.

504
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,640
I agree.

505
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,000
Mainly because I can't control my facial expressions.

506
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,300
And I can't put my mind into my lines.

507
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,090
Maybe because Erkang leads a different life compare to me.

508
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,300
You trying to become an actor?

509
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,420
Some athletes would like that thought,

510
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,370
but not me.

511
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,610
Because,

512
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,580
I like being your sidekick.

513
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Then forget it.

514
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,580
But we need to find a place if we want to continue practicing.

515
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,970
Follow me, let's go.

516
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,540
Slow down.

517
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,060
Here we are.

518
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
=Grandma: Did you lock the door?
Did you turn off the gas? Did you bring your cellphone?

519
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,490
My grandma suffers from dementia.

520
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,780
Sometimes, she can't remember things clearly.

521
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,820
I wrote that to remind her.

522
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,060
Grandma, I'm back.

523
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:55,940
Hello.

524
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,660
You must be Xiaosong's classmate.

525
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,700
Have you had your dinner?

526
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I'll cook for you two.

527
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,250
Okay.

528
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,060
Where are your parents?

529
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,850
My mother is out of town to take care of her mother.

530
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,700
My father...

531
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,540
We are here to practice, right?

532
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,610
Where's the script?

533
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,210
Grandma.

534
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,250
My son.

535
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,540
You're back!

536
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,460
Did you bring Xiaosong with you?

537
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,060
Did you fight with Xiaosong again?

538
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,540
Don't criticize him too much.

539
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,210
He's a sweet kid.

540
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,180
I won't.

541
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,610
That's right.

542
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,780
You are his father after all.

543
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,700
He didn't talk much,

544
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,010
but I know he cares about you.

545
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,580
You didn't come home the other day,

546
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,250
he waited for you by the dinner table for two hours.

547
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,820
Just one hour.

548
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,970
You forced him to learn how to swim.

549
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,660
Poor kid.

550
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,730
He doesn't have any friends

551
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,700
or classmates.

552
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Grandma, I'm Xiaosong's classmate.

553
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,490
We're practicing for the drama contest.

554
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,970
- Is that true? - Yes!

555
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,730
Wu Bosong is quiet popular at school.

556
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,900
We all like him.

557
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,970
Good. You kids play nice.

558
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,420
He suffered a lot already.

559
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,900
Are you all right?

560
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,460
Yeah.

561
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,060
Did your grandma ever mistake you for someone else?

562
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,820
No.

563
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,940
Are you truly all right?

564
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,700
Yeah.

565
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,610
Maybe that's for the best.

566
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,970
She worries about me and my father fighting all the time.

567
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,490
Now she doesn't remember anything.

568
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,780
I'll be there for her,

569
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,610
it's not that bad.

570
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,820
You weren't close with your father?

571
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,370
All I can remember was he made me swim.

572
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,780
When I was six, he shoved me into the water.

573
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,610
He forced me all the way from the youth team

574
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,250
to the city team, then the province team.

575
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,580
Didn't care if I liked it or not.

576
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,180
Do you like swimming?

577
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,090
Couldn't tell.

578
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,330
It's all right.

579
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,780
See, I don't have any skills yet I'm a supergirl.

580
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,060
What are you doing?

581
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,490
I changed the light bulb and realized something else was wrong.

582
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,580
Do you know what you're doing?

583
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,210
Should we call for help?

584
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,210
Unlike you, I actually understand physics.

585
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,850
Noted. I'm going home.

586
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,940
Why are you home so late by yourself?

587
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,540
I wasn't alone.

588
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,370
Wu Bosong walked me to the alley.

589
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,900
Did you remember your lines?

590
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,300
No, I didn't.

591
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,970
It's too hard.

592
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,540
Jiang Chen.

593
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,820
Is this the one you're looking for?

594
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:30,850
=The distant straight A student falling in love with me
Is this the one you're looking for?

595
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,450
=The distant straight A student falling in love with me

596
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,490
Yeah.

597
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,460
Thank you.

598
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,660
Excellent performance.

599
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,330
Well prepared.

600
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,660
Next.

601
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,490
This scene is about Ziwei sacrificed herself...

602
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,130
=Princess Pearl
This scene is about Ziwei sacrificed herself...

603
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:17,280
=Princess Pearl

604
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:17,590
...to save someone else.

605
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,820
=Save the emperor and entrust Jin Suo to Erkang
...to save someone else.

606
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,090
=Save the emperor and entrust Jin Suo to Erkang

607
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,820
She saved the emperor.
=Save the emperor and entrust Jin Suo to Erkang

608
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,590
Now she's been stabbed.
=Save the emperor and entrust Jin Suo to Erkang

609
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,010
Now she's been stabbed.

610
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,490
She wanted to entrust her best friend,

611
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,180
Jin Suo to Erkang.

612
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,730
Erkang.

613
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,610
Promise me one thing.

614
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,330
Sure. What is that?

615
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,490
If anything happens to me,

616
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,370
I'll entrust Jin Suo to you.

617
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,210
Treat her well for me.

618
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,400
Sure.

619
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,300
Good.

620
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,420
Now please enjoy drawing out the knife.

621
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,370
The next scene, is about Ziwei told Jin Suo

622
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,580
that she had arranged her marriage.

623
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,490
To a public servant with property, horse,

624
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,580
and permanent residence in Beijing,

625
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,250
Miss.

626
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,210
What's this all about?

627
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,300
Back then,

628
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,210
I thought I was dying,

629
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,420
so I wanted to arrange your marriage,

630
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,330
just in case I couldn't marry Erkang.

631
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,250
I already arranged for you to marry him.

632
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,330
You need to stay with him.

633
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,850
No what ifs.

634
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,540
I forbid you from saying that.

635
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,460
I...

636
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,330
...won't take your Erkang.

637
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,700
I'll find my own keys.

638
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,370
- Don't get handsy. - Fine.

639
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,090
All right.

640
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,610
That's it!

641
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,210
The end.

642
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,460
Good!

643
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,780
Everyone,

644
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,420
I can see that you all put your efforts into this contest.

645
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,850
I'm sure we all know which team wins.

646
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,770
Jiang Chen,

647
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,660
your team is well-prepared today.

648
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,500
And your performance was excellent.

649
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,700
I believe you'll make us proud.

650
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,900
Chen Xiaoxi,

651
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,610
your show...

652
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,180
...was humorous,

653
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,940
yet it didn't fit the concept of the contest.

654
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,530
Jiang Chen, work hard on your play.

655
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,740
Bring home the pride for Class Eight.

656
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,500
Well done.

657
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,260
What's wrong, bro?

658
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,460
Wasn't that fun?

659
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,940
Fun?

660
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,570
I'm serious.

661
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,850
Forget it.

662
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,220
We are not good enough.

663
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,290
Shouldn't blame others.

664
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,500
I made a huge sacrifice today.

665
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,900
See my clothes?

666
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,810
Mother is so gonna kill me when I get back.

667
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,420
Wait here.

668
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,420
Watch out.

669
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,220
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

670
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,810
I will be with you forever.

671
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,020
Waiting for Erkang?

672
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,290
How do you know Ziwei's line?

673
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,090
You wanted to join our team, wasn't it?

674
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,330
Nope.

675
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,610
Have a seat.

676
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,570
I know you don't want to be in the contest,

677
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,420
so I was thinking if I could win,

678
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,810
then you don't have to.

679
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,980
However, now you've won,

680
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,530
you should work hard on your play.

681
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,700
After all, we all need to try things we hate sometimes.

682
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,220
You leaving?

683
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
Aren't you?

684
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,740
Wu Bosong told me to wait.

685
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,610
Then wait.

686
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,980
Here.

687
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,530
What's this?

688
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,330
The detergent my grandma uses on my clothes.

689
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,330
Super useful.

690
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,050
A normal person would just give me new clothes.

691
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,570
Then wait a bit longer.

692
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,850
I'm just kidding.

693
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,420
In order to make sure our team can focus on their rehearsal,

694
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,420
I've decided to arrange a few students to help them.

695
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,980
Wang Dazhuang, you're in charge of props.

696
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,460
Liao Chenxuan.

697
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,290
Here.

698
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,370
You're in charge of their microphones.

699
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,290
- Chen Xiaoxi. - Here.

700
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,883
You're in charge of sound effect,

701
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:56,570
like recording the sound of thunder.

702
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,290
Right.

703
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,810
That's it.

704
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,330
Push the bottom when I count to three.

705
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,610
One, two, three.

706
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,900
How's that?

707
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,260
I don't think so.

708
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,220
The sound of thunder need to match the scene to be infectious.

709
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,940
Right.

710
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,020
Shake one infectious sound for me.

711
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,420
One, two, three.

712
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,420
Stop!

713
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,420
- It's bad. - Then you try.

714
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,220
How's that?

715
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,460
Nope.

716
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,530
I quit.

717
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,810
One more time.

718
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,020
Why are you so serious about this?

719
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,700
Just get it done.

720
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,810
You don't understand.

721
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,180
I wanted to do this right.

722
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,610
To show him that I'm not useless.

723
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,570
You'll do anything for love.

724
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,090
One more time, please.

725
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,020
I'll shake it.

726
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,180
The tape is full, turn it over.

727
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,020
Turn it over.

728
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,290
All right.

729
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,770
Chen Xiaoxi.

730
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,610
Going to the auditorium?

731
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,290
I can't, I have a group match.

732
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,460
Then why are you here?

733
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,900
I came to give you this.

734
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,810
Why would he buy whatever I say?

735
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,530
Excuse me, coming through!

736
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,050
Coming through!

737
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,020
Be careful!

738
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,090
Be careful!

739
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,330
Are you all right, Xiaoxi?

740
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,900
I'm all right.

741
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,050
Why are you holding a basin of water?

742
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,370
Ms. Liu put me in charge of props.

743
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,610
"Thunderstorm" needs water.

744
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,700
You're trying to pour a basin of water onto the stage?

745
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,000
Come on, everyone. It's show time.

746
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,900
Come on, hurry up!

747
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,800
We're next!

748
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,060
Chen Xuan, play the recording for me.

749
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,250
I need to go change my clothes.

750
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,170
Which side?

751
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,623
Let's welcome students from Class Eight, Grade One,

752
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:09,220
to perform "Thunderstorm".

753
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,460
Si Feng﻿.

754
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,130
I'll get you out of here.

755
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,370
Ping.

756
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,500
Mother, this is not true.

757
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,130
Father.

758
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,810
Mother.

759
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,290
I really enjoy to watch lovers become brother and sisters.

760
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,700
One more time.

761
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,260
Why are you so serious about this?

762
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,850
Just get it done.

763
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,420
You don't understand. I wanted to do this right.

764
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,850
To show him that I'm not useless.

765
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,180
You'll do anything for love.

766
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,330
One more time, please.

767
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,420
I'll shake it.

768
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,330
What's the matter?

769
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,530
How should I know?

770
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,130
The shirt is bigger for Chen Xiaoxi,

771
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,020
yet it's better than wet clothes.

772
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,260
Why are you hiding here?

773
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,460
Jiang Chen.

774
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,260
Bro.

775
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,290
Show's over?

776
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,980
I hurried back.

777
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
Chen Xiaoxi,

778
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,500
you are a disgrace today.
