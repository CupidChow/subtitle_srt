This week, our school is going to hold a drama competition.

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:37,860
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

3
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,680
I heard that Li Wei had invited Jiang Chen

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,360
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

5
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,840
to star in 'Thunderstorm'.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,020
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

7
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,580
Jiang Chen.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

8
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,960
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

9
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's discuss the division of roles later,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:45,620
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

11
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,080
is it okay?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

12
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,120
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,600
Chen Xiaoxi.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

14
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,640
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

15
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:47,940
I'm here.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:47,980
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

17
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,500
You're in charge of the dubbing,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:49,520
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
such as recording the sound of thunder.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,960
Why are you so serious?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:54,980
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,440
Just play around.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,560
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,280
You don't understand,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,740
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,020
I need to do it well.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,240
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,140
Why are you hiding here?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,140
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

31
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,560
Bro.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,180
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

33
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,760
It's over?
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,240
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,320
I specially come back.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,360
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,920
Chen Xiaoxi.
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,120
You've made a fool of yourself today.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
=Episode 6
It's no big deal.

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,600
Chen Xiaoxi.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,860
You've made a fool of yourself today.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,060
Xiaoxi.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,300
Xiaoxi.

44
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,470
- Take it easy. - Look at her...

45
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,840
Let's talk on the sofa.

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,420
Let's go.

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,240
Jiang Chen, how's it going recently?

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,700
Is your study tiring?

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,440
Just like that. I have to go to the class.

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,660
Alright.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,740
Here's the thing.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Mom is now working on my transfer.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,920
If they would allow my transfer,

54
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,040
then I could come back to Hangzhou.

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,340
Then our family could be together

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,980
Got it.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,880
Yesterday, what did the teacher tell us?

58
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,680
So she's right to be in love now?

59
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,480
It's just a suspicion.

60
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,900
The teacher especially emphasized that

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
we parents needed to be patient with her at this point.

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,560
Let me tell you,

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,760
haven't you read it on TV or newspapers?

64
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,780
How fragile the youngsters are nowadays.

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,000
Didn't you notice how upset she was last night?

66
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,620
She's been crying in the room for all night.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,660
Which means,

68
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,360
our kid has failed to be in love with someone.

69
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,180
That's right.

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,060
You see, our Xiaoxi is careless,

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,280
just like a boy.

72
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,300
Who would like her?

73
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,500
That's because they haven't discovered her merits!

74
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Stop it.

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,840
Chen Xiaoxi hasn't come yet?

76
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,780
Come, come over here.

77
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,200
Where did you go yesterday?

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,300
Come on, let's go to the office.

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,300
Come on.

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,900
I know I'm wrong, teacher. I'm sorry.

81
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,120
You are not sorry to me.

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,120
You are sorry to yourself.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
Look at you.

84
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,120
Don't you wanna go to a university?

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
I know at your age,

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,640
it's easy for you to have some thoughts,

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,220
which I can understand.

88
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,460
But Chen Xiaoxi,

89
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,420
is it now the right time to have this kind of thoughts?

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,060
Go back and think about it.

91
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,960
Which class are you in?

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
The bell has been ringing for a long time, can't you hear it?

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,860
Stop.

94
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
It has already passed for such a long time,

95
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,400
yet you're still wandering in the campus.

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:00,960
Let's go.

97
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,160
Take me to your class.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,720
I'll emphasize this one last time.

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,240
There's only a month left before the final.

100
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,740
Don't waste your time on those stupid things.

101
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,880
It's time for you to think about

102
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,140
whether to choose liberal arts or science.

103
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,380
It's a great event in your life.

104
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,660
When you come back home,

105
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,660
discuss about it with your parents.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,580
What's more,

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,800
The gap between your scores is too big.

108
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,020
So I've discussed with various teachers,

109
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,280
we decide to divide you into several study groups.

110
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,800
In each group, those who have good grades,

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,340
should help those who have bad grade.

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,880
I'll read the assignment to you.

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,820
Li Wei, Yu Tian and Liao Chenxuan are in the same group.

114
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,620
Jiang Chen, Lu Yang and Wang Songson are in the same group.

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,500
Lin Jingxiao, Chen Xiaoxi…

116
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,880
Teacher.

117
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,760
And you, are in the same group.

118
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,500
Teacher.

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,440
What do you want now?

120
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,680
That…

121
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,560
Chen Xiaoxi is here.

122
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,120
Get in.

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,320
Teacher Liu.

124
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,700
Your classmate Chen Xiaoxi is always making trouble.

125
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,980
The class has already begun for quite a while,

126
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
she's still wandering in the campus by herself.

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,860
Director Zhang,

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,540
sorry for the inconvenience.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
Students like her,

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,760
just need some discipline.

131
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,520
You're right.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,860
Take care, director Zhang.

133
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,100
Who dare to punish you, I'll deal with them.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,440
Li Wei.

135
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,900
Put it on the wall at the back of the classroom.

136
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,040
Chen Xiaoxi.

137
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,000
Who is your crush?

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Tell me about it.

139
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,480
Shut your mouth.

140
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,540
Jing.

141
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,700
Dazhuang bro.

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,300
What's up?

143
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,180
I need a sandbag to practice with recently.

144
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,780
I'm wrong.

145
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,140
Bro, I'm going to swim.

146
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,740
If anyone bullies you, let pigeon Xiaoyang tell me about it

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,460
Look at Chen Xiaoxi.

148
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,920
How humiliating she is.

149
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,120
If I were her, I would've transferred a long time ago.

150
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,200
Such a pachyderm.

151
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,060
Let's go. Let's get some water.

152
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,180
Are you okay?

153
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,960
What did the teacher say to you in the office?

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Just those cliche.

155
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,980
That's right.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,120
The teacher must have said something like,

157
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,840
being in love at such an early age is sorry to your classmates,

158
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,880
sorry to your patriarch,

159
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,060
and sorry to your parents those kind of words.

160
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,580
I wonder whether all these teachers' hobby,

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,260
is to break up affectionate couples.

162
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,500
Be careful.

163
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,380
I've got scalded.

164
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,060
Are you all right?

165
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,380
Sister Xi.

166
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,960
I've brought you some milk.

167
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,440
What do you want?

168
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,180
Here's the thing.

169
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,280
I want to exchange the study group with you.

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,420
Aren't you in the same group with Jiang Chen?

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
You've got help.

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,160
Jiang Chen is not good enough.

173
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,480
There's something wrong with his way of teaching homework.

174
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,720
His method is really bad.

175
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,900
And he is not patient.

176
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,540
You are better, right?

177
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
No matter who meets a person with your IQ,

178
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,640
he will be impatient.

179
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,620
I want to go to the bathroom.

180
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,540
If okay for you not to teach me the homework.

181
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,620
You can still drink my milk.

182
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,260
Piss off.

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,740
Chen Xiaoxi.

184
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,740
Miss Liu is asking for you.

185
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,140
Are you addicted to making trouble recently?

186
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,620
So you really plan to return home after you graduate from here?

187
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,540
Let me tell you.

188
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Whether you can graduate from high school or not,

189
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,120
it's now hard to tell.

190
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Look at your homework.

191
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,620
What are these?

192
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,800
All of your answers are wrong!

193
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,940
When I'm available,

194
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,200
I'll absolutely go to visit your parents

195
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,020
and talk to them about this.

196
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,460
Get out.

197
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
= See you at the library.

198
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,800
=A message from Lu Yang: Chen Xiaoxi, it's a trap! So it's a deal that we've exchanged our study group. Please do me a favor.

199
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,560
=If I and Lin Jingxiao had a child in the future, you could be his godmother.

200
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,920
Chen Xiaoxi.

201
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,880
Come here, sit with me.

202
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,960
Your auxiliary line is wrong

203
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,820
There's answer in the back.

204
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,160
I'll check it myself.

205
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,460
The answer of this problem is omitted.

206
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,320
Then I'll figure it out myself.

207
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,680
Chen Xiaoxi, are you alright?

208
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,840
Have you been scolded by the teacher too much?

209
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,220
Or…

210
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,340
Has she asked you about your crush intensely?

211
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,660
What are you talking about?

212
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,840
It's nonsense.

213
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,980
It's nonsense?

214
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
You are not going to study?

215
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,400
What's wrong with her?

216
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,920
Bro.

217
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,740
Where is your bike?

218
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Let me take you there.

219
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,240
Still haven't found the key yet?

220
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,320
I don't where it is.

221
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,880
What are you doing?

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,600
Pick the lock.

223
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,760
There's no need to do so. I've got spare key at home.

224
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,820
Then let me take you home.

225
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,400
It's okay.

226
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,820
If you've got into trouble, just let me know.

227
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,520
You are my bro.

228
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,040
I'll beat the guy whoever bullies you.

229
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,620
Stop it, you'd better hurry home.

230
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,640
Got it.

231
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,320
Bye.

232
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,780
Give me your money.

233
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,620
I've only got 10 yuan.

234
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,360
Who are you going to fool?

235
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,440
That's all you've got?

236
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,960
It's even not enough for you to get that fat.

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,840
Lin Jingxiao, please bless me.

238
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,020
Stop it.

239
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,960
You're two sizes bigger than her,

240
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,340
don't you feel ashamed to hide behind her?

241
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,920
Don't you think it's humiliating for you to do so?

242
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,880
You've made a fool of yourself today.

243
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,780
So you are bullying people.

244
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,600
You think others won't feel upset?

245
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,840
I've always been so nice to you.

246
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,140
You not only don't appreciate it,

247
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,460
but also say that I'm humiliating.

248
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,860
Why is it humiliating to like someone?

249
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,400
Besides,

250
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,580
she's got a big face, so she can lose face whatever she wants.

251
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
It's none of your business

252
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,680
Can't you look after the dignity?

253
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,660
Xiaoxi, we don't have such a relationship.

254
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,800
And you don't need to speak it out about my big face.

255
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,760
Cut the crap.

256
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,120
Just give me your money.

257
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,000
So you are going to rob me?

258
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,420
How dare you say that you're in this business?

259
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,120
Don't you know whose territory it is?

260
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,580
Whose?

261
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,880
My boss's.

262
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,480
Jiang Chen.

263
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,400
Bro, something's wrong.

264
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,720
She's got someone to back her up.

265
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,400
We should leave.

266
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,020
She is calling someone.

267
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,640
You have guts. Watch out on your way to school.

268
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,360
Chen Xiaoxi.

269
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,640
Brother, you are finally back.

270
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,560
Mom's been waiting for you for a long time.

271
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,300
Jiang Chen, you are back.

272
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,560
Let me have a look.

273
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,080
I think you are taller

274
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,240
And you are more handsome.

275
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,800
The transfer has been settled.

276
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,960
So we come back in a hurry.

277
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,560
Tidy up. Let's have dinner

278
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,520
I bought all the dishes.

279
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll heat them up again.

280
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,540
Come, have a seat.

281
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,300
Go.

282
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,700
Let's sit down and eat the dinner.

283
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,860
What are you doing?

284
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,220
Your brother hasn't started eating

285
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,280
how can you start eating by yourself?

286
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,560
Let's eat. Let's eat.

287
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,540
Don't you remember that

288
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,800
you were sent to hospital after eating shrimps last time?

289
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
I just want to eat a little bit.

290
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,840
No, don't eat it.

291
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,800
Give it to your brother.

292
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,000
Now,

293
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,180
your learning tasks are heavy,

294
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,700
the nutrition should keep up with them.

295
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,060
I hear that you've got the first place in the exams again?

296
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,100
Awesome.

297
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,900
Do you hear that?

298
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,340
Your brother has come first in the exams again.

299
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,020
You should learn from him.

300
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,860
Mom.

301
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,400
I'd like to drink some milk.

302
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,040
You shouldn't have any milk during your meal.

303
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,560
How could you eat your meal if you were full by drinking milk?

304
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,080
Jiang Chen.

305
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,940
Let me get you a cup of milk.

306
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,980
Nutrition is important. The milk's nutrition…

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm full.

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,380
Mom, don't you remember that brother is allergic to milk?

309
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,640
Xiaoxi.

310
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,060
Studying.

311
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,400
48 points.

312
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,060
I want to tell you something.

313
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,080
Here's the thing.

314
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,360
This afternoon, your homeroom teacher called me again.

315
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,180
I've discussed with your mother,

316
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,740
we wonder if there's something wrong with your school.

317
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,500
Too many activities.

318
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,540
I want to find a more strict school for you.

319
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,980
Let's transfer to another school, okay?

320
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,740
Dad.

321
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,760
I don't want to transfer.

322
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,460
Look at you.

323
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Look at your examination paper.

324
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,780
What is this?

325
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,280
Your teacher has told me that,

326
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,620
your score,

327
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,020
is only the odd

328
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,700
of the first one's score in your class.

329
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,260
Isn't it humiliating?

330
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,380
What are you doing?

331
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,100
We agreed to talk to her calmly,

332
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
why do you start yelling?

333
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,320
Have a seat.

334
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,080
Baby.

335
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,120
We think you are a good student,

336
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,460
except that your self-restraint ability is poor.

337
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,220
There's a boarding high school nearby,

338
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,480
which is more strict than Chenxi High School.

339
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,200
I and your dad,

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,980
both think it's suitable for you.

341
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,260
We don't want to force you to do anything.

342
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,480
It took you a lot of efforts to get into this high school.

343
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,680
But a year has passed,

344
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,820
your grade is getting worse and worse.

345
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,060
As for the boarding school,

346
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,340
We've had an inspection.

347
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,440
The enrollment rate of first-tier universities is 30%

348
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,020
We just need you to study hard for another two years.

349
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,080
Let's get into a good university.

350
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,620
Wu Bosong.

351
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
What's the matter? You still haven't found your key?

352
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,680
No.

353
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,700
I just don't want to ride bike.

354
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,060
No problem.

355
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,400
From now on, I will be your driver.

356
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,660
Bro.

357
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,960
Which one will you choose? Liberal arts or science?

358
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,620
I haven't…

359
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,500
It's okay. Take your time.

360
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,660
I'll choose the same as you.

361
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,920
Go ahead.

362
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,420
If I transferred to another school,

363
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,840
would you guys miss me?

364
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,380
Transfer?

365
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,060
To which school? I'll go with you.

366
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,940
Do they take sport-specialized students?

367
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,920
No, I mean what if.

368
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,840
I'm not leaving.

369
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,280
Then…

370
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,380
Let's go!

371
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,800
Everyone,

372
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,540
please write this down on your notebook.

373
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,140
It may come in handy in your exams.

374
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,660
Chen Xiaoxi.

375
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,400
Stand up.

376
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,980
Please tell us

377
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,780
the judgment method of the monotone interval of a function.

378
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,820
You don't understand it,

379
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,940
yet you're not listening to me carefully.

380
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,160
If you were a student in my class,

381
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,700
you would have been expelled a long time ago.

382
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,060
Teacher.

383
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,460
I'd like to go to the washroom.

384
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:35,740
Go ahead.

385
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,120
Where were we?

386
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,380
Your study attitude…

387
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,020
Teacher.

388
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,360
I'd like to go to the washroom too.

389
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,400
Go ahead.

390
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,840
Thank you, teacher.

391
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:51,820
Chen Xiaoxi, you…

392
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,420
Teacher.

393
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,220
Jiang Chen wants to solve the math problem on the blackboard.

394
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,540
Of course.

395
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:04,780
Come here.

396
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,600
Chen Xiaoxi.

397
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,660
It's okay, don't be afraid.

398
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,340
You've got us.

399
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,600
What you've written here is the knowledge of Senior two.

400
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,960
Why are you still standing?

401
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,300
Sit down and write the note down.

402
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
Not until I had come out did I realize that,

403
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,440
how can I use such a bad trick like you as a clever person.

404
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,380
I thought you'd tell her the answer.

405
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,220
I just suddenly forgot that I am a top-A student.

406
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,880
What's going on with my bro?

407
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,660
How can I know?

408
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,160
Where are you going?

409
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,760
I can't lie.

410
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,340
I need to go to the washroom sincerely.

411
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,800
Let me calculate this for you.

412
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,940
Never mind.

413
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,860
I can do it myself.

414
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,060
Except for the "Solution" is right,

415
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,860
others are all wrong.

416
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
I did that all by myself.

417
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,120
Don't you worry about that.

418
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,020
I think I want to do this?

419
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,920
It's the teacher's arrangement.

420
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,860
She's afraid your grades will become a drag on the whole class.

421
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,620
Jiang Chen, don't say that.

422
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,940
It sounds hurtful even to me.

423
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,560
Now that the moral model Jiang Chen has said that,

424
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,040
I'll leave now.

425
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,860
I won't be a drag on your great class eight.

426
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,980
I'll transfer to another school next semester.

427
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,040
Transfer?

428
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,280
Mind your step.

429
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,460
Alright.

430
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Young girl,

431
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,900
why are you crying?

432
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,380
You've been bullied by someone?

433
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,800
Don't come over here.

434
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,940
If you get any closer, I will shout.

435
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,480
Just shout.

436
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Your boss is Jiang Chen.

437
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,480
I'm so sacred.

438
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
Bro, don't be afraid.

439
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,400
That Jiang Chen is a counterfeit.

440
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,100
Get on.

441
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,700
So you are her boss?

442
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,140
She...

443
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,800
Is my boss.

444
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,800
So handsome.

445
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,720
Shut up.

446
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,440
Chase them.

447
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,980
Who is it this time?

448
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,300
I'm gonna kill you this time.

449
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,780
Why do you take me here?

450
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,420
I've promised to treat you to eat steak.

451
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,660
Are you better?

452
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,200
Then I'll take you to try something interesting.

453
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,300
I haven't finished eating yet.

454
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,640
Close your eyes

455
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,540
and count from 1 to 10.

456
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,200
What for?

457
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Just trust me.

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,820
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

459
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,580
How about counting to 100?

460
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,980
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

461
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,700
11, 12, 13, 14.

462
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
15, 16, 17.

463
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,560
Come here and have a try.

464
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,280
No.

465
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,840
I would tip over.

466
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,460
It will be okay. I will hold you.

467
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,920
Believe me, have a try.

468
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,680
How about this?

469
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,500
Don't you feel like you're in Maldives?

470
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,540
I feel like that you need to go to the doctor.

471
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
Don't be so negative.

472
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,860
Come.

473
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,080
Let's feel this positively.

474
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,180
Isn't it cool to sit on the water?

475
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,300
Yes.

476
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,860
Isn't it super cool?

477
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,860
Yes.

478
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,020
Don't you think it's no big deal?

479
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,200
Yes.

480
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,060
If the answer is positive, then speak it out.

481
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,120
It's okay to transfer.

482
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
It's okay to transfer.

483
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,920
The whole world should piss off.

484
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,500
Chen Xiaoxi is the best, the smartest, the most beautiful.

485
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,780
Chen Xiaoxi is the best, who has enough to eat and wear.

486
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,540
It's no big deal!

487
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,400
It's no big deal!

488
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,160
It's no big deal!

489
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,420
What's going on?

490
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,860
Come up.

491
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,560
What's going on?

492
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,180
You are not new here in the swimming team.

493
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,660
You don't even remember these ground rules?

494
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,740
I'm so sorry, coach.

495
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,240
It's because I'm in a bad mood,

496
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,480
so Wu Bosong took me here.

497
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,580
Please don't punish him.

498
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
I'm educating my teammates.

499
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,480
You should leave here.

500
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,420
Go.

501
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,800
Nothing valuable,

502
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
just some specialties for you to eat.

503
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
Please excuse me for that.

504
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,500
Yanjun, it's good for you to come back,

505
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
you don't need to bring us anything.

506
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,040
During these years,

507
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,560
Jiang Chen has caused great inconvenience for you.

508
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,920
I feel quite sorry about that.

509
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,660
Jiang Chen is an obedient and intelligent boy.

510
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,420
He can take care of himself.

511
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,580
He didn't cause any inconvenience.

512
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,900
We haven't helped at all.

513
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,940
Stop complimenting him.

514
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,100
I know he makes people worry about him.

515
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,680
He makes people worry about him?

516
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,260
He's good at study and independent.

517
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Xiaoxi makes us worry about her the most.

518
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,160
Xiaoxi is good.

519
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,180
Stop that, she's not good at all.

520
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
She's bad at study.

521
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,480
She couldn't catch up with the others,

522
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,240
yet is busy all the time.

523
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,600
I don't know why she is so busy.

524
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
She's just a kid who wants to play.

525
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,040
She just needs to make up the lessons she had missed.

526
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,620
No.

527
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,800
It's only a temporary solution.

528
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,760
These days,

529
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,300
Chen and I,

530
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
we plan to ask some acquaintances

531
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,520
to help her to transfer

532
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,360
to a boarding school.

533
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,980
She's going to transfer?

534
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,700
Yes.

535
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,780
These days, we are trying to persuade her.

536
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,520
Just now, I got her message.

537
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,700
Finally she's agreed.

538
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,780
You should have some too, they are sweet.

539
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,120
Five-hundred push-ups and five-kilometer swimming.

540
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,840
Who's that girl?

541
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,740
You don't wanna say, right?

542
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,200
You think you're amazing after getting a few champions?

543
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,340
So you can break the rules in the team?

544
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,320
You think no one can punish you, right?

545
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,420
She's my girlfriend.

546
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,000
What?

547
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,800
Girlfriend?

548
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,620
Five-hundred more.

549
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,060
She's my girlfriend.

550
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,160
So you think you're already in the national team?

551
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,140
How dare you fall in love with someone?

552
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,520
From now on, you are suspended.

553
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,980
You are not allowed to swim again.

554
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,980
Dad.

555
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,820
I don't want swimming to be the only thing in my life.

556
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,760
I've been swimming for ten years.

557
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,600
Since I was a boy,

558
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,260
I first joined the youth team,

559
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,640
then the city team, province team,

560
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,160
and I have to join the national team.

561
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
From then on, it's all about winning the championship.

562
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,920
Champions, champions

563
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,960
There you go.

564
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,840
If I don't push you hard now,

565
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,580
you'll regret for the rest of your life.

566
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,840
Let me tell you,

567
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,300
don't hang out with those disreputable girls.

568
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,860
She's not one of those disreputable girls.

569
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,080
Since I was a boy,

570
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,660
you've just arranged everything for me.

571
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,320
Did you ever ask if I really like swimming?

572
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,460
Did you ever ask if I have any friends?

573
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,520
I just keep swimming everyday.

574
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,580
I even don't have time to talk to my classmates at school.

575
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,300
She's my first friend.

576
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,420
I like her.

577
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,300
You…

578
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,480
I'll do it myself.

579
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,140
What happened?

580
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,100
I just got scratched.

581
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,540
Scratches are not like these.

582
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,460
You are not having a fight with the others?

583
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,000
If a man,

584
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,840
fights with someone,

585
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
it's either for money,

586
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,600
or for women.

587
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,680
What are you talking about?

588
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,200
Where did you learn those nonsense?

589
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,880
Brother.

590
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,620
It's for a woman, isn't it?

591
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,740
Go back to your room.

592
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,300
What is he talking about?

593
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Nonsense.

594
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,260
Just tell me,

595
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,740
what exactly happened?

596
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,300
You did not really get into a fight?

597
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,120
I've already told you, I just got scratched.

598
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,200
=A message to Chen Xiaoxi: Hello.

599
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,100
=A message to Chen Xiaoxi: Chen Xiaoxi.

600
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,800
=A message to Chen Xiaoxi: You…

601
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:31,000
=Have you finished your homework?

602
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:51,864
Don't transfer.

603
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,380
Wu Bosong.

604
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,840
Are you all right yesterday?

605
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm fine.

606
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,980
Everyone, write the question down.

607
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,520
It's important.

608
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,340
Chen Xiaoxi.

609
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,680
Why it is you again?

610
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,140
Come to my office.

611
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,000
Look at her.

612
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,800
She doesn't look like a student.

613
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,220
Her homework is a mess.

614
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,060
And she was in a daze and sleeping during the class.

615
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,940
I've never met a more unreasonable student.

616
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,880
Mr. Guo.

617
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,380
Although Chen Xiaoxi…

618
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,240
Miss Liu, don't persuade me.

619
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,600
I must scold her sharply today.

620
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,160
When her parents are here,

621
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,860
I'll talk to them.

622
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,760
Zero tolerance.

623
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,300
So you're Chen Xiaoxi's parents?

624
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,800
Come here, come here.

625
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,440
This way please.

626
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,100
Hello, Miss Liu.

627
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,760
Hello.

628
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,900
Have a seat.

629
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,120
Hello.

630
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,600
Have a seat.

631
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,800
So sorry to bother you to come here.

632
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,980
Not long ago, I told her that

633
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,860
I wanted to have a talk with you.

634
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,700
Xiaoxi, you've already told the teacher?

635
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,140
You'd better look at this first.

636
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,000
It's her math homework recently.

637
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,320
I know it may be a tough period for students.

638
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,740
But her study attitude recently

639
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,560
is indeed a problem.

640
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,000
She's either in a daze or sleeping during the class.

641
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,740
Teacher, I think I know the reason.

642
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,220
Recently,

643
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,500
we're preparing the transfer for her,

644
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,620
maybe she just hasn't adapted to that for the moment.

645
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,680
She may have a mood swing because of that.

646
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,100
That's right.

647
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,040
That's how all these happened.

648
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,240
Transfer?

649
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,060
We've been studying at Chenxi High School

650
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,720
for almost a year.

651
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,440
Her grades are getting worse and worse.

652
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,160
It's about her future.

653
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,620
We are worried.

654
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,120
So we want to change the environment for her.

655
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,800
It suddenly occurs to me that

656
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,860
I've still got some math test papers of class seven to correct.

657
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,280
What about you

658
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,760
talking to the parents first?

659
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,720
And I'll go to correct the test papers.

660
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,500
Go ahead.

661
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,680
Actually, Chen Xiaoxi

662
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,540
is a good student.

663
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,400
She really is.

664
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,560
You don't need to worry about it.

665
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,640
I think,

666
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,140
her senior one's grades,

667
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,320
can't represent her future grades,

668
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,480
also can't represent her grades of college entrance examination.

669
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,680
Some students are slow-type.

670
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,460
So it may take them longer to be enlightened.

671
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,020
When they are in senior two,

672
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,800
they just need to work a little bit harder,

673
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,800
then they can catch up with the others.

674
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,900
If you insist on that she should transfer,

675
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,780
it may take her some time

676
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,180
to adjust to the new environment.

677
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,100
Perhaps,

678
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,100
the loss will outweigh the gain.

679
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,320
Miss Liu,

680
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,980
what you said

681
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,600
sounds reasonable.

682
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,880
But her father has already settled everything.

683
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,400
Now we just need to do the transfer formalities.

684
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,640
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,580
I need to answer the phone.

686
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,200
That's okay.

687
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,480
Look at your scores.

688
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,380
This kid.

689
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,180
Really makes us angry.

690
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,100
Chen Xiaoxi is called into the office again.

691
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,020
This time, her parents are called here too.

692
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,180
How can she be so unlucky this week?

693
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,080
She is going to transfer.

694
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,740
Transfer?

695
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,900
No. What's going on?

696
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,000
No, no. Why?

697
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,840
But it seems that every teacher is aiming at her recently.

698
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,620
If I were her,

699
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,680
I couldn't stand it either.

700
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,480
But Liu Qingshan likes her very much.

701
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,980
Mr. Liu.

702
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,900
What's the matter?

703
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,900
That, we…

704
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,660
Don't falter. Go ahead.

705
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,540
That…

706
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,640
Let Jiang Chen tell you.

707
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,020
Jiang Chen, what's going on?

708
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,940
Do you know that Chen Xiaoxi is going to transfer?

709
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,920
Chen Xiaoxi?

710
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,200
Transfer?

711
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,960
That's right.

712
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,360
Let's find out.

713
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,920
Yes, that's right.

714
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,060
Jiang Chen is in my class.

715
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,620
No problem, I'll tell him.

716
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,380
Okay. Goodbye.

717
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,380
Miss Liu,

718
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,380
did you just mention Jiang Chen?

719
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,780
Yes.

720
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,980
What's wrong with him?

721
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,660
Here's the thing.

722
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,960
Jiang Chen lives in the building next to us.

723
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,720
And his mother is our good friend.

724
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,480
If there's something about him

725
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
that could use my help,

726
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,780
I can tell his mother.

727
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,560
Here's the thing.

728
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,440
Recently around our school,

729
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,360
there are a lot of unemployed youth

730
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,340
who specially blackmail the students.

731
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,460
Jiang Chen had saw some,

732
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,800
so he called the police,

733
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,420
and managed to stall them,

734
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,500
and helped the police catch them.

735
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,760
So the Public Security Bureau informed the Education Bureau.

736
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,540
And the Education Bureau specially called me to praise him.

737
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,000
Jiang Chen is such a good boy.

738
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,700
You see, students from our school,

739
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,220
are upright and smart.

740
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,980
If it's known by the public,

741
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,380
everyone would like to transfer to our school.

742
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,860
Who is going to transfer?

743
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,640
Mr. Liu.

744
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,120
Let me introduce to you.

745
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,380
This is our Chinese teacher.

746
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,320
his surname is also Liu.

747
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,440
They are Chen Xiaoxi's parents.

748
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,140
Hello.

749
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,980
Hello, Mr. Liu.

750
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,060
Please have a seat.

751
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,120
Have a seat.

752
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,580
- Let me say something. - Okay.

753
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,220
You always complain that Chen Xiaoxi is not good at studying.

754
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,240
And she is good at nothing.

755
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,460
I don't agree.

756
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,340
And I don't like it when you say these things.

757
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,100
It's not because she's not good,

758
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,860
but because you didn't see her merits.

759
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,720
First, Chen Xiaoxi has a talent for art.

760
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,920
Then look at her.

761
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,060
She is outgoing and kind.

762
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,120
What a good kid.

763
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,340
Yes.

764
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,240
That's right.

765
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,680
Her grades are not good now.

766
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,500
But I believe her.

767
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,040
=King Zhuang of Chu: A famous king in Chinese history.
King Zhuang of Chu hadn't achieved anything for three years.

768
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,680
But he finally made a great coup.

769
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,980
Mr. Liu, thank you, thank you.

770
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,020
Mr. Liu,

771
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,740
your words make sense.

772
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,600
But her school work is quite important after all.

773
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,520
All right.

774
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,160
We adults

775
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,380
should stop arguing.

776
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,460
Let's hear what she thinks.

777
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,100
Chen Xiaoxi.

778
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,260
Tell us.

779
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,440
Do you want to transfer?

780
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,900
I…

781
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,200
Mr. Liu.

782
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,020
You just now asked me to take the Chinese test papers.

783
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,000
Yes, right.

784
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,400
The papers are on the desk.

785
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,540
Take the composition notebooks too.

786
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,340
Oh, Chen Xiaoxi's composition is excellent this time.

787
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,760
She has made great progress.

788
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,640
Come, help me take the notebooks.

789
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,100
Xiaoxi,

790
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,280
we haven't finished talking, what are you doing?

791
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,020
=Jiang Chen=

792
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,580
Don't transfer.

793
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,700
Xiaoxi.

794
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,340
Xiaoxi, hurry up.

795
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,500
I won't transfer.

796
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,900
Our school is really good now,

797
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,260
teachers are really good.

798
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,940
And my friends are nice to me.

799
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
I decide to stay.

800
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,920
You've promised us!

801
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,460
Exactly.

802
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,480
Your grades are in a complete mess.

803
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,700
How can you not transfer?

804
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,140
Right.

805
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,100
I'll absolutely study hard in the future.

806
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,680
I will do well in the final.

807
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,920
I will get into…

808
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,800
Top 15 in my class.

809
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,580
Top 15?

810
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,360
You?

811
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,840
That's impossible.

812
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,200
How can it be possible?

813
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,640
If I got into the top 15 in my class,

814
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,100
do I still need to transfer?

815
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,200
Impossible.

816
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,780
Mom. Dad.

817
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,860
The point is, it's impossible.

818
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,020
Good girl.

819
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,620
You've got backbone.

820
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,300
I have faith in you.

821
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,360
Mom.

822
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,560
Chen Xiaoxi.

823
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:01,660
Walk faster.

824
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,120
Okay.

825
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,640
I heard that you'd helped the police catch the hooligans.

826
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,100
Did you do this because of me?

827
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,640
No.

828
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,940
I did that to eliminate the bad people and protect the good ones.

829
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,100
And I am the good one.

830
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,140
I feel like someone's following me recently.

831
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,140
It's you, right?

832
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,100
You must know that I've been bullied by hooligans,

833
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,000
so you just secretly protect me on my way home and way to school.

834
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,920
Right?

835
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,920
You imagination can be used to write a book.

836
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,120
Hurry up.

837
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,200
Then give me a ride.

838
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,460
No.

839
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,820
Why?

840
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,280
Because you're heavy.

841
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,540
That's because I am a sweet burden.

842
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,680
Chen Xiaoxi.

843
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,460
=In Chinese, you have no face means you are unabashed.
Where's your face?

844
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,620
I've sent it to you.

845
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:10,444
=Detailed study plan in high school=

846
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,900
# I like your eyes, your eyelashes and your coldness. #

847
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,180
# I like your dimples, your lips. #

848
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,460
A sad love story.

849
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,440
Broken.

850
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,080
It was Valentine's Day and Hu Jin had said…

851
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,660
# I like your shirt, your fingers and your smell. #

852
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,800
# I want to be your cotton-padded jacket, #

853
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,060
# your gloves and your heartbeat. #

854
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,720
# The whole world knows that I like you. #

855
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,540
# I'm suffering. #

856
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,540
# Don't be angry. #

857
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,480
# You'll find out how patient I am. #

858
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,160
# I like every moment and every second of you. #

859
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,640
# I like every place and every corner of you. #

860
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,080
# It has become a habit for me to like you, which is addictive. #

861
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,200
All the invigilators,

862
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,320
please check the test papers in front of students.

863
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,760
And open the test papers bag.

864
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,880
Check the number of the test papers.

865
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,020
And deliver them to students.

866
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,380
Students now can answer the questions.

867
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,460
# It has become a faith for me to like you, #

868
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,860
# which is hard to let go. #

869
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,320
# You'll know how much I like you. #

870
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,900
Excuse me, excuse me.

871
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,180
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

872
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,840
# You'll know how much I like you. #

873
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,520
No.13 in the class.

874
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,120
Chen Xiaoxi.

875
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,600
Your identity as a top student is finally exposed.

876
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,880
I'll break relations with you.

877
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,080
Guys,

878
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,740
I'll substitute wine with milk,

879
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,440
Let's congratulate Chen Xiaoxi on becoming a top student.

880
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,660
Let's congratulate Jiang Chen

881
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,220

882
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,820
At the same time,

883
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,120

884
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,560

885
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,080
Cheers.

886
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:12,980
Cheers.

887
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,400
It seems that I still like you very much.

888
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,400
Jiang Chen.

889
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,000
We thought you transferred.

890
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,200
What?

891
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,780
It's her.

892
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,880
She told us that you transferred to Changsha.

893
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,320
I transferred?

894
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,180
You didn't?

895
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,880
You tell me.

896
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,380
It seems that you didn't.

897
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,320
She wants to tell you something.

898
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,320
The class is about to begin.

899
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,600
It's okay.

900
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,160
Let's see if Hu Yitian of class six is there.

901
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,630
Let's go.
