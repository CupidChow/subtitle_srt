My name is Chen Xiaoxi.

00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:24,064
The most important thing in my life is drawing.

3
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:25,600
Drawing.

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,879
And...

5
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:30,950
...just drawing.

6
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:33,136
Yet when I was sixteen,

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,160
the most important thing in my life was him.

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,928
His name was Jiang Chen.

11
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,264
=straight A student/pupular/handsome/IQ200/talented/cool/athlete

We went to school together everyday.

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,224
Jiang Chen, let's go to school together.

16
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:12,368
Nope.

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,768
He often asked me to study with him.

18
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:19,488
We helped each other and made progress together.

19
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:24,672
He was quite gentle with me,

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,010
and he never loses temper on me.

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,050
Chen Xiaoxi.

22
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,488
The only problem was that he walked too fast.

23
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:30,944
I couldn't keep up.

24
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,544
Though it seems like I spent all my youth chasing him,

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,712
it's fine.

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,464
I believed that he was waiting for me secretly.

=Episode 1
Dear Jiang Chen

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,416
Chenxi High School is the place to follow your dreams.

29
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,610
Welcome, new students, to Chenxi High School,

30
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,976
one of the prestige high schools in China.

31
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,020
Today you are proud of Chenxi,

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,184
Jiang Chen.

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,752
We are in the same class this year.

38
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,544
This is fate destined by god.

39
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,856
How about that?

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,290
It seems like Chenxi's entry score is quite low this year.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
Five points lower, compared to last year.

42
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,488
Thank god to those five points,

43
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,392
or I would've been disqualified by one point.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,864
I am one lucky girl.

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,010
Jiang Chen.

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,176
I am really into you.

47
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,416
I don't.

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,496
Then...

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,152
let me work on that.

50
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,296
Working on that...

Look at my sweet little oval face.

55
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,336
This book sucks.

56
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,808
Young girl, you don't understand my taste in books.

57

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,688
Let me recommend you a new one.

62
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,224
No, thank you.

63
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,952
Your paper, please.

64
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,568
You're desperate!

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,020
You choose to copy mine.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,872
You always copy other people's answers.

67
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,872
How come you could be admitted to Chenxi?

68
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,048
Today's paper is easy, right?

69
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,360
I finished mine long ago.

70
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,384
That's embarrassing.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,540
You've been eating that Baozi for a whole class.

72
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,112
Nonsense. I'm on my fifth Baozi.

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,792
The listening test on the mid-term exams was quite simple.

74
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,430
Yeah?

75
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:56,650
That's Jiang Chen, he is so cute.

76
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,140
The tests were easy.

77
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,080
Only the essay was a bit hard to write.

78
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,560
Something called to follow your dreams?

79
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,776
Jiang Chen, what do you think of the test?

80
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,840
I wrote a short essay,

81
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,536
using just over a thousand words.

82
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,424
Couldn't help it.

83
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,928
Follow your dream is the sample essay.

84
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,776
The test essay's topic is about justice and equity.

85
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,728
You don't know that?

86
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,512
Look at your English test score.

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,440
Even your essay is off topic.

88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,144
And let's move on to your grade ranking.

89
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,352
You were down by a ranking of 75.

90
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,490
At that speed, you only need to take two more exams

91
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,048
to be at the bottom of the whole school.

92
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,552
You and Jiang Chen.

93
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,640
You two studied in the same middle school,

94
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,482
how come he ranks first at every exam,

95
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,968
while you rank last?

96
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:07,008
Ms. Liu, I understand.

97
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,232
I'll treat him as my role model.

98
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,240
Goodbye, teacher.

99
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,544
I think our grades are about the same.

100
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:20,032
How about we form a team?

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,840
Let's call it "The dragon brother and tiger sister".

102
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,880
Jiang Chen.

103
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,736
Can I have a moment of your time?

104
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,872
That's Li Wei.

105
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,140
What's up?

106
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,376
I didn't quite comprehend the grammer Ms. Liu taught us today.

107
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,152
Can you help me?

108
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,420
Tiger sister.

109
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,152
Do you like the name?

110
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,300
Okay. Which one you don't understand?

111
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,480
Who has a smaller face, me or her?

112
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:46,480
Compare to her?

113
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,740
Her.

114
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,632
My face is too big

115
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,712
to form a team with you.

116
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,370
That doesn't matter.

117
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,720
A big face is what makes you a tiger.

118
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,760
How can you judge someone based on academic record?

I read another edition of the book,

which I recommended to you yesterday.

131
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,168
It's well-written.

132
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,088
The only problem is that it lacks a little bit social criticism.

also dedicated this love letter to his dead wife.

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,570
Lu Yang, what the...

170
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,330
Chen Xiaoxi.

171
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,360
You expect to write good love letter based on that?

172
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:22,480
What do you know?

173
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,688
Then you don't know better.

174
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,808
Let me tell you something.

175
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,112
The person sits before you,

176
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,568
is the famous Casanova in Chenxi High School.

177
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,740
Let me tell you,

178
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,528
I have received dozens of love letters.

179
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,620
Do you know why?

180
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,392
Tell me.

181
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,380
Because I'm handsome, funny,

182
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,120
and I understand women.

183
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,450
I'd rather believe in this book than you.

184
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,980
I knelt down before your feet,

185
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,540
and I want to kiss them for a long time.

186
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,264
Please tell me more about your love letter writing experience?

187
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,856
Lu Yang.

188
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:14,816
I'm eating.

189
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,248
Have a bit more.

190
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Lu Yang.

191
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,620
Chen Xiaoxi.

192
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,568
My father wouldn't allow me to date a straight D student.

193
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,300
I plan to write to the school hunk in No.1 High School.

194
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,130
Fine.

195
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,824
Do me a favor then I'll teach you.

196
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,680
Give me back my chicken wings.

197
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,960
Did girls send you all those?

198
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,560
These are the ones I'll send to others.

199
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,128
Why would you send them love letters, being the Casanova and all?

200
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,840
You received a lot of them, then you have to return the favor.

201
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,784
I'm just sending some to others as a gesture.

202
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,500
This is more like giving out flyers!

203
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,808
I'll teach you after you send them.

204
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:04,672
Stop complaining.

205
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,608
Fine, I'll send them.

206
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,160
I'll do whatever you say.

207
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,856
Then let's begin with your first sentence,

208
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,192
which needs to be interesting to draw the reader's attention.

209
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,416
My dear...

210
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,712
Idiot.

211
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,100
Love letter needs a warm beginning.

212
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,890
Warm.

213
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,210
Just write down what I say.

214
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,130
I love you.

215
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,980
That's way too warm.

216
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,024
Hear me out.

217
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,640
I love your eyes,

218
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,250
your eyebrows,

219
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,928
your occasionally reflection in my heart.

220
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,200
Right, right.

221
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
The twist.

222
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,944
Throughout life, one could have many memories.

223
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,752
I wish I could be in your memories.

224
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,570
My love is like the flood,

225
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,264
and it pushes me to you.

226
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,360
Is this your way home? Where do you live?

227
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,328
Right next to Chen Xiaoxi.

228
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,210
Going home?

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,256
Li Wei, this is not your route home, right?

230
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:15,344
I...

231
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,936
Gotta go.

232
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,130
See you tomorrow.

233
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,600
I wrote a poem today, don't know if it's good or bad.

234
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,280
Would you like to hear it?

235
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,712
My love is like the flood, and it pushes me to you.

236
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,384
What do you think?

237
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:45,776
Does it rhyme?

238
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,416
You should spend your time on papers, not reciting lyrics.

239
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,688
Lyrics?

240
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,620
Ever since I got you,

241
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,740
the world has become a beautiful place.

242
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:06,256
# We wander the world together, #

243
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,250
# our memories are full of... #

244
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,096
These are lyrics!

245
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,048
Hello.

246
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,450
Xiaoxi, log on your QQ account immediately.

247
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,728
I invited you to a group chat.

248
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,770
I need a favor.

249
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,776
Let's talk there.

250
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,476
=Thin as Chunchun invited you to a group chat
"Chunchun's Hangzhou fanclub"

251
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,606
=Thin as Chunchun invited you to a group chat
"Chunchun's Hangzhou fanclub" Accept

252
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,952
We'll be canvassing for Chunchun tomorrow

253
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,392
at the street center garden.

254
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,784
We have to be well-prepared.

255
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,100
I can't go, it's my grandma's birthday.

256
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,464
I'll ask a friend to fill in for me.

257
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:40,740
=Chatting with: Flying feathers descend three thousand feet

258
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,776
Will you come tomorrow?
=Chatting with: Flying feathers descend three thousand feet

259
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:42,464
=Chatting with: Flying feathers descend three thousand feet

260
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,808
Actually, I have plans.

261
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,184
I'm so disappointed.

262
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,184
I'll fix your problem for you.

263
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,848
I have to write a love letter...

264
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,408
...for a friend.

265
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,344
That's simple.

266
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,608
I'll help you.

267
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,576
Stop right there!

268
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,296
I never talk nonsense.

269
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,690
Yet I want to tell you that I'm into you.

270
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,520
If you say no,

271
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,130
I have...

272
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,488
...a hundred ways to make your life miserable in this school.

273
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,740
Whoever dares to take you away from me,

274
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,464
I'll cut...

275
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,424
Who are you?

276
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,008
Why are you eavesdropping?

277
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,656
I wasn't eavesdropping.

278
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,992
This is a small school,

279
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,704
and you have a loud voice.

280
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,192
Hey,

281
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,320
this school is messed up, right?

282
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,620
Are you the bro in a gang?

283
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,980
Yes.

284
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,864
So,

285
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,736
don't you mess with me.

286
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:38,400
Can I count on Flying feathers or not?

287
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,380
Forget it, I'll write it myself.

288
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,168
Broken.

289
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,690
=I really like you! To me, you are perfect.
The only problem between us might be the academic record.

290
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,544
=I really like you! To me, you are perfect.

291
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,024
All right. Correct.

292
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,080
Lin Jingxiao, you choose the next student.

293
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,010
Chen Xiaoxi.

294
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,770
Sure.

295
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,100
Chen Xiaoxi.

296
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,128
Chen Xiaoxi.

297
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,312
Come on.

298
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,170
Hurry up.

299
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,384
Respect.

300
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,864
Organization.

301
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,408
Balance.

302
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,640
Balance.

303
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,856
Balance.

304
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,376
I know that word.

305
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,380
You are Wu Bosong, the new kid.

306
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,472
Yes, that's me.

307
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,980
You were suppose to report to me at eight o'clock.

308
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,712
What time is it now? Nine o'clock.

309
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,897
You are a sport-specialized student,

310
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:00,624
but it doesn't give you the right to be late.

311
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:01,456
Come on.

312
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,312
Get up there.

313
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,448
Do the word dictation.

314
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,440
Bro, I'm depending on you.

315
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,856
Modest.

316
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,424
Modest.

317
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,860
Don't look at me, bro.

318
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,744
I have no idea.

319
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,248
Quit stalling and start writing.

320
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,290
How hard would it be for you to actually recite English words?

321
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,530
And you, you tried to copy her answer?

322
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,660
Her English might be worse than you.

323
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,170
That's because I haven't taken any of your classes yet.

324
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,450
Don't bullshit me.

325
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:06,736
Go ahead and sit down.

326
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,330
How can you know only one word?

327
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,560
Introduce yourself to the class.

328
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,660
Hello everyone.

329
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,740
My name is Wu Bosong, I'm new here.

330
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm a swimmer,

331
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,856
and let's hang out sometime.

332
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,900
Go sit down.

333
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,740
You too.

334
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,780
Where should I sit?

335
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,020
There.

336
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,450
Bro.

337
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,690
Why did you call her bro?

338
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,660
Destiny brought us together, is that right, my bro?

339
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,050
Hello, is Jiang Chen around?

340
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,780
Nope.

341
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,260
Where did he go?

342
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,380
He's...

343
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,930
What?

344
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,050
I heard that he's been transferred to another school.

345
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,980
Which one?

346
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,210
I have no idea.

347
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,100
He's transferred?

348
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,930
You are dismissed for the rest of the class.

349
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,810
He who strikes first gains the advantage.

350
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,750
=Dear Jiang Chen

351
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,050
Take notes, this is important.

352
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,690
One carbon atom and one oxygen molecule,

353
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,330
water serves as the dispersing agent.

354
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,740
Draw this on the paper.

355
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,900
What are you doing?

356
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,570
It generally exists in the state of molecule or ion.

357
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,330
I've explained this before, do you remember that?

358
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,020
=Where will our love float to? To a distant place, or your heart?
I'm just a guy in love.

359
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,260
What does it say?
=Where will our love float to? To a distant place, or your heart?

360
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
=Where will our love float to? To a distant place, or your heart?
I'm just a guy in love.

361
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,500
Class dismissed.

362
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,900
Goodbye, teacher.

363
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,740
Jiang Chen,

364
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,740
I wrote that...

365
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,380
Chen Xiaoxi, have you finished your assignment?

366
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,860
...with my heart.

367
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,100
You tried to fool me with lyrics?

368
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,570
I can write my love letter better than you.

369
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,100
Send them, and you will find out.

370
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,020
Hello.

371
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,410
I'm looking for Qin Qiong.

372
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,100
He wrote this love letter for you.

373
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,500
Give it back!

374
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,570
You sent love letter to my class.

375
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,170
Give it back!

376
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,660
Give it!

377
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,690
You first grade kids have balls.

378
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,810
Where will our love float to?

379
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,500
Stop it!

380
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,980
To a distant place, or your heart?

381
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,900
Stop reading!

382
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,740
Do you have a place for me in your heart?

383
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,930
Chen Xiaoxi, let's get out of here.

384
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm just a guy in love.

385
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,660
Though I can't drink, I want to be drunk in your arms.

386
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,290
Stop it!

387
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,020
Chen Xiaoxi, forget it, let's go.

388
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,780
What's the rush?

389
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,810
Let me analyse this for you.

390
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,410
You got some nerve to send such an awful love letter.

391
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,170
I could write a better one in my sleep.

392
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,450
Chen Xiaoxi and Lu Yang are fighting with the seniors.

393
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,020
Did you write this?

394
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,810
Answer me!

395
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,380
You got the nerve to send them but not cop to them?

396
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,290
Pussy.

397
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,050
What's the matter?

398
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,980
They were reading Lu Yang's love letter.

399
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
Reading a love letter.

400
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,810
Yes, we did.

401
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,530
Can you recognize all the words there?

402
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,330
Now, read it again to mama.

403
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,690
Do it!

404
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,660
I won't.

405
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,140
Why would I do something just because you say so?

406
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,410
You tomboy.

407
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,810
That's one filthy mouth you have.

408
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,380
Let me clean that for you.

409
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,660
Who are you?

410
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,780
A cute guy.

411
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,290
Psycho.

412
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,379
Why would you take his love letter?

413
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,930
If you truly like them, write your own ones.

414
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,780
That one, right there.

415
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,020
That's my bro.

416
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,100
You take her love letter,

417
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,210
it's like you take my necessities,

418
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,660
how can I let that go?

419
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,380
You really have a filthy mouth.

420
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,980
There's more where that came from, you want a taste?

421
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,500
Zhang Shiliang is coming.

422
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,530
You are a loyal friend.

423
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,210
You are so full of it, right?

424
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,500
Now you tried to create a conflict with the seniors?

425
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,450
There is no place for you fools.

426
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,810
The fight never really happens, right?

427
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,980
Lu Yang, shut your mouth.

428
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,530
You think you're in Grade One now,

429
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,900
you still have plenty of time, right?

430
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,020
Then you don't know what's it like to be a senior.

431
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,410
Right now, time is not on their side!

432
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,310
Well,

433
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,170
the ones who started the fight,

434
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,260
and the ones who watched the show,

435
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,410
get out of my classroom!

436
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,380
To think about your actions.

437
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,100
Ms. Liu, this is not...

438
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,780
Not who's business?

439
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,780
I think it is your business.

440
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,290
You wrote love letters, started a gang fight,

441
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,570
and sent love letters to a senior.

442
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,500
What's it with you?

443
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,450
You wanted to start a sister-younger brother relationship?

444
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,780
Ms. Liu, let me tell you something.

445
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,740
These brats in your class are long time trouble makers.

446
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,860
If you don't punish them severely this time,

447
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,210
next time you'll see them in juvies.

448
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,290
I was in the middle of...

449
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,620
Where are the rest of the love letters?

450
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,100
Give them to me.

451
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,210
Mr. Zhang, I don't have them.

452
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,660
Chen Xiaoxi, this is a surprise,

453
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,780
you are an accomplice to the crime.

454
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,050
He had a crush on someone, what's it to you?

455
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,620
As if you can get your hands on his marriage money.

456
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,740
No,

457
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,050
I can't.

458
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,620
Give them to me.

459
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:35,100
Where will our love float to?

460
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,050
To a distant place, or your heart?

461
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,100
Do you have a place for me in your heart?

462
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,740
I'm just a guy in love.

463
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,140
Though I can't drink,

464
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,690
I want to be drunk in your arms and in the autumn breeze.

465
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,170
All your love letters are the same.

466
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,530
You should just send out flyers.

467
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,140
It's over for me.

468
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,660
He's gonna read my love letter.

469
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,450
Mr. Zhang,

470
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,410
this is a violation of privacy.

471
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,100
You shouldn't read that.

472
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,050
There's no privacy if you dare to write a love letter.

473
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,170
Don't you know our school has rules?

474
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,260
Mr. Zhang,

475
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,810
there's no rule says you can invade students' privacy.

476
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,810
Mr. Zhang,

477
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,530
stop reading that.

478
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,900
We know what we did is wrong.

479
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,050
Fine, you guys,

480
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,660
go write your confessions.

481
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,530
One thousand words in each confession!

482
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,690
Or no one leaves!

483
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,340
=Confession: Dear teacher, I truly understand...

484
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,380
Bro,

485
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,140
I only know how to write a match report,

486
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,050
I've never write a confession.

487
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,900
Can you help me?

488
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,670
Looks like you really know this stuff.

489
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,410
Wait for a moment.

490
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,710
I'll help you once I finish.

491
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,560
My hero,

492
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,410
just copy mine.

493
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,180
Young warrior, thanks a lot.

494
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,620
Did you stand up to Mr. Zhang because of me?

495
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,530
No.

496
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,190
Fine.

497
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,780
- I can teach you how to write a confession. - No need.

498
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,180
You can't write this.

499
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,330
What you just wrote, is so not a confession.

500
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,570
The teacher's actions in this event,

501
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,560
doesn't conform to the quality-oriented education.

502
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,940
You can't write something like that.

503
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,930
I'm better at this, let me help you.

504
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,870
You were so cool back then.

505
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,140
You should fight back when they push too hard.

506
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,210
Next time, you should just...

507
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,800
...kick their asses.

508
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,160
We, students in Class Eight, are not pushovers.

509
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,300
I say that's because he writes terrible love letters.

510
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,530
I'm just warming things up.

511
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,540
Lu Yang, didn't you say you are the Casanova?

512
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,380
Fine.

513
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,930
Thanks for all of your help today.

514
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,040
Let's cut the small talk,

515
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,790
and meet at the Internet cafe after school.

516
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,050
Who's with me?

517
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,710
Pass.

518
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,270
Me too. I have plans.

519
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,090
My bro won't go, why should I?

520
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,260
I'll kill him whenever I see him.

521
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,500
You are good at this, Jiang Chen.

522
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,380
Just like me.

523
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,500
After this, basically we went through sick and thin together.

524
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,580
Let's form a team together.

525
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,170
Dragon and tiger brothers?

526
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,450
You were so eavesdropping when I was talking to Xiaoxi.

527
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,980
You've been paying attention to me.

528
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,330
Let's form a new team together.

529
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:18,210
Wang Dazhuang has G4, let's call ourselves T3.

530
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,380
That's silly.

531
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,170
No wonder your love letter sucks.

532
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,620
And that's still better than your game skills.

533
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
Lu Yang, you think you're the terminal building?

534
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,410
Jiang Chen, you remember my name!

535
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,890
It is not too hard for me, I think.

536
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,860
One more.

537
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,020
Is Ximen dog show here?

538
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,690
Yes.

539
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,690
- How about A girl beats Youtian? - I'm here.

540
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,330
Is Women should treat men like dogs here?

541
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,530
JClove?

542
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,780
Is JClove here?

543
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,740
Yes, yes.

544
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,140
I'm here.

545
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,010
Is Flying feathers descend three thousand feet here?

546
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,210
=We support Chunchun forever
Chunchun, you are the best!

547
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,800
Right here.
=We support Chunchun forever

548
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,100
Right here.

549
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,210
Where's the support banner?

550
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,660
Right.

551
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,900
How can you put that in your bag?

552
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,530
I spent so much time on that.

553
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,810
You ruined Chunchun's photo.

554
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,740
How could you be a Yumi if you can't protect Chunchun's banner?

555
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,930
That's right.

556
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to.

557
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,900
Stop fighting and start thinking about how to make this right.

558
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,100
Right now, the banner's ruined.

559
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,140
I have an idea.

560
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,740
Can you let me try?

561
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,740
What are you going to do?

562
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,660
What are you doing?

563
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,050
Find me a photo of Chunchun, a good-looking one.

564
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,450
Hold that for me.

565
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,620
That's good.

566
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,140
Stop.

567
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,410
=Please vote for Chunchun

568
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,690
That's so cool.
=Please vote for Chunchun

569
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,690
That's so cool.

570
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,330
Please vote for Chunchun.

571
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,530
I really appreciate what you did for me today.

572
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,460
If it weren't for you today,

573
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,290
there's no way I could be off the hook so easily.

574
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,460
By the way,

575
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,900
your love letter, who did you write it to?

576
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,420
How did you know it was me?

577
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,700
Everybody does that.

578
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,660
They all start with "I have a friend."

579
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,940
It's for Jiang Chen, am I right?

580
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,490
My friend says yes.

581
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,220
Your friend has a peculiar taste in men.

582
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,530
She isn't afraid to be freezed to death,

583
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,250
'cause she likes someone who's cold and distant.

584
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,730
You don't understand.

585
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,530
I don't.

586
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,460
You do.

587
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,530
Should I bring Jiang Chen breakfast?

588
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,770
Love is destined, not designated.

589
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,460
Let's go.

590
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,620
What are you laughing at?

591
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,620
Just that I feel really happy to go to school with you.

592
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,100
Though you didn't get the letter,

593
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,730
how come I feel like you know what I want to say?

594
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,180
Jiang Chen,

595
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,530
have a Baozi.
