There are some special circumstances in our school.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
I need to record everyone's temperature.

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,380
I think I've got a fever.

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,820
Li Wei and Qiao Li sit together.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

9
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,340
Would it be possible that Li Wei has been infected too?

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,500
Li Wei, come over here.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

Don't worry.

Have a rest.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

Teacher, I'm not feeling well.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

What are you doing here?

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

21
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,500
I told you,
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,300
I would come back to you later.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,720
Xiaoxi, can you see me?

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,740
=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,460
I'll always be here.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,680
When the sea is calm again,

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,300
people on the shore will sail a boat.

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

ten bodies that lie on the Soldiers Island,

=Previously on "A Love So Beautiful"

and a puzzle that no one can solve.

don't be scared.

Happy Winter

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,440
What present are you going to send Jiang Chen for Christmas?

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
Have you saved up enough money?

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,680
So you are only going to send him this card?

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,660
I have neither money nor ideas.

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,860
How about drawing him a comic book?

50
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you think he will read it?

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,040
No.

52
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,740
Come on.

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,800
Poor you.

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,740
Let me share my plan to you.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,420
There's no better way to express a girl's tenderness

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,220
than knitting a scarf.

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,980
And there's nothing warmer

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
than wearing a scarf knitted by a girl.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,120
But I don't know how to knit a scarf.

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,640
It's really easy.

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,760
You can search it on the Internet.

62
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,120
Then we both knit a scarf.

63
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,340
You knit one for Li Shu.

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,440
I knit one for Jiang Chen.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,920
Keep your voice down.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,560
Choose a color. Quickly.

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,760
Has the certificate arrived yet?

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,480
It was sent from abroad.

69
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,260
Not that fast.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
Can you urge them?

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,440
What if it can't arrive here before Christmas?

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,900
Are you going to be responsible for my emotional life?

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,140
You should've prepared it earlier if you are in a hurry.

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,260
Prepare what?

75
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,460
Now there's a fight against pornography and illegal publications.

76
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,580
I'm going to lay a solid foundation

77
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,300
for the most important thing in my life.

78
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,260
I've already told you.

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
Don't believe the ads posted on the telegraph pole saying

80
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,800
that they are willing to pay a lot of money only to have a child.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
The class is about to begin. Hurry up.

82
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,380
Lu Yang.

83
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,460
What's the matter?

84
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,220
Can you borrow me your gloves?

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,440
Why are you borrowing gloves with me?

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,780
Just go to hold his hands and share your temperatures.

87
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm begging you. Can't you just leave me alone?

88
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,040
I've already bought you ice creams and done your duty.

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,540
What else do you want me to do?

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,320
Do you need me to pack Lin Jingxiao up for you?

91
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,640
What are you doing?

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you speaking ill of me?

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,960
Lu Yang goes on talking about Jiang Chen and me.

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,900
You've already known it, yet you didn't tell me.

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,100
So you are the accessory.

96
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,720
Hurry up.

97
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,720
Guys, excuse me, excuse me.

98
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,020
What's this?

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,620
Gloves.

100
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,180
I don't want it.

101
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,880
Don't often buy things for me.

102
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,100
No.

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
It's a Christmas gift. I've prepared for everyone.

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
Wait a moment.

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,320
Jiang Chen.

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,060
How are you going to celebrate Christmas?

107
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,360
I don't celebrate.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,880
Alright.

109
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,420
Lu Yang.

110
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,420
Where is Wu Bisong?

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,020
Does he have a match today?

112
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
There appears to be a friendly match.

113
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,660
Why didn't his coach tell me?

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,300
It seems that

115
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,420
the match is confidential.

116
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,660
Confidential?

117
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,140
What kind of match is confidential?

118
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,760
It's a spot test within the group.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,080
A sudden selection.

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,220
Report.

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
Welcome Wu Bosong back in triumph.

122
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,340
Alright. Let's begin our class.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,840
Bro, I did you a favor.

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,320
You helped me to carry it down?

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm scared to death.

126
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,420
Okay. I'll tell you the grade in the next English class.

127
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,640
The class is over.

128
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,060
Goodbye, teacher.

129
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,640
Your Christmas gift.

130
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,920
But I've already had gloves.

131
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,440
Can you give me a pair of furry socks?

132
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,000
Trade them with your life.

133
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,820
Brother.

134
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,740
Thanks.

135
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,480
Thank you.

136
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
You really bought gifts for everyone.

137
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,240
Of course.

138
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
Do you like this color?

139
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,760
I suppose all the girls would like pink.

140
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,960
Not really.

141
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,620
Yours is good.

142
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,420
Lin Jingxiao.

143
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,120
What do you want for Christmas?

144
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,900
I'll reach for the stars if you want.

145
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,700
Just do it.

146
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,060
Just wait.

147
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,740
Save it.

148
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,840
If you really are great, then make it snow for me.

149
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,660
I hate the weather. It's neither cold nor warm.

150
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,960
It's not cold enough?

151
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
But snowing is good. I like snowy days.

152
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,720
It would be great if we could have snowy days.

153
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,600
We haven't had snowy days for a long time.

154
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,180
It would be amazing if it could snow on Christmas.

155
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,140
How romantic.

156
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,480
It's so romantic

157
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,680
that you couldn't help falling into the snow every time.

158
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,080
The road is slippery on snowy days.

159
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,280
We haven't had snowy days for a long time.

160
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,600
Let me create a snowy day for you.

161
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,220
I'm leaving.

162
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,940
Bye, see you tomorrow.

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,900
Bye.

164
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,060
Goodbye, jing jing. See you tomorrow.

165
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,200
Ride slowly.

166
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,860
Hurry up, Chen Xiaoxi.

167
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,940
Jiang Chen.

168
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,080
Lin Jingxiao will come and play at my house today.

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Does he always ride so fast?

170
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,220
I don't think so.

171
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,700
Then it's the vinegar jar in his house tipped over,

172
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,400
and he needs to go back to get jar up.

173
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,180
Nothing. Let's go, let's go.

174
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,220
I think it looks good.

175
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,420
It's ugly and out of naff.

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,220
It's not naff.

177
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,540
Let me tell you what kind of scarves do boys like.

178
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you see it? Boys like this one.

179
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,660
=JC stands for Jiang Chen.
What about embroidering a JC here

180
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,100
and add a little heat?

181
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,100
Have some fruits.

182
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,820
Apples!

183
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,460
Thank you, aunt.

184
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
What are you doing with all these knitting wools?

185
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,880
Here's the thing.

186
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,280
Aunt.

187
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,580
May I ask that

188
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,420
do you know how to knit a scarf?

189
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,740
Not only scarves,

190
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,900
I knitted all her woolen clothes since she was a child.

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Aunt.

192
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,600
Can you teach us?

193
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,180
Of course. Let me show you.

194
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
This hand could pinch this.

195
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Just pinch the needle.

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,040
Then you can cast on.

197
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,640
Look, just turn around like this.

198
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,220
Look, you can cast on as many as stitches you want.

199
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,540
You should cast on more stitches for a scarf.

200
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,440
You can do that as wide as you want.

201
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,080
Xiaoxi, did you see it clearly?

202
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,140
It's okay, aunt. I can teach her later.

203
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,260
You've already learned this?

204
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,720
I think it's pretty easy.

205
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,280
You think so?

206
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,280
Hold the needle with your left hand

207
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,640
and hold the knitting wools with your right hand.

208
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,540
And then turn around, right?

209
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,220
How clever you are.

210
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
Loot at this.

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,980
You hands are like feet.

212
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,040
You've already turned it around for a hundred times.

213
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,220
Look, just like this.

214
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,400
You need to turn it around.

215
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,060
If a mother knows everything then her daughter will be stupid.

216
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:56,940
Mom.

217
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,500
Alright. Have fun.

218
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
Just tell me if there's something you don't know.

219
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,040
Aunt, you look gorgeous today.

220
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,580
Goodbye, aunt.

221
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,220
Goodbye.

222
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,780
You should give it up.

223
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,460
No, I can't.

224
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,100
How to do this?

225
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,880
What should I do? I need to take it apart again.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,300
I've already do that for more than twenty times.

227
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,160
I think.

228
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
You should buy another set.

229
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,040
You asked me, how deeply I love Li Shu.

230
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,140
Chen Xiaoxi has chosen the same color as you.

231
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,060
Qiao Lu, let's go.

232
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,320
Did you see that?

233
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,820
The way she looks at me.

234
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,520
She looks down on me.

235
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,480
I think,

236
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,480
Li Wei isn't totally unreasonable.

237
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,240
Dear name astar live.

238
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,540
My name is Lu Yang.

239
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,820
Where is my star?

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,340
Now you can understand.

241
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,360
Mine is better.

242
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,240
Who do you think you are?

243
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,200
Seamstresses?

244
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,440
Jingjing. Jingjing.

245
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,540
Lin Jingxiao.

246
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,260
You think you are a heroine?

247
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,300
You're students.

248
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,100
If I saw this again,

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,060
I would confiscate them all.

250
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,920
Why didn't you tell me?

251
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,900
I didn't see it.

252
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,860
What are you laughing at?

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,520
Let's begin the class.

254
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,260
What's this?

255
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,180
Dear?

256
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,800
She's doing this again?

257
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,680
No, no.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,060
I must punish her this time.

259
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,060
Just now you didn't want me to lose temper.

260
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,160
Do you remember last time she did this?

261
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,080
We handled it well.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
We should do the same as last time.

263
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,060
That's effective.

264
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,880
Last time.

265
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,480
Okay.

266
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,760
Let's go.

267
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,540
What are you doing?

268
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,760
How old are you? Why are you ogling at each other?

269
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,220
Here's the thing.

270
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,320
Xiaoxi.

271
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,660
Do you still remember Aunt Liu?

272
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,460
She used to work at the food products factory with me.

273
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,720
I don't remember her.

274
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,080
It's okay.

275
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,580
It's just that Aunt Liu,

276
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,900
she has a daughter,

277
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,020
two years older than you.

278
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
She's really good at study.

279
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,640
Just the one who used to come to our house often

280
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,860
to help you with your school work.

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,260
What's wrong? She's asking for coaching fee now?

282
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,420
She has fallen in love with someone,

283
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,300
and failed in the college entrance examination.

284
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,820
So she went insane.

285
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,820
Why the direction of the story is so terrifying?

286
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm talking to you nicely.

287
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,700
Can you be a little bit more polite?

288
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,100
What's wrong with me?

289
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
I have nothing to do with her insanity.

290
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,580
Can you understand what I'm talking about?

291
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,280
Alright. Come on, let's eat.

292
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,280
We can talk about it later. Let's eat first.

293
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,080
Tang Li.

294
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,240
It may not be like this.

295
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,340
We beat around the bush for so long,

296
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,560
yet she didn't catch up with the conversation at all.

297
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,380
It means she never thought about that.

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,100
Then how do you think of the 'dear' on the card?

299
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,500
What problem can a card indicate?

300
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,540
Maybe she wrote that to her teacher.

301
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,820
We should observe.

302
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,740
Don't frighten yourself.

303
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,420
I couldn't knit better than Li Wei anyway.

304
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,080
Maybe,

305
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
I should select another gift.

306
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,620
Good morning, aunt.

307
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,340
Good morning.

308
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,160
Jiang Chen.

309
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,000
I want to ask you about something.

310
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,240
Do you think there's something wrong

311
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,120
with our Xiaoxi recently?

312
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,580
No.

313
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,580
Does she get close

314
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,500
with any of her male classmates?

315
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,180
No.

316
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,380
For example,

317
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,540
does she talk much

318
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,940
with any of her male classmates at school?

319
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,400
And they would hang out together sometimes.

320
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,320
No.

321
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,060
I'm wasting my time.

322
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,060
You're devoted to studying.

323
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,540
How can you know about this.

324
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,500
Alright.

325
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,020
Off you go.

326
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,120
Goodbye, aunt.

327
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,940
Goodbye.

328
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,740
Mom, what are you doing here?

329
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,260
Hurry up.

330
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,500
Jiang Chen is waiting for you, hurry up.

331
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,700
He's been waiting for you for a long time. Go.

332
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,040
You're really waiting for me to go to school?

333
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,400
No, I'm not.

334
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,060
I knew it.

335
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
Then what are you talking about with my mom?

336
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,360
The weather.

337
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,640
What weather?

338
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,920
Whether it's going to snow or not.

339
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,180
Is it going to snow?

340
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,920
Is it?

341
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,260
I don't know.

342
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,040
Then what's it to be talked about?

343
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,580
What are these?

344
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,820
I can't understand.

345
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,100
It's common for you.

346
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,880
I don't like the way you talk.

347
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,460
So what are these actually?

348
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,780
Weather.

349
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,340
I've looked up the weather of the following fourteen days.

350
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,220
I'm speculating if it's going to snow on Christmas.

351
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,500
How? Is it going to snow that day?

352
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,740
It might.

353
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,340
How much is the possibility?

354
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,160
50%.

355
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,700
Xiaoxi.

356
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,140
How do you think of it?

357
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,520
Not bad.

358
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,260
It's beautiful.

359
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,900
Give it back to me, give it back.

360
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,340
Why? You're going to send it to someone?

361
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,720
Give it back to me.

362
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Jiang Chen, I want to tell you something.

363
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,500
Can you come out?

364
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,000
What are you doing?

365
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,860
Teach me.

366
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,740
Jiang Chen, why are you wearing so little today?

367
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,260
It's pretty thick.

368
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,820
Don't go over there.

369
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,840
What's the matter?

370
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,920
That...

371
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,020
I've got something for you.

372
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,900
It's a scarf knitted by me.

373
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,540
It probably doesn't look good for it's my first try.

374
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,960
Try it on.

375
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,000
What are you doing here? So furtive.

376
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Chen Xiaoxi, what are you doing?

377
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,680
I'm done playing the game.

378
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,640
What's wrong?

379
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,080
Nothing.

380
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,840
Jiang Chen.

381
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,640
Why are you running?

382
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,880
What's this expression? You're going to cry?

383
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,280
Lu Yang.

384
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,320
Can you shut up?

385
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,160
You're so rude.

386
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,900
Will you stop it?

387
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,180
You must have received a lot of gifts recently.

388
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,720
You can look at it yourself.

389
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,540
You've really received a lot.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm not you.

391
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,700
I've got presents from the others too.

392
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,100
From Wu Bosong?

393
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,540
Go to ask her. Just go.

394
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,320
You go.

395
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,920
No, it's better for you to go.

396
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,300
Just go.

397
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
Ask her about it, ask her.

398
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,280
Xiaoxi.

399
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,720
Xiaoxi.

400
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,240
When I was doing the cleaning today,

401
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,660
I found a card.

402
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,060
Have a look, is it yours?

403
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,740
Why it's so cold?

404
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,880
Because the weather is cold.

405
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,360
That...

406
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,740
Who are you going to send it to?

407
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,840
Bastard.

408
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,720
What?

409
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,180
No one, I just bought it.

410
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,460
How's it going?

411
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,820
She won't say.

412
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,820
Good morning.

413
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,920
How do you think of it?

414
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,700
It's fabulous.

415
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,180
Your work is extraordinary.

416
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,900
Why do you stop knitting the bracelet?

417
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,220
I don't want to.

418
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,620
Why?

419
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,500
What about I...

420
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,140
Lin Jingxiao.

421
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,060
What?

422
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,040
You wanna attack me secretly?

423
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,840
No, I'm not.

424
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,380
There's a notice letter of an international parcel.

425
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,920
Can you have a look at it for me?

426
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,300
You're not an illiterate person.

427
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,140
Just have a look.

428
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,680
So you can't understand an international pornographic letter?

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,320
How can you think of me like that?

430
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,740
Am I such a person?

431
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,380
Yes, you are.

432
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,980
You will see.

433
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
You will be moved to tears.

434
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,380
Teacher.

435
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,060
Teacher.

436
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,780
Didn't you see me?

437
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

438
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,860
- Are you alright, Lin Jingxiao? - Piss off.

439
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,220
I didn't meant to.

440
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,700
Brother Zhuang.

441
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,920
She is aggressive. She even dares to abuse you.

442
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,260
She said this to you and you are not even angry.

443
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,760
You're not like her, are you?

444
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,300
Piss off.

445
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,660
I think it's true.

446
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,580
You must be a hen-pecked husband in the future, brother Zhuang.

447
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,800
To be honest,

448
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
I really think being a doctor without borders

449
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,120
is a very meaningful thing.

450
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,240
It's yours.

451
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,300
It's from my girlfriend.

452
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
Then put it away.

453
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,920
You don't need to show off in front of me.

454
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,280
You can show off in front of me after you have a girlfriend.

455
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,740
Look at those girls,

456
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,180
they always come here no matter if they really feel unwell.

457
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,260
And they are specially here to see you.

458
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,920
Screw you.

459
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,600
I'll leave you alone.

460
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,260
I think Li Shu has got a girlfriend.

461
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,000
She must be one of those hypocritical women

462
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,560
who have long legs,

463
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,920
a slender waist,

464
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,960
and without a baby face.

465
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,900
He definitely won't like me.

466
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,340
No, he will.

467
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,240
You are also one of those hypocritical women

468
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,080
who have long legs, slender waist and without a baby face.

469
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,820
Are you really my friend?

470
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,600
Of course I am.

471
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,020
Because I have encountered the same thing as you.

472
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,740
What's that?

473
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,080
The scarf that Jiang Chen wore this morning,

474
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,780
was a gift from Li Wei.

475
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,600
I saw her giving it to him.

476
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,780
He's got a drawer of gifts,

477
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,840
this one doesn't mean anything to him.

478
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,560
Jiang Chen's gifts in the drawer,

479
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,060
were all secretly given by others.

480
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,500
He wouldn't accept gifts from girls.

481
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,360
But he accepted Li Wei's.

482
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,000
She must be very important to him.

483
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,660
You're not going to fill the bottle with water?

484
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,620
It suddenly occurs to me

485
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,220
that I have to fetch Lin Jingxiao's bottle.

486
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,980
There are already two bottle in your hands.

487
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,460
Just remember to bring your brain with you.

488
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,860
Brother Zhuang, brother Zhuang, she's coming.

489
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,400
Learn from me.

490
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Lin Jingxiao.

491
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,920
What?

492
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,320
I have something to tell you.

493
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,800
Go ahead.

494
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,900
What are you doing?

495
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,760
You've got manliness.

496
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,880
What's wrong with you?

497
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,180
No, it's just...

498
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,860
Here's the thing.

499
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,000
Recently I'm not busy.

500
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,740
So I'm thinking about finding a sister-in-law for my brothers.

501
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,800
I think you're the right person.

502
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Although you're way too common,

503
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,280
it's okay.

504
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,380
You're good at study, we can complement each other.

505
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,340
After all, there's not much like me at our school.

506
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,380
So it is happily decided.

507
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,060
I'll take you to see a movie tonight.

508
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,080
What's wrong with you?

509
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,900
Piss off quickly.

510
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,360
Lin Jingxiao.

511
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,640
You don't cherish the chance that I give to you.

512
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Who do you think you are?

513
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,260
I'm nobody.

514
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,240
Piss off.

515
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,220
Piss off.

516
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,860
Lin Jingxiao.

517
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,120
What's your identity? You dare turn me down?

518
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
You should look at yourself in the mirror.

519
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,680
You are such a rude person.

520
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,580
Who would like you?

521
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,420
I like her.

522
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,260
Why you are everywhere?

523
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,080
You have problem with that?

524
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,520
Let's go.

525
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,060
Are you okay?

526
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm okay.

527
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,720
Thank you for that.

528
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,400
You're a good friend.

529
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,080
You didn't drop away at the critical time.

530
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,120
Lin Jingxiao.

531
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,900
I planned to move you on Christmas.

532
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,800
It seems that I need to move you in advance.

533
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,380
Wait for me, don't leave.

534
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,580
I reached a star for you.

535
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,140
This is the unique Lin Jingxiao star

536
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,980
that I bought from the sky.

537
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,680
This star, whose number is Lin Jingxiao 520,

538
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,420
is called Lin Jingxiao star from now on.

539
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,980
I begged Jiang Chen to buy this from an American website.

540
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,860
I bought this two months ago.

541
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,280
The naming right of fixed stars that you bought,

542
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,860
is just a way of making money of the commercial corporation

543
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,980
by using a star's photo and a certificate.

544
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,920
Also,

545
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,340
this name is not admitted nor used by the astronomy community.

546
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,800
Then forget about it.

547
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
But,

548
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,580
thanks anyway.

549
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,360
Here, everyone.

550
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,440
The school released a notice,

551
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,860
that there will be a filming

552
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
by the TV station tomorrow at our school.

553
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,840
So there's no self-study class today,

554
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
the whole school will have a spring-cleaning.

555
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,080
Stop it.

556
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,680
Don't complain, it's not gonna work.

557
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,100
Monitor, please organize the cleaning.

558
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,100
I'll come back to check later.

559
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,980
Lin Jingxiao.

560
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,140
Why are you standing on the desk? Come down.

561
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,840
How dangerous!

562
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,880
Come down please.

563
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,800
I have heart disease. Don't scare me.

564
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,360
Chen Xiaoxi.

565
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,420
Go up.

566
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,800
Exchange with Lin Jingxiao.

567
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,040
Look at your height.

568
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,900
=COG: Center of Gravity.
Your COG is low, it's not easy for you to fall.

569
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,180
You've never been to such a height, right?

570
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,560
If you stand higher,

571
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,920
the scenery would be very beautiful.

572
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,040
Let me cut the crap, just go up.

573
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,040
Alright, alright.

574
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,980
Come down, I'll go up.

575
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,400
Use this.

576
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,220
You idiot.

577
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,780
Are you coming down or not?

578
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,880
Lu Yang. Chen Xiaoxi.

579
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,360
Get on to your work.

580
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,020
Guys, come over here. It's snowing.

581
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,660
It's snowing, come on!

582
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,160
It's snowing! It's snowing!

583
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,000
Fake snow.

584
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,540
Reaching for stars is more romantic than snowing, right?

585
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,060
It's you again!

586
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,320
Get down right now!

587
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:02,900
Get down.

588
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,120
Hurry up.

589
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,280
The teacher is here.

590
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,200
That's enough.

591
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,860
Who did this outside?

592
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
There are white garbages all over.

593
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Go out and clean them.

594
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,460
I didn't do it. Who did this should be responsible for it.

595
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,200
Only you have opinions?

596
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,840
Teacher, there's no need to clean them.

597
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,420
It's really snowing.

598
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,560
It's so cold.

599
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,640
You should wear it.

600
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm okay.

601
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,240
I won't wear it.

602
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,800
Alright.

603
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,020
Hold my bike.

604
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,320
It's mine.

605
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,780
I won't give it back to you.

606
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,480
It's mine!

607
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:39,980
Slow down.

608
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,120
Don't follow me.

609
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,720
It's so cold.

610
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,460
Wear it.

611
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,060
Or I'll be scolded later.

612
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,200
Jiang Chen.

613
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,300
I don't want to wear this scarf.

614
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,260
It's a gift from Li Wei.

615
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,360
It's from my mom.

616
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,300
Wait for me, Jiang Chen.

617
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,460
So you're the champion?

618
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,180
You're amazing, right?

619
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,600
So you can ignore the rules and regulations

620
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,200
and do whatever you want, right?

621
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,400
Report, director.

622
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,680
- No, I'm not. - I think you are.

623
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,360
You think you are great.

624
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
Then why don't you participate in the Olympics?

625
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,320
Soon.

626
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,280
I'll invite you to watch then.

627
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,760
You...

628
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,800
Just wait to see how I will punish you.

629
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,020
Is 300 push-ups will do?

630
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,840
I didn't ask you to do so.

631
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,960
Dad. Mom. I'm home.

632
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,680
You're back. Let's have dinner.

633
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,340
Come here, come here.

634
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,340
Where did you get this scarf?

635
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,540
Yeah, whose scarf it is?

636
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,180
Jiang Chen's.

637
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,280
It's his.

638
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,900
I thought it was someone else's.

639
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,720
Jiang Chen's.

640
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,300
Wash your hands.

641
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,660
Today I cooked a lot of dishes.

642
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,900
The eggs are good.

643
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,240
Merry Christmas!

644
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,720
=Dear chen is a nickname of Chen Xiaoxi's father.
Dearr chen

645
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,560
What does this mean?

646
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,560
Dear Chen.

647
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,960
It's for me.

648
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,620
You see this?

649
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,680
Don't be jealous. Don't be jealous.

650
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,320
Good morning, I've also got a gift for you.

651
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,720
What's this?

652
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,720
A bracelet.

653
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,340
But I accidentally made it too long last night.

654
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,220
It's a bit longer for a necklace.

655
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,060
Maybe,

656
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,660
you can use it as a belt.

657
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,720
It's good.

658
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,640
I can also use it to hang myself.

659
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,460
Jiang Chen, come over here.

660
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,700
I want to ask you about something.

661
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,460
Do you think there's something wrong

662
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
with our Xiaoxi recently?

663
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,980
Your daughter has never been normal.

664
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,620
Does she get close

665
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,500
with any of her male classmates?

666
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
She gets close with me everyday.

667
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,700
For example, does she talk much

668
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,180
with any of her male classmates at school?

669
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,620
And they would hang out together sometimes.

670
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,420
Me.

671
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,400
I'm wasting my time.

672
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,700
You're devoted all your time to studying.

673
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,280
Then why do you ask?

674
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,120
Off you go.

675
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,320
Goodbye, aunt.

676
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,020
Mom, what are you doing here?

677
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,300
Hurry up.

678
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,380
Jiang Chen is waiting for you.

679
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,740
Hurry up. He's been waiting for you for a long time. Go.

680
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,640
You're really waiting for me to go to school?

681
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,060
No, I'm not.
