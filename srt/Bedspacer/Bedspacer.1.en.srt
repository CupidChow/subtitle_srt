1
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:10,265
Your father took care of everything,
so don’t waste it.

2
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:27,157
If you need someone
to go with you to the doctor,

3
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,784
just call your father’s secretary.

4
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,242
Janice.

5
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,570
And...

6
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,188
choose your friends carefully.

7
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,891
Hi, neighbor. I'm Andrea.

8
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,081
Are you free tonight?

9
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,890
Party next door. Wanna go?

10
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,241
What’s taking you so long?

11
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,266
Oh.

12
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:45,724
What?

13
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,227
Come here!

14
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:50,547
That girl went viral.
She stabbed her teacher.

15
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,039
Are you sure?

16
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:54,743
Sorry, let’s just hang next time.

17
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,665
Bye! Sasha has a problem.

18
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,422
So, bye!

19
00:02:58,447 --> 00:02:59,447
Hurry up!

20
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,528
- Are you sure? Someone might be here.
- There’s no one here!

21
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,888
Keep quiet.
Someone might hear us.

22
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,067
No.

23
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,231
It’s safe here, promise.

24
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,785
Wait.

25
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,043
There’s someone here.

26
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,785
There’s no one.

27
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,535
Sure? We’re safe here?

28
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:48,395
Yeah...

29
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:02,167
You’re so sexy.

30
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,132
You’re so good.

31
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,020
Wait.

32
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,528
Wait. You’re so excited.

33
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,715
Yes!

34
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,106
Slower, please.

35
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:16,723
Shit!

36
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:18,312
Who’s that?

37
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,670
Is someone there?

38
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:23,634
Who?

39
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,868
There’s someone here.

40
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,689
Didn’t you hear it?

41
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,851
There's no one.

42
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,210
Shit, there’s someone here.

43
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:32,628
I saw a foot.

44
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,133
Who’s that?

45
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,259
Come out of there.
Who are you?

46
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,859
Sorry, I saw nothing.

47
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,573
Oh my god. It’s the new girl.

48
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,245
My god.

49
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,421
So annoying.

50
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,171
I told you!

51
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:28,250
Miss, are you okay?

52
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,304
I was just looking for the library.

53
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,682
You’re too serious.

54
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,593
This school is just one big club.

55
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,782
With rich kids who only
keep on partying.

56
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,847
The library is already closed.

57
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:56,843
By the way, what’s your name?

58
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:03,632
Janice.

59
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:07,343
Are you lost?

60
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,257
Do you like stars?

61
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:35,741
Have you ever thought of how small
we are compared to the galaxy?

62
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,167
Yes.

63
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,593
I always think of that.

64
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,296
Some look in every direction.

65
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,394
As for me,

66
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,992
I only look up.

67
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,603
What are you looking for up there?

68
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:01,785
I don’t know.

69
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,703
Something that’s not down here.

70
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:10,823
Me too.

71
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:15,786
But now, I just accept it.

72
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,476
Don’t worry, we’ll find it.

73
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:28,846
Hopefully.

74
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:38,806
I believe that if you want something,

75
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,773
really want it, you’ll find it.

76
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:54,073
Are you sure
you’re a security guard?

77
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,685
I’ve never met a security guard
who talks like that.

78
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,998
How many security guards
have you talked to?

79
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,718
Are they just like you?

80
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:11,654
I don’t know.

81
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:16,060
I just like to read.

82
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:20,060
That’s why even though
I’m not allowed in the library,

83
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,499
I slip books out.

84
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,076
I don’t want to be
a security guard forever.

85
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,058
What do you want to be?

86
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:42,420
Don’t laugh, okay?

87
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,371
Ever since I was a kid,

88
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,336
I’ve wanted to become a detective.

89
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,062
But maybe I’m just fooling myself.

90
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,801
It’s a good dream.

91
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,313
Tell that to my father.

92
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,441
But that’s just it,

93
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:09,987
maybe I’m just dreaming.

94
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:17,787
I’ll take you to your dorm.

95
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:48,834
Thanks.

96
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,703
I thought no boys after 10 PM?

97
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,745
You know the rich.

98
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,040
A little bribe...

99
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,102
and it's done.

100
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,483
No questions asked.

101
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,037
But that’s…

102
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:24,108
Sorry.

103
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,694
Are you okay?

104
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,944
Sorry, I didn’t mean to.

105
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:45,082
Can we try that again?

106
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,895
Maybe not now.

107
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:55,344
Are you feeling shy?

108
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,217
Maybe...

109
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:08,448
if you’ve found yourself
and still want to kiss me...

110
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,441
I'd think of myself
as a lucky guy.

111
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,872
Just get anything.
I’ll treat you.

112
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:12,917
Hey!

113
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,378
There’s a line.

114
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,311
- Oh, sorry, Ryan.
- I’ll just get half.

115
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:18,621
- Okay.
- How much is it?

116
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:19,814
Sorry about that.

117
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:24,010
Money cannot buy good manners.

118
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,659
Are you talking to me?

119
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:30,214
Of course, who else?

120
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,995
You don’t seem used
to meeting people.

121
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,002
They don’t like getting to know me.

122
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,945
Maybe that’s because
you don’t give them your name.

123
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,324
Wait, let me guess.

124
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,558
Ja—

125
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:53,648
Janice.

126
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,034
How did you—

127
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,676
You got me there.

128
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:09,638
Maybe you just stole that book.

129
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,575
And the real Janice
is now just a corpse.

130
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,145
Excuse me,

131
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,112
I’m the real Janice.

132
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,481
Alive, okay?

133
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:29,448
Everyone,

134
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:32,058
Janice.

135
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:33,932
Janice,

136
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,329
everyone.

137
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,590
We’ve met.

138
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,526
Sorry about what happened last night.

139
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,153
Last night?

140
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:51,565
- Why?
- She’s talking about…

141
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:53,299
What happened last night?

142
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,492
She’s talking about that...

143
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:58,020
I know what she’s talking about.
Just shut up.

144
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:06,698
- So guys, have you seen this video?
- So you were just here!

145
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:09,191
- What does this mean, huh?
- This was a long time ago.

146
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:14,244
But the news is,
she’s now enrolled in our school.

147
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,136
I’m not talking to you!
Who are you?

148
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,232
What are you talking about, Sash?

149
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,003
She’s right in front of you.

150
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,142
I swear to God, Andi!

151
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,698
Sorry, you know I’m dyslexic.

152
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:27,323
I thought we were eating lunch together?

153
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:28,823
Look!

154
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:30,449
Don’t.

155
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,972
Let me go! Let me go, I said!

156
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:42,014
- I trusted you. But you betrayed me.
- Is this you, Janice?

157
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,619
Of course, it’s her, Ryan.

158
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,339
Isn’t it obvious?

159
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:56,425
Watch the video carefully
and look at her closely.

160
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,246
What do you see?

161
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:02,715
The psycho-freak
you invited to our table.

162
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,690
Hey, Sash! Stop it!

163
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,287
Not cool.

164
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,101
You think stabbing a teacher is cool?

165
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,932
Come on, Ryan!

166
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,909
She stays at our dorm.

167
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:19,893
Aren’t you worried she’d suddenly
stab your friends in their sleep?

168
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:28,547
Is this really you, Janice?

169
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:33,038
See?

170
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Look.

171
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:37,667
Look at those crazy eyes.

172
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,292
Where’s the guard?

173
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:42,456
Mr. Guard, there’s a crazy person here.

174
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:44,146
That’s enough!

175
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,386
Don’t you see she’s scared?

176
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:52,456
You’re like mad dogs.

177
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:55,397
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

178
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,417
Is there a lost Barbie here?

179
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:00,378
Who even are you?

180
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,980
I’m just her fairy godmother.

181
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:10,744
And I’m going to stick this phone
so far up your ass

182
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,870
you’d need to fart just to text.

183
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:22,204
Hey, are you okay?

184
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,998
Wow!

185
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,279
Luncheon meat.

186
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:20,735
I like that too.

187
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:23,193
Don’t you know how to knock?

188
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:26,524
Why do I need to knock
to enter my own room?

189
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:30,868
This is my room.

190
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:34,975
Well, it’s our room now.

191
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:46,052
You ran away before
I got to introduce myself.

192
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,721
I’m Lexi.

193
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:57,841
Lexi Mentirosa.

194
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:06,303
Sorry.

195
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,681
It’s okay.

196
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,115
I also like luncheon meat.

197
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:29,647
Go change.

198
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,599
Why?

199
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,356
Does it look bad?

200
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:43,049
It looks good.

201
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:45,679
Perfect…

202
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:48,674
For a prayer meeting.

203
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,699
There’s an event
at a club I’m going to.

204
00:28:58,575 --> 00:28:59,575
Club?

205
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:00,961
Yeah.

206
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,379
Sorry, I don’t drink.

207
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:06,006
Well,

208
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,178
just come.

209
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:09,127
It’s useless to argue with me.

210
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:10,515
Here.

211
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,388
But this looks nice.

212
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,235
Do you think Ryan will be there?

213
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:37,572
Forget about Ryan.

214
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:39,490
And those low lives.

215
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,373
As Gabriella Silang said,

216
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,364
“Fuck them!”

217
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,393
Not true.

218
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,629
She did not say it,
but she felt it.

219
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:54,145
Okay.

220
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:03,336
You’re funny.

221
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:14,299
You look beautiful and sexy.

222
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,656
Stop that.

223
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,173
Hey, what is that?

224
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,131
Relax.

225
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:35,617
It’s “Icarus”. For those
that want to fly.

226
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,452
Won’t we get caught, Lexi?

227
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:39,968
We won’t.

228
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:42,246
Don’t worry. I know these guys.

229
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:46,082
The line is long.

230
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,023
We can’t just skip ahead.

231
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:49,003
No pushing!

232
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:50,741
Hey, ma’am Lexi!
Good evening!

233
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:51,766
Please come in.

234
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:54,592
Hold on. Where’s your invite?

235
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:20,460
Dance!

236
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:21,882
Let’s dance!

237
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:24,765
I look bad, Lexi.

238
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:26,866
You’re beautiful.

239
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:30,541
Just think you’re the most
beautiful person at this club.

240
00:31:33,214 --> 00:31:35,023
- The usual.
- Yes, ma’am.

241
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:52,241
- Hi, girls.
- Hi!

242
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,968
[whispers]

243
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:57,092
Wait here.

244
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:25,886
Babe!

245
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,119
- Hi!
- Hi! How are you?

246
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:31,304
- I'm good.
- You look so gorgeous!

247
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,624
- Thank you!
- Are you with someone?

248
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,265
Yeah!

249
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:41,991
She’s beautiful
but she looks like a prude.

250
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:44,284
Can I borrow him?

251
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:45,769
Sure, he’s yours!

252
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:47,351
Thank you!

253
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:08,624
Just drink this.

254
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,358
Is this “Icarus”?

255
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:14,275
Wings.

256
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:17,921
No. I’m good here
on the ground.

257
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:20,843
The view is better from up high.

258
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:56,506
Kiss! Kiss!

259
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:58,756
Janice, let’s go!

260
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:02,170
But we just got here.

261
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,975
Wooh! Party!

262
00:34:09,374 --> 00:34:11,174
Let’s go! Let’s go!

263
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,530
Wait.

264
00:34:13,674 --> 00:34:17,030
Lexi, why are we running?

265
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,064
I’ll explain it to you later.

266
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:22,694
I still want to dance, Lexi.

267
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:25,920
Just tell me why.

268
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:28,436
We’re not safe here.

269
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,498
Why aren’t we safe here?

270
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:32,538
We’re just dancing.

271
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:35,428
Damn it.

272
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:38,755
Who’s that?

273
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:41,561
And why is his jacket so yellow?

274
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,959
- Looks like a banana.
- He’s my ex.

275
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:48,702
So, stay focused,
because we need to get out of here.

276
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:51,928
Let’s go!

277
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:58,811
- Who do you like among those girls, dude?
- Samantha!

278
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:09,225
Why are we running?

279
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:14,514
You’re crazy too, huh?

280
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:18,128
That’s right.

281
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:19,635
I’m crazy.

282
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:27,889
Dependent personality disorder
plus obsessive love disorder.

283
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:29,583
So, you’re taking meds?

284
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:40,777
You want that?

285
00:35:54,975 --> 00:36:00,108
[laughing, chattering]

286
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:04,663
Hey. Where is it?

287
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:10,622
Our dorm is gone. Where is it?

288
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,084
Ladies,

289
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:13,678
are you okay?

290
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:18,092
We’re okay,
nothing going on here.

291
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,817
Nothing going on here.

292
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:23,116
What are you saying?

293
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:29,880
Oh, it’s Miss Janice.

294
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,163
I know him, Lexi.

295
00:36:33,188 --> 00:36:34,514
It’s Mr. Guard.

296
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:36,865
The one who likes stars.

297
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,499
Crazy.

298
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:47,100
- Ma'am, let me help you.
- No need. We’re good.

299
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,983
- We’re good.
- We’ve got it.

300
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,684
I told you I’ll help.

301
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:14,053
Hey.

302
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,505
Easy now.

303
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:19,075
You’re planning something
once we get to the room.

304
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:24,256
Ma’am Lexi, I could never
do that to ma’am Janice.

305
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:29,083
Mr. Guard won’t do that, Lexi.

306
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:33,045
He wants to become a detective one day.

307
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,117
Right?

308
00:37:34,654 --> 00:37:35,738
Really?

309
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:37,686
You’re serious?

310
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:44,752
I think anyone can do it
as long as they work hard.

311
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:50,186
Hard worker?

312
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:04,425
I’ll go ahead.

313
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:07,264
Make her drink lots of water, okay?

314
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:08,436
Good night then.

315
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,762
And where are you going?

316
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:35,428
What are you doing?

317
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:52,163
I want to do it

318
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,487
and you’re the only one up.

319
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,103
That will cost you.

320
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,653
Do you want cash?

321
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,552
Or will a blow job do?

322
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:13,169
That works.

323
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,936
Both.

324
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:51,212
Are you okay?

325
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:53,130
Is there a problem?

326
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:55,942
Nothing.

327
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,366
Don’t mind me.

328
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,327
Want to join in?

329
00:41:02,348 --> 00:41:04,642
No, thanks. I’m saving my virginity.

330
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:16,351
My thanks for last night.

331
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:29,975
I’ve never felt
like that in my life. Really!

332
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:35,440
It just feels right!

333
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:52,242
You’ve got a lot more to learn.

334
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,479
Just stick with me.

335
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,268
Tell me about Ryan.

336
00:45:12,153 --> 00:45:13,636
It’s nothing.

337
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:16,948
He was just being friendly.

338
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:20,717
But you know,

339
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,013
I like his smile.

340
00:45:25,925 --> 00:45:27,456
Oh my god!

341
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:29,464
You do like him.

342
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:30,901
Admit it.

343
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:31,950
Admit it!

344
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:33,846
You want to kiss him, huh?

345
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,822
Is he the one
you’ll give your virginity to?

346
00:45:39,847 --> 00:45:41,940
Okay, fine. I like him.

347
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:44,295
But,

348
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:51,424
I can’t do anything
because he’s so famous.

349
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:57,612
While I’m… me.

350
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:03,284
And what’s wrong with that?

351
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:08,112
What you need is
more confidence in yourself.

352
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:12,323
I’ll take care of you.

353
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:28,854
The secret to get their attention

354
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:34,159
is through what I call the “A I M”.

355
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:38,471
“A” is to “Assault with quantity”.

356
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:41,762
Wherever they are,
wherever they are looking,

357
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,831
whatever they are doing,
get their attention.

358
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,956
“I” is to “Impress with quality”.

359
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:53,706
Show them your value.

360
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:59,705
Once they see your worth,
they’ll be dying to get you.

361
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:07,645
And “M” is for
“Maintaining your flexibility”.

362
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,126
Become a snake.

363
00:47:10,788 --> 00:47:17,795
Be ready to adapt
to any situation and then strike.

364
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,243
No...

365
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,573
I want to save my virginity.

366
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,352
Okay.

367
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:44,347
Then do this.

368
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:36,742
What does your tattoo mean?

369
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:39,650
Nothing.

370
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:43,827
It just means I was
once young and stupid.

371
00:51:46,413 --> 00:51:48,332
Does this have something to do with Gio?

372
00:51:50,665 --> 00:51:52,829
There’s nothing to talk about.

373
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:56,196
I don’t want to look back.

374
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,258
I want to focus on the present.

375
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:01,719
With you.

376
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:05,430
Why? Is Gio hurting you Lexi?

377
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:08,867
My god, Janice!

378
00:52:09,134 --> 00:52:10,969
Why don’t you just drop it?

379
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:18,469
Because if someone important
to you gets hurt,

380
00:52:18,494 --> 00:52:20,376
you shouldn’t let it go.

381
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:24,649
He beats me, okay?

382
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:28,876
He hurts me,
then beats me again.

383
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:35,359
He slams my head to the wall
to force his dick in my ass,

384
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,391
while my nose is still bleeding.

385
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:38,762
Is that it?

386
00:52:38,968 --> 00:52:40,634
Is that what you wanted to hear?

387
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,199
Happy?

388
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:03,002
Of course, I’m not happy.

389
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,055
I didn’t want to stress you.

390
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:13,055
But if that’s happening to you,
we need to report him to the police.

391
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:18,044
The problem with you is,
you’re so far from reality.

392
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:22,796
That’s unfair.

393
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,179
What's unfair?

394
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:30,915
Is it fair that I met Gio that one time
I was washing up at a gasoline station?

395
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,360
Handsome.

396
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:34,807
Bad boy.

397
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:36,393
My type.

398
00:53:36,971 --> 00:53:38,696
Until I got tired of him.

399
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,973
I thought he was
my ticket out of here.

400
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,383
I’m here to protect you.

401
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,483
So, if I see Gio—

402
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:54,508
What?

403
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:58,166
You’ll wave scissors at him,
break down, and cry?

404
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:08,215
Sorry.

405
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:10,287
Come here.

406
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:12,915
I'm sorry.

407
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:15,381
I didn’t mean it.

408
00:54:18,646 --> 00:54:21,506
You wanted to know
what my tattoo meant, right?

409
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:26,310
I have a brother,
his name is James.

410
00:54:27,743 --> 00:54:30,295
We got separated
when we were children.

411
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:37,295
I don’t know where he is,
or if he’s still alive.

412
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,349
I was going to look for him,
but then Gio happened…

413
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:56,947
I’ll help you.

414
00:55:10,828 --> 00:55:13,490
Let’s talk about this later, okay?

415
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:18,387
We’ve still got plans for tonight.
Someone’s waiting for you.

416
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:20,825
Okay!

417
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:21,974
Knock knock.

418
00:55:22,148 --> 00:55:23,148
Who’s there?

419
00:55:23,631 --> 00:55:25,599
Lexi Mentirosa.

420
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:27,069
Too bad.

421
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:29,029
I thought it was Janice.

422
00:55:32,824 --> 00:55:34,631
It’s Janice, then.

423
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,702
It's so good.

424
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:14,106
Shit.

425
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,904
Shit.

426
00:56:20,732 --> 00:56:21,732
Wow.

427
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:24,347
Shit.

428
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:27,292
Shit, it's cold!

429
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:29,497
Shit.

430
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:34,888
Damn...

431
00:56:47,283 --> 00:56:48,521
Shit.

432
00:56:52,657 --> 00:56:54,107
Damn...

433
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:55,132
Shit.

434
00:57:52,223 --> 00:57:53,223
Are you okay?

435
00:58:34,498 --> 00:58:36,159
Mimicry in the animal kingdom

436
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:38,877
is an evolved resemblance
between an organism and...

437
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:06,667
Are you okay? Lexi!

438
01:04:10,683 --> 01:04:11,803
Excuse me.

439
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:16,957
She seems familiar.

440
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:18,666
Who is she?

441
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:19,745
Hi Janice!

442
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,413
- Hi!
- Have you seen this girl?

443
01:04:23,623 --> 01:04:24,666
Who’s that?

444
01:04:26,146 --> 01:04:28,220
I told you, man. That’s Lexi!

445
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:29,608
Right, bro!

446
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:33,216
That’s not Lexi!

447
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,729
That’s Jenny!

448
01:04:35,463 --> 01:04:37,060
I’m sure I’m not wrong.

449
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:43,759
Hey!

450
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:46,636
- You?
- I'm getting goosebumps, bro.

451
01:04:46,661 --> 01:04:48,065
Do you know this girl?

452
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:53,159
Sorry, I’m going to be late for class.

453
01:04:54,697 --> 01:04:57,175
I’m talking to you.
Don’t try to avoid me!

454
01:04:57,406 --> 01:04:59,150
I’ll say it again for you.

455
01:05:00,531 --> 01:05:02,229
Do you know this girl?

456
01:05:02,771 --> 01:05:03,830
No.

457
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,526
She’s not familiar.

458
01:05:08,188 --> 01:05:10,231
Hey, you’re hurting me.

459
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:13,385
And I could do even worse
if you don’t answer me.

460
01:05:20,274 --> 01:05:21,455
She’s my girlfriend.

461
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,541
Jenny.

462
01:05:24,781 --> 01:05:25,909
She’s missing.

463
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:27,729
Have you seen her?

464
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:33,650
No.

465
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:36,362
I’ve never seen her in my life.

466
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:51,209
Here.

467
01:05:51,918 --> 01:05:54,284
Call me if you see that girl.

468
01:06:42,468 --> 01:06:44,518
Hello? Lexi?

469
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:45,620
Janice?

470
01:06:45,832 --> 01:06:47,300
Are you in there?

471
01:06:47,752 --> 01:06:51,182
Let’s go drinking in Sasha’s room.
Bring some “Icarus”.

472
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:14,854
You found me.

473
01:07:17,462 --> 01:07:19,840
I didn’t know you were hiding.

474
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:23,479
Thank you for last night.

475
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:28,185
These past few days have been confusing.

476
01:07:31,145 --> 01:07:35,525
I don’t know if it’s because of the drugs.

477
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:39,675
But you’re right,

478
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,783
I’m not myself.

479
01:07:47,928 --> 01:07:49,263
I saw Gio.

480
01:07:52,957 --> 01:07:54,208
You talked?

481
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:02,431
Yes... Jenny.

482
01:08:05,553 --> 01:08:06,553
Sorry.

483
01:08:07,242 --> 01:08:08,284
Now you know.

484
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:10,869
I don’t.

485
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:12,964
All I know is...

486
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:16,564
it doesn’t matter to me.

487
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:21,569
We need to talk.

488
01:11:49,902 --> 01:11:52,029
Now that you know I’m not Lexi,

489
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,160
will you think differently of me?

490
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:23,714
If you’re not ready to tell me
everything that’s happening,

491
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,322
I’ll wait.

492
01:12:36,304 --> 01:12:39,213
I’ll wait until you can trust me.

493
01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:50,792
From now on, you are my life.

494
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,749
I’ll give everything for you, Lexi.

495
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,130
Thank you for the dress.

496
01:13:18,155 --> 01:13:21,446
I want to celebrate
with my girlfriend.

497
01:13:25,521 --> 01:13:26,647
Girlfriend?

498
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,172
Get used to being my girlfriend.

499
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,752
This tattoo is so beautiful.

500
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:45,809
Its meaning too.

501
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,088
But it’s fading.

502
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:52,049
Then let’s get it retouched.

503
01:13:53,402 --> 01:13:55,002
- Now?
- Yeah.

504
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:04,327
How about you?

505
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,689
Maybe you want a tattoo.

506
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:07,413
Since you’re already here.

507
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:09,975
Why not?

508
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:13,401
Can I get the same one
as my girlfriend's?

509
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,487
Sure! Let’s get started.

510
01:14:41,784 --> 01:14:42,784
Does it hurt?

511
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:45,486
A bit.

512
01:14:45,738 --> 01:14:47,213
But it hurts in a good way.

513
01:14:47,922 --> 01:14:51,079
The kind of hurt
that reminds you you’re still alive.

514
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:54,370
Good kind or bad kind,

515
01:14:54,549 --> 01:14:56,448
all you need is one round.

516
01:14:59,523 --> 01:15:01,192
Are we selling tonight?

517
01:15:02,135 --> 01:15:04,924
No, not today.

518
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,457
Tonight is for us.

519
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:17,751
Hold on.

520
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:42,791
Hey, George! You’re here! Hello.

521
01:16:43,863 --> 01:16:45,767
Wanna go?

522
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:48,619
Okay. Let’s go to another bar.
It’s boring here.

523
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,876
- We’re going to another bar! Bye!
- Hey!

524
01:17:01,298 --> 01:17:02,298
You again?

525
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:04,336
You know what?
It’s hot in here.

526
01:17:04,361 --> 01:17:05,571
Why don’t we go out?

527
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:07,834
It’s cold outside.

528
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:08,859
Come here.

529
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:10,462
Let’s go out.

530
01:17:11,884 --> 01:17:12,884
Let’s go out.

531
01:17:14,799 --> 01:17:15,799
Hey.

532
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,634
I can be whoever you want me to be.

533
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:22,483
Let’s go?

534
01:18:10,073 --> 01:18:11,073
No!

535
01:18:25,297 --> 01:18:27,925
You’re hurting me! Hey!

536
01:20:33,091 --> 01:20:34,343
What the?

537
01:20:48,607 --> 01:20:49,918
Good morning!

538
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,664
Lex! Lex, wake up!

539
01:21:36,339 --> 01:21:37,360
Oh my god.

540
01:21:37,385 --> 01:21:39,456
Yeah, I know,
same reaction.

541
01:21:41,152 --> 01:21:42,152
Yuck!

542
01:21:47,999 --> 01:21:48,999
Hey girl!

543
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:51,339
I like your new look!

544
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:53,496
So on point.

545
01:21:54,558 --> 01:21:56,667
- But she looks like…
- I know!

546
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:58,611
Look, J,

547
01:21:58,985 --> 01:22:00,284
about last night.

548
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:03,393
Nothing happened between me and Ryan.

549
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:06,143
We were waiting for you.

550
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,589
I wanted to surprise you.

551
01:22:09,984 --> 01:22:11,018
Look, Lexi.

552
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:14,176
Ryan isn’t my boyfriend.

553
01:22:15,683 --> 01:22:17,885
And you don’t need to explain yourself.

554
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,290
Janice The Menace here.

555
01:22:31,315 --> 01:22:33,565
And this is a hostile takeover.

556
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:38,167
I hereby decree that
“Get Fucked to Get Fucked” is dead.

557
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:41,042
Get ready for
“Icarus Falls, Phoenix Rises”.

558
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:44,948
Who’s going to win
and what would you be left with?

559
01:22:45,174 --> 01:22:47,487
The old queen is dead.

560
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:50,378
Long live the new queen.

561
01:22:50,881 --> 01:22:52,408
Janice Hueco,

562
01:22:52,992 --> 01:22:54,369
be my date tonight.

563
01:22:54,628 --> 01:22:56,255
Let’s morning the night.

564
01:22:57,527 --> 01:22:58,862
Just the two of us.

565
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:02,806
Why do we need to find
a new place to have sex in?

566
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:05,010
The rooftop isn’t safe anymore, duh.

567
01:23:05,035 --> 01:23:07,079
Can’t we just do it in our room?

568
01:23:07,128 --> 01:23:08,921
That’s too boring.

569
01:23:11,942 --> 01:23:13,877
Fine! Whatever!

570
01:23:14,335 --> 01:23:17,354
Are we going to Janice’s party tonight?

571
01:23:18,235 --> 01:23:19,691
Screw that crazy bitch!

572
01:23:19,716 --> 01:23:22,385
I PM-ed my followers not to go.

573
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,686
Okay, fine.

574
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:50,901
Shit!

575
01:23:57,421 --> 01:23:59,464
Let me borrow
your outfit tonight okay?

576
01:24:00,877 --> 01:24:03,112
We share everything, don’t we?

577
01:24:03,895 --> 01:24:04,895
Janice,

578
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,623
sorry about Ryan.

579
01:24:11,398 --> 01:24:13,609
Do you think this is about Ryan?

580
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:20,291
J.

581
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:24,147
Don’t call me "J".

582
01:24:28,622 --> 01:24:31,298
Not after what you did to me.

583
01:24:33,622 --> 01:24:35,870
So, what do you want me to call you?

584
01:24:42,556 --> 01:24:44,221
Come to the party tonight.

585
01:24:44,268 --> 01:24:46,189
I have a surprise for you.

586
01:24:46,794 --> 01:24:48,661
Don’t go through with the party.

587
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:50,006
Please.

588
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,018
Why?

589
01:24:57,221 --> 01:24:59,807
Are you scared
that I’ll replace you?

590
01:25:52,566 --> 01:26:00,518
[chattering]

591
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:03,721
I've never been caught
but I always get a 0.

592
01:26:08,318 --> 01:26:09,384
Where are they?

593
01:26:09,568 --> 01:26:10,568
It’s still early.

594
01:26:25,151 --> 01:26:26,361
Hey guys!

595
01:26:26,718 --> 01:26:28,386
Are you enjoying yourselves?

596
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,420
No "wings"?

597
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:33,317
Where’s Lexi?

598
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,113
This party sucks!

599
01:26:41,457 --> 01:26:42,457
Let’s go.

600
01:27:36,991 --> 01:27:37,991
Miss Janice?

601
01:27:39,285 --> 01:27:40,285
Is that you?

602
01:27:44,318 --> 01:27:45,580
You look different.

603
01:27:47,627 --> 01:27:50,651
Different but familiar.

604
01:27:51,301 --> 01:27:52,301
Fine,

605
01:27:53,745 --> 01:27:55,075
I’m Lexi.

606
01:27:57,393 --> 01:27:59,072
Isn’t that your plan?

607
01:28:00,934 --> 01:28:04,362
Just give me a cigarette.
I need it.

608
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:11,081
What’s the problem?

609
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:13,661
I thought you had a grand party?

610
01:28:15,611 --> 01:28:16,753
Yeah,

611
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,760
but I feel like I’m still faking it.

612
01:28:22,057 --> 01:28:23,737
No matter what I do.

613
01:28:24,143 --> 01:28:25,932
Even when I give it all.

614
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:30,378
I’m still not that bitch Lexi Mentirosa.

615
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:35,549
I’m never going to be her.

616
01:28:36,848 --> 01:28:40,685
You don’t need to be anyone else.

617
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,196
But yourself.

618
01:28:46,766 --> 01:28:48,101
Janice Hueco.

619
01:28:59,424 --> 01:29:00,721
What’s the problem?

620
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:06,917
Am I still ugly, or is it
because I’m not Lexi?

621
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:08,010
No.

622
01:29:11,964 --> 01:29:14,466
It’s just that you haven’t found
what you’re looking for.

623
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:20,417
You are still that lost girl
I walked back to the dorm.

624
01:29:20,683 --> 01:29:22,846
Looking for answers in the stars.

625
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,206
Then, I should’ve just gone home.

626
01:29:37,033 --> 01:29:38,206
Anyway,

627
01:29:40,015 --> 01:29:42,354
your room seems pretty full.

628
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:44,586
Why?

629
01:29:45,237 --> 01:29:51,823
I saw Lexi and… was it “Ryan”?
They were walking together earlier.

630
01:30:42,862 --> 01:30:47,565
So, why did you make me record
that video inviting Janice?

631
01:30:48,136 --> 01:30:51,010
I thought you were my girlfriend.

632
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:57,104
Boys fight wars
with sticks and stones.

633
01:30:57,689 --> 01:30:59,431
We girls are different.

634
01:31:00,186 --> 01:31:01,186
We’re sly.

635
01:31:02,525 --> 01:31:04,377
Are you calling me basic?

636
01:31:08,033 --> 01:31:15,401
You left Janice and flirted with me
just for a pair of shoes.

637
01:31:19,768 --> 01:31:23,596
These are limited Air Jordans,
so they’re worth it.

638
01:31:31,377 --> 01:31:32,784
Shit!

639
01:31:35,384 --> 01:31:36,791
My shoes.

640
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:40,161
Why does Janice like this?

641
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:42,798
It’s cheap shit.

642
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:45,338
I thought she was rich.

643
01:31:48,094 --> 01:31:52,010
You know what the difference is between
a good luncheon meat and brand x.

644
01:31:53,321 --> 01:31:54,321
Of course.

645
01:31:54,682 --> 01:31:57,706
The expensive one tastes better.

646
01:32:02,103 --> 01:32:04,331
Only the packaging is different.

647
01:32:06,471 --> 01:32:10,721
If you don’t know
which one is brand x,

648
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,526
you’ll just keep eating whichever.

649
01:32:20,594 --> 01:32:22,330
I don’t know what you mean.

650
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,471
I’m just saying,

651
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:37,190
calling something one thing
doesn’t make it true if it’s not.

652
01:32:38,193 --> 01:32:44,282
But you can trick people
into swallowing just anything.

653
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:52,392
But, Janice, no matter how much
she dresses up, she’s damaged goods.

654
01:32:54,415 --> 01:32:55,833
She’s cheap.

655
01:36:01,713 --> 01:36:04,516
Jenny!

656
01:36:05,853 --> 01:36:08,363
I know you’re here!

657
01:36:10,073 --> 01:36:14,846
I can still smell your wet pussy.

658
01:36:18,658 --> 01:36:20,714
Jenny!

659
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,530
Janice, drop that.

660
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:45,241
You can’t hurt me.

661
01:36:45,336 --> 01:36:46,336
Why not?

662
01:36:48,162 --> 01:36:50,262
We share everything don’t we?

663
01:36:52,329 --> 01:36:58,077
Hair, tattoo, boys, bed.

664
01:37:00,282 --> 01:37:02,993
I also just want to share
these scissors with you.

665
01:37:03,623 --> 01:37:05,249
You’re not yourself.

666
01:37:12,036 --> 01:37:14,705
Have you forgotten, Jenny?

667
01:37:15,764 --> 01:37:18,385
I’m that girl from the video, remember?

668
01:37:26,193 --> 01:37:35,193
My whole life I’ve been on my knees
in this unforgiving world.

669
01:37:36,387 --> 01:37:37,387
Fine.

670
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,090
Do it.

671
01:37:40,706 --> 01:37:41,957
Kill me.

672
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:50,111
I love you, J.

673
01:37:51,769 --> 01:37:53,264
I hope you know that.

674
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:53,362
Wait for me at the gym.

675
01:38:53,935 --> 01:38:55,436
At the forest area.

676
01:38:57,037 --> 01:39:00,239
Everything important to me is here.

677
01:39:01,727 --> 01:39:03,479
I’ll just clean up this mess.

678
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,581
I’ll be waiting.

679
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:18,616
Promise, after this mess,
we can escape to paradise.

680
01:41:39,781 --> 01:41:41,073
Ryan is dead.

681
01:41:41,579 --> 01:41:43,155
Janice is dead.

682
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:45,079
And Gio is in prison.

683
01:41:46,746 --> 01:41:48,576
Guess who’s the hero.

684
01:41:52,882 --> 01:41:55,139
Freedom is fought for.

685
01:41:56,599 --> 01:42:00,196
But now, we are free.

686
01:42:03,998 --> 01:42:05,720
So where do you
plan to go to now?

687
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,780
Can you help me look for my brother?

688
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:15,939
Of course.

689
01:42:17,568 --> 01:42:18,966
That’s my promise to you.

690
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,570
But we need to move.

691
01:42:38,412 --> 01:42:40,326
The police are looking for you.

692
01:42:41,146 --> 01:42:42,562
Don’t worry.

693
01:42:42,951 --> 01:42:44,642
Just trust me.

694
01:42:48,108 --> 01:42:49,510
Yes, Miss Lexi.

695
01:42:50,813 --> 01:42:52,897
Call me Janice.
