00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,375
Motel

2
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,884
My name is Kang Min-hee.

3
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,042
I'm 22 years old.

4
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,484
I’m studying Fine Arts at Korea University.

5
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,255
Now is the prime of my life.

6
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:37,142
But there's one secret I have.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,184
I will share my secret with you now.

8
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:09,975
Mom's Boyfriend
Director's Cut

9
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,892
I love it.

10
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,434
Min-hee.

11
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,267
Min-hee.

12
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,850
- Dad.
- Yeah?

13
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,505
It feels so good.

14
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:25,142
I want it harder.

15
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,892
Harder!

16
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,392
Do you like it?

17
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:29,642
How is the water temperature?

18
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,059
Is it warm?

19
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,434
It's just perfect.

20
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,434
Turn around.

21
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:49,642
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

22
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,517
I'm almost done now.

23
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,225
Turn around.

24
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,875
Turn around.

25
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,809
Are you in a hurry to go somewhere?

26
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:29,571
Did you forget about it?

27
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,874
I’m meeting the person you
introduced to me last time.

28
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:34,634
Oh, right.

29
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:36,573
Was that today?

30
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,809
Min-hee.

31
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,892
Whenever you call me 'dad',

32
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,402
it feels awkward.

33
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:49,101
But I want to call you 'dad'.

34
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:51,952
I'll get going first.

35
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,857
You can come later.

36
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,094
Bye then.

37
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:01,904
Alright.

38
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,850
Bye.

39
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:27,987
Excuse me.

40
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,077
Are you Cheol-min?

41
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,457
That's me, nice to meet you.

42
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,107
- Are you Min-hee?
- Yes

43
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm sorry for being late.

44
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,916
Don't worry about it.

45
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:42,007
- Shall we go inside?
- Sure.

46
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,662
This is Lee Cheol-min.

47
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,784
He teaches physical education at my school.

48
00:08:56,848 --> 00:09:00,181
He also works as a personal trainer.

49
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,875
I'm Cheol-min,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

50
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:07,742
- I look forward training with you.
- Thank you.

51
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:11,013
This is my mom.

52
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:13,507
Her name is Yun Hyeon-jeong.

53
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:17,392
She is an interior designer.

54
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,709
She has quite a reputation in her field.

55
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:25,934
She’s currently working at home
to prepare for her solo exhibition.

56
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:30,698
Min-hee, isn’t this a little too abrupt?

57
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,814
Come on, mom.

58
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,700
This is your problem.

59
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,422
You work too much.

60
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,392
You've been overworking yourself
preparing for the exhibition.

61
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,934
Don't you know how worried I am about you?

62
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:51,559
And also...

63
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:56,059
You need to be in good
shape to succeed at work

64
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,624
I know that.

65
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:01,937
But I don't think
a personal trainer is necessary.

66
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:07,111
Too bad, but I’ve already
paid him for a month,

67
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,069
and he doesn’t offer refunds

68
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:12,556
Mr. Cheol-min.

69
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:16,059
Am I not right about what I said?

70
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,867
- Right?
- Of course.

71
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:23,934
Isn't my mom beautiful?

72
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,350
Yes, she is.

73
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:26,850
- Right?
- Yes.

74
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,475
She's very beautiful.

75
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,184
Be quiet.

76
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,975
Get prepared tor training now.

77
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,850
We're starting from today.

78
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,017
- Am I not right?
- That's right.

79
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:41,059
Come on.

80
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,017
Mom, look at you.

81
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:03,684
You're still in great shape.

82
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:06,434
- Stop teasing me.
- I'm not teasing you.

83
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,951
I didn't know you had such a good shape.

84
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,290
You look like a mistress.

85
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,312
Right, Mr. Cheol-min?

86
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:17,932
That's right.

87
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,453
You’ve really kept in great shape.

88
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:21,985
I'm flattered.

89
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,850
- Please come here.
- Okay.

90
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,592
Bend down.

91
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:35,200
- Face this way.
- Like this?

92
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,225
Stretch your legs back.

93
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,392
Straighten your back.

94
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:43,600
Spread your arms shoulder-width apart.

95
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:46,767
What do you think?

96
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,892
About what?

97
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,559
Do you think the training helps?

98
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,434
Isn't that a bit too early to ask
when I’ve only trained for two days?

99
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,975
But...

100
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:03,975
I feel like my stiff neck
is better than before.

101
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,767
Really?

102
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,934
Seems like he's a good trainer.

103
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:15,142
So don't skip classes
and make sure you train everyday.

104
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,267
Thank you, my daughter.

105
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,392
It's okay.

106
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,684
I know it was tough
raising me on your own.

107
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,642
I should be the one saying thank you.

108
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:30,934
- I love you.
- I love you more.

109
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,892
Thank you.

110
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,392
For what?

111
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:57,026
For introducing me to Mr. Cheol-min.

112
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,259
How was he?

113
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:02,017
I think he's pretty good.

114
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,392
He's quite handsome too.

115
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,350
Have you fallen for him?

116
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:11,299
Are you being jealous right now?

117
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:12,907
No, I'm not.

118
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,934
I'm just saying.

119
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,042
Anyways, thank you
for introducing him to me.

120
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,360
Since I'm thankful,
would you like a special service?

121
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,017
Again?

122
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:28,225
Yes, again.

123
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,934
- Return to the first pose.
- Okay.

124
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:41,660
Good.

125
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:45,392
Spread your arms shoulder width.

126
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:48,392
Tense your arms and hold.

127
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,392
Tighten your abs.

128
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:54,350
Can you feel the tension
in your lower back?

129
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:55,825
- Yes.
- Good.

130
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,209
Next, lift your right leg high up.

131
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,267
Straighten your legs.

132
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,392
Two, three, four, and five.

133
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,559
- Can you hold it?
- Yes.

134
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,017
You're doing great.

135
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:16,642
One, two, three, four, and five.

136
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,059
Now relax.

137
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:23,392
This time, the opposite leg.

138
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:29,392
One, two, three, four, and five.

139
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,517
Relax.

140
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,725
One moment.

141
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,434
Can you feel tension in your arms?

142
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:40,267
- Yes.
- Good.

143
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,725
This time, you will lower your body.

144
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,392
Extend your arms straight forward.

145
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:48,017
- Like this?
- Yes.

146
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,559
Pull your chin up.

147
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,059
Extend your arms.

148
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,934
Think that you're stretching
your whole body.

149
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:58,184
Now lean forward.

150
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,157
Don't lift your butt.

151
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,392
Like this?

152
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,767
Relax your body, how's your back?

153
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,184
- It's alright.
- Good.

154
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:13,392
Can you hold this pose?

155
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:17,017
- You alright?
- Yes.

156
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,642
Follow me.

157
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,392
Five.

158
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:30,184
Now, the opposite leg.

159
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:36,600
One, two, three, four, and five.

160
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,017
Relax.

161
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:40,267
Lean your body back.

162
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,059
Stretch your whole upper body.

163
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:46,934
Now, lean forward.

164
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:56,517
One, two, three.

165
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,350
Now lean back again.

166
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,309
Fully stretch your body.

167
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,834
Now, repeat the whole thing again.

168
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,600
Feel the stretch.

169
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:18,392
One, two, three, four, and five.

170
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,975
Now, lean back again.

171
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:29,100
Stretch your body, then lean forward.

172
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,934
And then heads up.

173
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:16,934
Tighten your lower back and abdomen.

174
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:21,267
Keep tightening your abdomen.

175
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:30,309
Slowly.

176
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,434
How does it feel?

177
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,350
Good.

178
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:37,975
It feels so good.

179
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,267
How much do you like it?

180
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,809
I can’t put it into words.

181
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,642
Keep going.

182
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:18,642
Please rub harder.

183
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:20,809
- Harder?
- Yeah.

184
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,684
- Like this?
- That's it.

185
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:24,267
- Keep going.
- Like this?

186
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,559
- Yes.
- Like this?

187
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:46,059
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

188
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:47,600
- I like it.
- How is it?

189
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,309
It feels amazing.

190
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,267
It's so full inside me.

191
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,475
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

192
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,864
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

193
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,030
I feel so full inside.

194
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:32,905
It's so hard.

195
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,072
Come on.

196
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:30,072
What am I doing?

197
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:33,239
What am I thinking?

198
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,471
Aren't you going to school?

199
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,697
Of course, I will.

200
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,553
I think I’ll be a bit late today
because of school work.

201
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:27,170
But why?

202
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:30,368
I'm just asking.

203
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:23,254
Hello.

204
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,416
Hello, Mr. Cheol-min.

205
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:32,897
Shall we start?

206
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:34,845
Sure.

207
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:39,359
As I said before, tighten your core.

208
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,660
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

209
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,320
How is your business these days?

210
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:49,997
I'm sorry?

211
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,313
What do you mean?

212
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:56,778
I heard personal training
is becoming popular lately.

213
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,664
Since you’re likely working
with many people individually.

214
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:04,676
I was curious about how my
progress compares to others

215
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:05,910
I see.

216
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:10,318
As your daughter already said before.

217
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,413
I’m only doing this in my spare time
while preparing for my studies abroad.

218
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:16,022
I'm not doing this for a living.

219
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:18,701
You're my only student.

220
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:22,081
Also, as I said yesterday,

221
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:25,571
you still hold up well
compared to women in their 20s.

222
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:28,176
The 20s?

223
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:31,468
- Stop joking.
- I really mean it.

224
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,819
And you can call me Coach Lee.

225
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:36,526
I prefer that over Mr. Cheol-min.

226
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:45,343
Coach Lee, do you have a girlfriend?

227
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,293
Pardon me?

228
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:55,426
Min-hee, I'm sorry.

229
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,893
I’m with Professor Choi for the seminar.

230
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,512
I don't think I can go today.

231
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,628
You must be tired,
so take a rest before you leave.

232
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:07,260
Once again, I'm sorry.

233
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,176
Coach Lee.

234
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,913
Do you have a girlfriend?

235
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:21,987
Pardon me?

236
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:32,176
You shouldn't do this.

237
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:36,426
Mrs. Yun, this isn't right.

238
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,395
I can't hold it anymore.

239
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,962
Mrs. Yun, this isn't right.

240
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,885
Mrs. Yun.

241
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:07,093
What if your daughter sees us?

242
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:24,718
Don't you like it?

243
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:26,968
We shouldn't be doing this.

244
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,801
It feels so good.

245
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,468
Mrs. Yun.

246
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,843
What if your daughter catches us?

247
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:34,176
Coach Lee.

248
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,885
Don't worry about my daughter.

249
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:38,510
This isn't right.

250
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:40,260
Just focus on me right now.

251
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,301
Coach Lee, your thing is so hard.

252
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:03,343
It feels so good.

253
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:04,760
I love it.

254
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,426
Coach Lee, why are you rushing?

255
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,843
Keep going.

256
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,510
It feels so good.

257
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,468
Coach Lee, please don't stop.

258
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:24,301
It's in so deep.

259
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,885
It feels amazing.

260
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:34,426
Oh my god.

261
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,885
Mrs. Yun, I love it too.

262
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,010
Don't call me Mrs. Yun.

263
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,718
It makes me feel old.

264
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:49,510
Call me by my name.

265
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:51,385
Just call me Hyun-jeong.

266
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,010
Hyun-jeong.

267
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:57,176
You're so amazing.

268
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,676
It feels fantastic.

269
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:05,593
Put it in me deeper.

270
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,926
Oh my god.

271
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:20,135
Oh my god.

272
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,968
Put it in me deeper.

273
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:18,718
I love it.

274
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,635
It's so deep.

275
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:22,843
It feels so great.

276
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:01,451
You're better than before.

277
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:04,843
I think I'm gaining progress.

278
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:06,301
Don't you think so?

279
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,468
Let's start from the beginning.

280
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,301
You're much more flexible now.

281
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,499
It's all thanks to you, Coach Lee.

282
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:46,676
Let's try it again.

283
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:52,510
Come on, you can do it.

284
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:22,985
What's the matter?

285
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:33,385
Did I make you upset?

286
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,343
No.

287
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:37,736
It's nothing.

288
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,176
Thank god.

289
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:42,991
I thought you're mad at me.

290
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:48,230
Shouldn’t you be at school right now?

291
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:51,203
Are you sure everything's alright?

292
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,593
Drink slowly.

293
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,635
You'll get drunk if you drink too quickly.

294
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:12,208
I just wanted to
have a drink with you.

295
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:15,058
Don’t you want to drink with me?

296
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,201
What?

297
00:45:50,777 --> 00:45:53,085
Why isn’t she home this late?

298
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:08,260
Are you sure about this?

299
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,301
Don't worry about the aftermath.

300
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,426
Just think about the two of us today.

301
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:39,676
Are you sure this is alright?

302
00:50:40,801 --> 00:50:43,093
I said just think about the two of us.

303
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:27,096
Please focus only on me.

304
00:51:29,718 --> 00:51:31,926
Mr. Cheol-min.

305
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,801
Mr. Cheol-min.

306
00:51:44,593 --> 00:51:47,218
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I love it.

307
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:52,551
Are you sure this is right?

308
00:52:13,176 --> 00:52:14,843
Are you always this good?

309
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,176
I wanted to sleep with you so badly.

310
00:52:20,718 --> 00:52:22,510
- Really?
- Yes.

311
00:52:35,926 --> 00:52:38,385
- It feels so good.
- Really?

312
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:40,176
I love it too.

313
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:42,510
You're so good.

314
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:23,718
I'm about to finish.

315
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:29,676
How about you?

316
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:31,426
Me too.

317
00:55:31,593 --> 00:55:32,968
Let's finish together.

318
00:55:33,718 --> 00:55:35,468
- Shall we finish together?
- Yes, please.

319
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,051
Yes, I'm coming.

320
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,760
Where were you last night?

321
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,426
I slept over at my friend's house.

322
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:39,260
I had to finish my school reports.

323
00:56:40,926 --> 00:56:42,676
I'm tired.

324
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,385
Didn't you say you're tired?

325
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,718
Where are you going?

326
00:57:12,135 --> 00:57:13,426
School.

327
00:57:15,326 --> 00:57:18,618
Just so you know,
Mr. Cheol-min won’t be here today.

328
00:57:19,576 --> 00:57:22,660
He said he has an interview
for his study abroad plans.

329
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:25,614
Anyways, I'm off to school now.

330
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:43,593
When is she coming?

331
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:47,428
Sorry for being late.

332
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,530
- You're so late.
- I'm sorry.

333
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:52,354
Give me a kiss if you're sorry.

334
00:57:53,593 --> 00:57:54,718
Let's go.

335
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:57,010
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

336
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:02,218
Cheol-min, I want to try this.

337
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:04,510
- Let's do this.
- The claw machine?

338
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,218
- Do you know how to play?
- I'm an expert in this.

339
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:09,593
I don't think so.

340
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:11,593
Alright, fine.

341
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:12,968
What prize are you aiming for?

342
00:58:15,343 --> 00:58:17,343
That's not how you do it.

343
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:20,343
- Let me try one more time.
- Aim it properly.

344
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:24,676
Calm down and take your time to aim.

345
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,426
I think you got it this time.

346
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,176
Oh, come on!

347
00:58:34,201 --> 00:58:35,534
Let me try one last time.

348
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:37,768
I think I can get it if
I try one more time.

349
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,426
Move away, I'll try it.

350
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:42,135
Let's see how good you are.

351
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:07,176
I guess Coach Lee is quite busy these days.

352
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,660
He hasn't visited for a while.

353
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,218
I guess so.

354
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:20,260
I didn't know he was such
an irresponsible person.

355
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,551
No, he's not.

356
01:01:22,926 --> 01:01:25,176
He's just busy preparing
for his studies abroad.

357
01:01:26,635 --> 01:01:29,760
He might not be able to come
to teach you anymore.

358
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:32,260
Didn't you pay him
one month in advance?

359
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:37,010
I know, but we had an agreement.

360
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:41,593
That he will teach
only when he has spare time.

361
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:43,468
What's wrong?

362
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,253
Just forget about him.

363
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:52,593
Didn't you say you
wanted to quit anyways?

364
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:50,135
You shouldn't do this.

365
01:02:50,218 --> 01:02:51,801
Coach Lee.

366
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:53,247
I mean, Cheol-min.

367
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,066
Do you know how long
I’ve been waiting for you?

368
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:01,533
You're the one who turned me on.

369
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:04,292
But how could you abandon me like this?

370
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:12,620
Is it because I’m caught
that you’re not going to feed me?

371
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:21,593
Please calm down.

372
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:24,635
I'm here to tell you something.

373
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,083
I think it's this house.

374
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:53,049
I'm sorry.

375
01:03:55,841 --> 01:03:58,547
I was too reckless in my behavior...

376
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,009
For what I did with you last time.

377
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:04,069
And also...

378
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,998
I'm dating your daughter.

379
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:14,495
I could no longer keep up the lie.

380
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:19,964
But when you called me last night,
I found the courage to come.

381
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:25,832
Please forget what happened between us.

382
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:31,196
And please allow me to meet your daughter.

383
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:56,885
What's wrong with you?

384
01:04:57,633 --> 01:04:59,369
Let's drink together.

385
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:01,457
That's right.

386
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:05,843
Mom, you drank too much.

387
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:13,027
Are you acting like this
because your professor is here?

388
01:05:13,635 --> 01:05:15,510
I'm fine, so don't worry.

389
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:18,051
When you weren't home,

390
01:05:18,135 --> 01:05:21,301
I had a conversation
with your professor.

391
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:24,343
I think he's an exceptional person.

392
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,734
Please don't say that.

393
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:30,260
I’m just an ordinary person,
just like everyone else.

394
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,218
But you're a university professor.

395
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:36,886
How is that an ordinary person?

396
01:05:37,093 --> 01:05:39,385
And you're not just any professor.

397
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:43,260
You’re the one overseeing
my precious daughter.

398
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:45,424
Having come this far,

399
01:05:45,803 --> 01:05:50,011
how could I just send you off
without serving you a meal.

400
01:05:50,676 --> 01:05:53,676
I should have greeted you earlier.

401
01:05:54,135 --> 01:05:56,051
But I’m greeting you now.

402
01:05:56,076 --> 01:05:58,287
You don't have to say that.

403
01:06:00,513 --> 01:06:05,014
I just came by to see Min-hee.

404
01:06:05,964 --> 01:06:09,798
I'm grateful for the warm hospitality.

405
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:12,491
I really appreciate it.

406
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:14,647
Since you came a long way.

407
01:06:17,718 --> 01:06:20,676
Drink as much as you want
and stay the night at my house.

408
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:25,343
I can't do that.

409
01:06:25,368 --> 01:06:26,577
I have to go.

410
01:06:26,977 --> 01:06:28,787
Think about this later again.

411
01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:33,220
Let's drink and enjoy for now.

412
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:34,926
Cheers!

413
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:37,926
Mom, you're drunk.

414
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,909
- You should cheers too.
- I don't want to drink.

415
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,635
Listen to your mom.

416
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,144
Professor Choi.

417
01:06:43,228 --> 01:06:46,353
Come on Min-Hee, let's cheers.

418
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:49,593
-Cheers!

419
01:07:07,176 --> 01:07:09,843
Mom, are you out of your mind?

420
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:11,301
What's wrong with you today?

421
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:12,926
What do you mean?

422
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:16,743
I just served your professor a meal.

423
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:20,260
What's so wrong about that?

424
01:07:22,908 --> 01:07:28,908
Still, how could get this drunk
with someone you've just met?

425
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,213
Min-hee.

426
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:33,023
I'm not drunk.

427
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:37,200
Fine, you're the boss here.

428
01:07:37,509 --> 01:07:38,595
Go to sleep now.

429
01:07:42,394 --> 01:07:43,653
What about Professor Choi?

430
01:07:46,037 --> 01:07:50,079
Stop worrying about him
and go to sleep.

431
01:08:38,852 --> 01:08:41,561
I didn't expect you to
come all the way here.

432
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,245
I'm sorry.

433
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:46,778
I tried not to come but...

434
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:51,153
Stop making excuses
and please leave.

435
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,092
Do you still love me?

436
01:09:02,968 --> 01:09:04,078
Do I still love you?

437
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:11,917
I'm sorry.

438
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:16,238
Honestly speaking...

439
01:09:17,964 --> 01:09:22,256
I’ve always been envious of kids who
had their fathers around since childhood.

440
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,372
I've fallen in love with someone.

441
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:32,206
I think...

442
01:09:34,576 --> 01:09:37,201
It's time to part ways with you.

443
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:41,929
Fine.

444
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:44,511
I get it now.

445
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:48,846
You're a really great person.

446
01:09:50,285 --> 01:09:53,076
Sorry that I took advantage of you
for my own pleasure.

447
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:57,760
I'm sorry.

448
01:09:58,343 --> 01:09:59,676
It's fine.

449
01:10:01,426 --> 01:10:03,510
I also enjoyed meeting you.

450
01:10:03,903 --> 01:10:05,486
It felt like having my own daughter.

451
01:10:06,342 --> 01:10:07,967
I know I might sound pathetic.

452
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,010
I'm sorry.

453
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:16,260
I think I should leave now.

454
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,859
It's already late, why
don't you stay here tonight?

455
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:23,563
It's fine.

456
01:10:23,993 --> 01:10:26,868
I feel like this isn't
the right place for me.

457
01:10:27,378 --> 01:10:28,563
I should go now.

458
01:10:29,272 --> 01:10:30,730
Seeing you is all I needed.

459
01:10:31,405 --> 01:10:33,946
Didn't you drink quite a bit?

460
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:36,093
You should just stay.

461
01:10:37,322 --> 01:10:38,457
It's fine.

462
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:41,012
I will leave.

463
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:56,082
You can use this blanket.

464
01:10:57,968 --> 01:10:59,676
Get some sleep.

465
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:09,241
I'm sorry.

466
01:11:49,343 --> 01:11:51,576
Why aren't you asleep yet?

467
01:11:51,799 --> 01:11:54,549
I was about to leave.

468
01:11:57,428 --> 01:11:59,845
How about a cup of coffee
before you leave?

469
01:12:07,468 --> 01:12:08,968
You should stay here for tonight.

470
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,540
It's fine.

471
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:13,265
It's already late.

472
01:12:13,581 --> 01:12:19,122
It's also hard to get a designated driver
because it's a remote area.

473
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,930
It's fine.

474
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,410
I'll just take a quick nap in my car.

475
01:12:25,727 --> 01:12:29,436
I can’t let you do that
when I have an empty room.

476
01:12:33,926 --> 01:12:35,568
The coffee tastes really good.

477
01:12:39,176 --> 01:12:42,343
Sorry for talking so much
when it's our first time meeting.

478
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,424
Don't worry about it.

479
01:12:45,109 --> 01:12:49,591
It was nice to feel the
peaceful family vibe.

480
01:12:51,718 --> 01:12:54,718
If you don't mind.

481
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,660
May I ask if you're married?

482
01:13:01,747 --> 01:13:04,581
Yes, but I don't have a family.

483
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:09,506
My wife passed away a
few years ago from cancer.

484
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,510
So now, I'm all alone.

485
01:13:18,818 --> 01:13:20,768
You must be very lonely.

486
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:10,097
I don't think this is right.

487
01:14:12,426 --> 01:14:14,260
I know that.

488
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:19,426
But I'm also very lonely.

489
01:16:23,301 --> 01:16:26,885
It feels like I've found my soulmate.

490
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,010
Me too, it feels so good.

491
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,718
Please make my life happy.

492
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:37,010
Of course I will.

493
01:17:57,843 --> 01:18:00,926
Dad, please take good care of my mom.

494
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:04,051
Don't worry, have a safe trip.

495
01:18:05,843 --> 01:18:07,385
We'll get going now.

496
01:18:08,676 --> 01:18:11,135
Let me know when you arrive.

497
01:18:14,426 --> 01:18:15,926
Don't skip your meals.
