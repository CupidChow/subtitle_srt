=Episode 24=

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,520
Stay away from me.

4
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,840
What exactly do you want?

5
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:00,719
What do you want?

6
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,120
You're ruining her!

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,879
How's it possible?

8
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,016
Meihui.

9
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,079
Stay strong.

10
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,799
Control the needle with will.

11
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,280
Miracle!

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,359
What a miracle!

13
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,560
Seeing such a miracle in life,

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
I could seriously die happy.

15
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,064
Shut up.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
Watch. No talk.

17
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,159
Get away from me.

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,904
Get lost!

19
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,360
Shen Guohao took my sister.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,639
I have to see Ms. Shen.

21
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,280
Wang Meihui and Ms. Shen
are in treatment.

22
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,280
Grandmaster said

23
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,680
never interrupt no matter what.

24
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,280
Let me in.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,199
You can't.

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,080
No one can afford the consequences.

27
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,719
Run?

28
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,360
To where?

29
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,328
My beauty.

30
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,680
Come on. Give me a kiss.

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,680
Let go of me.

32
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,000
A step closer.

33
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,120
I'll just kill myself.

34
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,520
Fine.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,120
Then show me.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,759
Anyway.

37
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
It's suicide.

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
None of my business.

39
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,399
Can you have someone check inside?

40
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,480
Just be quiet. It won't disturb.

41
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,560
Wu Ming.

42
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,279
Shen Guohao took my sister.

43
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,199
I've tried everything.
Still can't find her.

44
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,959
What?

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,392
Stay calm.

46
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,160
Mr. Hao.

47
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,000
Mr. Hao, it's Ms. Shen.

48
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,439
She says if you won't reply,

49
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,839
she'll kick you out.

50
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,496
Get lost.

51
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,240
You kid.

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,920
Bring Miss Yang over here!

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
If anything happens to her,

54
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,360
I'll come after you.

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,120
Do you see me as your son?

56
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,319
I was just adopted

57
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,759
to stop the gossip, right?

58
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,920
You wretch! You...

59
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,160
Shen Guohao.

60
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,560
Bring it on me.

61
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,160
Catch a woman? Seriously?

62
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,480
Alright.

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,879
Meet me at the East Suburb Power Plant.

64
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,800
If you know what's good for her,

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
come alone.

66
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,279
Wu Ming, don't.

67
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,199
Don't hurt her.

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,079
I'll come. Alone.

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,199
You'll see

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
Wu Ming groveling at my feet today.

71
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,040
No.

72
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,279
And Wu Ming will see

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,839
how I've conquered you.

74
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,480
No.

75
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,279
No.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,079
Come on, cheers.

77
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,519
Cheers.

78
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:29,448
Wretch!

79
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,319
Quite a man.

80
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,560
Alone, huh?

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,560
Where's Yang Ling?

82
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Dead.

83
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,959
You'll soon join her.

84
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:39,920
Get him!

85
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,519
Alright.

86
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,920
That's enough.

87
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,399
Don't kill people.

88
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,160
Where's she?

89
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,759
Threaten me?

90
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,800
I don't know.

91
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,480
Where's she?

92
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
Inside, inside.

93
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,480
Shen Guohao.

94
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,439
Wu Ming.

95
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,800
Wu Ming.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
Want her to be fine?

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,959
Kneel now.

98
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,399
Stop there.

99
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,519
I said, stop.

100
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,519
Shen Guohao.

101
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,519
You can't touch my woman.

102
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,759
Your woman...?

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,080
You...

104
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,199
- You...
- Shut up!

105
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,480
Sister!

106
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,360
Sister.

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Are you alright?

108
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,639
I was super worried.

109
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,639
Well,

110
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,720
Yang Tingjian and Long Gang were caught.

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
They'll be punished by law.

112
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,360
No worries, I'm fine.

113
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,440
Good.

114
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,840
Don't worry then.

115
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,840
Why staring at me?

116
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,799
Wu Ming.

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,799
That guy just drugged me.

118
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,559
I'm feeling dizzy.

119
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,440
Help me over to the side and check.

120
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,280
Okay.

121
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,000
Personal distance.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let me.

123
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,080
Personal distance?

124
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
He's your brother-in-law.

125
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,039
We've done that,

126
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,519
and there's a baby coming.

127
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,592
Yuetong,

128
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,519
put aside your little thoughts, okay?

129
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,120
No way.

130
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,720
I got to know Wu Ming first.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,039
It's not "first come, first served."

132
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,519
Personal distance.

133
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,759
Step aside.

134
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,799
Stop arguing, you two.

135
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,639
Never asked his opinion.

136
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,272
Me?

137
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,159
Wu Ming.

138
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,200
Confess to me now.

139
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,480
I'll marry you.

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,360
Wu Ming, if you choose me,

141
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
I'll give you everything I've saved up.

142
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,080
From now on, all your call.

143
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,919
I might even allow for concubines.

144
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,960
You marry both of us.

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,480
Really?

146
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,799
Really what!

147
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,759
Need some lesson?

148
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,279
Stop.

149
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,159
Don't touch him, Sister!

150
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,279
You can't touch him either!

151
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,960
Ouch, ouch.

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Ouch!

153
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,224
(Acupuncture)

154
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,600
Wu Ming.

155
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,480
(Acupuncture Therapy)
You again?

156
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,600
I tolerate you sleeping,

157
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
but now you're having good dreams?

158
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,039
Is that your way of torturing me?

159
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,360
I'm sorry, Sir.

160
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,799
I'm so sleepy.

161
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,720
Chinese medicine is seriously profound.

162
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,720
There are tons left

163
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,279
for you to learn.

164
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't think about taking it easy

165
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,600
because of some talent!

166
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,399
Be serious!

167
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,200
Serious! Serious!

168
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,840
Finish my homework tonight.

169
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,559
Okay, Nie.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,639
Tonight.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,879
Magpie Phoenix Room.

172
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,240
Okay?

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,120
On me.

174
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,960
Great.

175
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,480
- Let's go!
- Wait for me.

176
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,039
Meihui.

177
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,960
Meihui.

178
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,759
(It was just a dream.)

179
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,799
(Even if it was a dream,)

180
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,720
(but I felt the calling to heal)

181
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
(and the awe and love for life.)

182
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,480
(I'll master Chinese medicine,)

183
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,320
(so I can help people out!)

184
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,039
Excuse me?

185
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,080
A question got me.

186
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Can you help me?

187
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,440
Sure.
