=Episode 3=

3
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,159
Listen.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,399
We don't earn much.

5
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,240
You can't let him walk off like that.

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,840
You stop...

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,000
I...

8
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,000
What did you do?

9
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,920
What did you give my husband to eat?

10
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,799
Honey,

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,079
how are you doing?

12
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,079
Quick, spit it out!

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
Honey, are you okay?

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,320
Spit it out now!

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,519
Hey! Stop!

16
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,480
Everyone, come judge this!

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,239
This man

18
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,799
broken our stall

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
and even fed poison to my husband!

20
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,920
Everyone, come help us!

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,239
Take him to the police!

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,959
Honey, are you alright?

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
Honey, say something!

24
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,599
You're scaring me!

25
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,920
Honey, we can't let him go.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,879
Honey, say something!

27
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,519
Enough.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,719
What are you doing?

29
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,959
He hasn't paid yet.

30
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,840
Forget the money!

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Go back.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,040
Why go back?

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,040
Go!

34
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,159
Let's go home.

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,079
What do you mean?

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
He hasn't paid!

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,000
What do you mean?

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,040
Honey, what are you doing?

39
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,079
He didn't pay!

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,359
What are you doing?

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,599
Fatty, why are you here?

42
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,599
Didn't you run away?

43
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,879
How can you wrong me?

44
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,760
I went back to bring this motorbike
to pay off the debt.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,159
This is my only possession.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,159
Alright.

47
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,760
Let's go find Lei Changhe.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,000
I want him to do three things.

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,079
Lei Changhe, the boss of Loong City?

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,199
How would he help you?

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,360
He will help me

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,840
and even thank me.

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
Mr. Long,

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,840
you're putting me in a tough spot.

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,919
I can't afford to offend Yang family.

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,199
If anything happened to Miss Yang Ling

57
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,479
at my place,

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,599
I couldn't handle the consequences.

59
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,080
Mr. Lei.

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,120
Are you saying

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,599
you don't take
the Long family seriously?

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,080
That's not what I mean, Mr. Long.

63
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,560
I can't afford to offend

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,879
both of you.

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,360
Moreover,

66
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,439
this club belongs to the Yang family.

67
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,080
I'm just helping with the management.

68
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,439
Alright.

69
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,759
If you're scared, just stay out.

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,039
I'm meeting Yang Ling here tonight.

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,159
Clear all your people.

72
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,360
Whatever happens later,

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,879
it has nothing to do with you.

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,960
How's that?

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
Long Gang.

76
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
You're really asking too much.

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,319
This is

78
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,000
still under my control.

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,840
No matter what occurs here,

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,680
I can't just wash my hands of it.

81
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
Right?

82
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,919
Five percent

83
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,879
of Long Group's shares.

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,560
Glad to cooperate.

85
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,479
Glad to cooperate.

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,879
Private club.

87
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,680
No trespassing.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,879
Bro,

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,919
how can we get in?

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Money is useless.

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,039
You need a black card.

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,039
We know your boss, Mr. Lei.

93
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,520
We're here to meet him.

94
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,639
Since you know him,

95
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,280
give him a call.

96
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,560
Bro,

97
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,399
have a cigarette. Let us in.

98
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,480
Leave now.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,519
Or you'll be thrown out.

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,439
And you!

101
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,319
Don't move.

102
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,240
Everyone, stop!

103
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,360
Greetings, Miss.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,319
What's all this fighting about?

105
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,040
What's going on?

106
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Miss,

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,439
they don't have a black card,

108
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,279
still messing around.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
We tried to stop them.

110
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm here for personal matters
with Lei Changhe.

111
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,879
No offense intended.

112
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,160
(At this critical time
when Grandpa's ill,)

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,800
(any disturbance)

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,759
(could be part of a deliberate plot.)

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,120
You must deposit 20 million

116
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,680
and have a celebrity guarantee

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,120
to get a black card as VIP.

118
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,759
If you can do that,

119
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,560
you are always welcome here.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,079
If you can't,

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,279
please leave immediately.

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,439
This is not the place for you.

123
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,519
Look at those people!

124
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Treat us like beggars.

125
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,600
That's about enough.

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,720
Mr. Ming, what do we do now?

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,839
What else can we do?

128
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,199
Find another entrance.

129
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,519
Let's go.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,399
Mr. Long, your medicine.

131
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
Does this thing work?

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,439
Rest assured.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,639
One drop can drive the Ice Queen wild.

134
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,240
We use it often.

135
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,920
What about mine?

136
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,319
Just one Jingang Pill

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,439
can completely satisfy your ambitions.

138
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,639
You guy.

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,160
I really like you.

140
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,240
You may leave.

141
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
You've arrived.

142
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
Get to the point.

143
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm very busy.

144
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,199
Of course, I have something important.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,000
Ask your people to step out.

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
Just say it.

147
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,160
They are all my trusted men.

148
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,279
Speak freely.

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,319
Miss Yang.

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
You remain as cautious as always.

151
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,800
How about

152
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,079
letting them

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,560
wait at the door?

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,319
This matter concerns

155
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,199
the survival of the Yang Group.

156
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Please.

157
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,000
Can you say it now?

158
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,879
No hurry.

159
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,639
Have a drink first.

160
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,879
I don't want to drink today.

161
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,319
If you can't even give me this courtesy,

162
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,199
should I

163
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,559
just go talk business

164
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,200
with your second uncle?

165
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,840
What kind of deal will he make with you?

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,039
What's wrong?

167
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,679
Afraid I'll poison you?

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,519
This is your place.

169
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,399
Would you dare?
