=Episode 23=

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,920
(If I'd just believed him
from the start,)

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,119
(maybe it would end differently.)

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
I will touch your Heavenly Orifice.

6
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,640
The Chinese and Western medicine

7
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,319
have the same conclusion.

8
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,480
No cure for it.

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,640
Right.

10
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,719
Even a pro
of the Divine Thirteen Needles

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,439
wouldn't be able to cure it.

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,719
First,

13
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,519
the needle removal thing

14
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,319
seems like a no-win situation to me.

15
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
Even if the needle is somehow
pulled out,

16
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,519
it's tough

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,760
to manage the crazy backlash
when the energy pathways reverse.

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,280
As for the Yin-Yang integration,

19
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,239
performing acupuncture during periods

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,280
of increased blood flow
might facilitate pathway access.

21
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,319
But it's super risky.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,960
If one can't bear it even slightly,

23
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,000
the consequences could be
a total disaster.

24
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,960
So, Mr. Li, sounds like

25
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,199
you oppose Wu Ming's treatment
of Wang Meihui?

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Theoretically,

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
if he can cure Wang Meihui,

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,840
then Miss Shen, your ghost-faced nevus

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,159
may also be cured.

30
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,639
But it's just impossible.

31
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,960
Miss Shen,

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,560
the greater the hope,
the greater the disappointment.

33
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,439
But I do hope he pulls off a miracle.

34
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,520
In Chinese medicine, there's a legend.

35
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,039
The Divine Thirteen Needles
can rival the King of Hell for a life.

36
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,560
Is he really as good as legend has it?

37
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,960
Is that way

38
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
the only way to save me?

39
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,800
Even with that way,

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,400
it's still a bit tricky now.

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
Maybe it's just fate.

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
Even if I could be cured,

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,039
there's no way I'd do that
with someone I don't love

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,560
and who doesn't love me either.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,759
This world

46
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,800
may be inherently unclean.

47
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,240
But I still want to save a spot

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,879
that is pure in my heart.

49
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,759
Love itself is pure.

50
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,400
Wu Ming, you shouldn't feel guilty.

51
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,199
I'll tell my mom

52
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,599
not to bother you anymore.

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
And we won't blame you.

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,759
We should be grateful instead.

55
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,400
Back then, to save me,

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,879
it must have cost you much
to perform the needles.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,039
Medicine is all about saving lives.

58
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
You shouldn't give up

59
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,719
until the very last moment.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,712
Can I ask you a question?

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,639
Go ahead.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,039
If.

63
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,400
I mean, if.

64
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,719
If someone could cure me

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,280
by being with me,

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,680
but he already has someone he loves,

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,400
would he give up his lover
just to save me?

68
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,199
Would he?

69
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,400
Is life more important,

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,759
or love?

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,439
Life is important.

72
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,439
So is love.

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,240
But you must make a choice.

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,439
What would you choose?

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,600
There must be other ways.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
No worries.

77
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,560
Wu Ming,

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,800
can you grant me a wish?

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,240
What is it?

80
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,040
Can you be my boyfriend for a day?

81
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,279
I've never had one yet.

82
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,279
I just don't want to end up
with so many regrets.

83
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,120
I know you're

84
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,279
into Yang Ling, but it's one-sided.

85
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,680
She hasn't said she feels the same.

86
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,600
So don't stress too much.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm just asking you

88
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,240
to fulfill a dying person's

89
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,959
little wish,

90
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,519
okay?

91
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,360
Okay.

92
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Then it's a deal.

93
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't go back on your word.

94
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,759
Miss.

95
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,160
Grave robbers messed up Tomb Mount.

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,560
Your dad's grave got robbed.

97
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,360
They even exposed his bones.

98
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,120
Get me a car now.

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,439
I'm going there.

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,680
Okay.

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,639
Your wish is so simple.

102
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,519
Order as you like.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,399
It's on me.

104
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,439
No need.

105
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,360
Growing up,

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,480
I pretty much always did
what my family told me.

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,399
Never did anything too wild.

108
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,040
So today, I'm thinking of
doing something crazy!

109
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,720
Like what?

110
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,000
Eat first.

111
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,079
You'll find out later.

112
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,319
Hello, Mr. Shen.

113
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
Handled it as you arranged.

114
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,399
I'll bring Yang Ling to you myself.

115
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,839
Don't forget

116
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,199
your promise.

117
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,632
Let's go.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,079
We haven't paid.

119
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Hey, you two.

120
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,279
Dine and dash?

121
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,759
Stop right there!

122
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,600
Can't reach my sister.

123
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,839
Sha's phone is off, too.

124
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,319
What happened?

125
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,959
Dining and dashing

126
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,959
is really thrilling!

127
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,879
Looking for thrills, huh?

128
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,279
I've plenty of options.

129
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,199
Tell me now.

130
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,680
For example,

131
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,000
be unclothed.

132
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,360
You know, performance art.

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
Well, nope.

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,000
Then go kiss strangers on the street.

135
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,480
Meihui.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,319
You're not a good boyfriend.

137
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:20,959
Wu Ming,

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
nice meeting you.

139
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,240
Thanks a lot for all you've done
for me today!

140
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Well,

141
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,519
let's call it a day.

142
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,480
Goodbye.

143
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,440
Meihui.

144
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,519
There's another way that may save you.

145
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,799
What is it?

146
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,840
But it's very dangerous.

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
Either you'll reborn,

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
or you'll die.

149
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,519
Do you want to try it?

150
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,200
Yes, I do.

151
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,440
Okay.

152
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,679
I'll take you to Miss Shen now.

153
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,360
It needs her help.

154
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,320
Okay.

155
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,759
Before that,

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,679
let's go settle the meal bill first.

157
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,159
This is a huge risk.

158
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
You think I'd agree with you?

159
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,039
Ms. Shen, you don't have a choice.

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Chances of success?

161
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,559
Trust me, it's a sure thing

162
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,360
for you.

163
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,279
What about her?

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
Whatever the outcome,

165
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,039
I'll accept it.

166
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,759
I trust him.

167
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
I've got one condition.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,840
Mr. Li and Mr. Ji should be there
during the treatment.

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,919
They're renowned doctors.

170
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
I need more assurance.

171
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,639
You're soaking in a special healing mix.

172
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,799
It gets into the skin, then the blood.

173
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
You'll feel some effects.

174
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,720
Hang in there.

175
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:24,679
Meihui.

176
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,039
I will channel the decaying force

177
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,600
from Miss Shen's ghost-faced nevus
into you first.

178
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,000
It'll soften meridians
around the Ghost Needle

179
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
and help with the petrification.

180
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,679
Once that needle's loosened up,

181
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,960
I'll yank it out.

182
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,200
If you can't bear it,

183
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
it's all for nothing.

184
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,399
If we don't get rid of
that decaying force

185
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
from the ghost-faced nevus in one go,

186
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
it'll regenerate

187
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
and could kill them.

188
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,679
Kid.

189
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
No way your method works.

190
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,559
Exactly, Miss Shen.

191
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,840
It's life or death here.

192
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,360
So first, I will seal up
all your major pressure points

193
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,960
to even get that decaying force moving.

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,279
Once I pull Ghost Needle,

195
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll use the 12th Needle to remove

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,399
the ghost-faced nevus.

197
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,440
What do you think?

198
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,759
Theoretically, it could work.

199
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,559
But

200
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,799
completely sealing
all those pressure points?

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,919
That's practically impossible.

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,799
Precisely, Miss Shen.

203
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,759
If he's really got that skill,

204
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,320
I, Ji Qingchuan,
will shut down my practice

205
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,279
and abandon medicine.

206
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,960
You're all just clueless.

207
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,840
Time for a lesson.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,639
Wu Ming.

209
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,879
I'm putting my life in your hands.

210
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Don't let me down.

211
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:53,248
(Yang Yuetong Incoming Call)

212
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,519
You're awake.

213
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
What did you do to me?

214
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,320
Nothing yet.

215
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,919
I just

216
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,240
got you changed.

217
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Stay away from me.

218
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,399
What exactly do you want?
