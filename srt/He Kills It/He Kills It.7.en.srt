=Episode 7=

3
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,479
Stop!

4
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,320
Great you're here, Manager.

5
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,479
We got trouble.

6
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,119
It's you!

7
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,640
Still got that temper, huh?

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
Want more needles?

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,799
Where's Xu Zhengchun?

10
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,560
He's in seclusion

11
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,799
to master the art of healing.

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,760
I've got his phone.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,239
Seclusion?

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,719
He's probably just hiding away
because he knows

15
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,200
he's not good enough.

16
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,079
Scared of me.

17
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,120
You're really enjoying it, aren't you?

18
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,376
Is there no end to this?

19
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,480
You made that call just now?

20
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,120
Yes.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,040
How come you know my master's number?

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,400
Because he is my disciple.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,560
Bravo!

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,159
Talk about having some nerve!

25
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,040
Dr. Xu looks to be in his fifties,
maybe even sixties.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,879
And you? Still teething?

27
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,799
Kid,

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,519
you dare call yourself Dr. Xu's master!

29
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,439
You think

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,000
we're all idiots?

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,120
You're not saying

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,280
you were born a genius, right?

33
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,280
Beauty doctor.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,439
If

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
this guy is Dr. Xu's master,

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,120
then he should be your grandmaster.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
Seriously, you didn't even

38
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,479
recognize your grandmaster?

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,919
Honestly, I didn't know him before.

40
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,479
Miss,

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,439
what an embarrassing moment.

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,759
Dr. Xu's disciple

43
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,479
doesn't even know Dr. Xu's master!

44
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,159
Why is Wu Ming so stubborn?

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,879
Let's see how he will settle this.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,479
Who's

47
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,159
got the nerve

48
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,080
pulling scams at Baozhi Clinic?

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,919
I will break his leg for Dr. Xu.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,319
Miss Shen, I'll be right back.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,759
That's Mr. Jin from

52
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,879
Jintong Construction.

53
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,800
His status is on par with Lei Changhe.

54
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,159
Hello.

55
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm Yang Jinbao from the Yang Group.

56
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,960
Yang Jinbao?

57
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,639
Never heard of you.

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,960
Are you with the eldest sister
or the second brother?

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm Uncle Yang's nephew.

60
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,199
A far distant relative.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,400
No far.

62
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,759
Can't you speak Chinese?

63
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
Go play yourself.

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,759
Mr. Yang,

65
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,159
aren't you a direct descendant
of the Yang family?

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,680
How's some random guy

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,879
yelling at you like that?

68
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,400
Yeah, I am.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,439
But the old master
specifically told me to

70
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,400
keep it low-key

71
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,199
when I'm out.

72
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,919
Low-key.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Oh, low-key.

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,439
Got it.

75
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,360
Hey, Doc.

76
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll take care of this

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
for you today.

78
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,159
My construction site just started up.

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,479
We're short on bricks.

80
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,560
So I'm making him

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,319
into a brick.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Mr. Jin,

83
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,080
appreciate your kindness.

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,280
But it's our internal matter.

85
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:46,479
We'll take care of it.

86
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,080
Congenital ghost-faced nevus?

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,599
Nope.

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
Not congenital.

89
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,879
H-how do you know?

90
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,319
Grandpa!

91
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,680
Grandpa!

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,639
Dad!

93
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,120
Dad!

94
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,319
Look at this mess you caused!

95
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,319
If anything happens to my grandpa,

96
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,560
you won't get away with it!

97
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:19,720
Doc,

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,839
please.

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
Please save my grandpa!

100
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
Get him to the treatment room!

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,560
Yes.

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm going too.

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,759
He probably won't make it

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,839
if I don't go in.

105
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,160
Wu Ming,

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
what has our family ever done to you?

107
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,879
Why are you always against us?

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,399
Now you're cursing our master?

109
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,120
What do you want?

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,279
I'm telling the truth!

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,399
Miss Shen,

112
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,720
Dr. Xu will take action.

113
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,319
Let's go in and see what he's got.

114
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:46,680
Whatever happens to the Wang family

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,079
is none of your business.

116
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:49,519
Just get out of here.

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,759
Now!

118
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,199
The Wangs made it perfectly clear.

119
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,319
You're not welcome here.

120
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,920
If I don't go in there today,

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,519
just kiss your Baozhi Clinic signboard
goodbye.

122
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,240
Still not your business.

123
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,000
Get lost.

124
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,839
Mr. Ming,

125
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,600
let's go.

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,959
Even clay figures get angry.

127
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,160
The King of Hell

128
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
couldn't save this wretch.

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,399
I don't like the Wangs either.

130
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,079
But Grandpa was fond of Wang Meihui
back then.

131
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,776
Can't die.

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,879
Miss.

133
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,519
Wang Meihui would die?

134
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
What's going on?

135
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,079
Isn't it her grandpa?

136
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,480
Hurry up.

137
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,879
Grandpa!

138
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,160
Dad!

139
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,000
Dad!

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Grandpa!

141
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,199
Dad, are you okay? Dad.

142
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Hold on, Dad.

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,439
Li,

144
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,879
go get Master. Fifth floor.

145
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,680
Got it.

146
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,888
Don't worry.

147
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,519
She is awesome.

148
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,600
And now she's going to get Dr. Xu.

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,439
Dad!

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,959
Stop it!

151
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,199
If this needle goes in,

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
he'll be dead.

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
If it doesn't,

154
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
he's also dying.

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
One shot is all I get,

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
but it's worth a try.

157
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,639
Doc,

158
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,600
no time for us.

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,839
My dad's dying.

160
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,879
Just try it.

161
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Whatever the outcome,

162
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,399
we won't blame you.

163
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Do it.

164
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,199
Stop.

165
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,560
Wu Ming, what exactly do you want?

166
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,439
Get lost!

167
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,160
Wang Meihui,

168
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,120
trust me this time.

169
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:33,399
Get lost!

170
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:34,079
Doc,

171
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,439
do it!

172
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:36,759
Quick!

173
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,360
Trust me.

174
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Go.

175
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:41,199
Dr. Xu is here.

176
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,879
He had an attack.

177
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,480
I blocked his acupoints with needles.

178
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,368
But he...

179
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,240
You're just rambling!

180
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,879
Get to the point!

181
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,319
You...

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,839
He's nearly gone.

183
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,480
Why waiting?

184
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,560
Dead.

185
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,296
Grandpa!

186
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,879
Dad!
