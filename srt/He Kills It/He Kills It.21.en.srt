(Shrine)

4
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,520
Oh god.

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,000
Please.

6
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,240
Save my Meihui.

7
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,000
She's really young.

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,320
Please give her your blessing.

9
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,600
Let her

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,359
get through this.

11
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:03,072
(Pine-Crane Longevity)

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Sorry.

13
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,200
No fortune-telling.

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,319
Look at what you did.

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,439
Why brought me so much trouble?

16
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,159
What happened?

17
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,480
You brought a dead person.

18
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,079
Master Wang,

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,719
what do you mean?

20
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,200
Are you saying Meihui...?

21
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,319
She's dead for years.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,640
How's it possible?

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,640
Isn't she standing here just fine?

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,680
She is just a walking corpse.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
Three years ago, I got sick.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
But recovered quickly.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,239
Someone was just using witchcraft
to extend your life.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,680
You can't hide it anymore.

29
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,159
Heaven's calling for you.

30
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,599
You stepped into my domain.

31
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,799
The witchcraft is suppressed
by the good vibes of my domain.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,680
Suppress.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,439
Suppress.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,680
Suppress.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,760
I'll exorcise ghosts for you.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,920
May the four sources of light be open.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,519
May heaven and earth be constant.

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,879
May sacred water cleanse filth.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,840
May it ward off bad luck.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,479
May the gate be guarded.

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,360
May the room be secured.

42
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,039
May the nectar refine and nourish.

43
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,639
May all energies harmonize.

44
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,280
May inner and outer be upright.

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Protect this yellow garment.

46
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,879
So grand and majestic.

47
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,039
The sun rises in the east.

48
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,360
One whip sweeps the courtyard.

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,680
Repel hundreds of ghosts.

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,520
Sweep away the sins.

51
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,879
Only then can there

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,680
be rebirth.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,479
Meihui.

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,319
Meihui.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,599
Master.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
This girl is pretty.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
You have to pay more.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,319
This card has 50,000.

59
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,439
After it's done,

60
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,960
another 50,000.

61
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,680
There's a room in back.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Fully equipped.

63
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,080
Young man,

64
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,800
take your time and enjoy!

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,560
Sure thing!

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,719
Wang Meihui.

67
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,560
You were pretty distant, huh?

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,319
Now

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,479
you're still in my hands.

70
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,319
Wang Meihui has been discharged.

71
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,439
But I heard she's in really bad shape.

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,560
Her life's always at risk.

73
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,360
Okay.

74
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,199
Thanks. I'll make a call first.

75
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,280
(Shrine)

76
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,879
This bad guy.

77
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:19,272
Hello?

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,600
What do you want?

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,319
Ma'am,

80
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,879
where's Wang Meihui now?

81
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,800
You heartless, wicked person.

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,240
You hurt Meihui badly.

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
What else do you want?

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
I can heal Meihui.

85
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,279
Such a liar.

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,680
Few top doctors can cure it.

87
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,079
Who do you think you are?

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
I just don't get it.

89
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,360
Are you nuts or something?

90
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,600
I really want to crack your brain open,

91
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,759
and see

92
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,079
what makes you tick!

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,879
Please trust me.

94
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,439
If I'm lying,

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
may lightning strike me dead.

96
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,519
Listen, kid,

97
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,720
don't make promises like that.

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,240
I didn't believe it either

99
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,800
until

100
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,399
I saw Master Wang today.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,519
Forget it.

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Why telling you this?

103
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,759
Anyway,

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,399
you'd better hope Hui's fine.

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,279
Otherwise,

106
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,879
you'll pay for this.

107
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
No much time left

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,879
for Meihui.

109
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:33,393
Hello?

110
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,240
Bro, what's up?

111
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:35,959
Mr. Lei,

112
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,560
do you know any Master Wang?

113
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,000
Never heard of him.

114
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,199
Looks like a charlatan.

115
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
My friend Wang Meihui is with him.

116
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,959
Could you find out where he is?

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
Sure. Await my message.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
What are you doing?

119
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,319
What did you do to me?

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,680
No worries, darling.

121
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,439
I just

122
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,639
got your clothes changed.

123
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,000
Not started yet.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
After all,

125
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,800
playing with wood is no fun.

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,639
Mr. Yang,

127
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,120
you'd better let me go.

128
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,079
Otherwise,

129
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,079
I'll hold on to you, even as a ghost.

130
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,920
Alright.

131
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,800
Do you really think

132
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,639
you can talk yourself out of this?

133
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,319
You!

134
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,199
Let me tell you the truth.

135
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,879
Every time I see you,

136
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,120
I feel really uncomfortable all over.

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,839
Like claws scratching me.

138
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,600
I want you.

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,800
I want you, but I can't have you.

140
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,399
Look at now.

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,639
You're finally

142
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,279
in my hands.

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,720
Do you honestly think I'd let you go?

144
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,639
Wild kitten.

145
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,759
Don't even think about it.

146
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,639
Wang Meihui.

147
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm handsome.

148
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,839
I've put so much effort
into winning you over.

149
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,160
Can't you just obey me?

150
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Pfft!

151
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
Wang Meihui.

152
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,240
You really are a rose with thorns.

153
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,480
Just so charming.

154
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,639
I want to see you

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,319
scared,

156
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,839
weak,

157
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,000
and pitiful.

158
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,399
Not like this.

159
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,679
You want me to grovel

160
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,559
and beg?

161
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
Get real!

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
I just don't get it.

163
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,840
I've made myself all
you could ever want.

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,879
What's not to like?

165
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,440
Trash is just trash.

166
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,640
Listen.

167
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,679
You're not even close to Wu Ming.

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,399
I!

169
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm not even close to Wu Ming?

170
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,200
That is your standard, huh?

171
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,480
Why laughing?

172
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,240
What are you laughing at?

173
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm just thinking

174
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,519
beneath your hideous face,

175
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,360
what kind of mess you're dealing with.

176
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
You got a death wish or something?

177
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,399
Wretch.

178
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,159
You were all tough just now?

179
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,519
I'll post you on the net.

180
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,720
Let everyone see what you really are.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,639
Why you do this?

182
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,120
You despicable one.

183
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,200
Shameless!

184
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,240
Let go of me!

185
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,000
Scared?

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,879
Scared, aren't you?

187
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,559
Wretch.

188
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,360
I want everyone in the world

189
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
to see your lewd face.

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,120
See how wild you are!

191
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,799
No.

192
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,559
No!

193
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,639
Let me go.

194
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,600
Let me go.

195
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,200
Let me go.

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,000
Let go.

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,519
Let go.

198
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,639
Let go.

199
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,600
Wretch.

200
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,600
My ear.

201
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,799
You asked for it.

202
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,399
You bad guy!

203
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,960
Hui!

204
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,879
Wu Ming.

205
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,399
I'll kill you.

206
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,279
Kill you.

207
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,879
Beat you to death.

208
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,919
You bad guy.

209
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,240
What did you do!

210
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,159
Mom.

211
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,879
Hui.

212
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,600
Mr. Wu.

213
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
What do we do with them?

214
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
They need to face the music.

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,000
Take them!

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,799
Let go of me!

217
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,944
Go!

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,159
Hui.

219
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,120
It's all my fault.

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,600
I shouldn't have believed them. Sorry.

221
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,279
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,919
I'm so sorry.
