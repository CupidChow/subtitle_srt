00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,479
Well, Wu Ming!

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,399
Get out of my way!

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Gonna beat you up today.

6
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,880
Can we talk first?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,799
Is Meihui alright?

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,280
I want your life.

9
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,320
I'll kill you.

10
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,159
I'll kill you.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,200
Just beat you to death. I beat...

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,959
Mr. Wu,

13
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,000
your hands and legs...

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,480
Suddenly

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,319
a surge of energy
flows through the body,

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
right through my limbs and nerves.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,959
I'm good now!

18
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,519
See?

19
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,400
Magical, isn't it?

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,599
So it is.

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,319
Such a great plan, Mr. Wu.

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,359
You little brat, let go of me!

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,719
You hurt Meihui.

24
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,959
I won't let you off.

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,159
I just gave her the medicine.

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,719
Nothing will happen anytime soon.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,159
Stop the nonsense.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
Did you insert the needle

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,000
into Meihui's head or not?

30
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,319
You know it.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
You little brat.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Meihui never hurts you.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,040
Why did you hurt her?

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,200
I didn't hurt her.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,959
I was saving her.

36
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,760
That was for easing the ALS symptoms.

37
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,319
That's utter nonsense!

38
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,519
The doctor got it wrong!

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,280
Wu Ming,

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,840
if anything happens to my daughter.

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,439
I won't let you off.

42
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,040
This ma'am,

43
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,079
if you don't go out on your own,

44
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll have someone walk you out.

45
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,360
That's why you're so sure
about calling off the engagement.

46
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,400
Turns out you're tied
to a rich woman, huh?

47
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,840
You're so shady.

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Just you wait.

49
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Wait.

50
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,360
Phooey!

51
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm the one who got rejected.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,639
How come I'm being blamed?

53
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,039
You went with this plan.

54
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,360
Guess you want me to step in

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,000
and deal with your enemies?

56
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,319
You guessed it.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,199
Ms. Shen, you're sharp as ever.

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
You really don't have to do this.

59
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,560
Just say it.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
The Shen family is here to help you out.

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,439
Tell me.

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,719
Who's it?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,439
The person who caused the car crush

64
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,280
is Long Gang from the Long Group.

65
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,599
I hope you will

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,919
bring him to justice.

67
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,879
About the evidence,

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,919
please have someone look into it.

69
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,599
Alright.

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,199
I've got this.

71
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,439
Mr. Wu,

72
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,039
don't forget our agreement.

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,039
Sure.

74
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll keep you posted.

75
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,039
I'll leave you here

76
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,599
for good rest.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,759
Why laugh? What's so funny?

78
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,759
Didn't even stop it.

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,719
It could be serious.

80
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,960
You upset me today.

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,759
Upset you? How?

82
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,599
Totally random.

83
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,039
Now that it's out in the open,

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,000
what do we do now?

85
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,120
With the Shens involved,

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,280
Long Gang is off our backs.

87
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,000
The only problem now

88
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,879
is Shen Guohao

89
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,960
doing something crazy.

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,039
First, call Yang Ling.

91
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,520
Ask her to find a safe spot to hide.

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,759
As for Wang Meihui,

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,719
no further delay.

94
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,919
Call her yourself.

95
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,039
I'm not your servant.

96
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
Wang Meihui had this strange disease.

97
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
What a pity.

98
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,399
So annoying!

99
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,600
Never got her.

100
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,040
It just makes me want it even more.

101
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,439
Mr. Yang, why are you here?

102
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,360
Ms. Wang.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,759
Meihui's got this strange disease.

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,448
No cure for it.

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,959
What's the point
of staying in the hospital?

106
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,279
The point?

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,079
Where else can she stay?

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
She might pass out at any moment.

109
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,040
Her life's always at risk.

110
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm her mom.

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,480
I can't just watch her...

112
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,199
Ms. Wang.

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,040
Ms. Wang.

114
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,639
Cheer up.

115
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,000
The world is full of eccentric people.

116
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,240
I happen to know one.

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
He can change destinies.

118
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,319
A lot of big shots trust him.

119
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,319
Is it true?

120
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,000
Of course, it's true!

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,600
Ms. Wang, as long as there's a chance,

122
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,560
we shouldn't give up.

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
Let's protect Meihui together.

124
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,400
Right.

125
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,439
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

126
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,399
Thanks a lot!

127
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,079
Mr. Yang,

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,079
I decided to see this so-called master

129
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,800
to make my mom feel better.

130
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,680
If you have any intentions,

131
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,040
you will be disappointed.

132
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,720
I don't have much time left.

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,800
Don't waste your time.

134
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,920
This master is truly powerful.

135
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,079
You'll know.

136
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,720
Please check

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Wang Meihui's room.

138
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
Sure, on it now.

139
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,279
Wait.

140
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,920
What else?

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,279
Did she actually take it?

142
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,959
I bought the medicine myself.

143
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
And I watched her take it.

144
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,720
Mr. Wu, if I may,

145
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,800
no guy has ever won her heart.

146
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,920
If you don't give it your all
to win her over,

147
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
I'd suggest you quit now.

148
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,512
(Shrine)

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,079
Ms. Wang, we're at the shrine now.

150
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,959
Shrine.

151
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,319
Hui, I see hope.

152
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,199
Let's go.

153
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,680
Stop there.

154
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,399
Master Wang, what's wrong?

155
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,519
Hello, Master.

156
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
This lady,

157
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
you can't come in.

158
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,319
I?

159
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:29,839
Master,

160
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,319
why?

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,959
Something's following you.

162
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,079
Master,

163
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,519
what is it?

164
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,959
A disfigured man

165
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,839
with shattered limbs.

166
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,639
(Husband!)

167
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,079
(Husband!)

168
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,040
Master, how did you know?

169
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,959
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

170
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,399
You should leave.

171
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Her problem first.

172
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,120
She's dying.

173
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,839
Master.

174
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,240
Please.

175
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,639
Save my Meihui.

176
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,079
I'll do

177
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,399
anything.

178
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,120
Great thanks.

179
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,879
Alright.

180
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,439
I'm leaving.

181
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,040
Meihui, be good.

182
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm just outside waiting for you.

183
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,079
- Mom
- Be good.

184
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,040
Master, thank you.

185
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,839
Be good.

186
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,079
Oh my gosh.

187
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,040
That's so scary!

188
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,680
Come in.

189
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,799
Let's go.

190
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,464
Please.
