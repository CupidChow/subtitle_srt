00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,640
What's wrong?

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,320
Afraid I'll poison you?

5
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,079
This is your place.

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Would you dare?

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,920
Mr. Long, stop beating around the bush.

8
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,280
It's becoming boring.

9
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,439
Chairman Yang

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,680
is now gravely ill.

11
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,640
The Yang family business

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,359
is in a precarious situation.

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,359
Your second uncle
wants to rise to power.

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,760
I think

15
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,840
you've figured

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
all these out already, haven't you?

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,000
If Mr. Long

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,840
came today just to tell me these,

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
there's no need keep talking.

20
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,599
Calm down.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
Let's put it this way.

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,840
The Yang Group's success

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,439
was mostly made by your dad.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,640
But he passed away so young.

25
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,079
You and your sister

26
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,400
are too new to the game.

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,640
Not enough clout.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,599
But the shares you hold

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
are the most

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
besides your grandpa.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,519
So,

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
if your grandpa

33
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,879
really

34
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:09,960
passes away,

35
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,840
and something happened to you two,

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,960
what would happen?

37
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,840
What do you mean?

38
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,240
Alright.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
I'll be straight.

40
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,599
Your second uncle asked me

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,039
to collaborate with him.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
He wants to take you down

43
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,360
so that he can take power.

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,319
After that,

45
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll get some shares of the Yang Group.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
Long Gang.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,319
Do you think your petty tricks

48
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,120
could bring chaos to our family?

49
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,199
We have power struggles,

50
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,400
but we will not kill each other.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,759
Miss Yang, you may be smart,

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
but I think

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
you're a little too naive.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,680
I can't handle this matter myself.

55
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,599
Only if your Long family takes action,
will it be foolproof.

56
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,680
Do you believe now?

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,759
Why do you tell me

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,159
about this?

59
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,520
Let me be honest with you.

60
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,400
For me, whether working

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
with you or your uncle,

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,759
it makes

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
no difference.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,599
Don't be delusional.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,080
Working with you

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
is like partnering with a tiger.

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,919
Our family's own matters,

68
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,039
I will handle them.

69
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,280
I knew you wouldn't give in.

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,560
But I

71
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,599
don't want to be cruel either.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,479
Well, doing one thing

73
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,759
with different approaches

74
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,240
will yield different results.

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,599
And my method

76
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,560
is to keep you and your sister

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,000
in my own hands.

78
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,840
You drugged the wine?

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,479
Sha!

80
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,680
Sha!

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,719
Sha!

82
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,080
Sha!

83
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,400
Go ahead, scream.

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,759
Scream.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
Scream all you want.

86
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,120
They are already under my control.

87
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
But don't worry.

88
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,680
I won't lay a hand on you tonight.

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,199
Unless you beg me.

90
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,199
Then I won't be able to refuse.

91
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,079
Run!

92
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,560
Hurry up.

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,959
How about it?

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,439
Are you in a lot of pain now?

95
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,800
Long Gang.

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,199
I'd rather die

97
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,839
than let you succeed!

98
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,319
Aren't you always lofty

99
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,240
like an ice queen?

100
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,600
Tonight, I want you to see

101
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,399
what you

102
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,879
look like

103
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,879
when you fall!

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,319
Excuse me.

105
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,480
Are you Lei Changhe?

106
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,519
Who are you?

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
How did you get in?

108
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,000
Through the window.

109
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,800
Nonsense!

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,079
This is the thirteenth floor.

111
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,480
I don't care that.

112
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,600
Get out of here!

113
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,360
So you are Lei Changhe?

114
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,439
You're Lei Changhe!

115
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,319
Are you crazy?

116
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,279
This is Lei Changhe's room.

117
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,079
The person in the photo is him.

118
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,639
Where is he?

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,839
Your whole family is nuts!

120
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,160
Don't want to die?

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,319
Get out now!

122
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,839
Mouth stinks.

123
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,959
Burning inside.

124
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,040
You're all about desire.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
I'll help you cool down.

126
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,199
I see.

127
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,120
You really do have a death wish.

128
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,920
I...

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,519
I sealed your Niwangong

130
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,680
to make you calm down.

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,600
The drug is strong.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,759
If not treated soon,

133
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,879
you'll die.

134
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,120
(Seal the acupoints now.)

135
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,839
(How can I help her detoxify?)

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,639
(This drug is so powerful!)

137
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,160
(She broke the seal through?)
