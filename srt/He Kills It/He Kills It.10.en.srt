2
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,479
I'm good now.

4
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,280
Thank you!

5
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,600
Great thanks.

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,920
Wu Ming is a brat!

7
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,439
Not so easy next time.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,399
Ms. Wang,

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,439
you better watch your mouth.

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,760
Sorry.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,920
Doc,

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,799
what about my daughter's report?

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,959
Did he poison her?

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,439
Wang Meihui's report is quite strange.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,799
All indicators appear normal.

16
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,680
All values
are at the high end of normal.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,879
What?

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,959
And...

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,599
And what?

20
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,359
A 3-cm needle in her brain.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
A 3-cm needle?

22
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,760
How is it?

23
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,799
Her brain

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,000
was just check after the MRI.

25
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,120
Nothing there.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,159
Could it...

27
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,439
Could it just happen
in the last few days?

28
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,959
Not a silver needle.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
A very small bone needle.

30
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,799
It's in the skull sutures.

31
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,400
Hard to detect.

32
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,280
A bone needle in the brain?

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,719
Doc,

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,640
is this fatal?

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Any ways

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,599
to save her?

37
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,879
Can you remove it?

38
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,159
We have no way.

39
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,400
You need to consult a neurologist.

40
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,599
The brain structure is too complex.

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,599
A slight mistake

42
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,360
could lead to accidents.

43
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,120
How could this happen?

44
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,199
Where did this come from?

45
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,240
How could there be a bone needle
in the brain?

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Could Dr. Xu

47
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,000
have a way?

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
If he does,

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,719
I'll surely tell you.

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,919
That curse, Wu Ming, is to blame.

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
What bad luck

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,599
is this for our family?

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,439
I'd suggest staying on good terms
with my grandmaster.

54
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,960
It won't hurt you.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,280
Grandmaster?

56
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,639
You said Grandmaster?

57
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,039
Doc,

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,719
who is

59
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,360
your grandmaster?

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Doc,

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,159
you haven't finished.

62
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,400
Mom,

63
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,960
I brought you your meal.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Eat it hot.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,479
Mom.

66
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
What's going on?

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,879
What happened?

68
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,680
Hui,

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
Doc sent

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,719
your medical report.

71
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,719
Wu Ming poisoned my medicine, huh?

72
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,879
Stay calm.

73
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Listen.

74
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,000
Sister, what happened?

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,120
Feeling unwell?

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,199
No.

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,360
I spotted you through the window
when you came into the yard.

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,759
Your way of walking looked kind of odd.

79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,680
Need a doctor?

80
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,879
(That wretch embarrassed me.)

81
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,959
No worries.

82
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,000
Stop looking.

83
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,160
You go first.

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199
Sister, are you okay?

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,800
Did you maybe drain somewhere?

86
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,759
I'm really fine.

87
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,279
Don't ask again.

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you still remember

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
that person I mentioned last time?

90
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,439
He's really a miracle doctor.

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Today I saw with my own eyes

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,519
that he brought someone back to life.

93
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,360
Really?

94
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,759
Where's he?

95
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
Did you bring him back?

96
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,519
He snuck off.

97
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,160
I sent Yu to look for him.

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,759
Find him

99
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,160
wherever he is.

100
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,079
The clock is ticking.

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,399
Sister,

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,839
are you worried about Grandpa?

103
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,839
(Do I really have to)

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,959
(marry someone I don't love
for the Yang family?)

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,199
Who are you?

106
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,759
I am Wu Ming.

107
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,040
Delivering gifts for Yang Ling.

108
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Got an appointment?

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,279
Appointment for delivering gifts?

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,319
Of course.

111
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,160
Miss gets tons of visitors every day.

112
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,279
Does she have to meet with everyone?

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,199
Our relationship is quite special.

114
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,360
Do me a favor. Let me in.

115
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll remember it.

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Are you some distant relative
of the Yangs

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,959
from the mountains?

118
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,680
Not blood,

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,639
but closer than family.

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,680
Look,

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,079
if you don't believe me,

122
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,160
call Yang Ling.

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,959
I'll talk to her.

124
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,879
Captain.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A situation at Gate 2.

126
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,560
Bring him to the station.

127
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,759
Need some guys here.

128
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,079
No.

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,319
If not allowed in,

130
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,319
I'll just leave.

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
(Ms. Yang, all our key projects)

132
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,680
(have been blocked
by some mysterious force.)

133
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,319
(Its cash flow
exceeds a hundred billion.)

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,959
(With no external support,)

135
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,040
(our key projects are at risk.)

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,439
(If you agree to marry my son,
Shen Guohao,)

137
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
(the Shen family is ready to jump in)

138
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,680
(and solve your crisis.)

139
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,959
(No need to answer right away.)

140
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,240
(I believe)

141
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:09,040
(you'll make the smart decision
for the Yang Group,)

142
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,399
(since it's on the brink.)

143
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,680
What're you doing?

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,439
Don't touch me.

145
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:58,920
I...

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,879
I can't swim.

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,439
You can't swim?

148
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
No rivers where I'm from.

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,279
It's heavily guarded here.

150
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,319
How did you get in?

151
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,560
Blocked during the day.

152
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,639
I climbed in at night.

153
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,360
You're trespassing.

154
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,439
I could have you locked up.

155
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:21,959
Wife.

156
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,360
Shut up.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,879
I'm not your wife.

158
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,920
Listen.

159
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,639
Forget about that night.

160
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,240
Didn't I give you ten million
to get lost?

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,800
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
I get it.

163
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,240
Never satisfied, huh?

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,039
Ten million isn't enough?

165
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,879
Money means nothing to me.

166
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,519
I came here for you.

167
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,720
For me?

168
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,840
You have quite an ambition.

169
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,440
Are you good enough?

170
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,519
This

171
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,279
is an 800-year-old wild ginseng,

172
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,039
just right for boosting your energy.

173
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,279
This packet

174
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,559
is formulated herbal medicine
to help with pregnancy.

175
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Kidneys

176
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,720
are key
for a stable pregnancy.

177
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,759
All these here

178
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
are good for spleen, kidneys,

179
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,440
and blood.

180
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,600
Are you mad?

181
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm not pregnant!

182
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,919
And these

183
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,559
are clothes,

184
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,440
and baby formula.

185
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,080
A boy and a girl. Twins.

186
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,399
Are you deaf?

187
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,960
Ling, trust me.

188
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,440
You will be a mom.

189
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
Crazy.

190
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,240
You're just crazy.

191
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
Want to marry me like this?

192
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,679
I'm telling the truth.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,279
You're really ignorant.

194
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,639
One night isn't enough to get pregnant.

195
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,320
Even if it did,

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
you wouldn't know for a week.

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,919
Honestly, go get your head checked.

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,799
You short on cash?

199
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,320
Okay, another ten mil.

200
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,600
Now get lost.

201
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,600
Bank account?

202
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,679
Listen up.

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,200
I won't ask you for another cent.

204
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,679
Consider that ten million

205
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,039
as a loan.

206
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,159
These

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
are for you and our child.

208
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,679
They're not worth much.

209
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,559
But they show my care.

210
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,240
And as I said, you are pregnant.

211
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,720
Don't doubt my medical skills.

212
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,679
I believe there are
many unique people and things out there.

213
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,639
But I don't think you're one of them.

214
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,720
I can prove it.

215
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,559
I've told you I'll be responsible.

216
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,080
I'll surely keep my word.

217
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,159
I also know

218
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,320
the Yang family is now deeply mired.

219
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,720
I'll protect you.

220
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,879
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,039
I don't have time for your fantasies.

222
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,759
Also, drop all those unrealistic dreams
about me.

223
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
I've decided to marry Shen Guohao.

224
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,759
What?

225
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,320
You claim to protect me.

226
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,120
With what?

227
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,120
Shen Guohao

228
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,840
is one of the heirs of the Shen Group.

229
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,600
The Shen family has connections
and wealth you can't even imagine.

230
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,720
Once I marry into the Shen family,

231
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,639
my family's crisis
will be solved easily.

232
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,279
What've you got then?

233
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,480
Leave now.

234
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,799
Don't look for me again.

235
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,279
Don't get yourself dragged
into the mess.

236
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,039
Forget that ridiculous night.
