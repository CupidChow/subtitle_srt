2
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,920
To awaken a vegetative patient

4
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,560
is so difficult.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,560
Such medical miracles are very rare.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,759
But I believe in you.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,679
Your blind trust like this

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,119
puts a lot of pressure on me.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,079
Wu Ming, give me a definite answer.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,840
Does my grandpa have hope?

11
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,400
Traditional Chinese medicine
calls it as "Shi Jue".

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,560
It means the evil displaces the spirit,

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,719
and damages the brain.

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,439
The spirit is displaced.

15
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,680
The mind is injured,

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,599
leading to a loss of cognitive function.

17
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,719
To restore, the 12th

18
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,280
of the Divine Thirteen Needles,

19
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,480
Risky Life-saving Trick,

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,040
may bring the spirit back.

21
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,040
As you mentioned,

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,159
do you master

23
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,000
the 12th one?

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,168
Yes.

25
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,040
But I never did it.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,000
Its success rate is super low,
like 10 to 20 percent.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,599
Wu Ming,

28
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,359
don't even talk about one in ten.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
Even if it's one in a hundred,

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,439
I've still got to try.

31
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,319
Wu Ming,

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,120
please do it for Grandfather.

33
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,840
Even if it fails,

34
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,159
I won't blame you.

35
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,200
The risk is just way too high.

36
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,359
The last two
of the Divine Thirteen Needles

37
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,599
are seriously dangerous.
It's life and death.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,840
A couple of things first.

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,120
Might boost my odds by 30%.

40
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,239
What is it?

41
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,319
Ghost Needle.

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,080
Professor Song, how's it going?

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,240
We've pinpointed the exact location

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,680
of this bone needle

45
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,439
using the marking method.

46
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,039
Can this be removed?

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

48
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,680
Great.

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,840
The probability of death is 99%.

50
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,599
Professor Song.

51
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,584
The probability of death is 99%?

52
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,719
What does this mean?

53
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,039
This bone needle is now entangled
with the brain nerves.

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,599
Almost integrated.

55
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,800
So, I'd say
don't forcefully take it out.

56
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,400
Mom.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
How come nobody found it sooner?

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,759
It has been in the brain

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,280
for at least three years.

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,199
Three years?

61
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,919
Such a pity for a good girl.

62
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,719
At least three years.

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,400
Was it the Wu family that put it in,
Mom?

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
That terrible Wu family!

65
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,319
It's all his fault.

66
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,159
Miss,

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
calm down.

68
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,560
What I'm about to say,

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
please listen carefully.

70
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,199
Alright, please go ahead.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,759
Miss Wang

72
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,199
passed out a few times lately
for no apparent reason.

73
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
It's very likely

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,479
that her brain nerves
are being compressed.

75
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,479
Maybe Miss Wang will

76
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,599
faint more often.

77
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,520
And the chance of dying is really high.

78
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,719
Very high?

79
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,280
You mean,

80
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,800
whether or not she gets surgery,

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,400
she will definitely die?

82
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,520
Is that so?

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
You could say that.

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,199
I suggest,

85
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,599
if you've got unfinished business,

86
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,560
you should probably get to it.

87
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,159
Dr. Song,

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,919
please!

89
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,960
Save our Hui.

90
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,400
She's only 20.

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,360
Not even had a boyfriend.

92
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,520
Dr. Song, you can't let her die.

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,639
You're a leading brain expert.

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,719
Please save Hui.

95
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,840
I am begging you!

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,800
What are you doing?

97
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,560
Please get up.

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,240
Please.

99
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,759
I do want to save her.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,240
But I just can't do anything.

101
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,360
Mom, get up!

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,120
Mom.

103
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm just useless.

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
It's my fault.

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
Mom.

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Mom.

107
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,600
Not your fault, Mom.

108
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,120
It's my fate.

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,399
I don't blame anyone.

110
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,160
No.

111
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,279
This isn't your fate.

112
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,879
It's the fault

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
of the Wu family. Of Wu Ming.

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,920
If anything happens to you,

115
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,439
I'll just destroy him with my life.

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,279
I'm settling this with him.

117
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,519
- Right now!
- Mom.

118
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
Hui, are you alright?

119
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
Mom, I feel dizzy.

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,920
I want some rest.

121
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,000
Alright.

122
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,759
Considering Old Mr. Yang's
health condition,

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,319
now, the biggest shareholder,
Mr. Yang Tingjian

124
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,000
will step in as the temporary chairman.

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,759
Next up, we'll announce the CEO changes.

126
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,759
Ms. Yang Ling is dismissed as CEO.

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,959
Mr. Long Gang is the new CEO.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
My dear Ice Queen.

129
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,120
You left the business empire
built by your grandpa and dad.

130
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,120
I'd really like to interview you.

131
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,279
Do you regret your choice back then?

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Sorry to disappoint you.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Whether up on a mountain top
or down in a valley,

134
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,279
I'd never pick a filthy bug like you.

135
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:50,959
You!

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,279
Hey, don't forget.

137
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,439
Even if I get fired now,

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm still one of the main shareholders
of the Yang Group.

139
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,480
You won't make it.

140
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,600
(Wretch!)

141
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,360
(Sooner or later,
you'll come begging to me.)

142
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,959
Come on.

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,439
Congrats to Mr. Yang
on taking over the Yang Group!

144
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,759
Teaming up closely with the Long family.

145
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,240
Dominating Loong City.

146
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,439
You're too kind, Mr. Jin.

147
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,199
Thanks to Mr. Shen for stepping.

148
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,160
We then managed to crush

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,000
those minor shareholders
siding with Yang Ling.

150
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
From now on,

151
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,079
my Yang Group is doing
whatever Mr. Shen says.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,800
Honestly, the Yang Group

153
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,279
is peanuts to my Shen Group.

154
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm helping you just to get Yang Ling.

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,439
Yes.

156
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,680
She's really getting squeezed right now.

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
If Mr. Shen shows her a life raft,

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,199
she'll be grateful and, you know,

159
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,399
give herself to you.

160
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,959
That's a sure thing.

161
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,439
Mr. Shen,

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,759
Yang Ling is a pretty tough woman.

163
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,839
I heard she's pretty close

164
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,279
with that Wu guy.

165
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,360
To win her over,

166
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm afraid

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,839
it's not that easy.

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Wu Ming?

169
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,000
Just a tiny ant, nothing more.

170
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,839
I have a ton of ways to handle him.

171
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,120
A ton, indeed!

172
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
Cheers to Mr. Shen!

173
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,839
Come on, cheers!

174
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,360
Here.

175
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:08,920
No need.

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,519
You need it!

177
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,920
You're a patient now.

178
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,040
Should eat more.

179
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,319
What are you doing?

180
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,399
Your arms and legs are broken.

181
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You're stuck.

182
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,040
Yue, you've got a lot of guts.

183
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,639
Any respect to me?

184
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,559
Grandmaster.

185
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,679
You're a patient now.

186
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,679
Make your acting feel real.

187
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,279
Others will then believe.

188
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,759
Mr. Wu, all ready.

189
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,559
We won't mess up.

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,159
But

191
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
does this method really work?

192
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,120
Of course.

193
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,120
Some just see me as an ant,

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,759
a thorn in their eyes and a real pain.

195
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,840
But others see me as a treasure,

196
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,120
and a lifeline.

197
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,200
So,

198
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,519
leveraging strength is crucial.

199
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,840
Grandmaster.

200
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm the one

201
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,039
who sees you as a treasure.

202
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Yue,

203
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,039
you're getting

204
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,320
pretty bold lately.

205
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,399
Don't you know about personal space?

206
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Back off.

207
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,080
You're a patient.

208
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,000
You should be nice.

209
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
Back off.

210
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,840
Doctor.

211
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,480
Doctor.
