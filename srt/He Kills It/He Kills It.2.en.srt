3
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,520
(Wang Family Villa)

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,560
Mr. Ming,

5
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
your fiancée's family is really wealthy.

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,679
Auntie?

7
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,000
Are you Wu Ming?

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,600
Yes.

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,679
Mr. Ming,

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,200
your fiancée is so beautiful.

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,159
Auntie, you are too kind.

12
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,159
Came here to greet me.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,680
You're too self-righteous.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
You think you're worthy?

15
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,079
What do you mean?

16
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,359
Wu Ming,

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,879
you're just a nobody
from the deep mountains.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,840
You're not worthy of my daughter at all.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,239
Our family owns assets
worth tens of millions.

20
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,159
In Loong City, we are among the elite.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,920
You can't reach our level.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,719
Wang Meihui,

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
is that how you feel too?

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,959
Wu Ming,

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,920
although our marriage

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,799
was arranged by the elders,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
I am in charge of my own life.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,959
My husband

29
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,519
must be a true hero

30
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,159
with great success.

31
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,959
We from two different worlds.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,159
I hope you understand that.

33
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,159
You!

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,439
You two

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
are really snobbish.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
You've got it all wrong.

37
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,560
When I saved you...

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,319
Nonsense!

39
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,080
Wu Ming,

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,280
marriage is no child's play.

41
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,840
Take the money and go.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,000
But you're not healed.

43
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,080
I'm here to treat you.

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,879
Shut up!

45
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,319
Keep this up,

46
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,879
I will kick you out.

47
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,599
Do you believe it?

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,159
Sweetie, hurry.

49
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,120
Mr. Yang is here.

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,000
Hurry!

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,680
Hurry up.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,439
Quick.

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Truly a snob.

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,000
Mr. Yang,

55
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,759
please.

56
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,120
Meihui,

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,719
long time no see.

58
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,680
I really miss...

59
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,840
Mr. Yang, please behave yourself.

60
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,680
How can you talk to him like that?

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,000
He is one of the heirs

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
to the Yang Group!

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,000
If you can latch onto him,

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,599
we'd soar to new heights!

65
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,919
Break it off

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,919
with that hillbilly.

67
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,599
(This hillbilly is her fiancé?)

68
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,919
(I'll handle him.)

69
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,599
Mr. Shuangying,

70
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,240
help me take someone down.

71
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,879
Tonight,

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,159
I want his hands placed before me.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
(BBQ, Night Snack)
Hurry up!

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,639
I'm coming! Be patient!

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Mr. Ming, what are you going to do?

76
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,280
When I came out,

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,479
I promised two things.

78
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,240
One is curing my fiancée's illness.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,919
Come on.

80
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,840
And the second?

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
To practice and promote

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,039
traditional Chinese medicine.

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,439
(KARLET)
That's great!

84
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,159
Let's open a clinic together.

85
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,240
You treat patients.

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,879
I manage the business!

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,719
Okay.

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,680
How much do you have?

89
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
Three to five hundred...

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Bucks.

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,680
That's it.

92
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,680
Forget it.

93
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,520
Over there!

94
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,280
Finally found you.

95
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,439
You hungry?

96
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,400
- Meeting is fate.
- Come on.

97
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,080
Have some.

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Second Miss said
your medical skills are amazing.

99
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
She wants to invite you
to treat our master.

100
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,240
You look only in your early twenties.

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,759
Are you really skilled?

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,439
You've got the wrong guy.

103
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,960
I am just a common doctor.

104
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,279
We're closed!

105
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,439
Don't want to get beaten up.

106
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,120
Get lost right now!

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,879
Go, hurry!

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Go.

109
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,959
You are Wu Ming, aren't you?

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,519
You're quite arrogant.

111
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,240
Who do you think you are?

112
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,120
Who are you?

113
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,920
You look pretty cute.

114
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,000
Come with me.

115
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,079
I'll treat you well.

116
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,399
Dare to touch me?

117
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,120
Don't you want your hands anymore?

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,720
You hear that?

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
So cool!

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,279
Just my type.

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,319
Listen.

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,879
No one who dares threaten me

123
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,920
has been born yet.

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,680
Big Bro!

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Let go of me, you wretch!

126
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,959
Are you looking to die?

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,079
You dare mess with the Yang family?

128
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Guys, get her!

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,079
You're dead meat!

130
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,680
Then tell me how I'm dead meat.

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,560
My Boss is Loong City Twin-Gun,
Liu Shuangying.

132
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,839
He said

133
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,040
that he wants your arms.

134
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,120
Don't want to get shot.

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,319
Just break your arms yourself.

136
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,279
Let's see who dares to touch me today.

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,240
What big talk!

138
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,959
Release them now.

139
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,920
My Boss is here.

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
Let me go

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
if you don't want to die!

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,120
Alright.

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
You fight well

144
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,120
and you're pretty bold.

145
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,399
What a pity.

146
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,240
Have you thought of how to die?

147
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
Yes, I have.

148
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,959
Live to a ripe old age,

149
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,519
then go peacefully.

150
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,000
Or maybe you can tell me,

151
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,800
how I should die?

152
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,800
Everyone knows

153
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,160
that with golden and silver guns,

154
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,279
I'm in charge of Loong City.

155
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,160
If I want your hands,

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,879
you won't be able to protect them.

157
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,199
Guys!

158
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
Cut off his hands!

159
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,399
Wait.

160
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,399
You are Mr. Liu, right?

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,439
So beautiful.

162
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,079
I told you to read more.

163
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Promotion must start with young people.

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,199
I got it.

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,519
Miss, you know me?

166
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,079
Then you must know Lei Changhe.

167
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
Don't go calling my boss by name

168
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,480
just because you're my fan.

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Lei Changhe.

170
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,560
Do you have a subordinate
named Liu Shuangying?

171
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,240
Subordinate?

172
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,000
Ask him

173
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,399
if he messed
with someone he shouldn't have.

174
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,920
Liu Shuangying!

175
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,639
Mr. Lei.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720
Liu Shuangying,

177
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,560
if you want to die, don't drag me down!

178
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,839
You dare provoke the Yang family?

179
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,279
Are you insane,

180
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,240
or just dumb?

181
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,879
How dare you do that!

182
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,839
Mr. Lei, you don't know.

183
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
It's Mr. Yang's order.

184
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,519
Take your men

185
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,680
and get lost now!

186
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,600
Yes, Mr. Lei.

187
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,639
Miss, I'm sorry.

188
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,959
What have I told you guys?

189
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,480
Just do one thing. Make money!

190
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
Don't bring me

191
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,319
into such useless thing!

192
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,399
- Got it.
- Let's go!

193
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,319
Boss!

194
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,959
Boss!

195
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,439
Sir,

196
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,839
please tell us.

197
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,399
Do you really know medicine?

198
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,360
If you do, what's your rank?

199
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,399
I'm just an ordinary doctor.

200
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,920
No official rank.

201
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,879
Miss, I told you.

202
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,639
Don't waste time here with him.

203
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,759
Let's go.

204
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,399
Miss!

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,040
Don't go!

206
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,079
Give us a chance.

207
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,600
My buddy is a miracle doctor!

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,159
Mr. Ming,

209
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,200
we're not bragging.

210
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,480
Just tell them the truth!

211
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,720
How pretty they are!

212
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,320
Having them with us,

213
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,759
isn't it nice?

214
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,200
Let's go.

215
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,320
What a pity!

216
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,000
Stop.

217
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,639
Stop!

218
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,200
Don't go!

219
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Stop.

220
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,559
You can't leave.

221
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
This is all because of you.

222
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,960
You must pay!

223
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,720
Pay money!

224
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,879
You're right.

225
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,799
How much?

226
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,639
3,000.

227
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,679
3,000?

228
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,919
3,000.

229
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,080
What are you doing?

230
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
What?

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,000
Boss.

232
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
This is all I've got.

233
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,320
Is it enough?

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Want to dodge the bill?

235
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,559
Call the police!

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,879
I don't have money.

237
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,799
Boss,

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,919
are you sick?

239
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,559
You!

240
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,759
You are the one who is sick!

241
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,000
Who are you cursing?

242
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,639
Boss, can I have a word?

243
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,600
Impossible!

244
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Boss.

245
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,679
Are you impotent?

246
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,039
Nonsense!

247
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
Even medicine doesn't help?

248
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
How do you know?

249
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
I just read your wife's aura.

250
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Nonsense.

251
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,519
From my wife's aura,

252
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,360
you know I am impotent?

253
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,799
Ridiculous!

254
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,279
I have a remedy

255
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,279
that can replenish your vitality.

256
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,159
Make you feel like new.

257
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,960
I don't sell it normally.

258
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,600
Listen.

259
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
We don't earn much.

260
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
You can't let him walk off like that.

261
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,320
You stop...

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,440
I...

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,519
What did you do?

264
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,240
What did you give my husband to eat?
