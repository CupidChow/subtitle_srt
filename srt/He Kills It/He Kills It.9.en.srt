2
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,679
Grandmaster, Miss. Please continue.

4
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,759
Not what you think.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,200
She wants it. Not me.

6
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,200
Oh no.

7
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,799
They must've misunderstood.

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,239
How about you go out and explain it?

9
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,040
I can't make you speak immediately.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,879
I'm exhausted.

11
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,799
Need a good rest.

12
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,799
Let me have some rest.

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,959
When did they get together?

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,560
They only met twice.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,959
Twice?

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
Awesome.

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,760
Then she's my grandmaster's wife.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
You misunderstood.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,640
I thought he wanted to sleep.

20
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,120
So I just...

21
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,480
But he...

22
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,120
Nothing happened.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,760
Don't let anyone disturb him.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,519
Tell me immediately when he wakes up.

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,079
Already over?

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,400
The grandmaster isn't that strong.

27
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,560
Didn't you say it's foolproof?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,919
Just because of some nobody,

29
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,159
your plan got ruined.

30
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,879
Mr. Long,

31
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,520
guess I need
to reconsider our cooperation.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,560
This

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
is our cooperation agreement.

34
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,240
Sign here.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,120
Your shares in the Yang Group

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,840
will exceed those of the two sisters.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Then, you'll have a real voice

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,199
in the Yang Group.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,960
As for that Wu guy,

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,240
I'll make him disappear.

41
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,520
Mr. Yang,

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,280
if you don't want any changes,

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
I still recommend

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
you make Old Mr. Yang

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,319
enjoy his afterlife sooner.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,919
Grandpa!

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,080
Grandpa!

48
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,159
Mom.

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,159
Hui.

50
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,439
You're awake, Hui.

51
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,599
Mom, did I faint again?

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,039
Doc said you were anxious and angry.

53
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,400
Just some rest. You'll be fine.

54
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,800
It's all Wu Ming's fault.

55
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,120
How is Grandpa?

56
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,120
Is he alright?

57
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,960
He's fine.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,319
He's recovered now.

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,159
Mom,

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
did anything happen
when I was passed out?

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,800
Dr. Xu arrived just in time.

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,840
He applied advanced acupuncture.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
That's how Grandpa was saved.

64
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,199
Wu Ming even tried to steal credit.

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Grandpa didn't wake up.

66
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,840
Scared of blame,

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
he just bolted.

68
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,439
I would've thrown him in jail today

69
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,080
if Grandpa wasn't so weak.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,639
I'm just wondering

71
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,759
why Grandpa

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
arranged this marriage
in the first place?

73
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,599
Alright, Mom.

74
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,680
Let's not talk about him.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,879
The most important thing now

76
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,960
is keeping Dr. Xu treating Grandpa.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,400
Right.

78
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,639
See Grandpa.

79
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay.

80
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,680
Mr. Ming,

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,800
you're quite popular now.

82
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,360
Many await outside to see you.

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
Where's Wang Meihui?

84
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,240
Mr. Ming,

85
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,680
are you still thinking about her?

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,079
Isn't Miss Yang Ling nice?

87
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,319
I'll tell you later.

88
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,240
First, take me to her.

89
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,759
Alright.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
Have a good sleep.

91
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,040
What are you doing here?

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,959
Wang Meihui,

93
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,199
something prevented your illness

94
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,399
from fully healing.

95
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Now it's about to come back.

96
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,319
Address it quickly,
or it could be serious.

97
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,680
But I'm completely drained today.

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,839
Can't do much now.

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,040
Here, take this pill

100
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,680
first.

101
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
I'll cure you after I recover.

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,519
Are you finished?

103
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,279
If so, you can go.

104
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,720
I...

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
You get out!

106
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,079
Get out!

107
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,560
Are you trying to ruin our family?

108
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,720
Get out!

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,839
Mom.

110
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,959
What did you do to my mom?

111
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,199
She deserves it.

112
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,120
A closed mouth catches no flies.

113
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,319
I just want her to be silent.

114
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Seriously, you're pissing me off.

115
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,199
I'm asking you to leave.

116
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,079
Get out!

117
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,319
If I didn't value life,

118
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,360
I would let you go.

119
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,040
Better not.

120
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,000
Get out!

121
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,399
You despicable and shameless one.

122
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,120
Why can't I move?

123
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,360
Let's go.

124
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,399
What exactly did you feed me?

125
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,240
Someone, help!

126
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,720
Wu Ming!

127
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:15,560
Run!

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:15,959
Now!

129
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,160
Wu Ming, come here!

130
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Mr. Ming!

131
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,319
Mr. Ming!

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Stop running.

133
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,240
Mr. Ming.

134
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,160
Mr. Ming, don't go!

135
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,439
I have a big deal for you.

136
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,000
You couldn't even handle

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,199
all the money coming your way.

138
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,839
Wait.

139
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,199
Why are we running?

140
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,279
It's a mess.

141
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,240
No time for them.

142
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,959
By the way,

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,279
my wife said she gave me a thousand.

144
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Not checked it yet.

145
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,800
Well,

146
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,839
it's not even worth mentioning.

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,279
It's less than the barbecue we had.

148
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,079
Let's go to the bank and check.

149
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:50,944
(Please enter the password.)

150
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,392
(Hello!)

151
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:52,640
(Balance: 10,000,000.00)

152
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,720
Bro,

153
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,279
you calling ten million

154
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,399
a thousand?

155
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,680
Miss Yang Ling is so extravagant!

156
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,079
Why all the sweat?

157
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,319
I'm poor.

158
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,639
Mr. Ming,

159
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,439
I haven't seen so much money in my life.

160
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm sticking with you from now on.

161
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't worry.

162
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,079
I'll get the clinic stuff covered.

163
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,279
Mr. Ming, look at you.

164
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,160
Got something big going on?

165
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,759
Very important.

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,319
Mr. Lei,

167
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,800
tell me about

168
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,079
Miss Yang Ling.

169
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
Have you two

170
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,720
crossed that line?

171
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,360
Awesome you!

172
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,879
Turns out, Long Gang

173
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,000
was just paving the way for you.

174
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
Be gentle.

175
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,879
Yang Ling

176
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,720
is the Eldest Miss
from a Fortune 500 family,

177
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,000
totally spoiled and pampered.

178
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
She's a global spotlight.

179
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,839
But lately,

180
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
her family's in a bit of a rough patch.

181
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
She's under a ton of pressure.

182
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,120
Bro,

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,920
you should

184
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,879
let some things go.

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,480
Look ahead, right?

186
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
What kind of woman are you into?

187
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Tell me.

188
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll...

189
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,319
Please be gentle.

190
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,439
Once I've chosen her,

191
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
I'll never change.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,399
I'll be her strongest support.

193
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,639
What kind of gift should I get my girl?

194
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,279
Mr. Ming,

195
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,840
Miss Yang Ling is like an angel.

196
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
How would I know what to get her?

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,919
What to get?

198
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,879
Got it.

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,159
Ms. Shen's arrival

200
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,919
really brightens up our place!

201
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,080
The first time I saw you,
you were just a teenager.

202
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,480
Now, you've grown into a real stunner.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Even made it onto the rich list.

204
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,240
Ms. Shen, I'm flattered.

205
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,840
Just some silly titles.

206
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,159
Don't call me Ms. Shen.

207
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,960
Old Master is my master.

208
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,639
If you don't mind,

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,519
call me Auntie Yu.

210
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,080
Auntie Yu?

211
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,360
You don't look a day over my age.

212
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
Lady Yu.

213
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,399
That won't do.

214
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,679
Seniority matters.

215
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,879
I'm here to discuss something important
with you.

216
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,879
What is it?

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,840
There's this big international fund,
SDG, trying to

218
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,279
exploit the friction
between you and Yang Tingjian,

219
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,759
to gobble up the Yang Group

220
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,759
and profit from it.

221
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,200
But don't worry.

222
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,039
I won't just sit back and watch.

223
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,480
That's why I'm here

224
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,360
to talk about a marriage alliance.

225
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,279
Marriage alliance?

226
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,240
If you agree to marry my son,
Shen Guohao,

227
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,360
the Shen family is ready to jump in

228
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
and solve your crisis.

229
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm sorry, Ms. Shen.

230
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,840
But I'll only marry

231
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
for love,

232
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
not for anything else.

233
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,799
No need to answer right away.

234
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
I believe

235
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,879
you'll make the smart decision
for the Yang Group,

236
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,000
since it's on the brink.

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,519
I'll leave.

238
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,519
Call me.

239
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,919
Sha,

240
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,200
look into that SDG

241
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,279
International Fund now.

242
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,799
Okay, Ms. Yang.
