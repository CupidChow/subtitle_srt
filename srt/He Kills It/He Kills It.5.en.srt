=He Kills It=

2
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 5=

3
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
How strange.

4
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,439
Have your neck muscles and nerves

5
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,439
suffered any special stimulus recently?

6
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,199
All previous examinations were stagnant.

7
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,199
But this time the test report shows

8
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,400
signs of activity.

9
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,039
Now you believe it, right?

10
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,599
Miss, don't get too excited yet.

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,680
Dr. Tang,

12
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,840
is this result accurate?

13
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Definitely.

14
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,439
Many methods have been used

15
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,400
stimulating her neck muscles and nerves,

16
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
but all didn't work.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,319
Tell me what happened!

18
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,599
This could possibly restore your voice.

19
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Dr. Tang,

20
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,159
do think it's possible

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,800
that without any medicine,

22
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
someone could just

23
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,000
wave a hand

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
and make it happen?

25
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,680
Impossible.

26
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Our understanding of the world seems

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,960
still too superficial.

28
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,879
Let's find that person.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,240
When you wake up...

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
When you wake up,
you won't be this obedient.

31
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,520
But don't worry.

32
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,560
I won't betray you.

33
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,200
You awake?

34
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,719
Who are you?

35
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,759
What did you do to me?

36
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not what I did to you,

37
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,560
but what you did to me.

38
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,039
You were drug-controlled.

39
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,039
You remember, right?

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,919
He is the one who drugged you.

41
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,199
If you really can't remember,

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,719
the phone over there recorded it.

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
It can prove my innocence.

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
Turn around!

45
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,879
Rest assured.

46
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,079
It's both our first times.

47
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,399
I'm Wu Ming. I have my ID card.

48
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,319
We can get married anytime.

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,959
I'll be accountable.

50
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,560
I'm warning you.

51
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,560
About tonight,

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,680
if you dare to tell anyone, you're dead.

53
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,040
Don't worry.

54
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,720
Since we have slept together,

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
we're allies.

56
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,759
Allies don't betray each other.

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Don't let your imagination run wild.

58
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,720
Even if it happened...

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,360
It's impossible for us to get together.

60
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
Here's ten million.

61
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,040
Take it and get lost.

62
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,279
Leave Loong City.

63
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Don't try to get close to me.

64
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,720
Otherwise, I will make you disappear.

65
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,959
Does this woman

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,519
think everything can be bought
with money?

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,480
I'll see this money as a loan for now.

68
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,639
Is there any news?

69
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,519
Miss.

70
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,879
Lei Changhe,

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm impressed.

72
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,560
Lei Changhe, hurry up!

73
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll destroy him!

74
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,360
Get him!

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,240
Go!

76
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,000
It's been a long time.

77
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,920
Anything wrong?

78
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,480
Miss, are you okay?

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,439
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,319
We were suddenly attacked.

81
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,720
Fortunately, Wu
and his men came to help, so...

82
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,560
Miss,

83
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,839
he actually offended the Yang family.

84
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,759
We definitely can't let this go.

85
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,879
(He offended Long Gang.)

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
(He won't get away.)

87
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,240
(Forget it.)

88
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
(I'll help this once.)

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,920
Come with me.

90
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,839
Honey?

91
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,519
Why are you here?

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
Miss me?

93
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:20,959
Sorry.

94
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,759
I didn't notice
so many people following you.

95
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,560
Don't get the wrong idea.

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
Nothing happened between us.

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Did you beat them?

98
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,879
How is it a beating?

99
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,160
That was self-defense.

100
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,480
Release them now.

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,399
Don't mess with the Longs.

102
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,319
Fine. For your sake.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,079
Don't underestimate him.

104
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,839
He absolutely hates you now.

105
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,279
If you want to live,

106
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,600
then get out of here now.

107
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,920
We've been together after all.

108
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,040
You do care about me.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,639
Wu,

110
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,199
keep an eye on my uncle.

111
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,720
Okay.

112
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,600
Mr. Ming,

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
the lipstick mark on your neck.

114
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,000
Could it be from Miss Yang Ling?

115
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll tell you later.

116
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
Mr. Lei,

117
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm Wu Ming.

118
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,639
Let's talk.

119
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,440
You're truly a skilled fighter.

120
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,200
Yet against sheer strength,

121
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,639
it's like an egg hitting a rock.

122
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,440
Long Gang always seeks revenge.

123
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,679
If I were you,

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,519
I'd find a place to hide for now.

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,519
No need to worry about me.

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,879
Mr. Lei,

127
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,519
remove your pants.
