00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,240
Lighten up, okay?

4
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,600
Like a grumpy old man,

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,039
not handsome at all.

6
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,560
What's wrong?

7
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,320
Considering the Ghost Needle.

8
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,560
Grandmaster,

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,359
what is Ghost Needle?

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,280
The Wu family is the only heir
of the Divine Thirteen Needles.

11
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,239
Ghost Needle

12
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,599
is the essence
of the Divine Thirteen Needles.

13
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,599
It has cured

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
countless lives.

15
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,840
Sounds powerful.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,400
Grandmaster, show it to me.

17
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,079
I'm really worried about this.

18
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,239
Why?

19
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,680
It's a long story.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,959
(Three years ago,)

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,079
(Meihui got the petrification disease.)

22
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,879
(Modern medicine calls it)

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
ALS.

24
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,879
It's terminal.

25
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,000
So how's she still alive?

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,159
I guess

27
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,640
it's because you intervened.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,959
Already this awesome three years back?

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Really a miracle doctor!

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
She was already pretty much frozen.

31
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,920
Her body gave out.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Only the 12th
of the Divine Thirteen Needles

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,599
could save her.

34
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,480
Sadly, I just wasn't good enough.

35
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,120
I knew how to do it.

36
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,719
But didn't dare.

37
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,959
So, I stuck the Ghost Needle into her

38
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,640
to keep her energy flowing

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
and sustain her life.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
So in that case,

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,760
she's still got the needle in her.

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,280
Can't you just take it out?

43
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,680
That's easy.

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Tough to save life.

45
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,280
Why?

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,680
I just realized

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,240
why Grandpa set up our engagement.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,719
Are there any hidden secrets?

49
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,840
Quick, tell me!

50
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,400
On the wedding night,

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,599
do the needling

52
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,240
when yin and yang are in sync

53
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,960
could cure her disease.

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,639
Is this mysterious yin-yang energy

55
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,680
medicine or some kind of metaphysics?

56
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,159
I don't know.

57
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,800
Handed down from ancestors.

58
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,759
It could be true

59
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,759
or false.

60
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,039
But doctors

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,240
always hold onto that sliver of hope.

62
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,776
Doctors always

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,280
hold onto that sliver of hope.

64
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,000
Grandmaster,

65
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,520
I got the message.

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,759
There you are.

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
So,

68
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,879
you need to sleep with her to save her?

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,080
Just thought you're good.

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,840
Behave like a lady!

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
Grandmaster, just tell me.

72
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,800
Don't change the subject.

73
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,680
No way.

74
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,919
I do not accept.

75
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,000
As my grandmaster,

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
you're mine.

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Mr. Wu.

78
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,800
My best regards.

79
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,280
Mr. Shen, so nice of you.

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm friends with your mom.

81
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,400
Just call me uncle.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Watch your mouth!

83
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,560
Want to die?

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,479
Get out.

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,759
Mr. Wu.

86
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
I heard

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,488
you're close with my fiancée, Yang Ling.

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,439
Is it true?

89
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,599
How come I've never heard Yang Ling

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,039
mentions you?

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,360
She's my wife.

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
Pregnant with our child.

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,599
I'd say drop your wishful thinking.

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,240
You two slept. So what?

95
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,319
Look at you now.

96
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,919
Are you good enough for her?

97
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,000
My poor memory.

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,680
This was found in her room.

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,599
Contraceptive pill?

100
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
Why she did this!

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
Grandmaster,

102
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,959
you and her really...?

103
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm mad.

104
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,600
Yang Ling already
agreed to our marriage. You...

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,279
I can make you call me Dad.

106
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,680
You dare insult my mom!

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
Tired of life?

108
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,680
Stop!

109
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,079
Mom, why are you here?

110
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,959
You dare touch Mr. Wu.

111
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
I'm so disappointed.

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,199
Wait, Mom.

113
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,240
He just...

114
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
Get out.

115
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,839
Mom, you don't need to be
that nice to him.

116
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,000
Even if he's really good at medicine,

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,399
he's a deadbeat now.

118
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,120
Get out!

119
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,279
Yue,

120
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,120
you also wait outside.

121
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,199
Hubby, I'm waiting outside.

122
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,240
Call me if you need.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Sorry, Mr. Wu.

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,319
I apologize on behalf of Guohao.

125
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,639
No need, Ms. Shen.

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,079
But you've definitely raised
a great son.

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,519
Arrogant.

128
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,360
Domineering.

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Overbearing.

130
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,839
Any word of this kind.

131
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,600
What about you?

132
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,319
How are you feeling?

133
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
I'll survive it.

134
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,399
Don't worry.

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
The arm that can do acupuncture
isn't hurt.

136
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,920
That's good.

137
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,600
Next time, it might be different.

138
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
They will do whatever it takes

139
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,920
to reach their goal.

140
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
They dared to make a move on you.

141
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,079
Who's it?

142
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not difficult

143
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,399
for your Shen family
to find out who it is.

144
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,160
Mr. Wu, I promise,

145
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,759
your enemy is also
an enemy of the Shen family.

146
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,079
Enemies of our Shen family,

147
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,720
won't end up good,

148
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,240
unless they're untouchable.

149
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,600
What if it's your son?

150
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,079
Guohao, come in.

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,639
Mom, what's it?

152
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,199
Do you have anything to do

153
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,680
with Mr. Wu's car accident?

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,480
Of course not.

155
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,759
If it does, would he

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,319
still be lying here?

157
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,120
Wretch!

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,720
Mom!

159
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,600
He's now crippled.

160
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
A lowly ant.

161
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,920
What do you even see in him?

162
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,680
My nephew.

163
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,600
Watch your mouth.

164
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,199
Show the basic manners.

165
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,728
Qianyu,

166
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,360
he needs a proper lesson.

167
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,360
You loser.

168
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
Even call my mom by name?

169
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,480
You...

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Qianyu,

171
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,839
you see,
I'm having trouble moving around.

172
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,519
My leg feels so numb.

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,560
Massage, will you?

174
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,759
Looking for trouble?

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,439
Get lost.

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,879
Mom!

177
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,319
No guy in the world

178
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,439
dares to order you about.

179
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,560
Look at him!

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,399
How dare he...

181
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,040
He's insulting you.

182
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
I will kill him.

183
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,040
Get out.

184
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,800
Mr. Wu is my friend.

185
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,279
He can't move right now.

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,000
Just some massage. No big deal.

187
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,319
Listen.

188
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,319
People may be different in status,

189
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,439
but not in character.

190
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,360
One more instance of disrespect
towards Mr. Wu,

191
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,120
and I'm revoking most of your power.

192
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,720
Mom!

193
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,560
Get out!

194
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,399
Ms. Shen,

195
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,920
even though Shen Guohao
isn't your biological son,

196
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,959
education in a big family
shouldn't be like this.

197
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,959
Yeah, I did adopt him.

198
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
I spoiled him.

199
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,439
Please keep this matter private.

200
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,720
I'd really appreciate it
if Mr. Wu could keep this secret for me.

201
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,879
Don't worry, I won't say a word.

202
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,600
That's good to hear.

203
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,439
I bet everything on you.

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,839
Don't let me down.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,680
Ms. Shen.

206
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,600
Weren't you just calling me Qianyu?

207
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,480
Why change your word?

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
You're being naughty.

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,600
I just wanted to say,

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
what's your plan for handling our enemy?

211
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,919
I'll definitely give you

212
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,120
a satisfactory answer.

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
That's good.

214
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,080
Well, Wu Ming!

215
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,840
Get out of my way!
