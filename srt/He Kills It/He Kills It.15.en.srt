00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,200
All right?

4
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Long, the car has been scrapped.
But the Yangs shut it down.

5
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,240
It's unclear if the people
in the car are dead.

6
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:30,912
Okay.

7
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,280
Inform me immediately
if there is any news.

8
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,400
Mr. Lei,

9
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,879
stop eating.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Isn't the person you introduced to me
reliable or not?

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,040
Mr. Long,

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,959
you can't say that.

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
I just introduced you to a friend.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,359
As for what kind of cooperation
you have with him,

15
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,120
I know nothing.

16
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,239
I don't want to get involved.

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,239
Alright.

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,200
So,

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
you introduced me to a truck driver
and pocketed a hundred million?

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,799
This money

21
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,799
was earned too easily.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Mr. Long.

23
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,520
Could it be that you befriend me,

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
not because I have many friends?

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,624
Right?

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,240
♪Friends stay with you throughout life♪

27
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,639
♪Those days♪

28
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,479
Alright, enough.

29
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,240
I understand now.

30
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,416
Being friends with you

31
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,280
is all about

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
clear-cut pricing, isn't it?

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,719
You see things so clearly.

34
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,719
So I still have to tell you.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,319
If this matter succeeds, fine.

36
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,599
But if it doesn't,

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,319
why don't we look at it
from a different angle?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,319
Broaden your horizons.

39
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,560
No!

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
Since I grew up, I have never
endured such grievance and humiliation!

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,719
That bad guy

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,319
must die.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Ling, I need to go ahead
to perform acupuncture.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,624
Are you a bully?

45
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,719
How could that be?

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,719
Although she has an exquisite curve,

47
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,840
fair skin,

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,439
and soft...

49
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,080
Shut up!

50
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,759
I have completed needling
the meridians at the back.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,360
If the points are not needled,
there may be changes.

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,400
Do it with your eyes closed.

53
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm a fairy?

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Then...

55
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,039
It's a matter of life.

56
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,479
What if I needle the wrong spot?

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,520
You wouldn't really want
to take advantage, would you?

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,599
In my eyes, she is just a statue.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,599
Besides,

60
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,319
aren't you supervising me right beside?

61
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,776
I promise, apart from the needle,
my hand will definitely not touch her.

62
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,520
She's still going to be exposed to you?

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Yuetong is a virgin maiden.

64
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,639
This matter is only known

65
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,439
to us.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
She won't have any psychological burden.

67
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,039
You...

68
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,840
Wait a moment!

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,639
There is a problem.

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,879
What's the problem?

71
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,599
Tell me!

72
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,719
You're driving me crazy.

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,960
Why are you having a nosebleed?

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
My acupuncture method

75
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,759
particularly consumes vital energy.

76
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,920
Do you want to take a break?

77
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,079
No.

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,959
Her meridians must be
fully opened at once.

79
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,048
There must be no delay.

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,680
The acupuncture points at her front
are not easy to find.

81
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,040
Don't make any sound.

82
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,639
Okay.

83
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,344
I need to concentrate fully
while needling.

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,759
Help me wipe the nosebleed.

85
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,240
What happened?

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,800
What happened?

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
Yuetong, don't be afraid.

88
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,720
H-He is helping you
to clear the meridians.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,639
Yes. Don't have psychological burden.

90
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,399
For a doctor,
there's no gender difference.

91
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,319
I will do my best to help you recover.

92
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,680
Sound can be made now.

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,592
This indicates that most of it
is connected.

94
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,680
Yuetong,

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,319
you just spoke.

96
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,199
Make another sound for me.

97
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,519
(Oh, how embarrassing!)

98
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,360
(He surprisingly
stares at me like that.)

99
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,040
(My whole body...)

100
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,800
(Oh, I don't want to live anymore.)

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,279
(And my sister.)

102
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,680
(How can I make another sound?)

103
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Yuetong, make another sound.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,839
Don't rush. Don't affect
my needle application.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
She must be shy.

106
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,279
After all, Grandmaster is a man.

107
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,519
Grandmaster, why don't you
let me apply the needle?

108
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,000
You can guide me from the side.

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Your skill is not enough.

110
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,839
The technique
of needle insertion is incorrect.

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,520
All efforts will be wasted.

112
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,560
Why did you have a nosebleed?

113
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,600
Due to exhaustion of energy.

114
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,560
Why are you so slow
in applying the needle?

115
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,120
Life hangs in the balance,

116
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,439
so it must be treated

117
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,120
with caution.

118
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,079
When applying the needle
to Old Mr. Wang,

119
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,079
why were you

120
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,040
rapid and forceful?

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,319
It was a critical moment.

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,480
We had to act fast.

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,959
Yue,

124
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,040
your grandmaster said

125
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,759
Yuetong's meridians are hard to find.

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
Is that true?

127
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,439
No, not at all.

128
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,720
Her figure is exquisite and full.
Her meridians are obvious.

129
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,199
They can be found in an instant.

130
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm really exhausted.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Yue, I have finished.

132
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,079
You remove the needle.

133
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,879
(Wretch, I won't forgive you!)

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
That's not right.

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,519
A doctor has a benevolent heart,

136
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,879
so why should I be afraid

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,839
and run away?

138
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,959
Being serious, meticulous, and steady

139
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,240
is my professional integrity.

140
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,240
I have a clear conscience.

141
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,360
Hey, Bro.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,680
Mr. Lei.

143
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,399
It's good that you're fine.

144
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,680
You made me worry.

145
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,240
If it weren't for your timely reminder,
I wouldn't have thought

146
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,759
that the truck was coming at me.

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,879
Luckily, I reacted in time.

148
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,519
Of the three things you owe me,
you can offset one.

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Hey, Bro.

150
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,000
You're being too polite.

151
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,000
But you have to be careful from now on.

152
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,360
Long Gang hates you.

153
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
He definitely won't let it go.

154
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,439
Long Gang.

155
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm a bit nervous.

156
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,920
Don't be nervous.

157
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,519
Try to make a sound

158
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,320
like this.

159
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:35,882
Ah.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,840
It's okay.

161
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,559
What's going on?

162
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,879
Why is it still like this?

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,920
We put in so much effort.

164
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,000
It doesn't make sense.

165
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,616
Did I get fooled by the grandmaster too?

166
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,120
He's so young.

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,600
He's actually an amateur?

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,159
Exactly.

169
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,399
So young.

170
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,799
He talks so impressively,

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
but has no skills at all.

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,864
Bring him to me!

173
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,600
Yes.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,799
Don't lose heart.
I will find a miracle doctor for you.

175
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,312
And I've decided to marry
into the Shen family.

176
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,279
They must know many reclusive masters.

177
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
I will definitely cure you.

178
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,960
Did you really agree?

179
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,720
You must not wrong yourself.

180
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,600
Even if our family falls on hard times
and we live an ordinary life,

181
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,919
you should still be happy.

182
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,559
You know?

183
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,240
Don't have to worry about that.

184
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,559
Wu Ming, didn't you vow

185
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,440
that only you can cure Yuetong
in this world?
