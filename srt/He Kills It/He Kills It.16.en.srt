3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,679
Wu Ming,

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,280
didn't you vow to say

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,159
that you are the only one
who can cure Yuetong?

6
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:52,960
Don't worry.

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,600
I'll check first.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,439
Don't move.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,359
How is it?

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,040
Strange!

11
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,519
Where's strange?

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,239
I need to check her throat.

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,959
Okay,

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,280
please check.

15
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,359
If you can't find anything,

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
I definitely won't spare you.

17
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:27,552
Open the mouth.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,680
Open wider.

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,000
Shine a light in.

20
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:47,808
Don't move.

21
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,304
Alright.

22
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,599
How is it now? Quickly tell me.

23
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,879
Worse than I thought.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't expect

25
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,200
I would have a day of failure.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,919
You should leave.

27
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,680
Don't let me see you again.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Sister,

29
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,719
it's not his fault.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Perhaps

31
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,319
this is my fate.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,719
Yuetong,

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,039
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,439
What?

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,199
Wretch!

36
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,280
I'll kill you!

37
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,759
Sister, stop hitting.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,319
Yuetong,

39
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,400
you can speak now.

40
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,680
Sister!

41
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,680
Sister!

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Grandmaster,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
you really came through.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
Helping to cure her with kindness

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,759
ended up with this result.

46
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,240
It's really not worth it.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
I got it.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,280
Second Miss hasn't spoken for years.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,759
Even if she is cured now,

50
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,039
there's a barrier in her heart.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,280
Forcing her to speak doesn't work.

52
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,120
But under the recent stimulation,

53
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
she made a sound in one go.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
Great.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Good interpretation.

56
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,159
Wu Ming,

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,120
I wrongly blamed you.

58
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,159
Wrongly blamed me?

59
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,599
What's the use?

60
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Do you think it can heal
my wounded soul?

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
That slap

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
used all your strength.

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
You can dodge but you didn't.

64
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,080
So you deserved it.

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
You surely have a better way.

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,800
But you use such despicable methods.

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,879
I am a healer.

68
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,160
I only care about the patients.

69
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,240
The method just now
was quick and effective.

70
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
Look how well it worked.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,800
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,199
How do I repay you?

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,480
Call me Brother-in-law.

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,720
This isn't quite proper.

75
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,079
What did he say?

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
He asked me to call him Brother-in-law.

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,399
I could agree to that.

78
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,680
As long as you cure my grandpa,

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,720
the Yang family's crisis
can be resolved.

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
And I won't have to marry Mr. Shen.

81
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,959
Can you do it?

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,519
I want to say I can't.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
But my abilities do not allow.

84
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,720
Miss, Second Master is here.

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,480
Second Uncle,

86
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,319
aren't you at home with my Auntie?

87
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,759
Why are you here?

88
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,560
I heard Yuetong had a car accident.

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,839
I am very anxious.

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
How is she now?

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,079
In which hospital?

92
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,560
Thanks to you,

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,199
Yuetong has yet to wake up.

94
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,399
And she still hasn't escaped danger.

95
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,720
But I can't disclose which hospital.

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,240
After all,

97
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,120
this time it's a man-made disaster.

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,120
From what you're saying,

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,199
are you suspecting me?

100
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,240
Y-You want to anger me to death?

101
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,319
Uncle,

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,199
stop pretending.

103
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,384
I know about shady dealings
between you and the Long family.

104
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,079
When my grandpa wakes up,
I will tell him everything.

105
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,480
Why do you keep making baseless claims?

106
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
If I find out

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
who harmed Yuetong,

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,879
I will make him repay much.

109
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,920
As for your grandpa,

110
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,639
I'm afraid he won't wake up.

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,480
What did you say?

112
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
Today we received notice from Mr. Hao.

113
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,000
He declared that your grandpa
is in a vegetative state.

114
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
What?

115
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,319
How is that possible?

116
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,759
He was fine just a few days ago.

117
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
How could he be a vegetative state?

118
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,519
This is the unpredictability of life.

119
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,079
With your grandpa not around,

120
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,240
the huge burden of this family

121
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,199
will fall on my shoulders.

122
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,160
Ling,

123
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,040
don't worry.

124
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,360
As an elder,

125
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,639
I will definitely take good care of you.

126
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,120
Did you do something to my grandpa?

127
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,040
Shouldn't I ask you about this?

128
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
You picked the people to look after him.

129
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,160
If something really went wrong,

130
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,959
shouldn't you be held accountable?

131
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,439
However,

132
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,240
I know you are a filial child.

133
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,000
You definitely wouldn't
do anything so disgraceful.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,759
If this gets out,

135
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,879
the entire Yang family would be shamed.

136
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,839
After all, we are one family

137
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
with shared

138
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
reputation, right?

139
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,439
Second Uncle,

140
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
you really are ruthless

141
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,920
to even lay a hand on
an old man in his twilight years.

142
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
That man is your dad.

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,759
Ling, if you keep
slandering me this way,

144
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,800
I will not be courteous to you.

145
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,480
Stop pretending.

146
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,199
What kind of person you are,

147
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,560
we both know clearly.

148
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,199
I'm telling you.

149
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,040
Your best-laid schemes

150
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
will not go as you wish.

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,439
Is that so?

152
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,519
Forget to tell you.

153
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,079
The company's board meeting
is scheduled for

154
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,040
the election process
for the new chairman.

155
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,000
And I, as the largest shareholder,

156
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,079
will become the new chairman
of the company.

157
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,600
Sister.

158
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,919
He really deserves a beating.

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,799
I really want to smack him in the face.

160
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,080
Sister, what should we do now?

161
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,639
Wu Ming, you'll cure my grandpa, right?

162
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,519
I'm not sure.

163
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Need to check first.

164
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:12,352
(Hospitalization)

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
How is it?

166
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,919
His bodily functions now

167
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
all rely on these machines.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
And he has lost consciousness.

169
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,159
It's difficult.

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,679
To awaken a vegetative patient

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,200
is so difficult.

172
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,240
Such medical miracles
are extremely rare.

173
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
But I believe in you.

174
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,240
Your blind trust like this

175
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,559
puts a lot of pressure on me.

176
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,600
Wu Ming, give me a definite answer.

177
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,360
Does my grandpa still have hope?
