=Episode 1=

3
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:48,960
(China, Deep in Mount Zhongnan)

4
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,759
It's deep in the bones.

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,479
No medicine can save her now.

6
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,719
You

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,640
should prepare for the worst.

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,359
Dr. Wu,

9
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,039
she's my only granddaughter.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,519
(Wang Family, Wang Meihui)
If she dies,

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,319
my family

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,959
might go extinct!

13
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:07,760
Grandpa.

14
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,159
I can save her.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,319
Bring her in.

16
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,319
Though I'm

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
not fully skilled yet,

18
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:15,040
(Wu Ming)

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,359
I can use the Ghost Needle

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
to preserve her life.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Ming,

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,680
Divine Thirteen Needles is forbidden.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
It will entangle you
in karmic consequences.

24
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,480
Grandpa,

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,799
we learn medicine

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
to save lives, right?

27
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,719
No way.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Dr. Wu,

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,120
this young doctor looks exceptional.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Meihui is a rare beauty, too.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,760
If you can heal her,

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,319
I'm willing

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,680
to marry her to him.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,000
I beg you!

35
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,319
Your Wang family

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,359
is truly aiming high.

37
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,856
(Three Years Later)

38
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:55,719
(Loong City, A nation in the Pacific)

39
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,079
(Breaking news.)

40
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,439
(Chairman of Yang Group,)

41
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,040
(a Fortune 500 company,
is on death's door.)

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,760
(A global reward is offered
for a miracle doctor.)

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,600
(100 million)
(The reward is 100 million.)

44
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,959
100 million!

45
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,439
It's endless wealth!

46
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,159
(I heard his illness is terminal.)

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,360
(Even top medical teams have failed.)

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
(A miracle doctor?)

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,680
(Even an immortal couldn't help.)

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,879
(Yang Family's Eldest Miss, Yang Ling)
I solemnly swear.

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,719
If someone can save my grandpa,

52
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,719
I will agree to anything.

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,159
Even marriage.

54
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,560
Why is there no signal now?

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
I was watching my short drama!

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,599
Grandpa.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,879
I'm going out.

58
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,719
Ming,

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
this trip

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,840
to Loong City

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
is not just to promote
traditional Chinese medicine.

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,120
Also,

63
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,560
you need to fulfill
your engagement with Wang Meihui.

64
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,840
(The bone needle you placed
in Wang Meihui's brain)

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,120
(has reached its limit.)

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,800
(Remember,)

67
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,039
(you must use Divine Thirteen Needles)

68
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,719
(to extend her life.)

69
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,719
(Otherwise, she will die.)

70
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,080
(Don't worry, Grandpa.)

71
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,919
(I'll invite you to my wedding.)

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Such a foul smell.

73
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,039
Definitely a gut inflammation.

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,439
Besides,

75
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,319
that tooth is decayed.

76
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,360
You need new one.

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,759
Fate brought us together.

78
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,159
I should get it fixed.

79
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,400
When I return,

80
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,719
you'd get a golden one.

81
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:11,680
(Dr. Xu Zhengchun, Clinic)
(Baozhi Clinic)

82
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,079
Miss,

83
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,480
Mr. Li returned the call.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,544
(Yang Family's Second Miss, Yang Yuetong)
He says he can't cure Master's illness.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
He also says

86
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
no one or medicine

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
can help.

88
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,480
You may leave first.

89
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,560
Let me be alone.

90
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,319
Yes.

91
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,079
(Baozhi Clinic)

92
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,240
Baozhi Clinic. This must be

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,639
the clinic of my disciple.

94
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,639
Stop.

95
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,920
Do you know what this place is?

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,439
And you just walk right in?

97
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm looking
for my registered disciple, Chun.

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,360
Who is Chun?

99
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,920
His name is Xu Zhengchun.

100
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
Where did you crawl out from?

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
How dare you address Dr. Xu by his name?

102
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,839
Chun?

103
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,519
You!

104
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,920
Do you have no shame?

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,040
The Second Miss of the Yang family
is here for treatment.

106
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,920
Leave now!

107
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,920
It hurts.

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Let go of me.

109
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Holding desire is unhealthy.

110
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,199
Proper release
is the way of yin and yang.

111
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,560
What do you mean?

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,199
Stop!

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,839
Zusanli.

114
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,560
Xiajuxu.

115
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,360
Why can't I move?

116
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,639
Come back!

117
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,439
G-Get those needles out!

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,959
Chun.

119
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,079
(Baozhi Clinic)
Chun.

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Chun.

121
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:18,879
Are you okay?

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,759
Do you need help?

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,519
(What's going on?)

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
(Why can't I move?)

125
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,040
(What does he want?)

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,680
(Could he be a foot fetishist?)

127
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,560
(Rascal.)

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,160
Alright.

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,279
You rascal!

130
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm calling the police!

131
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,439
What are you doing?

132
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,120
I can't read.

133
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,839
I was correcting your bones.

134
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,079
Your foot's healed now.

135
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,519
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,240
I misunderstood you.

137
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,399
Thank you.

138
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,600
I said I don't understand.

139
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,399
Where is Xu Zhengchun?

140
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,240
I don't know.

141
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,800
Can you use
the traditional Chinese medicine?

142
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,040
Your aphasia can't be cured right away.

143
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,439
But I can help you speak temporarily.

144
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,160
Futu.

145
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,920
Zhongfu.

146
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,879
Tiantu.

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,199
Dazhui. Feishu.

148
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,480
Fengmen. Xinshu.

149
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
What are you doing?

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
Where is Xu Zhengchun?

151
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,319
I don't know

152
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,800
I can speak now!

153
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,319
Fatty.

154
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm in Loong City now.

155
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
I'll meet you later.

156
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll help you next time.

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,839
I have to go.

158
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Fatty, where are you?

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Miss.

160
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,120
Miss, are you okay?

161
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,399
Who was that man?

162
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
What happened?

163
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,720
Quickly.

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,519
Go to find that man with me.

165
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,152
(Baozhi Clinic)

166
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,399
You...

167
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Take out your needles.

168
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,159
I'm exhausted.

169
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,360
Are you still a man?

170
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,799
Your internal fire is too much.

171
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,360
I was clearing your meridians.

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,840
Stand up now.

173
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,759
You brat.

174
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,000
Come back again

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
and I'll make you regret it!

176
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,879
Master.

177
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,200
Master.

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
Who dared to mess with my Yue?

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,120
I'll beat him up!

180
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,759
A brat just came.

181
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
He didn't respect you,

182
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,639
claiming to be your master.

183
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,559
What?

184
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,679
In broad daylight,

185
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,240
someone dared to impersonate my master?

186
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,159
Is he in his early twenties,

187
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
dressed in plain clothes
and cloth shoes?

188
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,240
Oh, no!

189
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,840
You've caused a huge mess!

190
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,039
What?

191
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,360
Miss.

192
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,720
Dr. Xu,

193
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,559
is there other doctor

194
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,399
whose skills rival even yours?

195
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,759
Have you found such a person?

196
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,519
Rival than mine?

197
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,679
Honestly,

198
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,399
until now, I've never met one.

199
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,320
Miss,

200
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,200
if my master's here,

201
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,879
Chairman Yang's illness

202
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,559
is just

203
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,120
a piece of cake.

204
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,039
Where is your master?

205
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,720
My master

206
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,080
is quite low-key.

207
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,679
Doesn't even give me his number.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,159
But he did come by today.

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
Check the security cameras!

210
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,519
We must find him.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,720
Mr. Ming!

212
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,960
Fatty?

213
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,240
Mr. Ming!

214
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,279
It really is you!

215
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
You look much slimmer!

216
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Running deliveries is exhausting.

217
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
Your outfit is...

218
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,960
This is what I wore back
when I was in real estate.

219
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,679
I just changed jobs.

220
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,679
Can't afford new clothes.

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,759
You'll lift me up this time, right?

222
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,519
Let's go.

223
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,799
Let's eat first.

224
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,600
Then we'll go visit my fiancée.

225
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,559
(It's been three years.)

226
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:16,736
(Yang Family Villa)

227
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,159
Welcome home, Miss.

228
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,879
Sister,

229
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
I met a miracle doctor today.

230
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,879
With just a wave of his hand,
I could speak!

231
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:53,840
Sister,

232
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm telling the truth!

233
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,639
If he's that amazing,

234
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,720
why wasn't your throat cured?

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
Why didn't you bring him home?

236
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,919
Listen to me.

237
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,799
Don't worry about Grandpa.

238
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,720
Our aunts and uncles

239
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,919
are waiting to divide the assets
after Grandpa passes.

240
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm exhausted handling them.

241
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
Don't add to my burden.

242
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll handle

243
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,080
all of this myself.

244
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,000
Miss,

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,399
we've got a lead on that person.
