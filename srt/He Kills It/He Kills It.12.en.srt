00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,799
(Why does he smell like my sister?)

4
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,320
(Her perfume is unique.)

5
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,000
(It's him!)

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,920
Who are you?

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,599
Any idea who you're dealing with?

8
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,480
Defending this guy?

9
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,159
Hello, Mr. Jin.

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,439
This is the Second Miss
of the Yang Group,

11
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,239
Yang Yuetong.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,280
(She's my wife's younger sister.)

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,840
(My sister-in-law!)

14
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,959
Miss Yang,

15
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,640
nice to meet you.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,200
(Jin Tong)
I'm Jin Tong from Jintong Construction.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,319
Mr. Jin.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,879
Mr. Wu is an esteemed guest
of our Yang Group.

19
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,359
Could you not

20
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,560
make it hard for him?

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,239
I'm not.

22
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,519
I'm just taking him to meet someone.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
So we have to go then?

24
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,959
You think you are...

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,280
God?

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,519
Mr. Jin,

27
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,359
we need Mr. Wu for some urgent issue.

28
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,040
You might need to wait for a bit.

29
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,200
Mr. Wu, let's go.

30
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,640
Wait a moment.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,640
Miss Yang,

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,719
with all due respect for your family,

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,799
a big shot
from the Shen family in Jinling

34
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,400
asks to see him.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,719
Today, I'm taking him with me,
no matter what.

36
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,879
Shen Guohao's family?

37
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,000
Nobody can take him.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
I don't understand that.

39
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,840
We can't afford
to cross the Shen family.

40
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,520
But Mr. Wu is going with us today.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
So a standoff, huh?

42
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,520
Alright then.

43
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,520
Don't blame me.

44
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,199
Seize him.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,919
Wait!

46
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,840
Mr. Jin,

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,199
I'll join you.

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,240
That makes it easier.

49
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,680
Don't be afraid.

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,599
We'll protect you.

51
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,639
Don't worry.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Mr. Wu, in Loong City,

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,759
if we've got your back,

54
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,879
no one can harm you.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,719
Sister-in-law, wait for me.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,719
I'll fix your throat.

57
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,280
Miss,

58
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,520
why's Mr. Wu calling you sister-in-law?

59
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,439
Tell Wu.

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,039
Get ready to back him up.

61
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,639
Protect him no matter what.

62
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,879
Got it?

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,680
Yes.

64
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,560
Your leg was healed

65
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,360
within a day?

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,439
How's it possible?

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm right in front of you.

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,599
Why don't you believe it?

69
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,520
We can't let this wretch live.

70
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,800
He'll be trouble.

71
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,759
Mr. Long,

72
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,199
better to make friends than enemies.

73
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,840
Besides,

74
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,879
a living young miracle doctor

75
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,759
is more valuable to us.

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,039
Besides,

77
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,960
could we maybe

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,759
broaden our horizons a bit?

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,639
Loong City

80
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,479
has Dr. Xu is enough.

81
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,680
Besides,

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,439
he probably just got lucky

83
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,719
with your leg.

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,319
Mr. Long,

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
mind your words.

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,680
Just an analogy.

87
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,439
Fifty million for his life.

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,759
His value is far more than this.

89
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Introducing him
to some bigwigs for treatment

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
would earn me way more money

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,480
and connections than this.

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,839
100 million!

93
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,560
Cash!

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Deal.

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,160
Miss, he's here.

96
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,839
One moment.

97
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,199
I'll take a call.

98
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,000
Ling,

99
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,680
what's up?

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,639
Ms. Shen,

101
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,240
for the proposal you made,

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,319
I accept it.

103
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,639
Mom,

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,399
she was that cold previously.

105
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,920
Didn't even text back.

106
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,600
But look at her now.

107
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,680
Wise choice.

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,800
You can count on the Shen family
for strong support.

109
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,560
I have a request.

110
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,879
Go ahead.

111
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,160
Postpone the wedding for a year.

112
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,680
I respect your decision.

113
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,720
I will soon lead the team

114
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
to stop the international fund's
invasion into the Yang Group.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
Just to stop it?

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,279
It's a powerful enemy.

117
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,680
It takes time to get them

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
to withdraw their funds.

119
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,439
Okay, understood.

120
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,720
Mom,

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,639
you can easily make them withdraw funds.

122
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,639
Then why...

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
I accept her decision
to postpone the wedding.

124
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,560
She has to take the pressure
coming with it.

125
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
I want to see

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
what my future daughter-in-law

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
is made of.

128
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,839
Mom, you're probably

129
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,800
the only person in the world

130
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,920
who can make someone that proud
eat humble pie.

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,279
You go back first.

132
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,079
I've got some important guests.

133
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Alright.

134
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm off then.

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Sorry about the wait.

136
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,040
Something urgent came up.

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,879
Shen Qianyu
of the Shen family in Jinling.

138
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,720
You can even wait.

139
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,959
So can I, of course.

140
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,600
Ms. Shen,

141
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Shen Guohao isn't your real son, right?

142
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,839
I'm not sure why you said that.

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,959
But please don't make such jokes.

144
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,279
Alright.

145
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Then let's consider it a joke.

146
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,839
Straight to the point.

147
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,240
Sir,

148
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,639
what have you spotted?

149
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,839
Ms. Shen,

150
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
my eyesight isn't great.

151
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,279
Mind if I take a closer look?

152
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,519
Closer.

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
A little closer.
