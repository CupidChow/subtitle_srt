00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,520
Mr. Lei,

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,079
remove your pants.

5
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,719
Isn't it too humiliating?

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,759
Mr. Lei,

7
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,960
I'll call our men now!

8
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,840
I absolutely won't let him
walk out of this room alive!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,079
I want to see his legs.

10
00:00:59,159 --> 00:00:59,600
I...

11
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,319
Let him.

12
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,599
Strong bones.

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
Slight muscle damage.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,480
But it should not affect walking.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
The problem lies in the meridians.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,319
My leg paralysis is indeed a result
from nerve compression.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,079
You know medicine, huh?

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,000
Mr. Lei,

19
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,560
how about we make a deal?

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,959
What kind of deal?

21
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,439
I'll heal your leg,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,319
and you do three things for me.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,959
What are you anyway?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,319
A miracle doctor?

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,879
You know some half-baked skills,

26
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,000
and think you're invincible?

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Mr. Lei's leg

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,120
has been treated by the best experts
from around the world,

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,599
yet they were all helpless.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,799
Even the well-known Dr. Xu
from Loong City

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,159
couldn't do much.

32
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,879
How dare you talk big here?

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,319
Xu Zhengchun?

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
The name of Dr. Xu

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,879
isn't something a nobody like you
can mention.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,840
I should educate that disciple of mine.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,479
His rudimentary skill

38
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,759
is embarrassing to be mentioned.

39
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,520
Mr. Lei,

40
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,719
yes or no?

41
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,800
Young man,

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,759
I admit you're really good at fighting.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,199
I treasure talents.

44
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,240
But you've offended the Long family.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,000
I really can't protect you.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,759
As for treating my leg,

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,080
forget it.

48
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,680
Mr. Lei,

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
you won't stand for life anyway.

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,800
Why not let him try?

51
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,599
Give it a shot.

52
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,960
The result may be good.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,319
What if?

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,360
What if?

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,400
Nonsense!

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,719
If he can cure Mr. Lei's leg,

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,400
I...

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll go to extremes!

59
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,240
Okay!

60
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,479
I have never seen anyone ask to do that.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Young man...

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,479
Yinlinquan.

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,919
Xuehai.

64
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,360
Oh my God!

65
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,319
My leg!

66
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,120
I can feel it!

67
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,439
Straight!

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,400
Straight!

69
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
So soon?

70
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,840
Mr. Lei,

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,520
want to heal your legs?

72
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,719
Yes.

73
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,599
Please!

74
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,280
I'll treat one leg first.

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
After completing three tasks,

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,960
I'll treat the other, how about that?

77
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,639
Okay.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,199
Not to mention three.

79
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,520
Even a hundred, I'd agree.

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,439
Miss,

81
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,319
I found details on that person.

82
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,240
He's from Mount Zhongnan,

83
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,759
engaged to the Wang family,
a small family.

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
However, the Wangs don't like him.

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Engagement canceled.

86
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,360
He can't accept it.

87
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,120
For money,

88
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
he's been pestering Miss Wang.

89
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,520
Miss,

90
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,599
if he really has
such good medical skills,

91
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,199
why would he do such shameful things?

92
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,120
Rumors cannot be fully trusted.

93
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
We'll go see Miss Wang to learn more.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,639
Okay.

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Alright. Stand up.

96
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,480
Really?

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Just try.

98
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,560
Mr. Lei!

99
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,199
You stand up!

100
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,560
I stand up!

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,199
I stand up!

102
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,519
Luck is coming, Mr. Ming!

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Mr. Ming,

104
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,319
you're like my real brother now.

105
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,600
I stand up!

106
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,199
I'll be your agent from now on.

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,920
Anything you need, contact me directly.

108
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,680
Alright?

109
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,879
Okay.

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,560
Bro,

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,839
thank you.

112
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,199
In the future,

113
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,079
I'll respect you like my own parents.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,920
In this lifetime, I will

115
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,720
never let you down.

116
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,759
Even if the Longs pressures you,

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,759
I'll help you.

118
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,720
Stay calm.

119
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,439
Sit down first.

120
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll cure your other leg.

121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,959
Bro,

122
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,199
don't I need to do the three things

123
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,040
before that?

124
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,920
You're a good man.

125
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,079
I'll treat you first.

126
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,959
I surely won't let you down!

127
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,600
So sentimental.

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,759
After I treat your legs,

129
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,879
I need to see my incompetent disciple.

130
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,600
Sit.

131
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,639
Sweetie,

132
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,519
dress up nicely.

133
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,759
Mr. Yang is quite interested in you.

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,759
Mom.

135
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,079
I can rely on myself.

136
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,839
Why should I cling to someone else?

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Besides,

138
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,279
what isn't your own won't last.

139
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,079
Mr. Yang doesn't seem that great.

140
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,399
My dear,

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,199
if you can marry into the Yang family,

142
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,000
our family will

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
all get rich too!

144
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, Mom.

145
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,879
About my marriage,

146
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,000
please don't worry.

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
As for my future boyfriend,

148
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,120
he must have good character,

149
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,160
be capable,

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,560
and loyal.

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,720
My dear,

152
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,839
please be more realistic, will you?

153
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,519
Mr. Yang

154
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,839
is better than that Wu guy

155
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,319
for a thousand times!

156
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
I didn't even mention Wu Ming.

157
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,040
Hui,

158
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,399
what's wrong?

159
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,959
What's wrong?

160
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,639
Hui?

161
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,360
Hui!

162
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,720
Hui!

163
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,120
Don't scare me. What's wrong?

164
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,096
Why are you here?

165
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,480
Mom, what's happening?

166
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,639
The doctor said

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
you have low blood sugar.

168
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,759
Other body indicators are normal.

169
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,040
Low blood sugar?

170
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,120
Lately,

171
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,199
you worried too much about your grandpa.

172
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,000
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

173
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,160
You keep talking.

174
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,920
And I

175
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,399
will handle the discharge.

176
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,360
Mom.

177
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,079
Meihui,

178
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,079
don't worry.

179
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,240
I've invited the famous Dr. Xu

180
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,439
to treat your grandpa.

181
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,879
For this,

182
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,680
I spent a lot of favors.

183
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,560
Therefore...

184
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,199
You get me, right?

185
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,439
Meihui.

186
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,480
Meihui,

187
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,959
be my girl.

188
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,680
Mr. Yang, don't do this.

189
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
Stop pretending to be ignorant.

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
As long as you say yes,

191
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,199
I'll take your grandpa to Dr. Xu.

192
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:29,759
How about it?

193
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,080
No.

194
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,080
Alright.

195
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
I have numerous ways to get you.

196
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,480
However,

197
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,799
I admire you.

198
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,840
I don't want to use those tough methods.

199
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't be ungrateful.

200
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,279
Please leave.

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,559
You're not welcome here.

202
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,200
I must remind you.

203
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,679
In this world,

204
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,600
perhaps except for Dr. Xu,

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,840
no one can save your grandpa's life.

206
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,039
And I am

207
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,960
your only chance.

208
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
If your grandpa misses this chance,

209
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,440
then you

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
will be the one
responsible for his death.

211
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Oh, Meihui,

212
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,080
just keep me company.

213
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,399
Let my grandpa see Dr. Xu first.

214
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,360
You can't negotiate terms with me.

215
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,679
This is my bottom line.

216
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,799
Otherwise, I will never agree.

217
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,399
Miraculous!

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,159
A few hours ago,

219
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,399
you were still disabled.

220
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,360
Now you can stand up!

221
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,720
Talk nicely or be quiet.

222
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,399
What I'm saying is

223
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,840
that Wu Ming
really has true capabilities.

224
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,600
By the way,

225
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,320
didn't the Yang family
offer a billion for a good doctor?

226
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,240
We could introduce Wu Ming.

227
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,799
It improves the relationship.

228
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,600
We can also earn a brokerage fee.

229
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,799
It's a win-win.

230
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
Old Mr. Yang
staying in his current status

231
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,559
is in our best interest.

232
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,440
About Wu Ming's skills,

233
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,679
nobody should know!

234
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,039
Or, I will make you suffer.

235
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,840
(Baozhi Clinic)

236
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480
Dad, we've arrived.

237
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,759
You're really like a haunting ghost,

238
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,799
following us everywhere.

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,639
What?

240
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,080
You want money?

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,159
You're like a persistent dog.

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,200
Old hag.

243
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,200
When did you see us following you?

244
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,600
We are dogs?

245
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,120
So are you the mess

246
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,039
we can't avoid?

247
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:03,919
You...

248
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,200
You hillbilly.

249
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,919
- I'm going to rip your mouth!
- Mom,

250
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,039
don't stoop to their level.

251
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,360
Grandpa is more important.

252
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,519
Xu Zhengchun can't save him.

253
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,320
If even Dr. Xu can't,

254
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,759
so you can?

255
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,600
This is Baozhi Clinic.

256
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,679
People of your status

257
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,600
can't even get in the door.

258
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,120
This is Baozhi Clinic.

259
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
No loud noises.

260
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,600
Let's go.

261
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,279
If you have an appointment, show us.

262
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,559
If not, please do not loiter here.

263
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,360
Let me see Xu Zhengchun.

264
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,480
Have an appointment?

265
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,840
If no, you can't get in.

266
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,639
Then let him come to see me.

267
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,159
Tell him my name is Wu Ming.

268
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,480
How dare you?

269
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,320
Who do you think you are?

270
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,279
Wu Ming, stop making trouble.

271
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,200
I am now extremely disgusted with you.

272
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Are you satisfied now?

273
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,039
Is it because I'm too easy-going

274
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,639
that you got the wrong idea?

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,559
Okay.

276
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,240
Then I'll tell you now.

277
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,799
Put away those unrealistic fantasies.

278
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
If I pay any more attention to you,

279
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,399
I'll be dumb.

280
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,039
Mr. Yang, I'll leave it to you.

281
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,519
I am Mr. Yang, from the Yang Group.

282
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,639
I'm familiar with Dr. Xu.

283
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,279
Just let us in.

284
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,000
Sorry.

285
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,759
No entry without an appointment.

286
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,759
This is the rule.

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,039
Sir,

288
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,960
it's said that the Yang Group has shares
of Baozhi Clinic.

289
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,480
So, he is a shareholder.

290
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,320
Are you even stopping shareholders now?

291
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,279
You!

292
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,720
I can have your manager

293
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
fire you, believe it or not?

294
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,039
A shareholder?

295
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Dr. Xu is my uncle.

296
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
The manager is my girl.

297
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,840
With your demeanor,

298
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,879
I won't let you in.

299
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,759
Grandpa!

300
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,159
Mr. Yang,

301
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,480
hurry up and call the doctor!

302
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,440
Okay.

303
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
Grandpa, don't worry.

304
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,840
We will go in and see Dr. Xu soon.

305
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,360
Grandpa!

306
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,879
Don't thank me.

307
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,840
If that breath hadn't come back,

308
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,519
he would be a dead man by now.

309
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,440
If anything happens to my grandpa,

310
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,240
I will make you pay!

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,519
Are you okay, Dad?

312
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,320
How is it going?

313
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,159
Did the call connect?

314
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,600
His phone is off.

315
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,200
What should we do then?

316
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,279
Dr. Xu might be busy.

317
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,039
His phone's off.

318
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,120
My grandpa can't wait.

319
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,600
Yes!

320
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,519
Sir,

321
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm begging you.

322
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,879
Please let us in, okay?

323
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,879
I'm begging you.

324
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,080
Isn't Mr. Yang very capable?

325
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
Let him find a way.

326
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,240
Anyway, I act according to the rules.

327
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,639
Chun,

328
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,720
I am Wu Ming.

329
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,879
I am at the entrance of Baozhi Clinic.

330
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,240
Come out within two minutes,

331
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,759
or I'll make you kneel here for a day.

332
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,799
Miss, this person is bragging again.

333
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,720
He even wants Dr. Xu to kneel.

334
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,639
I think he

335
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,000
is a big bragger.

336
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,120
Let's see.

337
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,000
Wu Ming, stop.

338
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,559
Didn't Mr. Yang make it clear just now?

339
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,120
Dr. Xu is not answering calls.

340
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,399
Must you add to my troubles now?

341
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Exactly.

342
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,679
Will it kill you to be honest?

343
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,960
If you want to deceive people,

344
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,399
think first and make it real, okay?

345
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I don't have time for you idiots.

346
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,360
In two minutes, the truth will come out.

347
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,159
So many people today.

348
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
The tough-talking
but weak-boned Mr. Yang,

349
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,360
and this boastful gentleman.

350
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,960
Where do you think are you?

351
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
Do you have a death wish?

352
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,840
You really messed things up for me.

353
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Sir, here is the thing.

354
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,320
This man has nothing to do with us.

355
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,679
Please don't involve us, okay?

356
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,679
Let us in.

357
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,840
No rush.

358
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,960
Take care of him first.

359
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,480
As long as you kneel
and apologize to Baozhi Clinic,

360
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,080
I won't trouble you.

361
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,399
One more minute.

362
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,720
Wait a bit longer?

363
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
In one minute,

364
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,919
if Dr. Xu does not show up,

365
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,039
I wonder what he'll do.

366
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,639
If Dr. Xu does show up in a minute,

367
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,279
it'll be even more fun.
