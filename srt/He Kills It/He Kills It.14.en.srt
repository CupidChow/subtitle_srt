00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,599
How is it?

4
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,359
Feel fine, right?

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,319
I will not back out of the marriage.

6
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,439
But I will help Yang Ling
fend off external pressure.

7
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,280
As for you two,

8
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,719
whoever can win Yang Ling's heart,

9
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,640
that will depend on your abilities.

10
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,319
How?

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,879
What?

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,120
You don't even have confidence?

13
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,680
Tell me.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,960
Shen Guohao is vying for my woman.

15
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,759
Should I make him call me Dad?

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,159
Little boy,

17
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,080
I wish your courage

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,680
exceeds

19
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,879
your tone.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,240
Forget it.

21
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,719
Such a big son.

22
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,159
He's never tamed.

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,039
That's too bad.

24
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,360
I heard the Yang family threw you out.

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,439
Your woman doesn't seem
to value you much.

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,080
It's just minor squabbles between us.

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't overthink it.

28
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,879
When I'm confident,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,719
I'll find you.

30
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,240
Are you okay?

31
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,560
What?

32
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,719
I'll take you to see my sister.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
I can't understand.

34
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,520
Today's expenses are on me.

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,599
Have fun!

36
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,000
Sir, why not go for

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,039
a 200 thousand Emperor Set?

38
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,840
One set isn't enough.

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
One set per person.

40
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,000
Mr. Jin.

41
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Mr. Jin.

42
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,599
Mom.

43
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,159
There's change in your marriage.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
We'll no longer be involved.

45
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,319
What?

46
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,120
Listen to me closely!

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
No matter what means you use,

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,360
in the short term,

49
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,879
you must win Yang Ling's heart.

50
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Got it.

51
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,399
What's up?

52
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. Jin,

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,759
tell me.

54
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,120
How can I

55
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,240
quickly win a woman's heart?

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,519
Mr. Shen,

57
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,879
are you kidding me?

58
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,079
With your looks and wealth,

59
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,439
isn't it a piece of cake

60
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,279
to win any woman's heart?

61
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,360
You're mentioning Yang Ling?

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,120
Yes.

63
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,240
Actually,

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
Yang Ling also has weaknesses.

65
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,560
She is concerned about

66
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,319
her grandpa's condition.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,199
As long as

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,079
you can cure his illness,

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,079
you'll naturally win her heart.

70
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,800
Right?

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,399
I'll go call girls back.

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Bro, you need to be careful.

73
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,199
Long Gang has put up a billion
for your life.

74
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
Long Gang?

75
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,600
She is fine.

76
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,319
The accident was aimed at me.

77
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,600
The one who acted

78
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,800
was Long Gang.

79
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,600
I told you to leave Loong City,
but you didn't.

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,079
Now, my sister is also involved.

81
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,000
No matter what,

82
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
they'll go after your family.

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Moreover,

84
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,560
sister-in-law

85
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
and your grandpa

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,399
need my treatment.

87
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,079
Who is your sister-in-law?

88
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,800
What nonsense are you spouting?

89
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

90
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,319
Yuetong hasn't been able
to speak for over ten years.

91
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,560
Even the world's
best doctors couldn't fix it.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,399
But you can?

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,639
Indeed,

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,839
just me.

95
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,079
Besides me in this world,

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
there are few who can cure her illness.

97
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
Yuetong is naive.

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,079
You can easily fool her.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,399
But to fool me?

100
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,480
No way.

101
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,279
Miss,

102
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,439
I believe in him.

103
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,839
I have witnessed his ability
to resurrect the dead.

104
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,040
Yes, Miss.

105
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,480
Let Mr. Wu give it a try.

106
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,319
What if it works?

107
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,000
Give me a chance.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Also give your sister a chance.

109
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,160
If it can't be cured,

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,959
I promise I won't bother you again.

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,959
Okay.

112
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,879
Remember what you said.

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,360
If you can't cure it,

114
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,120
I'll make you regret it!

115
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,079
All of you, go out.

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,439
I am going to treat her now.

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,879
Don't you prepare anything?

118
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,839
I need to be here.

120
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,360
If there's any problem,

121
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,240
I will stop you immediately.

122
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,439
Suit yourself.

123
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,519
Wu Ming.

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,360
Honestly,

125
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,639
they all praise you

126
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,000
for your medical skills.

127
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,160
But I still don't believe it.

128
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,720
Believe me.

129
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,639
Your husband is very capable.

130
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,279
You...

131
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,519
I am going to start now.

132
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,480
What are you doing?

133
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
To activate the neck muscle groups

134
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
and nerve function,

135
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,799
I must unblock her meridians.

136
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,480
Don't deceive me.

137
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,039
I think you just want to take advantage.

138
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,559
You are not a good person.

139
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,639
Miss Yang,

140
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,919
take it objectively.

141
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't attack me.

142
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
You took the initiative.

143
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,519
You took the advantage.

144
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,440
The video...

145
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,159
Shut up!

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,559
No more talking.

147
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,480
You're serious.

148
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,480
I think you have a death wish.

149
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,759
It was the night we became a couple.

150
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,480
Remembering it

151
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,960
makes me feel emotional.

152
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,919
You actually dare to say that
in front of Yuetong.

153
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll kill you.

154
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,639
Yang Ling,

155
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,840
you are my love.

156
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,519
You're my first

157
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,919
and only woman.

158
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,960
You can only be mine.

159
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,919
Whether you admit it

160
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,639
or not,

161
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,879
it has already happened.

162
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,879
This is destiny

163
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,679
and affinity.

164
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,480
No matter what happens,

165
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,240
I will not let you leave me.

166
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,919
I hope you can

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,480
make my sister speak.

168
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,200
Don't think that
the throat isn't as big as a fist.

169
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,960
But it links the upper orifices

170
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,799
to the five organs.

171
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,919
It's the secret fortress
of the human body.

172
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Eight meridians

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,759
pass through it.

174
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,799
They are

175
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:07,552
Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin,
Kidney Meridian of Foot-Shaoyin,

176
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:10,840
Triple Burner Meridian of Hand-Shaoyang,
Small Intestine Meridian of Hand-Taiyang,

177
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,600
Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming,
and Spleen Meridian of Foot-Taiyin.

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,679
Only by unblocking these

179
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,240
can she fully recover.

180
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,759
Wait!

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,879
Ling,

182
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,879
I know what you're worried about.

183
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,600
You call me what!

184
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,440
I'll tear your mouth.

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
Remember, I am a doctor.

186
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
For a doctor, there's no gender,

187
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,240
just patients.

188
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,519
Moreover,

189
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,200
she is your sister.

190
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,200
She is my family.

191
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,159
Put away those thoughts.

192
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,159
Rest assured.
