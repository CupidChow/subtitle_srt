=Episode 22=

3
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,784
(Baozhi Clinic)

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,039
So,

5
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,359
Meihui's grandpa

6
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,200
only made it

7
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,600
because of Wu Ming?

8
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,640
Yeah, that's correct.

9
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,079
You're treating

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,079
the miracle doctor like charlatan.

11
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,799
If it weren't for my grandmaster,

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,840
Old Mr. Wang's ashes would be gone.

13
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,679
Hey, watch it!

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,599
No way.

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,640
Absolutely impossible.

16
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,000
Wu Ming's just a punk.

17
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,319
I'll believe it when I see it.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,040
You guys

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,079
can't fool me.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,879
How can you believe it?

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
How about my master

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
tell that to you in person?

23
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,719
He's a real miracle doctor?

24
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,319
Definitely!

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,879
(If he truly is a miracle doctor,)

26
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,840
(then he's my daughter's last hope.)

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,680
(I'll trust him this once.)

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,640
(If he can't cure my daughter,)

29
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,879
(I'll deal with him.)

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Wu Ming,

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,760
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,519
You are a miracle doctor.

33
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,040
Please.

34
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,799
Save Meihui.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,799
I'm begging you.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,879
Please.

37
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,400
No, Ma'am.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Mom, don't.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,599
I hit you,

40
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,200
cursed you,

41
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,239
and insulted you

42
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,120
because of

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
some misunderstanding.

44
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,319
I thought

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,480
you had bad intentions.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,640
My bad.

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,159
As long as you can save Meihui,

48
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,400
punish me

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,639
however you want.

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,479
Forget it.

51
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,199
No problem.

52
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,120
Get up.

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,800
No.

54
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,800
Promise me.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Or I won't get up.

56
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,000
I promise you.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,919
Get up first.

58
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,039
Good.

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
Thank you.

60
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,599
Blame me if you want.

61
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,120
I treated you like that.

62
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,039
You're still willing to save Meihui.

63
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,159
I...

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,159
I'm really touched.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,879
Ms. Wang,

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,159
forget it.

67
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,919
That's in the past.

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,039
Okay.

69
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,639
Meihui's illness

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,199
can't wait any longer.

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,439
Any way to cure it?

72
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,840
There is a way.

73
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,488
It's just...

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,280
Just what?

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Tell me.

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,919
Even if it'll make me broke,

77
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,120
I'll do it.

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
(Wu Ming, I've put all my trust in you.)

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,039
(If you're a fraud,)

80
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,280
(I'll kill you.)

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,480
With no Ghost Needle,

82
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,759
the brain gets unbalanced.

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,439
The suppressed illness

84
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,240
will erupt like a flood.

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,080
Unstoppable.

86
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,560
Really that serious?

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,639
What to do then?

88
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,280
My grandmaster said

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,479
he planned to

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,599
combine Yin and Yang energies

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,199
with Meihui

92
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,039
on their wedding night.

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
He would perform acupuncture.

94
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,199
But you called off the wedding.

95
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,560
What's he supposed to do?

96
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,960
That's an easy fix.

97
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,159
I'll just have Meihui marry Wu Ming.

98
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,400
They can get married tonight.

99
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,479
Mom!

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,759
Marriage first, love later.

101
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,680
Totally normal!

102
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,639
If Wu Ming ever gives you trouble,

103
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,159
I will be all over him.

104
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,520
Ma'am,

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
stop pulling matchmaking here.

106
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,840
My grandmaster already has a lover.

107
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,520
Miss Wang

108
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,280
doesn't even have a shot, probably.

109
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,280
Wu Ming,

110
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,280
the engagement was just cancelled.

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,479
You already have a lover?

112
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,199
Who's she?

113
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,079
It has to be Miss Yang Ling, of course.

114
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,120
Miss Yang Ling?

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,800
Wu Ming,

116
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,199
you two are a terrible match!

117
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,360
Drop these pipe dreams.

118
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,560
Be the Wang family's son-in-law,

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,319
alright?

120
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,759
You'll have

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,360
all of our Wang family fortune.

122
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,800
Ma'am,

123
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
we are practically a couple

124
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,199
and have a bun in the oven.

125
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,319
A bun in the oven?

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,639
Our Miss has taken the pill.

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,079
So what?

128
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,199
Don't talk nonsense.

129
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,240
I hate men who juggle two relationships.

130
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,399
I'll call Miss right now.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
How come I juggle two relationships?

132
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Wu Ming,

133
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,680
you must be with Meihui.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
Can you just stand by

135
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,000
and watch Meihui die?

136
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,399
Wu Ming,

137
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,399
I'm begging you.

138
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,000
There's an easy fix.

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,920
What's your plan?

140
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,519
Just let my grandmaster

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,360
date Miss Wang for one day.

142
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,639
Cure Miss Wang first
and then figure out the rest.

143
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,439
No way.

144
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,480
Mom.

145
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,399
Date for one day? What's it?

146
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,480
We're out of options then.

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
My grandmaster has a lover already.

148
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,439
He can't just end it out of the blue

149
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,800
and date Miss Wang.

150
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,680
(If Grandmaster and Miss Wang hook up,)

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,600
(that would give me a chance.)

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,639
Wu Ming,

153
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,720
Miss Yang Ling is so high above.

154
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,240
Way out of your league.

155
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,199
Besides,

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,040
she has plenty of choices.

157
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,600
But look at Meihui.

158
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
She only has you.

159
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,680
If Meihui

160
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,399
got...

161
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,279
If she got hurt,

162
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,680
I'd rather die.

163
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,399
Ma'am.

164
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,639
Let me check Meihui's condition first.

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,839
Alright.

166
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,160
Mom, don't worry.

167
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,839
Wu Ming's here.

168
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm not worried.

169
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,480
(I know there's no such thing
as a miracle doctor.)

170
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,600
(I say I believe in Wu Ming,)

171
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,399
(just to give you some hope)

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,000
(while you're still here.)

173
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,040
(I don't want you to be anxious)

174
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,560
(or have any regrets.)

175
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,319
(Oh, my daughter.)

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,879
Sister, are you okay?

177
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,519
Are you pregnant?

178
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,279
Stop it.

179
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,800
How's that possible?

180
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,279
My stomach's just a bit off.

181
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,480
Be careful.

182
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,040
Sister, what did Sha say?

183
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Nothing.

184
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,360
How do you feel about Wu Ming?

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
Why suddenly ask about him?

186
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,519
Nothing special.

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Sister,

188
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,800
you don't actually like him, do you?

189
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,160
How's that possible?

190
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,079
I don't even know him.

191
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,560
I wouldn't say "like".

192
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,240
Great.

193
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,800
So I can go after him.

194
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,959
No.

195
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,879
Why not?

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
That guy is no good.

197
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,240
Pretty bad.

198
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,959
You can't like him.

199
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,240
I think he's good.

200
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,600
You don't like him,

201
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,800
so you think he's no good.

202
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,879
I like him,

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,279
so I think he's great all around.

204
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,439
Sister,

205
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,199
I finally found someone I like.

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,680
You'll support me, right?

207
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,920
You probably don't have a chance.

208
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,319
Wu Ming's fiancée is seriously ill.

209
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,360
The only way to save her
is to marry her.

210
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,560
If he's a kind person,

211
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,199
he will feel

212
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,600
he has to save Wang Meihui.

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,959
If he doesn't save her,

214
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,199
then he's not a kind person.

215
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,600
People like him
should never get close to you.

216
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,800
So,

217
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,879
no matter what Wu Ming chooses...

218
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,680
That's right.

219
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Whatever he chooses doesn't work for

220
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,800
us.

221
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,199
I just feel really sorry for him.

222
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,759
But it's okay.

223
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,480
No matter what he decides,

224
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,279
I still like him just as much.

225
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,960
You're my sister.

226
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,639
I'll make sure

227
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,279
you're with a good guy.

228
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,519
So, no.

229
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,120
Love is between two people.

230
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,808
You're a third person!

231
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,000
Think you're grown up now?

232
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Yes, I do.

233
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,399
I'm chasing my own happiness.

234
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,279
No means no!

235
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Sister, take a pregnancy test first?

236
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,919
I'm worried about you.

237
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,440
Mr. Shen,

238
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,000
the Long family is our partner.

239
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,519
How did it collapse like that?

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,120
Don't believe it?

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
Go ask my mom.

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,960
Well, Yang,

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
don't you see the light?

244
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,399
The Long family is down.

245
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,519
A huge profit on the table.

246
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,519
If we each grab a share,

247
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,320
we're talking serious money, right?

248
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,840
Sounds great.

249
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,399
But I'm worried we'll end up
sharing the Longs' fate

250
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:28,879
if we pursue this.

251
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,200
Wu Ming's doomed.

252
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,840
I said it.

253
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,799
Nobody can help him.

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
But I can't do it in front of my mom.

255
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,799
It needs a thorough plan.

256
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,039
As for that Yang Ling,

257
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,320
I can't wait any longer.

258
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,679
Yang Tingjian,

259
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,200
I've helped you that much.

260
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,120
You still can't take over Yang Group?

261
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,440
Tell me,

262
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,399
are you a loser or something?

263
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,840
Mr. Shen,

264
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,720
I do need to explain.

265
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
The bigwigs in this group

266
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,440
are all old-timers,
with my dad way back when.

267
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,039
They still trust my dad the most.

268
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,919
So, are you saying

269
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,039
you're even useless

270
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,399
than a vegetative person?

271
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,759
Relax, Mr. Shen.

272
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,679
I'll take down Yang Group
and serve you soon.

273
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,879
Anyone who doesn't listen

274
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,759
needs a good lesson.

275
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
Got it.

276
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,559
Tonight,

277
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,759
bring Yang Ling here.

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,879
Mr. Shen,

279
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
she's now in her own hospital,

280
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
with bodyguards.

281
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,480
Even if I went with a gun,
it wouldn't do any good.

282
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,039
You're a family, aren't you?

283
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
Family members
know each other's weaknesses.

284
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,399
If you can't even
manage this tiny thing,

285
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,320
then honestly, I think it's time

286
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,240
we shake things up around here.

287
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,639
Mr. Shen, easy. All buddies here.

288
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:58,919
Yang,

289
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,960
use your head, will you?

290
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,960
If you're stuck,

291
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,159
as your bro, I've got an idea for you.

292
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,200
You might not dare.

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,080
What idea?

294
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,720
Go dig up your family's ancestral grave.

295
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,919
That'll get Yang Ling's attention.

296
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,720
She'll come running, right?

297
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
What the hell are you talking about!

298
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm just trying to help.

299
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,159
If you can't

300
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,279
bring yourself to do it,

301
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,679
I've got a construction crew.

302
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,919
I can do it for you.

303
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,919
How's it possible?

304
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,879
I've taken the contraceptive pill.

305
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,000
How could I even get pregnant?

306
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,639
It's all his fault.
