00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,319
(From here on out,
I'll live for my family.)

4
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,760
(But right now,)

5
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
(just let me be myself,)

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,159
(even if it's for a little while.)

7
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,879
Sister,

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
I saw nothing.

9
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,879
You guys continue.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
Do not marry Shen Guohao.

11
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,400
Give me some time,

12
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll surely...

13
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,120
Wu Ming.

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,599
Stop.

15
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,400
No one said he'd protect me before.

16
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,800
I don't know whether you really mean it.

17
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm touched anyway.

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,639
Leave here now.

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,719
With all your stuff.

20
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,680
(You're right.)

21
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,560
(Except medical skills,
I've got nothing.)

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,000
(But I'll never let anyone
touch my girl.)

23
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,439
(Never.)

24
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,919
That's enough.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,479
Sister, who's that person?

26
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm finally having a brother-in-law?

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,599
Expecting a husband?

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll find you one.

29
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,919
Dishes ready.

30
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, Boss.

31
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,759
We didn't order these two dishes.

32
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
(Shan Ye)
They're on my wife.

33
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Come around more often.

34
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,800
Hey, Boss,

35
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
your wife always has a stone face.

36
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,879
What's got her so cheerful today?

37
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,879
Hey, Bro.

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,079
You got any more of that med
you gave me last time?

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,079
Boss,

40
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,600
as long as you don't overdo it,

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,600
one pill is enough.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
That med is

43
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,639
seriously potent.

44
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm still feeling it, no joke.

45
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,160
Not for me. For my buddy.

46
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,160
You know.

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Some meds

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
are priceless.

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,639
(Shan Ye)
Alright, got it.

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,079
Enjoy your dinner.

51
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
It's all on me.

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,199
Boss, so generous.

53
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,879
Enjoy.

54
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm at your service.

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,759
Mr. Ming,

56
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,279
what med did you give him?

57
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Can I have a try?

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,399
Not now.

59
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,680
Well,

60
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,279
how's that thing going?

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,959
Found a place.

62
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,639
200,000 in rent per year.

63
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,439
Good.

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
Tomorrow, ask Lei Changhe

65
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,920
about Shen Guohao from Jinling.

66
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,199
Why bother?

67
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,279
Shen Guohao,
one of the Four Young Masters.

68
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,759
What's this about?

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
He stole my girl.

70
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,839
He can steal any woman

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,000
he wants.

72
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,839
What did you say?

73
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
Let's see

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,879
who comes out on top.

75
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,920
(Ling, trust me.)

76
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,639
(You will be a mom.)

77
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,439
(I'll protect you.)

78
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,959
(I believe)

79
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,199
(you'll make the smart decision
for the Yang Group,)

80
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,519
(since it's on the brink.)

81
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,240
Send me a contraceptive pill now.

82
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,160
Come on, Mr. Ming.

83
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,759
Grandmaster!

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,519
Such a coincidence.

85
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,920
Low-key, please.

86
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,879
Sounds like you're begging for alms.

87
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,439
Begging for alms?

88
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,199
Grandmaster.

89
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,759
Benefactor!

90
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm not begging.

91
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Order whatever you want.

92
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,560
It's on me.

93
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,480
Hey, Beauty.

94
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,959
You call him Grandmaster.

95
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm his bro.

96
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
So I'm your granduncle?

97
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,959
Want me to call you Granduncle, huh?

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,959
Depends on what gift you're offering.

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
My gift

100
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,680
is this big,

101
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,800
and this long.

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,639
Are you messing around?

103
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,920
Hey! I'm a decent guy.

104
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm talking about...

105
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,319
It's the thought that counts.

106
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't mind it.

107
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,360
Grandmaster,

108
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,120
where's your greeting gift?

109
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,839
You skipped the kneeling ceremony.

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,639
Grandmaster,

111
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,120
my respects to you!

112
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,240
Alright, get up now.

113
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,319
It's my insights

114
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
(Acupoint Map)
about complicated illnesses.

115
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,839
Thanks, Grandmaster!

116
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Mr. Ming,

117
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,639
this book of insights

118
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,720
is worth a fortune.

119
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,040
You just gave it away?

120
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,959
It's a copy.

121
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,120
I have plenty.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,879
Mr. Jin.

123
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,600
Doc, great to see you here.

124
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,199
But today I've got other stuff today.

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
Are you here looking for them?

126
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,079
Yep.

127
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,439
For him.

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Bro,

129
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,519
come with me.

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Mr. Jin,

131
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,399
you claimed to break my legs,

132
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,159
and make me lay your foundation.

133
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,639
How dare I go with you?

134
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,120
Brat,

135
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,799
watch your mouth!

136
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,759
Tired of living?

137
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
Keep it down.

138
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,600
Grandmaster,

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,279
need my help?

140
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,679
You just need to pay a bit.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,679
No worries.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,519
I'm not that rich.

143
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,039
Hey, you! I'm talking to you!

144
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,960
Are you deaf!

145
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,679
I said, keep it down.

146
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,919
Just keep it down.

147
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,080
You're talking so loud.

148
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,759
People will think you're the boss.

149
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,679
Let me put it this way.

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
A big shot's been asking after you,
by name.

151
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,399
You, eating at this cheap street stall,

152
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,919
got no business talking to me.

153
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm being nice. Don't be a fool.

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,519
Nice?

155
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,440
Fine.

156
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,440
You should

157
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,960
look the part.

158
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,840
What's wrong with you?

159
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,559
Take him.

160
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,120
Who dare harm him!

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,759
(Why does he smell like my sister?)

162
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,320
(Her perfume is unique.)

163
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,679
(It's him!)
