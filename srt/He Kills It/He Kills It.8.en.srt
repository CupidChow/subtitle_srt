1
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,488
=He Kills It=

2
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,240
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,759
Dead.

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,159
Grandpa!

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,840
Dad!

6
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:03,328
She...

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,079
She fainted.

8
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,359
This doctor everyone raved about
killed someone?!

9
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,560
Looks like Baozhi Clinic

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,040
will be toast!

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,760
Dr. Xu, please!

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,680
Please save my dad.

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,280
No matter the cost,

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,000
our Wang family can afford it.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,439
Alright.

16
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm begging you.

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't panic.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,280
Calm down.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,719
Dad.

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Master,

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,920
he's dead.

22
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,719
Baozhi Clinic has never had
a patient die on us.

24
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,120
If he dies here,

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,120
our reputation is ruined.

26
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,239
I should've been a better doctor.

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,280
It is as it is now.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,159
Have to try anything.

29
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,519
Mas...

30
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,000
Look carefully.

31
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,439
I'll show you again

32
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,488
Divine Thirteen Needles.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,760
Okay.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,400
Fingertip blood

35
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,640
shows blocked energy.

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,239
Move.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,080
Make way.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
Divine Thirteen Needles.

39
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,400
The first five lock the fate,

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,639
keep the illness

41
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,879
from progressing.

42
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,680
The middle five,

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,159
called Heaven's Gate,

44
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,479
open up the body's meridians.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
The eleventh

46
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,159
is Soul Return.

47
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,240
Oh, Dad!

48
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,360
All this is just for show.

49
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,199
Dr. Xu, you don't actually believe

50
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,120
this bum's nonsense, do you?

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,319
I just feel bad for the Old Mr. Wang.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Being humiliated like this,
even after death.

53
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,719
Guess it was all for nothing.

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,879
Wu Ming,

55
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,280
I will sue you.

56
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,199
You're paying for this with your life.

57
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:15,840
I will take a rest.

58
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,319
You take it from here.

59
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,599
What will be, will be.

60
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,840
Don't take it too hard.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I know what you're capable of.

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
You can't leave.

63
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,360
This is not over.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,159
You bad guy killed my dad.

65
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,960
Want to escape?

66
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,599
Oh, Dad!

67
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,439
Why grabbing me?

68
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,039
Wu Ming did it.

69
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,120
You should grab him, Dad.

70
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,360
You're alive!

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,680
Dad.

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,199
Alive!

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Dad's alive.

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,719
This...

75
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,080
How could this happen?

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Wasn't he just dead?

77
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,439
Don't say things like that!

78
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,759
My master is right here.

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,919
How can anyone possibly die?

80
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,960
I got it.

81
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,439
It must be Dr. Xu's needles working.

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,639
Or maybe Wu Ming's needles

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,759
helped too?

84
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,560
No.

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
Impossible!

86
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,519
Dr. Xu had been needling him for long.

87
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,439
Wu Ming just showed up,
acting like he knows something.

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,519
Finding that the old man was dying,

89
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,199
he just ran away.

90
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,639
Plain as day,

91
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,720
Dr. Xu's the one who saved him.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,199
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

93
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,040
Dr. Xu,

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,680
do you agree with my analysis?

95
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,839
You are the real miracle doctor!

96
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,959
Get this noisy thing out of here.

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,759
Enough.

98
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,879
You are

99
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,519
just everywhere.

100
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,680
Go away.

101
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
The pulse is stable.

102
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,920
Dr. Xu...

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
I've lost substantial energy.

104
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:50,759
Have to go into seclusion.

105
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,199
Don't bother me no matter what.

106
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,319
Seriously, remember that!

107
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,160
Remember that!

108
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,839
Remember that!

109
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:57,959
Mr. Chun.

110
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,519
Everyone!

111
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,720
Master's going into seclusion.

112
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm covering everything for him.

113
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,959
Let's go.

114
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,560
Miss Shen.

115
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,680
Yue, where is Wu Ming?

116
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,800
Didn't see him.

117
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,680
He is your grandmaster?

118
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,120
I don't want to admit it.

119
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,240
But you've seen it.

120
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,519
My grandmaster looks
even younger than me!

121
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,279
Still feel like I'm dreaming.

122
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,839
Where's your friend?

123
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:32,736
Over there?

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,399
Miss Shen,

125
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,199
rest assured.

126
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Dr. Xu and I go way back.

127
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:57,959
He will definitely help out.

128
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,399
Mr. Jin,

129
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,839
bring Wu Ming to me.

130
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,360
Wait, Miss Shen.

131
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,439
You wouldn't think

132
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,920
Wu Ming is a miracle doctor?

133
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,199
He is so young.

134
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,319
How's it possible?

135
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,480
Right?

136
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,616
(Pin Ming)

137
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,279
Extreme acupuncture
takes a huge toll on me.

138
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Like I owe the Wangs.

139
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,800
Hey!

140
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,680
How'd you get in?

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
Alright.

142
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,639
What is it?

143
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
You didn't lie to me.

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,199
(You're a miracle doctor.)

145
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm not a miracle doctor.

146
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,480
You've got it wrong.

147
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,399
Get out.

148
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,560
Close the door, please.

149
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,160
(Last night with the Ice Queen.)

150
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,000
(Today, intense acupuncture.)

151
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,199
(Now I feel just wiped.)

152
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
(If you agree to treat my grandpa,)

153
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,160
(ask for whatever you want.)

154
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,879
I want to sleep.

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,840
What are you doing?

156
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,799
I'll sleep with you.

157
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,120
You'll save my grandpa.

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,080
Okay?

159
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,759
I get the first sentence.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,240
You want to sleep with me?

161
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320
How can you be so casual?

162
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,759
Not what?

163
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,159
You...

164
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,399
You get on my bed.

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,120
(You said you want to sleep.)

166
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,639
You want to sleep with me?

167
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm not a casual guy.

168
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,879
I have a wife.
