=Episode 18=

3
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,320
Don't you know about personal space?

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,159
Back off.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,000
You're a patient.

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,880
You should be nice.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,159
Back off.

8
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,664
Doctor.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,479
Doctor.

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,319
Doctor.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,000
I-I have a neck pain.

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,120
Is anywhere alright?

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,680
Straight!

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,760
Please, all same!

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
All same.

16
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,400
No way.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,568
Here.

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,488
Mr. Shen,

19
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,120
are you sitting on the winning seat?

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,920
Win, every round!

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,120
Winning seat?

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
Wherever Mr. Shen sits,

23
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,359
good fortune just follows.

24
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,000
Got honey on your tongue?

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,959
Listen!

26
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,920
Good news.

27
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,359
News just in.

28
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,280
Wu Ming

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
had a car accident.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
Hands and legs broken.

31
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,280
Currently in hospital.

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,319
Well, Mr. Long,

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,280
he had such a huge incident.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,359
You still laughing?

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,959
Is he dead?

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,792
No fun if he's dead.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,239
So swift and clean.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
If you ask me,

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,199
lying on the bed half-dead

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
is truly suffering.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,879
That's mean.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
Such a genius.

43
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,759
Well, Mr. Yang,

44
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,319
I think he should die.

45
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,759
Even dare to go against Mr. Shen?

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,960
No, no.

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Actually, I'm not so keen on him dying.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,719
I just want him to see

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,319
how I play Yang Ling

50
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,599
like a fiddle.

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,120
And I want her to see

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,879
what a complete loser

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
she's got a crush on.

54
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,479
Have to say, Mr. Shen's
got the book smarts.

55
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,719
Look at how well
he's waging this warfare.

56
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,319
Come on.

57
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,479
Shuffle the cards.

58
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,639
Shuffle, quick!

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,759
All your cash.

60
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,439
Put it here.

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
What do you want?

62
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,759
This villa is part of the group.

63
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,960
It has other uses.

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,879
You two pack up and get out immediately.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,479
Sister, what should we do now?

66
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,120
This mute survived a car accident.

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Even started talking.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,759
What's going on?

69
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,960
This world is full of things
you can't imagine.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,439
My dear Ice Queen.

71
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,639
Even now,

72
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,919
still acting like you're calm?

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,479
Your backup is Wu Ming, right?

74
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,319
You don't actually believe

75
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,080
that a loser

76
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,000
can cure a person who's brain dead?

77
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,400
Yang Tingjian.

78
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,599
Honestly, you're
pathetic and ridiculous.

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Ganging up with outsiders.

80
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,759
Doesn't that bug your conscience?

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Why act all noble?

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
No family bonds in war.

83
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,319
Business is just as cutthroat.

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,639
I also reckon
businesswomen are ruthless.

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,840
You're just better at hiding it.

86
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,400
Power.

87
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,759
Money.

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,960
Status.

89
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,800
If getting these means
I have to hurt my family,

90
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,439
I wouldn't even go near them.

91
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,000
What are you waiting for?

92
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't want to leave?

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,639
Wish to be kicked out?

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,720
You there.

95
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,440
Take action.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't touch my sister.

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,040
All, stop!

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,720
Are you okay?

99
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,432
Come on.

100
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,759
(Real beauties.)

101
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,079
(I want both of them.)

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,199
Who are you, really?

103
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,879
Messing with the Long family?

104
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm Shen Guohao.
How dare you touch my girl?

105
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,000
(Bad guy!)

106
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,480
(It's just an act!)

107
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,759
(Hit so hard!)

108
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,680
What?

109
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,040
You're lucky to get hit by me.

110
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Who exactly are you?

111
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,079
Just so arrogant.

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
Our young master

113
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,199
is an heir

114
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,800
of the Shen family in Jinling.

115
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
The Shen family?

116
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,000
That one with a legacy
going back centuries?

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,800
Are you the legendary

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,199
Mr. Guohao from the Four Young Masters?

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,680
Mr. Guohao?

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
(You are really an actor!)

121
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
(Reliable.)

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,079
Mr. Shen,

123
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,399
it's my honor

124
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,040
to meet you.

125
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh, right,

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,920
you just called Yang Ling your girl?

127
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,079
That's right.

128
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,608
We're planning to get married next year.

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,759
- What?
- What?

130
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,839
Well,

131
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,839
any objections?

132
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,120
No, no.

133
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,040
If the Yangs get together
with the Shens,

134
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
that'd be like striking gold!

135
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,560
Exactly.

136
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,720
Second Uncle is so shameless.

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Ling, such huge news! Why not tell me?

138
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,959
Look at all the fuss here.

139
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,360
Alright, from now on,

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
I'll put you back
as CEO of the Yang Group.

141
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,480
How about that?

142
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,759
(What terrible acting.)

143
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,560
Yang Tingjian,

144
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,079
you're not that old.

145
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,000
Your knees already that weak, huh?

146
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
Truly pathetic.

147
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,352
You!

148
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
You're right.

149
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,959
Look, admiring strength

150
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,680
is just human nature.

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,959
Plus,

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
Mr. Shen is seriously

153
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,079
someone you can't help but admire.

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,279
Alright.

155
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,920
Ling doesn't like you.

156
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,079
Get lost already.

157
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:30,959
Yes.

158
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,879
It's awful if one loses his dignity,

159
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,240
just like a dog.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
But I get it.

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,920
Nations rise and fall.

162
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
Let alone a family.

163
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
I don't need help from any of you,

164
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,720
including you, Shen Guohao.

165
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,879
I won't marry you either.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Yuetong,

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,639
let's go.

168
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,256
Sister.

169
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,240
Hey, stop there.

170
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,279
Stop.

171
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
What on earth is going on?

172
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,839
Can't you see it?

173
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,199
She just had an epiphany.

174
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,480
This wretch!

175
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,079
Embarrassed me in front of everyone.

176
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,959
Mr. Shen, we shouldn't let her go.

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,439
If needed,

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,879
how about using some special methods?

179
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,160
Let me think about it.

180
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,439
I feel even more eager to conquer.

181
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,480
It's exciting
to conquer a woman like that.

182
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,439
Got it.

183
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,040
You're just a genius.

184
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
Mom.

185
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,879
Since there's no cure,

186
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,800
let's go home.

187
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,120
I don't wanna die in a hospital.

188
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
My daughter,

189
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,759
where else could you go?

190
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,079
If you suddenly pass out one day,

191
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,519
you can still get help in time
in the hospital.

192
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,759
That's the only way I can relax.

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,759
Even Professor Song can't do anything.

194
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,439
Looks like there's really no chance.

195
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,519
Mom, don't worry about me.

196
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,919
What will be, will be.

197
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,639
Let's just enjoy the moment.

198
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
Sweetie,

199
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,960
that's just killing me.

200
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,639
How can I possibly let go?

201
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
You are my only daughter.

202
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,679
Well,

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
if Professor Song has no way,

204
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,759
how about we find another doctor?

205
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,360
I'll never give up on you.

206
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Not even until the end.

207
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,360
Mom!

208
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,279
Alright.

209
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,799
Don't move.

210
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,720
Then you won't squish the brain nerves.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,519
Alright, I promise you.

212
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,759
Wherever I am is fine,

213
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,159
as long as I'm with you.

214
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
- I'll be with you.
- Mom.

215
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,320
Stop crying.

216
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll be with you.

217
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,039
Good girl.

218
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,576
Okay.

219
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,360
Here.

220
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,720
Have an apple.

221
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,600
You eat first.

222
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,720
No. Eat it.

223
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,200
Good?

224
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,559
Eat more.
