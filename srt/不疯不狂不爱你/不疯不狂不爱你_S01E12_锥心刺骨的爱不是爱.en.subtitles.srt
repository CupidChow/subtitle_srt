1
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,703
I probably know the passcode,
but I waited anyway.

2
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,041
It felt kind of wrong.

3
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,751
Or maybe not.

4
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,211
I guess it's still my house.

5
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,090
Is it 1234?

6
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,347
It's 2345?

7
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,559
Here.

8
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,650
I no longer own any part of this house.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,652
I should've done this
when you gave me money.

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,988
But you never asked me for it.

11
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,159
Are you going to keep living here?

12
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,745
Yes.

13
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,664
Isn't that weird? We lived here together.

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,334
No way.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,753
Don't be mistaken.
It's not because of you.

16
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,964
Then what's this?

17
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,842
You put this on the table

18
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,969
and tell me not to get mistaken?

19
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,180
Don't touch it. It's not yours.

20
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,018
I see.

21
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,730
I guess you're seeing someone.

22
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,191
Does she

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,651
know?

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,986
Know what?

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,490
That you got dismissed from your job
and that you receive therapy.

26
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:58,952
Yes.

27
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,162
She knows.

28
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,957
That's a relief.

29
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,459
Not many women are able to embrace a guy

30
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,337
who has no job and receives therapy

31
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,714
for anger management issues.

32
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,260
She must have a peculiar taste in men.

33
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,808
What are you trying to do?
Are you trying to start a fight?

34
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,351
Of course not.

35
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,313
I'm just checking up on you
for old times' sake.

36
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,483
You call this checking up on me?

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,661
Then what about you? How are you?

38
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,914
Are you doing well?

39
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,292
Yes.

40
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,002
I'm happy.

41
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,588
I'm going to get married soon.

42
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,634
He's an accountant.

43
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,471
I wanted to take my time,
but things just happened.

44
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,016
Is that okay?

45
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,227
-About what?
-I mean, think about it.

46
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,355
You're still living in our old house.

47
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,733
Meanwhile, I'm happily getting married.

48
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,446
Plus, I'm aware
that you have mental issues,

49
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,991
so I'm worried
your condition might get worse.

50
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:21,993
You're worried?

51
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,373
Since when did you ever worry about me?

52
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,292
Tell me.

53
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,836
Did you break off the engagement

54
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,924
even though I begged you to wait
until the investigation ended

55
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,218
and file a claim for damages

56
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,929
because you were so worried?

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,563
Abandoning someone during their worst time

58
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,817
is the worst thing anyone can do.

59
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,529
Sure.

60
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,199
Of course.

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,868
So you were the only one suffering.

62
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,205
What was I supposed to do?

63
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,252
People get married to be happy,
but you suddenly turned into a mess.

64
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,673
Was I supposed to stay by your side

65
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,799
and comfort you

66
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,717
by any means necessary?

67
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,472
Would we have been happy?

68
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,100
No.

69
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,770
You have a knack for driving people crazy.

70
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,730
I would've eventually lost it too.

71
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,363
So?

72
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,449
Are you happy now?

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,244
What?

74
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,496
Are you happy?

75
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,126
Yes, of course.

76
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,837
Why?

77
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,714
Do I look unhappy?

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,718
A little.

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,055
People who are truly happy

80
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,977
don't bully or hurt others.

81
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,148
Because if you're really happy,

82
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,485
you don't need to put your mind at ease

83
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,864
by purposely condemning
and hurting others.

84
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,206
It's true that I hated you
after you left me,

85
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,251
but I never wanted the worst for you.

86
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,962
Even now, I still want you to be happy.

87
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,424
I may not know much,

88
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,845
but judging by how that tax accountant
wants to marry you,

89
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,263
he must be a good person.

90
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,807
So there's no need to feel anxious.

91
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,147
I hope you're happy like I am.

92
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,277
He's just an accountant, you fool.

93
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,742
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,289
I packed your stuff. You should take them.
Wait here for a moment.

95
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,310
Gosh, what is this?

96
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,370
Howi…

97
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,508
Babe, someone's here.

98
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,096
Come in.

99
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,141
I…

100
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,750
Babe, someone's here.

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,130
Yeah? Didn't he say he was married
when he moved in?

102
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,093
I can't make it today.
Something just came up.

103
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,012
Hey, did you forget?

104
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,847
I got an urgent call from the station.

105
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,848
-Girlfriend!
-Miss…

106
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,184
He's completely trash!

107
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,626
It took me ages to find this.

108
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,586
Gosh.

109
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,588
By the way,

110
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,466
did you call me "babe" earlier?

111
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,093
Right, "babe".

112
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,679
It's just a casual way of calling people
these days.

113
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,808
But I think the girl
who has a peculiar taste in men

114
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,560
ended up getting the wrong idea.

115
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,566
Gosh.

116
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,694
You should go.

117
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,571
You're so…

118
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,823
Just go.

119
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,580
EPISODE 12
LOVE THAT DIDN'T HURT TOO MUCH

120
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,803
Open up. I know you're inside.

121
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,435
Are you going to make me go nuts?

122
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,689
Just come outside.

123
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,692
Let's talk face to face.

124
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,745
Get lost before I call the cops.

125
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,044
I know why you're being like this.
I'll explain. It's not what you think.

126
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,839
I don't want to hear it.

127
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,342
You lied because you felt guilty.

128
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,511
You said you were at the station.

129
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,058
I didn't lie to you.

130
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,769
I met her after I came back
from the station.

131
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,982
It was my first time seeing her
after the breakup.

132
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,902
She had a few of her things
she needed to pick up, and…

133
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,116
She probably called me "babe" on purpose.
She tends to do that.

134
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,955
So? What about it?

135
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,541
What does that have to do with me?

136
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,129
Why? Do you think we're something special
because we slept together once?

137
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,548
So what?

138
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,677
I always sleep around with married men.
Didn't you know?

139
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,221
Don't say that!

140
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
Why…

141
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,993
Why won't you even hear me out?

142
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,414
You're right. I'm no one special.

143
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,459
But just know that I never lied to you.

144
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,879
I don't ever want anyone
to lie to you again.

145
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,589
No one.

146
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,468
I just don't want you
to get hurt by anyone ever again.

147
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,538
What's the matter?

148
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,041
Did something happen?

149
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,796
Howi is sick. He's at the vet.

150
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,258
Why? Did he get hurt?

151
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,637
I think he was poisoned.
I think someone did it on purpose.

152
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,436
He did this to warn me.

153
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,857
He kidnapped Howi in the elevator
when I accidentally let go of the leash.

154
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,818
I don't know
how long he's been watching me.

155
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,319
I'm so scared.

156
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,490
My dog is gone.

157
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,994
It smelled of gas since yesterday,
so I left the door open to let some air…

158
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,829
It was you! You did it!

159
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,962
Open the door.

160
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,580
It's okay.

161
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,832
It'll be okay.

162
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,629
I understand.

163
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,515
You don't believe me,

164
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,308
do you?

165
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,854
I believe you.

166
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,443
You promised not to lie to me again.

167
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,405
Tell me the truth. Do you believe me?

168
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,661
I do. I believe you, but…

169
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,249
maybe he accidentally ate something
from a flower bed.

170
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,211
Plus, that man…

171
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,421
He's in prison.

172
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,634
So don't get any ideas.

173
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,807
You almost fooled me.

174
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,185
You and that devilish tongue of yours.

175
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,438
What? You want me to trust in myself?

176
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,858
You asshole. You're an asshole too.

177
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,945
No, don't get me wrong--

178
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,363
Let go!

179
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,739
Get lost!

180
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,701
Get lost! Go away!

181
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,287
Don't get worked up. Calm down.

182
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,332
Get off me! Don't touch me! Get off me!

183
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,837
You don't believe me either.

184
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,882
You just think however you want
and jump to conclusions.

185
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,928
Yes, that's right.

186
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,223
I can't believe you.

187
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,726
Even less in myself.

188
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,562
Are you happy now?

189
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,421
See?

190
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,465
So trust yourself.

191
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,967
You didn't do anything wrong.

192
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,386
What do you mean, no one is on your side?

193
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,308
You have me.

194
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,978
Here. We're allies now.

195
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,948
I don't ever want anyone
to lie to you again.

196
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,785
I just don't want you
to get hurt by anyone ever again.

197
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,799
No matter what I do,

198
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,094
be understanding, trust me,

199
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,388
and stand up for me.

200
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,432
Can you promise to do that?

201
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,434
My gosh.

202
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,104
I'm so stupid. I'm such a fool.

203
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,862
Especially on days I hear news of you

204
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,074
Do you like that person?

205
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:37,329
To be honest, it's hard for me to bear

206
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,873
Who uploaded this without my permission?

207
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,710
Look at the number of views.

208
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,754
It already got over 100,000 views
in such a short time.

209
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,506
And read the comments.

210
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,550
Look.

211
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,926
HER VOICE IS UNREAL

212
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,262
I'VE WATCHED THIS SO MANY TIMES

213
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,180
WHAT AN AMAZING VOICE

214
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,851
So what?

215
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,352
I already told you.

216
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,897
So what if I can sing?
I'm just someone who's studying

217
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,190
to pass an exam anyway.

218
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,525
This is big.

219
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,945
The number of views equals money.
Think of this as another part-time job.

220
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,368
I won't have enough time to film, edit,
and upload the videos online

221
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,870
because I'll be busy studying.

222
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,204
It'd be really nice

223
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,208
if someone who's really good
with computers can help you.

224
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,003
For example, a game programmer.

225
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,132
Will you help me? Why?

226
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,635
Once you start profiting, fifty-fifty?

227
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,553
What?

228
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,347
I'll be filming, planning,
and editing the videos.

229
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,810
I'll take all that into consideration
and give you 30 percent. No more.

230
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:43,937
Deal.

231
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,778
What should we name the channel?

232
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,866
How about "Part-timer examinee
who can sing"?

233
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,994
Sure. It's nice and straightforward.

234
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,789
Can you think of anything else?

235
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,957
How about something more catchy?

236
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,343
I guess they're "a set" now.

237
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,179
And so are units 506 and 507, right?

238
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,891
The three of us also hang out together
all the time, so we're also "a set".

239
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,519
That's not how it's pronounced these days.

240
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,563
-It's pronounced "set, set" like this.
-What?

241
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,774
-"Set, set".
-"Set, set". Like this?

242
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,151
-"Set, set".
-"Set, set". Yes.

243
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,779
Howi.

244
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,460
He's recovering well.

245
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,296
I see.

246
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,757
Howi, you need to get better soon.

247
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,676
Get better so you can go for a walk.

248
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,852
Yes, starting from there.

249
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,187
Here?

250
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,637
-Did you look into it?
-Yes.

251
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,056
-Really? Okay.
-Here.

252
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
LIST OF EVIDENCE (INCLUDING WITNESSES)

253
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:28,662
PHOTO OF ASSAULT VICTIM

254
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,717
He should've been arrested for this,

255
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,386
but he must've hired
a really expensive lawyer.

256
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,681
The court must've accepted
that both parties were at fault.

257
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,017
So he was even charged without detention.

258
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,021
Hwi-oh, didn't you know about this though?

259
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,565
This was a pretty big issue
on the internet.

260
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,404
There were articles and videos about
the Cheongdam-dong Dating Violence Case.

261
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,448
Take a look.

262
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,766
Gosh. It must have hurt so much.

263
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,145
I mean, this guy isn't even human.

264
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:41,276
He was jailed thanks to this footage.

265
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,736
But what's the use?

266
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,156
He was bailed out after a short while.

267
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,534
What?

268
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,831
I'll call you.

269
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,311
Yes.

270
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,689
I changed my door lock passcode,
but I forgot.

271
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,360
This is Hongjik Jungang Apartment,
unit 506, building 105.

272
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,448
It's urgent, so can you come right now?

273
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,991
I'll pay you twice the cost.

274
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,872
Unit 506, building 105. Yes.

275
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,293
Please hurry.

276
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,964
Excuse me, sir.

277
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,550
Which unit did you just say?

278
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,136
What do you mean?

279
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,305
Who are you?

280
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,474
Didn't you just say "unit 506"?

281
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,559
No, I didn't.

282
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,107
-No, wait.
-You're mistaken.

283
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,442
-No, I clearly heard you say "unit 506."
-You're mistaken.

284
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,361
No, wait.

285
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,404
Wait. Come here.

286
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,073
Seriously! You're mistaken!

287
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,700
Stop right there!

288
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,661
Stop right there, you punk! Come here!

289
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,829
Come here!

290
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,131
Get up.

291
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,217
Come here. Get back up, you punk.

292
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,429
It was you, wasn't it?

293
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,973
Why are you doing this to me?

294
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,232
What? Are you trying to be a hero
for your girlfriend?

295
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,568
Do you even know Min-kyung?

296
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,320
Do you even know about us?

297
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,740
Hello? I'd like to file a report
for someone breaking and entering.

298
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,409
There's a video we took together.

299
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,332
Aren't you curious?
Do you want me to show you?

300
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,669
Do you think you'll be able to date her
even after you watch that?

301
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,048
Actually, you'll probably
fall for her even more.

302
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,060
What? What did you just say?

303
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,437
What did you say?

304
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,068
Get up. Stand up!

305
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,653
Come here.

306
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,129
Stop it.

307
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,799
Don't! Stop it!

308
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,050
Get off!

309
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,024
Are you okay?

310
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,183
You think I followed her, threatened her,
and did something to her dog?

311
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,687
Did Min-kyung say that?

312
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,690
You believed her and just beat me up?

313
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,153
I only went there to apologize.

314
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,072
Also, she has mental issues.

315
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,490
You should check.

316
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,622
We were deeply involved with each other.

317
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,793
We had a slight misunderstanding.

318
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,546
We're going to get back together.

319
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,507
What was that, you jerk? Come here…

320
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,010
That's enough. Calm down.

321
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,806
Right now,
we're just investigating you for assault.

322
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,435
Mr. Noh, do you admit
that you assaulted Mr. Lee?

323
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,399
Yes.

324
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,777
Why did you assault him?

325
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,948
Because he deserved it.

326
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,994
That kind of testimony
could act against you.

327
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,247
Mr. Lee, do you want
the assailant to be punished?

328
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,917
I'd like to sue him for assault.

329
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,144
Apologize and settle no matter what.
Do you understand?

330
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,313
Won-cheol.

331
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,816
He's a real asshole.

332
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,776
I know. I heard about him.

333
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,778
So I understand why you did what you did.

334
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,947
But still, aren't you
going to get reinstated?

335
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,659
You even got a doctor's note.
You're almost back.

336
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:26,788
If you get sued for assault,
your reinstatement will go down the drain!

337
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,415
So, settle no matter what.

338
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,459
Answer me!

339
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,547
Whatever. My reinstatement
isn't what's important here.

340
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,090
Aren't you going to catch Yang?

341
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,677
I thought you
wanted to catch him for U-jin.

342
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,887
Did you forget all that?

343
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,809
I guess you've forgotten.

344
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,024
My gosh.

345
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:55,942
Hey.

346
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,946
Min-kyung!

347
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,200
Wait.

348
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,077
Please hear me out.

349
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,203
Just a second.

350
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,080
Please! Just for a second!

351
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,833
Let go of me.

352
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,379
What's wrong?

353
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,007
Did you think I'd thank you?

354
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,426
When did I ask you to do that to him?

355
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,512
Is beating people up
the only thing you're good at?

356
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,309
-No, it's not that…
-You did it for me?

357
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,103
No.

358
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,898
You just took your anger out on him.

359
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,400
I didn't take out my anger on him.

360
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,361
He deceived and harassed you!

361
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,030
How are you any different?

362
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,292
I'm sorry.

363
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,295
Let me see. Are you okay?

364
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,713
Get off me!

365
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,593
Right now, you're hurting me the most.

366
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,637
You don't believe me.

367
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,889
You think I'm crazy.

368
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,641
No.

369
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,768
I'm the one who's crazy.

370
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,479
I'm the real crazy one.

371
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,399
I'm so angry.

372
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,694
I'm so angry that it drives me crazy.

373
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,867
Seeing you hurt…

374
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,291
Seeing you in so much pain…

375
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,087
That makes me so angry, okay?

376
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,923
I don't care what happens to me now.

377
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,513
Don't think you have the right
to meddle with my life.

378
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
What's the point of all this?

379
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,601
I'm a crazy woman who had an affair
with a married man.

380
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,271
And you're just a hothead
who's always beating people up.

381
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,773
This hothead who's always
beating people up

382
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,860
just wants to be with the crazy woman

383
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,821
who had an affair with a married man!

384
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,447
Darn it.

385
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,316
CURRENTLY FILMING
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION

386
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,408
Cue.

387
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,623
I purposely take a few steps back

388
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,878
I look at you

389
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,174
Walking without me

390
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:11,596
There's a void beside you

391
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,099
Upon the black and white road

392
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,225
I'd like to buy this.

393
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,980
You look back

394
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:27,445
That's when I realized

395
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,035
Smile. I'm taking a video.

396
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,851
You were right, Dr. Han.

397
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
A dog that's too big and wild

398
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,440
is too dangerous.

399
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,324
Do you remember asking me
what the source of my anger is?

400
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,662
It's me.

401
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,391
Are you going somewhere?

402
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,560
Yes.

403
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,822
I'm sorry.

404
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,325
I…

405
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,077
Let's end it.

406
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,166
Whatever it was that we were doing.

407
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,044
Unfortunately…

408
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,674
there's nothing we can do.

409
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,349
Min-kyung.

410
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,977
This is too hard for me.

411
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,312
So I can't do this anymore.

412
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,517
No, wait! Min-kyung!

413
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,731
Wait there! I'll be right down!

414
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,172
Min-kyung!

415
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,677
Should I stop the car?

416
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,305
No, keep driving.

417
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:18,212
