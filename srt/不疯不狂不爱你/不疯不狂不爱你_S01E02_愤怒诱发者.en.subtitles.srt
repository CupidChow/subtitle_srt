1
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,397
There, there.

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,736
There.

3
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,246
You'd better tell the truth.

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,749
Today at 4 p.m.,

5
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,667
you used this umbrella

6
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,462
to hit me here, here, here, and here.

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,506
You did it deliberately
even though you knew it could hurt me.

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,550
Yes, I did.

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,011
According to Article 261
of the Criminal Act,

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,598
if you cause physical harm to someone
using a dangerous weapon,

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,809
you can be jailed up to five years
or be fined up to ten million won.

12
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,145
You just confessed
that you committed assault.

13
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,065
-Sir, are you writing this down?
-Oh, yes.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,942
Are you a law student?

15
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,403
And on the same day at 9 p.m.,

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,323
you climbed on top of my car
in the parking lot.

17
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,659
You kicked it, hit it, and sat on it.
You admit it, right?

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,245
It's all on security footage,
so don't try to get out of it.

19
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,874
Article 366 of the Criminal Act,

20
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,794
if you damage another person's property,
you can be jailed for up to three years,

21
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,588
or be fined up to seven million won.
You'll have to pay a fine.

22
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,133
Gosh, this woman must've wanted
to end up behind bars.

23
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,385
Why do you think I did all that?

24
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,514
Yes, let's talk about that.
Tell us your motive.

25
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,935
You stalked me all day,
kept hitting on me, and threatened me.

26
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,189
And he even tried to assault me
in the parking lot.

27
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,151
I only got on top of his car
to lure him towards the security camera.

28
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,823
If I didn't do that, who knows
what would've happened to me by now?

29
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,032
Gosh, seriously.

30
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,203
You were scared too, weren't you?

31
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,914
Look at you shaking.

32
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,542
Look. The dog is shaking.

33
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,876
It's okay, it's okay.

34
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,799
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

35
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,300
How is this nonsense?

36
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,431
Detective, he's a sex offender.

37
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,227
He's even wearing an ankle monitor.
You should check.

38
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,771
An ankle monitor.

39
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,189
What? An ankle…

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,025
Jeez.

41
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,070
Gosh.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,366
It's a locker key from the bathhouse!
Got that?

43
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:42,829
I wore these slippers
because I thought they were mine.

44
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,497
I had no idea I was wearing this.

45
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,791
An ankle monitor? An ankle monitor?

46
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,169
That can't be. Wait.

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,714
Here.

48
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,884
Like this. Like this. Like this. See?

49
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,468
What?

50
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,429
Are you saying this guy is me?

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,975
Here. Do I look like him now?
What do you think? Do I look like him?

52
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,143
Give me a glare.

53
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,479
Here you go. I'm glaring.

54
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,232
What do you think? Do I look like him now?

55
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,195
Why are you so quiet?
You must be pretty embarrassed.

56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,363
Did you get plastic surgery?

57
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,448
Look here.

58
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,283
Quiet down now.

59
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,244
I just checked that you guys
live next to each other.

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,371
It looks like
there was a misunderstanding.

61
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,290
Why not just apologize and end things?

62
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,208
-Apologize for what?
-Apologize for what?

63
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,045
-That's a load of bull.
-It's best for you to settle this…

64
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,505
Detective Noh!

65
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,720
Hey, what…

66
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,388
What are you doing here?

67
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,350
What about you?

68
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,940
-Hwi-oh.
-Yes.

69
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:52,941
It's hot.

70
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,401
What are you doing here?

71
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,653
What?

72
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,364
I was here
for a cooperative investigation.

73
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,241
A cooperative investigation? For what?

74
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,118
It's nothing serious.

75
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,456
Anyway, why do you keep avoiding my calls
as well as the captain's?

76
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,209
Why aren't you picking up?
Are you going to cut ties with us?

77
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,835
Do you hate us now?

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,671
Gosh, it's not like that.

79
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,340
How's U-jin? Is he okay?

80
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,427
Yes, he's a lot better now.

81
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,931
But he won't be able
to work in the field again.

82
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,060
Aren't you going to visit him?

83
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,981
U-jin doesn't resent you. So…

84
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,441
Okay. Maybe later.

85
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,901
Hey, you crazy bastard!

86
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,487
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,325
Didn't I tell you not to go near
a police station until you're reinstated?

88
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,288
Gosh, you're so loud.
Do you think I wanted to come here?

89
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,414
You don't even know anything.

90
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,792
You were dismissed and dumped.
Is this how you want to end your life?

91
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,044
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!

92
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,379
My gosh!

93
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,799
Why would you poke me where it hurts?

94
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,176
Look at yourself.

95
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,389
You shouldn't get angry
even if you hear this kind of stuff.

96
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,101
Are you sure you're getting treated?

97
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,438
Is it impossible to do something
about your temper?

98
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,566
Are you seriously treating me
like a patient?

99
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,152
You're a cop, damn it.

100
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,238
Why did you have to beat someone up
and get yourself in this mess?

101
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,448
What did I do?

102
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,535
I was only trying to catch that dealer.

103
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,912
So did you catch him?

104
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,499
How did you expect
to catch some drug dealer

105
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,294
when you don't even know
what he looks like?

106
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,630
Gosh, forget it.

107
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:44,218
Don't think about anything else.
Just get me a doctor's note

108
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,138
saying you're not a lunatic
who beats people up.

109
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,724
I'll try to take care of the rest.

110
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,019
Whatever.
As if you can do anything about it.

111
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,646
No doctor's going to write that for me.

112
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,316
You still don't get it, do you?

113
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,571
-Don't you care if you get fired for good?
-Of course, I care.

114
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,868
I have no money, no pride,

115
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:14,957
and I seriously don't even
see the point in living these days.

116
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,962
Especially with what happened today.
Gosh, seriously. Damn it…

117
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,592
-Are you crying?
-Damn…

118
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,386
You were angry just now.
Why are you suddenly crying?

119
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,517
I don't know. My emotions keep
shooting up and down these days.

120
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,728
That makes you seem even more insane.

121
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,563
Don't cry.

122
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,606
Damn…

123
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,690
Stop.

124
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,947
EXIT
HONGJIK POLICE STATION

125
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,700
Don't get in any trouble
until you get reinstated, okay?

126
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,327
You're only making me feel worse.

127
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,955
You guys should go now. Go on.

128
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:54,956
-Bye.
-See you, Hwi-oh.

129
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,457
Yeah, bye.

130
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,504
Hey, hey! You there.
Give me your phone number.

131
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,131
Here, punch it in.

132
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,426
Seriously? You really must be crazy.

133
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,185
This is driving me nuts.

134
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,608
Do you happen to think
you're always being followed and watched?

135
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,777
Is that it?

136
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,323
Do things go missing from your home
and you find them someplace else?

137
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,494
Do you hear noises that you can't
figure out where they're coming from?

138
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,290
Why is that?

139
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,377
I was right.
My gosh, this is unbelievable.

140
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,422
I knew it the moment I saw
that flower in your hair.

141
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,716
You're completely nuts.

142
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,553
I'm asking for your number
so you can pay me the settlement money.

143
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,055
Why else would I want your number?

144
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,975
What's going on in that head of yours?

145
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,810
Didn't you hear the cop earlier?

146
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,481
If I didn't agree to settle,
you'd be in jail right now.

147
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,941
You really should think before you talk.

148
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,905
And I'm warning you one last time.

149
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,323
Give me that.

150
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,366
I have anger management issues.

151
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,119
So if you mess with me one more time,

152
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,539
I swear I might do something to you.
Do you understand?

153
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,088
Shut it, you darn dog!
You're just like your owner.

154
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,425
Anger management issues?

155
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,427
Maybe you only lose it against women,

156
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,680
animals, and people
who are weaker than you.

157
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,807
Are you sure that it's anger
you have trouble managing?

158
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,893
What?

159
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,564
Oh, nothing. It's just that I heard
you were dumped by your fiancée.

160
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,528
Didn't you know?

161
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,281
I installed a wire inside your ear.

162
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,829
If you want to fix your temper,
you should try meeting Don Lee.

163
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:03,209
You'll be surprised to see
how well you can manage your temper.

164
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,046
Hey.

165
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,090
-Hey!
-Hwi-oh, that's enough.

166
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,384
-Let go of me.
-Hwi-oh, Hwi-oh.

167
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,303
No, let go.
I think I should quit being a cop.

168
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,513
-Cut it out.
-Don't you know

169
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,306
-that this is a serious condition?
-Don't!

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,558
A serious condition!

171
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,393
-Just don't.
-It's serious!

172
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,116
Gosh, do you think you're a cop
or something?

173
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,659
You're only going to hurt
an innocent person.

174
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,869
Gosh. Seriously.

175
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,998
Hey. Why are you taking my photo?

176
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,542
Cut it out. Don't take my photo!

177
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,712
I have to leave evidence.

178
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,049
You threatened me earlier.
You scared my dog and ran at me.

179
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,595
This will prove that you're the culprit
if anything bad happens to me.

180
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,181
Hey, wait. Stop.

181
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,852
What you did is a violation
of my privacy. You know that?

182
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,731
You took my picture?
You're not the only one who can do that.

183
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,275
Stop it. Don't take my photo. Stop.

184
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,360
There's no use hiding. This is a video.

185
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,529
Stop it!

186
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,573
You shouldn't have taken my picture then!

187
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,741
What?

188
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:33,841
EPISODE 2
PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU ANGRY

189
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,808
Gosh, the corners are all cracked.

190
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,277
Why? What?

191
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,905
Just decide.

192
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,491
Should I walk in front of you
or behind you?

193
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,036
I don't want you calling the cops
saying I'm following you again.

194
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,332
I'm also on my way home,
but you're making it so hard.

195
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,334
What's it going to be?

196
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,506
Let's go home.

197
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,320
Jeez.

198
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,097
Dam, I waited for you. I'm going now.

199
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,309
Make sure to heat the soup
in the microwave.

200
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,938
I love you.

201
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,612
Gosh, seriously…

202
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,621
Aren't you pretty after taking a bath?
You cute thing.

203
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,500
Heave.

204
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,589
You were pretty amazing earlier.

205
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,555
But what am I going to do with you?

206
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,903
I should've told you your bowels
could react sensitively to the drugs

207
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,279
depending on your condition.

208
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,949
I'll prescribe you something else
since it gave you a hard time.

209
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,036
Or would you like to stop taking them
for a while?

210
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,538
No, just give me something stronger.

211
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,875
Do you have a tranquilizer?
Something that knocks me out instantly.

212
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,669
Sure.

213
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,339
Doctor, the truth is…

214
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,925
I still…

215
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
get so angry.

216
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,890
Everyone gets angry.

217
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,725
Anger is a natural emotion.

218
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,145
Suppressing it isn't the only answer.

219
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,773
It's how you express it.

220
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,568
You're free to get angry,
but do it in a healthy way.

221
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,865
In order to do that,
you need to know about your anger.

222
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,784
Who you're angry at and why.

223
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,912
Why don't we talk about that day?

224
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,251
It was…

225
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,671
no different from any other day.

226
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,924
Except for just one thing.

227
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,512
I remember it rained like crazy.

228
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,566
Hwi-oh, is he even coming?

229
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,610
Give it some time.

230
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,619
Do these junkies not sleep at night?

231
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,749
-What's that?
-This is a one-way street.

232
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,627
That jerk is driving the wrong way.

233
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,050
What was the license plate number
you told me earlier?

234
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,552
41B0919, 06W1212, 43J8869

235
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,600
06W1212

236
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,393
-That must be him.
-Right?

237
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,686
Get ready.

238
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,937
Those bastards.

239
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,023
Hello?

240
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,816
We didn't get the warrant. Abort.

241
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,860
What? Why didn't we get a warrant?

242
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,777
Look.

243
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,656
Yang himself is going to make the delivery
for his VIP customers today.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,991
I've confirmed it already.

245
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,076
We'll lose him
if we don't catch him today.

246
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,369
How am I supposed to know?

247
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,496
Just come back to the station
with the boys.

248
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,125
Hello? Hello?

249
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,085
Damn it.

250
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,588
What is it? Didn't we get a warrant?

251
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,090
What do we do now?

252
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,135
What do you think?

253
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,263
We don't need a warrant
to drink at a bar, do we?

254
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,890
Great. Let's go.

255
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,308
-Go.
-Go, go, go.

256
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,559
We're here to drink.

257
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,811
-You can't come in here.
-Hey. Hold on, hold on.

258
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,813
-Jong-dae, check inside.
-Yes, sir.

259
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,025
-Oh, you're back.
-Hey, long time no see. Sure, sure.

260
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,818
-Excuse me, sir.
-Let go for a second.

261
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,111
Let's party!

262
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,495
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

263
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,330
Come and have a drink!

264
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,456
Gosh, Detective Noh.

265
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,333
-We're doing business here.
-Sure, sure.

266
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,461
You can't just barge in like this.
Cut us some slack.

267
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:07,132
We can help each other out.
You know how things work here.

268
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,968
-Jong-dae! Anything?
-What?

269
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
-Let me take you to a room.
-Damn, that punk.

270
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,138
Come on. Come this way. Let me escort you.
Okay?

271
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,724
-What's that? Sure, all right.
-Let me lead the way…

272
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,685
-Come on, come on. Sir?
-Yes, sir!

273
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,145
Damn…

274
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,482
Hey, he's headed your way.
He's on his way! Damn it!

275
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,323
Damn it…

276
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,368
Hey!

277
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,459
Damn it!

278
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,838
Jong-dae.

279
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,839
Who are these punks?

280
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,924
We're cops!

281
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,096
Move it! Get out!

282
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,474
Jong-dae! They're getting away!
Come on! Hurry up!

283
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,935
Hwi-oh!

284
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,146
-Stay back and find evidence.
-Hurry, hurry!

285
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,355
Hey!

286
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,649
Let's see.

287
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,821
Damn.

288
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,451
U-jin.

289
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,079
U-jin!

290
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,635
Get up! U-jin!

291
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,763
U-jin! Hey!

292
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,723
Damn it!

293
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,891
Hwi-oh!

294
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,185
That's enough!

295
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,187
Hwi-oh, stop it!

296
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,148
-Over there! Stay still!
-Let go!

297
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,026
What are you doing? Get off of him!
Damn it!

298
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,071
We're here from Yeongsan Police Station
to investigate ongoing prostitution!

299
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,533
Let go! We're cops!

300
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,202
Stay still, damn it!

301
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,578
Let go!

302
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,209
A bar in Gangnam
that ran an illegal brothel

303
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,505
through a secret passage
was raided by the police.

304
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,968
Also, a police officer who was in
charge of the district was arrested

305
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,762
for having assaulted a civilian
at the scene.

306
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,973
-There he goes again.
-The police have revealed

307
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,559
-that they will thoroughly investigate
-He's lost it.

308
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,269
-Go through his desk.
-to see if this Officer Noh has

309
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,312
-any affiliation with the brothel.
-Get rid of anything suspicious.

310
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,272
Okay.

311
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,900
Let me ask one more time.

312
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,820
Three police officers
went to an illegal brothel

313
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,781
within their jurisdiction
during work hours.

314
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,616
Why?

315
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,744
You want me to tell you again?

316
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,458
Why do you think? I went there
to arrest a drug dealer.

317
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:33,630
And I clearly saw the drugs
that Yang brought

318
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,299
with my own two eyes that day.

319
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,177
But where did those drugs go?

320
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,263
There are no investigation records,
and the warrant was rejected.

321
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,599
We have the business owner's statement

322
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,977
that you coerced him to
provide you with entertainment that night.

323
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,438
Let's say you're telling the truth.

324
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,982
Then why did you assault
an innocent civilian there?

325
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,902
He wasn't an innocent civilian.

326
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,740
A drug dealer attacked a cop from behind.

327
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,742
A drug dealer? Who are you talking about?

328
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:07,039
We confirmed that the victim was mentally
unstable after having taken ketamine

329
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,957
that he was prescribed for his illness.

330
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,001
He wasn't mentally unstable.

331
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,546
You know that's what drug dealers
always say.

332
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,425
Let's not waste our energy already.
We have a long way to go.

333
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,677
You keep asking me
the same questions over and over again.

334
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,097
He wasn't asking me questions
to begin with.

335
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,850
The answers were already in his head.

336
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,354
I'm not some kind of parrot!

337
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,272
SERGEANT NOH HWI-OH
DISMISSED

338
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,566
I wasn't charged for prostitution,

339
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,069
but they brought up a total of 11 reasons
to discipline me

340
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,906
including assault, having received
illegal overtime payment,

341
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,909
neglecting my duties, drinking on the job,
and conducting shameful behavior,

342
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,871
and failing to stay disciplined
as a public official.

343
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,999
Do you really think I beat that junkie up

344
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,710
because I was just desperate
to assault someone?

345
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,880
No, of course not.
It was rightfully self-defense.

346
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,591
Why? Because I had to
protect my colleague.

347
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,469
But of course,

348
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,265
I failed to do that too.

349
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:14,189
Then was that the only day
you had assaulted a suspect?

350
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
Well, I…

351
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,989
When you're investigating a case…

352
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,868
it happens every now and then.

353
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,916
Once you admit that you have trouble
controlling your impulsiveness and anger,

354
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,711
it'll help you recognize

355
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,256
the kinds of situations or things
that trigger you to get angry.

356
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,675
Avoiding these things
will be good for you.

357
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,888
Right.

358
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,391
Things that trigger my anger…

359
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,028
What?

360
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,949
Avoiding these things
will be good for you.

361
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,586
Mr. Noh Hwi-oh.
How was your counseling session?

362
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,087
-Good, good.
-Okay.

363
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,301
That'll be 35,000 won.

364
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
Here's your prescription.

365
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,973
When would you like to come
for your next session?

366
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,767
Same day at the same time.

367
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,018
-The same time?
-Yes, yes.

368
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:33,935
Okay.

369
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,694
Okay, have a good day.

370
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,167
What are you doing here?

371
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,710
Why are you here?

372
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,129
Because I get counseling here.

373
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
Didn't I tell you already?

374
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,717
I have anger management issues.

375
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,802
Good for you.

376
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,762
My gosh.

377
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,349
You know what?
There's no need for me to be ashamed.

378
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,392
I have nothing to hide.

379
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,019
Then why did you try to avoid me?

380
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,188
Because I don't like you. Okay?

381
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,441
Forget it. Don't try to start a fight.

382
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,195
Just go and get counseling.
I don't know what your illness is,

383
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,405
but I think it's getting worse.

384
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,658
-What? Do you have a death wi--
-Ms. Lee Min-kyung.

385
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,078
-The doctor will see you now.
-She's calling for you. Go on, hurry up.

386
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,204
Get going.

387
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,248
Gosh, seriously.

388
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,461
He suddenly showed up from behind
out of nowhere.

389
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,548
Then does that mean he followed you?

390
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,092
I was wearing earphones,
so I didn't notice anything.

391
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,176
So I'm not sure.

392
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,053
-Welcome.
-Can I get a pack of Plus?

393
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,138
Plus. Got it.

394
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,932
That will be 4,100 won.

395
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,769
Aren't you Detective Noh Hwi-oh?

396
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,109
Oh, I remember you. What a surprise. Yes.

397
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,862
I'm sorry,
I didn't recognize you last time.

398
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,071
No, it's fine.

399
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,074
I heard you were famous
in the Violent Crimes Team in Gangnam.

400
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,367
Gosh, no.

401
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,911
I'm actually going to try and apply
for the same team next time.

402
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,747
I see, I see.

403
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,666
But what brings you here?

404
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,627
I heard a flasher appeared nearby.

405
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,546
Oh, a flasher?

406
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,632
-Gosh, thanks for your hard work.
-Oh, no problem.

407
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,843
I'll let you know of any updates.

408
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,887
Okay. Here you go.

409
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,806
-Have a good day.
-Goodbye.

410
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,226
-Did you say you were a corporal?
-Oh, yes.

411
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,603
Jeez.

412
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,698
What are you doing?

413
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,742
You didn't press the elevator button yet?

414
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,993
Why do you care?

415
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,539
I thought you would've gone up already.
So I was going to catch the next one.

416
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,584
Why? Why can't you ride this one?

417
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,378
Stop acting suspicious and get in.

418
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,380
No, forget it. Go by yourself.

419
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,631
So tell me why!

420
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,549
Because I'm avoiding you from now on!

421
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,635
Why? What are you scared of?

422
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,846
You avoid crap because they're scary,
not because it's dirty.

423
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,932
Darn it. It's the other way around.

424
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,768
My gosh.

425
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,491
My goodness.

426
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,337
Let's go.

427
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,964
Good boy.

428
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,885
-Hey, it's a dog!
-Hey, it's a dog!

429
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,803
-Can I pet it?
-Can I give it this?

430
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
No, go away.

431
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,433
Let's go. Come on.

432
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,727
-Good boy.
-Darn it.

433
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,395
I wanted to pet it.

434
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,730
Me too.

435
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,123
No, don't eat that.

436
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,794
That's dirty. If you eat that,
you'll get fat and die.

437
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,296
I'll give you something to eat
once we get home.

438
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,800
My gosh, seriously.

439
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,053
Why are you eating that here?

440
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,846
You're making my dog hungry.

441
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,725
If it's okay for humans,
it's okay for dogs.

442
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,602
Here. Eat this.

443
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,897
Is it good? Goodness.

444
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,611
I guess you have nothing better to do

445
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,864
other than counseling
and roaming the neighborhood.

446
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,617
Yes, nice introduction.

447
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,285
What?

448
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,665
Fine. I'm no different.

449
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,879
By the way, it's going to cost me a bit
to fix my car.

450
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,341
You broke the car door and hood.

451
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,260
I even need to fix the rearview mirror.

452
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,430
Gosh, how much is that going to cost?

453
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,224
Your car door already had a dent in it.

454
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,308
Yes, I know.

455
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,978
I was going to get it fixed anyway,

456
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,689
and thankfully
you hit the exact same spot.

457
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,608
There's the repair cost,
depreciation cost,

458
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,320
compensation for psychological damages,
and the car rental fee.

459
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,615
I'm still thinking about
how much I should ask

460
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,993
for the settlement fee.

461
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,291
-What do you think?
-Swallow your food before you talk.

462
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:19,924
We're neighbors,
so I don't want to ask you for everything.

463
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,636
I'm willing to give you a discount. But…

464
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,930
on one condition.

465
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,725
What's that?

466
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,477
It's nothing difficult.

467
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,982
Why don't you go see another psychiatrist?

468
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,153
And let's try not to run into each other.

469
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,864
Why should I do that?

470
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,034
While I'm getting treated,

471
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,622
I need to avoid things
that trigger my anger.

472
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,249
And I feel like I'm trying my best.

473
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,834
But look at what happened today.

474
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,254
How can I do that when we live next door
and even go to the same doctor?

475
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,799
Nothing good can come out of this.

476
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,675
Have you heard this saying?

477
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,345
"If you don't like me,
you should get lost."

478
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,728
Can't you see that I'm already trying hard
to avoid you in our neighborhood?

479
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,687
But the clinic…

480
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,774
Okay, fine.

481
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,985
That's the only place
with a female doctor around here.

482
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,948
You're unbelievable.

483
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,909
Gosh. Don't get the wrong idea.

484
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,455
It's because I don't get as angry
when I talk to a woman.

485
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,290
I thought you couldn't control it?

486
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,084
You must be a pathological liar too.

487
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,213
That has nothing to do with my condition.
It's just basic manners.

488
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,841
I can't be hitting a woman, right?

489
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,928
Can't you see that you're fine
even after what you've done to me?

490
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,847
My gosh.

491
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:55,937
Crazy jerk.

492
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,820
What? "Crazy jerk"?

493
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,947
"Crazy jerk"?

494
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,492
Look who's talking.

495
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,537
Don't you have a conscience?

496
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,747
Do you want to talk crazy?
You're the craziest…

497
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,043
You're the craziest one around here!
What? "A crazy jerk"?

498
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,714
If I'm crazy, what does that make you?

499
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,632
You crazy little… My gosh!

500
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,342
You crazy… Seriously!

501
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,011
Crazy what?

502
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,852
My gosh, seriously!

503
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,522
My gosh!

504
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:27,862
