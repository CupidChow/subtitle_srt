1
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,512
Hey, guys.

2
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,266
Ladle Man!

3
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,811
-Dad!
-Dad!

4
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,021
Hey, guys.

5
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,397
Let's go!

6
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,659
So…

7
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,330
What are you having for lunch tomorrow?

8
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,332
What?

9
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,543
You should eat well.

10
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,962
Tomorrow…

11
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,966
you have a lot of self-defense to learn.

12
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,013
Don't look at me like that.

13
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,599
I need to teach you properly

14
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,562
so that I won't have to lend you
this arm again.

15
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,398
Isn't that so?

16
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,571
Go on inside.

17
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,823
Okay.

18
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,756
EPISODE 6
RUN AWAY

19
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,015
I'm Noh Hwi-oh,
your drill instructor for today.

20
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,391
Trainee Lee Min-kyung.

21
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,768
Lose the sunglasses.

22
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,021
-What?
-"What?"

23
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,439
Did you just say "What?"

24
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,817
From now on, I want you to scream
when you answer me.

25
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
Understood?

26
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,408
Lose your sunglasses!

27
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,869
Why just me? You're wearing them too.

28
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,872
You're talking back again.
What's wrong with your character?

29
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,415
Your character…

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,004
Yes, you do have a problem
with your character.

31
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,464
Lose your sunglasses!

32
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,471
There's something I overlooked yesterday.

33
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,183
People have an instinct
to protect their vital points.

34
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,312
So you need to trick your opponent
and block their sight before you attack.

35
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,438
Poke their eyes,

36
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,815
then you kick them in the nuts.

37
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,943
Got it?

38
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,236
Good! Give it a try.

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,737
Poke the eyes!

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,030
My gosh, come on.

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,741
Don't forget what happened yesterday!

42
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,452
Imagine it in your head
and do it looking this way, not me.

43
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,954
Do it over here in the air.

44
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,247
Don't attack me.

45
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,414
Now go on.

46
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,628
Poke the eyes!

47
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,921
-Bam!
-That's right.

48
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,798
-Poke the eyes!
-With power!

49
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,051
Bam! Poke! Bam! Poke!

50
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,135
Enough!

51
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,721
Now let's try defending yourself
when someone grabs you from behind.

52
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,391
Stomp on the person's foot with your heel!

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,519
Then turn around
and kick them in the nuts!

54
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,479
Got it?

55
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,356
Turn around.

56
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,569
A stranger is trying to grab you
from behind.

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,997
Are you enjoying this?

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,416
-Hurry up!
-Stomp on his feet!

59
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,168
Bam!

60
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,006
Good job. Now…

61
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,301
it's time to increase your stamina

62
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,679
as well as your guts and agility.

63
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,723
Down on all fours!

64
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,813
"Stay" on one. "Alert" on two.

65
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,772
One.

66
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,983
Stay!

67
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:17,984
Two.

68
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,152
Alert!

69
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,195
-One.
-Stay!

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,614
Bend your arms more. Bend them more.

71
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:30,330
Two, one, two, one, two. Do it properly.

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,665
One, two.

73
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,544
Come back. Come back here. Get up.

74
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,838
Hang in there. That's right. Good.

75
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,423
One, two. One, two, one.

76
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,592
Gosh, it hurts.

77
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,302
Get up.

78
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,804
Why are we doing this?

79
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,015
You're all warmed up, right?

80
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,893
Now you're going to run like
you're actually in trouble.

81
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,604
Imagine someone is chasing you from behind

82
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,314
and run, okay?

83
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,525
When someone tries to attack you,
the best thing is to run.

84
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,610
Understood?

85
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,320
Your voice is too small.

86
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,946
Understood?

87
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,033
Ready.

88
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,911
Run!

89
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,498
Run!

90
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,458
Run! Faster!

91
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,877
You run slower than an old grandma.

92
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,712
Run faster!

93
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,507
Imagine that someone is actually
chasing you from behind.

94
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,424
Come here!

95
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,593
Stop!

96
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,429
Get over here!

97
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,973
Come here!

98
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,585
I'm with her.

99
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,797
-No.
-Do it. I dare you!

100
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,632
I'm her next-door neighbor!

101
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,301
-What are you doing?
-You were chasing after her!

102
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,762
-No, we came here together.
-You were yelling and chasing after her!

103
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
No, we were just running together.

104
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,641
No, it's not what you think.

105
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,811
You're mistaken! There she is! Wait!

106
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,565
Hey, unit 506! Hurry up and come here!
Come over here!

107
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,358
Look. We know each other.

108
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,776
We're next-door neighbors.

109
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,821
I'm sorry, everyone.

110
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,658
Are you kidding me? Get over here.
You're dead meat. Come here!

111
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,247
Come here!

112
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,623
Get over here.

113
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,708
Come here.

114
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,594
Gotcha!

115
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,597
Hwi-oh.

116
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,556
What?

117
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,808
Did he go somewhere?

118
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,729
What is this smell?

119
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,940
My goodness.

120
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,652
Beer cans and instant noodles?

121
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,448
Goodness.

122
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,619
Let's get to work.

123
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,540
It's like I'm his housemaid or something.

124
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,084
He should hurry up and get married.

125
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,176
My goodness, what is this?

126
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,470
My goodness gracious.

127
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,815
Goodness.

128
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,446
-Change his name.
-Pardon?

129
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,699
Either that, or he'll have to move
to a place near the river.

130
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,327
Well, that'd be nice.

131
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,120
But the apartment price went down,

132
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,123
so we can't sell the place.
What should we do?

133
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,380
Well, there is a way.

134
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,465
What is it, ma'am?

135
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,220
He could meet a woman
who has a lot of water energy.

136
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:20,059
She might use that energy
to put out the fire that burned his heart.

137
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,145
A woman who has a lot of water energy?

138
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,567
Welcome.

139
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,070
You're only going to buy me ice cream
after having put me through all that?

140
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,406
I'll buy you ice cream. Come here.

141
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,283
Well, fine then.

142
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,619
You're going to have
strawberry ice cream, right?

143
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,707
Be careful of that man.

144
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,543
-No, just have the strawberry.
-Green tea.

145
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,460
Gosh.

146
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,716
That one's expensive.

147
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,763
Buy two, get one free.

148
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,224
Please, bring one more.
It's "buy two, get one free".

149
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,274
This isn't past its expiration date.
I bought it myself.

150
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,151
I bought it with my own money. Here.

151
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,323
What's this?

152
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
Goodness.

153
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,496
Where did you get the money to buy this?
You work part-time.

154
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,833
I'm sure I earn more than someone
who's unemployed.

155
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,961
Yes, I guess you're right.

156
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,381
-Gosh.
-You can drop the honorifics.

157
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,510
You seem way older than me.

158
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,304
You didn't use proper honorifics anyway.

159
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,306
Okay then.

160
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,434
Anyway, thanks for this.

161
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,855
We have one extra ice cream.

162
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,775
You can have it.

163
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,070
Go on.

164
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,495
Are you studying to be a police officer?
Why?

165
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,954
They're civil servants.

166
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:08,042
I often see cops on patrol at work,
and the job seems pretty easy.

167
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,337
Working at a local precinct
isn't as easy as it looks.

168
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,466
You'll have to spend all day
dealing with rude people

169
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,926
and drunkards.

170
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,011
I'd still love to pass the test.

171
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,889
The pervert said he was stressed
over not finding a job.

172
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,350
He kept calling me asking to settle.

173
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,186
He said he won't be able to get a job
with a criminal record.

174
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,355
And that his life will be a mess
because of me.

175
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,732
He begged me to cut him some slack.

176
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,985
It made me feel like the bad guy.

177
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,153
It didn't feel nice.

178
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,906
He's the one who ruined his own life!

179
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,246
And why should the victim
be considerate of the assailant?

180
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,039
You work part-time and study too,

181
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,708
but it's not like
he was considerate of that.

182
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,754
This wasn't intended,
but we're all victims here.

183
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,299
She was also attacked by that pervert.

184
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,387
I bet they just need to pay a small fine
for indecent exposure.

185
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,307
Why do cops always tell victims to settle?

186
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,810
How do they know
what the sentence is going to be?

187
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,480
And is it true? Do they really
get released after paying a fine?

188
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,065
No.

189
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,942
You need to study a bit more.

190
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,610
He blocked your way,

191
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,156
humiliated you by forcing you
to look down there,

192
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,740
and approached you threateningly.

193
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,827
That's attempted indecent assault.

194
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,372
And it's totally up to you
whether or not to settle.

195
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,249
No one can force you to settle.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,710
I really don't want to settle.

197
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,046
But what if he tries to harm me
just because I didn't settle?

198
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,801
If he keeps persuading you to settle,
you can request the cops for protection.

199
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,846
You can also write a petition
asking for a stronger punishment.

200
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,057
So don't worry too much.

201
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,728
If he seems suspicious in any way,

202
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,688
let me know.

203
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,524
I'll do what I can to help you out.

204
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,823
A customer just went inside.

205
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,784
See you.

206
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,501
We should go too.

207
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,839
-Go?
-Yes, let's go.

208
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,639
Can you really get reinstated

209
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,475
if you get a doctor's note
saying you're not crazy?

210
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,478
When did you overhear that?

211
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,648
I hope you get reinstated.

212
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,652
I think you're a pretty decent cop.

213
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,155
You talk as if you're
the police commissioner or something.

214
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,074
No, you talk like you're the president.

215
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,248
Whenever anyone offers you food,

216
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,000
you accept them right away. My gosh.

217
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,169
What? You want some?

218
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,087
Here. Have one.

219
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,968
By the way,

220
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,763
why did you use honorifics
when you talked to that part-timer?

221
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,098
You didn't with me.

222
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,933
Don't you know why?

223
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,935
She also used honorifics.

224
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,229
But you never did.

225
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,564
You even swore at me.

226
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,859
I noticed that you use honorifics
with everyone else but me.

227
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,497
Let's hurry up and go.

228
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,915
I'll treat you to a meal.

229
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,459
Do you think I'm broke?

230
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,921
I'm buying tonight.
I'll pay for it myself.

231
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,636
Hey.

232
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,514
Today?

233
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,019
Okay.

234
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,812
Okay, I'll see you later.

235
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,314
Bye.

236
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,444
I can't make it today.
Something just came up.

237
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,696
I'll treat you to a meal next time.
Let's go.

238
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,667
You're good, Noodles.

239
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,377
You knew where to find us.

240
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,129
My gosh, seriously.

241
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,632
Will you stop calling me Noodles?

242
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm a delivery man.

243
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,511
How would you feel if I call you "Popo"?

244
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,472
I know you already call me that.

245
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,806
I bet you thought I didn't know.

246
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,726
But I did, you punk.
Show some respect to a detective.

247
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,686
I have ears too, you know.

248
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,521
Whenever Detective Noh isn't around,

249
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,024
I always hear you calling him Mad Dog.

250
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,151
Mad what?

251
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,778
No, that's not it.

252
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,738
Why would you say that, you punk?

253
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,532
Let me explain.
It means you're like a dog,

254
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,535
because you never let go once you bite.

255
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,870
Do you get it?

256
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,706
It's a way of expressing
how persistent you are.

257
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,334
Everyone calls you that. Didn't you know?

258
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,257
You called me all the way here

259
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,801
to have this?

260
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,762
You were the one who always said

261
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,891
eating jjajangmyeon
during a stakeout tastes the best.

262
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,686
I bet no one cares for you
as much as I do.

263
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,895
So much I'm sick of you.

264
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,231
It's just jjajangmyeon.

265
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,733
Eat up. They'll get soggy.

266
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:31,365
Hwi-oh, were you upset when the captain
lashed out at you at the precinct?

267
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,620
I sometimes feel like
he's the one who should get treated

268
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,622
for anger management issues, not me.

269
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,668
Or is he going through andropause?
Is that it?

270
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,628
No, it's not that.

271
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,839
He has his reasons.

272
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,677
The headquarters called and mentioned
meeting you during a sting operation.

273
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,264
And they threw a fit telling us
to stay out of Yang's case.

274
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,350
They even threatened to prevent you

275
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,102
from getting reinstated.

276
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,896
That's why the captain got furious.

277
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,816
He felt really bad about it
after you left.

278
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,026
You know how he can be.

279
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,946
He's becoming more of a coward
now that he's old.

280
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,658
But what's with those guys
from headquarters?

281
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,786
Why are they so obsessed with Yang?

282
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,874
Why do they think they're the only ones
who are allowed to catch him?

283
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,542
What is up with them?

284
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,337
Think about all I went through
trying to catch him.

285
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,591
I was accused of sex trafficking,
investigated by the prosecution,

286
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,134
and what happened recently too…

287
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,436
Do you think there's something going on
that we don't know about?

288
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,646
What do you mean?

289
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,440
I mean, think about it.

290
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,903
Every time we try to catch Yang,

291
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,030
the headquarters always gets involved.

292
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,741
Gosh, that's nonsense.

293
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,409
Are you saying

294
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,704
Yang has connections with
someone at headquarters?

295
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,665
Well, maybe not.

296
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,586
But I sense something suspicious,
but I don't know what it could be.

297
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,507
Anyway, make sure you update me
if you find anything new

298
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,092
related to Yang, okay?

299
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,302
No way. If the captain finds out he'll--

300
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,721
Cut the crap. Just do as I say, okay?

301
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,683
Okay, fine.

302
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,684
Okay.

303
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,981
-Hello, welcome to Olivia.
-Hello, welcome to Olivia.

304
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,859
-Let us know if you need help.
-Let us know if you need help.

305
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,213
I'll help you make your payment.

306
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,135
No. Everything from his height to his face
is totally different.

307
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,344
Do you need a paper bag?

308
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,595
Yes.

309
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,932
A bag with handles will cost you
an extra 100 won. Is that okay?

310
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,851
Yes.

311
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,062
Howi, let's go.

312
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,529
Let's go for a walk.

313
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,531
Let's go for a walk.

314
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,127
Samantha.

315
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,131
-Hey.
-Hey.

316
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,887
That day, when I dressed up as a woman,

317
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,139
my feet hurt like crazy.

318
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,226
Women seem to be fine
running with high heels.

319
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,978
Do they not feel any pain?

320
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,563
You get used to it after a while.

321
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,903
My legs were really cold too.
I feel like they'll easily catch a cold.

322
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,032
I read somewhere
that Chinese people get shocked

323
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,576
when they see Korean women
wearing short skirts

324
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,911
during the winter.

325
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,996
It's just a cultural difference.

326
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,502
We have a hard time accepting things
that are different.

327
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,592
Right. I totally forgot to dry-clean
and return the dress I borrowed.

328
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,345
It's okay.
I didn't look good in it anyway.

329
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,430
You can keep it as a souvenir.

330
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:34,399
The ladies from the women's association
brought me bread.

331
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,985
They apologized for that day.

332
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,656
Did they?

333
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,118
Don't act like you don't know.
You told them to, right?

334
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,872
You didn't have to do that.

335
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,292
Well, no reason.

336
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,005
Thank you.

337
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,510
I, Samantha,

338
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,054
will repay you one day.

339
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,606
By the way, do you know her?

340
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,191
Is she your girlfriend?

341
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,651
What?

342
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,069
Who?

343
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,324
Hey, let go.

344
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,457
My gosh. I can't believe this.

345
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,210
I think she's jealous.

346
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,714
Jealous, my foot.

347
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,507
There's nothing going on between us.

348
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,842
Be honest with me.

349
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,303
Do you want things to work out with her?

350
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,763
What are you talking about?
It's nothing like that.

351
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,099
If that's the case, I can help.

352
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,435
So, do you want help?

353
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,543
Jealousy is the most powerful tool
to make someone love you.

354
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,134
What was that?

355
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,094
That's why he had to leave?

356
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,600
Howi, let's go.

357
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,025
Gosh. What a playboy.

358
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,069
Even with the part-timer before.

359
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,237
Who's that woman he was with just now?

360
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,282
Hello.

361
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,786
You're so cute.

362
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,621
I'll see you.

363
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,874
What?

364
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,461
Howi. Let's go. Come on.

365
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,963
Let's go. Okay?

366
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,423
Hey.

367
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,133
Gosh.

368
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,680
Hey, I'm disappointed in you.

369
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,016
You're no guardsman.

370
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,520
A guardsman should always
stay loyal to his owner.

371
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,356
I named you hoping that you'd protect me.

372
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,733
You go around accepting food from anyone,

373
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,069
and follow any girl
around the neighborhood.

374
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,821
You lock arms with anyone.

375
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,533
What kind of a guardsman is that?

376
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,993
Only assholes do that.

377
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,377
Did you enjoy your dinner?

378
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,213
What are we having for lunch tomorrow?

379
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,674
As for dinner, it'll be on me.

380
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,676
Why are you asking me?

381
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,347
Aren't you going to learn
how to defend yourself?

382
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,141
You need to pay for the lesson.

383
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,684
You don't even teach me much.

384
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,477
I can run on my own.

385
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,272
I don't need you anymore.
Just go meet your girlfriend.

386
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,694
Are you talking about…

387
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,071
I think you have the wrong idea.

388
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,490
The woman I was with earlier--

389
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,701
I'm not interested. Don't explain.

390
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,327
She's not my girlfriend.

391
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,289
That person is just a neighbor
who lives in Unit 705.

392
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,749
Who cares? I never asked.

393
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,211
We're not dating.

394
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,297
Why are you explaining that to me?

395
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,425
I'm just saying because we're not.

396
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,969
Are you sure you're not lying?

397
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,264
What are you talking about? We're not.

398
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,017
Are you positively sure?

399
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,395
We're not. You can go and ask yourself.

400
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,730
We're seriously not.

401
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,733
Okay then.

402
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,235
Let's go, Howi.

403
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,876
Who is it?

404
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,336
I'm from the post office.

405
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,305
Are you Ms. Lee Min-kyung?

406
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,058
The court sent you a registered post,
and I need your signature.

407
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,434
Okay.

408
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,480
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,691

OBLIGEE: LEE MIN-KYUNG

413
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,628
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

414
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,964
I clearly stated
that I'm not going to settle,

415
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,675
and I never agreed on
giving away my personal information.

416
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,553
So why is my address
written on this document?

417
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,430
I never told them my address.

418
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,558
This means they know where I live.

419
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,979
We're not allowed to give away
the victim's address without permission.

420
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,857
Maybe they got the information
while looking up other cases.

421
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,734
It's hard to know how they found out.

422
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,369
Okay, I'm sorry.

423
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,788
Something urgent came up.

424
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,583
I don't know what happened.

425
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,793
But you can't move out
when you only just moved in.

426
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,047
You're totally ignoring the fact
that you signed a lease.

427
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,548
I'm sorry.

428
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,717
I'm so sick of dealing with tenants.

429
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,885
I'd sell the place if I could,

430
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,346
but I can't
with the price dropping so low.

431
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,098
Anyway,
I'll try to look for another tenant,

432
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,267
but you'll have to stay if I can't.

433
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,603
I can't afford to return your deposit now.

434
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,397
Plus, I have no obligation to do so
until the contract is over.

435
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,357
I know.

436
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,611
I'll also try my best

437
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,322
to find a new tenant.

438
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,378
Okay.

439
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,467
I'll be right there.

440
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,187
What? What is it?

441
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,108
I tell people that my yearly wage
is 30 million won.

442
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,278
That'd be the case if that's how much
our apartment price rises every year.

443
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,363
Don't you agree?

444
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:23,952
Our apartment price may have
declined temporarily,

445
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,540
but now that it's hit rock bottom,
it only has room to rise.

446
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,583
So instead of not doing anything,

447
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,796
we should gather together
and do something about it.

448
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,631
That's what I've been thinking.

449
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:42,512
So why don't we change the name
of our apartment to something more…

450
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,471
Trendy?

451
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:48,059
Yes, why don't we change it
to something more trendy?

452
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,229
So I'd like you all to…

453
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,356
Yes, that's right.

454
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,110
Share your ideas on naming the apartment.

455
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,237
Goodness, unit 507 is here. Come on in.

456
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,947
Unit 507 is here.

457
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,449
-Welcome.
-Hello.

458
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,200
Let's start sharing ideas.

459
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,412
How about

460
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,458
Hongjik Central Apartment?
We can use the word "Jungang" in English.

461
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,918
That's a good idea.

462
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:19,466
Why don't we get rid of "Hongjik"
and switch it to "Mapo" instead?

463
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,843
Mapo?

464
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,306
But this area doesn't fall into Mapo-gu.

465
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,810
Wouldn't it be a bit weird
to call it Mapo Central Apartment?

466
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,607
It just means

467
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:42,530
we have the equivalent infrastructure
to that of Mapo-gu.

468
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,825
The famous Mapo Ribs franchise
doesn't just exist in Mapo-gu.

469
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,952
Pyongyang naengmyeon
don't just exist in Pyongyang.

470
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,663
And you don't need to go to LA
to eat LA ribs.

471
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,250
You're a young man, but you're so…
What do you call it?

472
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,251
Inflexible.

473
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,213
Yes, you're so inflexible.

474
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,173
My gosh.

475
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,178
We need a name that's easy to say
and also very high-class.

476
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,639
For example,
imagine what you'd like to say

477
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,225
when you tell your destination
to the cab driver.

478
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,602
Just try imagining that.

479
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,651
Unit 506, if you're done drinking that,
why don't you share some ideas?

480
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,379
Sir.

481
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,507
Mapo Prestige Central Castle, please.

482
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,764
Mapo the Premium Central Forest, please.

483
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,354
Mapo Noblesse Central River, please.

484
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:03,027
Sir, please take me
to Central Maison de Mapo.

485
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,913
We should quickly change
the name of our apartment,

486
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,416
automate the entrance gates,

487
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,335
and paint the outer walls
of the apartment buildings

488
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:24,507
so that the apartment price
will soar back to its normal price.

489
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,135
We should do our very best
to make that happen.

490
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,268
RESIDENTS' MEETING ROOM

491
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,107
You were great today. I loved your ideas.

492
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,236
Isn't unit 506 living here on a lease?

493
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,947
Yes, she is. How strange.

494
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,117
My gosh.

495
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,078
Goodness.

496
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,845
I thought I knew you by now,
but I guess I was wrong.

497
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,641
I didn't know you were so interested
in the housing prices here.

498
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,895
I don't care. I want to move,
but if the price keeps going down,

499
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,397
I won't be able to receive my key deposit.

500
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,191
You're moving?

501
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,234
Why are you moving
when you just came here?

502
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,532
You told me to run away.

503
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,285
I'm going to run away

504
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,040
before I get caught.

505
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,536
Howi, what's wrong?

506
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,750
Okay, come here.

507
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,077
One.

508
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,538
Two.

509
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,874
Three.

510
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,585
Four.

511
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,713
Five.

512
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,204
Vegetables are good

513
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,830
-Chew them well
-Yum, yum

514
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,665
Meat is good

515
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,334
-Chew it well
-Yum, yum

516
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,753
I scold those who are picky with food

517
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,590
I am the invincible Ladle Man

518
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:57,637
I am the Ladle, Ladle Man

519
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:04,018
