EPISODE 13

2
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,480
GOODBYE & HELLO

3
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,484
Come on. Pick up the phone.

4
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,611
Don't order it
if you're not going to eat it.

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,363
Anybody ordered jjajangmyeon?

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,367
Anybody ordered jjajangmyeon?

7
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,869
Hey!

8
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,454
You little…

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,041
I told you to call me when you're here.
How dare you come in here!

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,543
I did call,
but you didn't answer the phone.

11
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,756
What are you looking at?

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,508
Wipe that look off your face.

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,552
Didn't you hear me?

14
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,224
What an idiot.

15
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,775
Keep the change.

16
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,861
And take that outside.

17
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,130
Hey, what's up?

18
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,717
What?

19
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,344
Here! Over here!

20
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,979
He's in there?

21
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,024
Yes. He's definitely that jerk
from the photo.

22
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,363
Why are the lights turned on
when no one even lives here?

23
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,699
It might be a drug factory
disguised as a workshop.

24
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,369
I think I saw him yesterday
at that drug factory.

25
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,267
Hi, I'm here to pick up the plates.

26
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,149
What the hell?

27
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,067
I told you not to come up, you punk.

28
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,696
I came to pick up the plates.

29
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,574
The plates are outside, you idiot.

30
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,325
There were no spoons.

31
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,327
Then look for them outside.

32
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,913
What do you think I would do
with your spoons, you punk.

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,375
I looked for it. I kept looking for it.

34
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,918
I looked for it frantically.

35
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,422
But the spoons weren't there.

36
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,092
Give the spoons back, you bastard.

37
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,512
What? "Bastard"?

38
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,140
Yes, you bastard.

39
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,308
You little…

40
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,685
What about it, you bastard?

41
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,521
-Who the hell are you?
-Me?

42
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,282
I'm Gangnam Mad Dog, you damn bastard.

43
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,983
Nice to meet you.

44
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,533
Hey. Don't you want to see Yang in person?

45
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,912
Where am I? I'm…

46
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,040
-Hey! Here! Come in!
-I'm going, punk!

47
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,251
Captain, here.

48
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,380
Look here. Look at this.

49
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,176
I got you.

50
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm good.

51
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,058
It's inside.

52
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,226
Go inside.

53
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,727
Hey!

54
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,355
It's over. It's all over.

55
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,193
You caught Yang and found the factory.
You'll get your job back in no time.

56
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,280
-It's only a matter of time.
-Hey, it hurts. Stop it.

57
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,407
It hurts? Where does it hurt?

58
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,867
Gosh, stop being creepy.
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

59
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,079
Now, when Min-kyung brings
the settlement agreement,

60
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,956
apply for the reinstatement right away.

61
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,083
Settlement?

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,336
What settlement?

63
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,256
She went to sign the agreement.
Didn't you know?

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,174
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,344
When the assault case is settled,

66
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,430
can he get his job back?

67
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,932
I think so.

68
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,978
But he wouldn't settle, so…

69
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,480
I'll get him to agree to settle.

70
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,484
I want you to talk Hwi-oh into it.

71
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,487
Please, do me this favor.

72
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,742
Why are you telling me this now?

73
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,618
She told me not to tell you.

74
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,078
Right. She told me not to tell you.

75
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,247
-I didn't know.
-Damn it.

76
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,916
What's the big deal?
Min-kyung is doing this for you--

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,295
Does she even know
who she's trying to talk into?

78
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,964
Hwi-oh.

79
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,554
AGGRESSIVE DOG

80
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,366
Won-cheol, I'll send you a number.
Track the phone and send me its location!

81
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,035
Hey, Hwi-oh!

82
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,376
Gosh, we can't just let him go like this.

83
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,504
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON ASSAULT

84
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,760
VICTIM: LEE SEON-HO
OFFENDER: NOH HWI-OH

85
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,140
Is your face all right?

86
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,267
Give me that first.

87
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,153
WITHDRAWAL OF LAWSUIT

88
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,321
I thought you'd never do it.

89
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,865
Is this for that uncultured bastard?

90
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,660
He's a cop, right?

91
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,329
How much do cops earn?

92
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,666
Right. He was fired.

93
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,128
Go on. He will beat you up again.

94
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,631
If I hadn't stopped him,
you would have died.

95
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,925
But I won't next time.

96
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,969
Did it hurt when he beat you?

97
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,637
I hoped it would.

98
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,264
Min-kyung.

99
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,934
You can't be with him.

100
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,769
I know you.

101
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,772
Let's start over.

102
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,191
I'll be better to you.

103
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,115
I would rather die than do that.

104
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,120
One more thing.

105
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,289
Stay out of my sight.

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,209
If you see me on the street, walk away.

107
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,961
You're a coward,

108
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,214
and that's what cowards do.

109
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
I know you.

110
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,094
Min-kyung. Wait. Don't go.

111
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,304
Listen to me.

112
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,014
What are you doing now?

113
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,438
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,982
It's all my fault.

115
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,860
I wanted to say this.

116
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,614
You know I'm not doing this
for the settlement.

117
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,035
Please hear this trashy bastard's excuses
before you go.

118
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,925
I was going to divorce her anyway,

119
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,345
so I thought I might as well
tell you later.

120
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,015
I know it was selfish of me.

121
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,395
I thought you would leave me
if I told you the truth.

122
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,314
So I couldn't tell you.

123
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,569
Min-kyung.

124
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,781
It was because I really loved you.

125
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,242
I mean it.

126
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,370
We had good times together.

127
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,915
You were all I had,

128
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,502
but you kept saying
you'd break up with me.

129
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,714
That's probably why I lost it.

130
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,759
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,817
It wasn't love,

132
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,027
a regret,

133
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,655
or a fight.

134
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,783
There's no reason or cause

135
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,078
for what you did to me.

136
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,498
I was bitten by a dog

137
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,084
and was hit by a car.

138
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,335
Do you understand?

139
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,801
I accept your apology,

140
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,553
but don't expect me to forgive you.

141
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,118
Don't forgive me…

142
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,579
until the day you die.

143
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,474
Have you seen…

144
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,853
I saw her leaving with her boyfriend
just a while ago.

145
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,940
She looked unwell.
She barely left with his help.

146
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,787
I can't see him.
Give me the address again.

147
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,746
Okay.

148
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,039
Okay. Thank you.

149
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,084
Hwi-oh, he's now
driving towards Beopheung.

150
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,335
We're heading there now,

151
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,504
so you stay out of this.

152
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,005
Give me the address now!

153
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,799
Noh Hwi-oh, get a grip!

154
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,594
That assault charge
hasn't been dropped yet!

155
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,264
If we get to them any later,
Min-kyung will be in serious trouble.

156
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,600
Give me the address! Now!

157
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,018
Okay. One second.

158
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,687
Hey, they say he's with you.

159
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,774
Hold on.

160
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,987
There he is.

161
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,671
Won-cheol, call an ambulance.

162
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,339
No, call two ambulances.

163
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,590
No, call three ambulances.

164
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,093
What? Did you find him?
Hwi-oh! Noh Hwi-oh?

165
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,808
Stop the car!

166
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,853
Stop the car!

167
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,521
I said, stop the car!

168
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,834
Open the door!

169
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,586
Open the door!

170
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,505
Open it!

171
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,550
Damn it…

172
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,025
Do you want to die?

173
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,485
Hey, come here.

174
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,457
Damn it.

175
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,625
Min-kyung.

176
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,087
Min-kyung.

177
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,637
Min-kyung.

178
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,933
Min-kyung, wake up.

179
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,852
Min-kyung.

180
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,812
Somebody…

181
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,357
Somebody call an ambulance!

182
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,442
Call an ambulance!

183
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,861
Okay. One second.

184
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,863
They say they suddenly stopped moving.

185
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,781
Do you think they're okay?

186
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,618
Please, just don't kill him, Hwi-oh.

187
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,663
Hey!

188
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,759
Hi, please drive me to the city.

189
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,261
And can I borrow your phone?

190
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,930
Okay. Sure.

191
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,432
You can.

192
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,559
-What the…
-Oh, well.

193
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,727
Mr. Lee Seon-ho.

194
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,313
We might as well take you to Seoul.

195
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,898
To Gangnam Police Station.

196
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,150
All right. Here we go. Buckle up.

197
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,527
-Damn it.
-Can't buckle up yourself?

198
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,780
Do I have to pay a fine?

199
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,333
Ma'am, I'm looking for a patient
injured in a car accident.

200
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,127
-Okay. What's the patient's name?
-Hwi-oh. Noh Hwi-oh.

201
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,046
I'm looking for a car accident patient.

202
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,173
-What's the patient's name?
-Lee Min-kyung.

203
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,467
They're both receiving
emergency treatment.

204
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,762
It's nothing serious,
so you don't need to worry.

205
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,973
Thank you.

206
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,932
Please wait there.

207
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,849
Okay.

208
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,336
PATIENT NAME, NOH ***-OH

209
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,747
Seeing you hurt…

210
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,707
Seeing you in so much pain…

211
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,919
That makes me so angry.

212
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,670
Okay?

213
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,090
I don't care what happens to me now.

214
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,191
What is it?

215
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,529
What?

216
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,241
What were you going to do?

217
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,202
I wasn't going to do anything.

218
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,167
Do what you were going to do.

219
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,007
I said, do what you were going to do.

220
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,472
Come here.

221
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,657
What is it?

222
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,076
Can't you sleep again?

223
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,539
Are you okay?

224
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,876
It must hurt a lot.

225
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,128
It's nothing.

226
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,672
It's just a sprained ligament.

227
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,842
It happens when you play soccer.

228
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,139
How do you feel?

229
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,933
Are you hurt?

230
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,894
No.

231
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,272
They said I can leave
the hospital tomorrow.

232
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,774
Really?

233
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,027
That's great.

234
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,615
You should go and take care of Howi.

235
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,784
When I get out,

236
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,413
let's go for a walk together.

237
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,962
How's getting your job back going?

238
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,217
I think it's going well.

239
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,762
That's great.

240
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,015
You really wanted to get back to work.

241
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,268
I was worried
you might not be able to because of me.

242
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,729
You're right.

243
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,943
I wanted to get my job back so badly…

244
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,032
because of you.

245
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,956
Because you told me to.

246
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,222
Hey, could you open the drawer over there?

247
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,195
Open it.

248
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,414
Do you like it?

249
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,167
Yes.

250
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,968
Put it on for me.

251
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,053
Okay.

252
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,352
Let's put this on.

253
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,966
Thank you.

254
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,901
Being with me

255
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,111
will hurt him again.

256
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,739
He'll suffer,

257
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,991
be hurt again,

258
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,995
and be angry again.

259
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,375
Nothing good can come out of this.

260
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,007
If that's why you're leaving,

261
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,931
you're coming back, right?

262
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,133
-I'm leaving now.
-Okay.

263
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,593
-Thanks.
-Get well soon.

264
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,220
-Bye.
-Bye.

265
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,390
Hey.

266
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,017
Are you really moving out?

267
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,228
Thank you for everything.

268
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,313
Why do you have to leave so suddenly?

269
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,732
Something came up.

270
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,069
Please take good care of Hwi-oh.

271
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,258
Sir, you seem happy.

272
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,344
Right. I haven't been home in a while, so…

273
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,348
I'll get you home as quick as lightning.

274
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,267
Thank you.

275
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,814
MOVING SERVICE

276
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,404
Bye, sweetie.

277
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,448
Bye.

278
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,532
Take care.

279
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,917
Unit 507.

280
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,794
What should we do? Should we tell him?

281
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,878
What do we do?

282
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,175
Hey, are you coming from the hospital?

283
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,636
-Yes. How have you been?
-Fine.

284
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,221
What do we do?

285
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,975
Gosh, I don't know!

286
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,645
-You know, your "set".
-Right.

287
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,147
Unit 506 just moved out.

288
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,776
-She packed everything and just left.
-Yes.

289
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,319
She moved out?

290
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

291
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,073
She just left, so if you hurry,
you will be able to catch up with her.

292
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,533
-Hurry and go.
-You should follow her.

293
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,618
-Hurry.
-Please keep this.

294
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,787
-Hurry!
-Run!

295
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,205
He's a good runner.

296
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,675
How could you move out
without saying a word to me?

297
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,640
I was going to tell you later.

298
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,561
Take care.

299
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,531
Are you kidding?

300
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,325
So you're just leaving like this?

301
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,326
Why?

302
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,162
You saw it.

303
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,666
You saw what happened to you
when I'm next to you.

304
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,459
You saw what happened to us.

305
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,627
What about me?

306
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,088
What about us?

307
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,676
When he hit me, I was so scared

308
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,846
that I got down on my knees and begged.

309
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,684
You don't have to say that.

310
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,686
I want to tell you.

311
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:55,024
I begged him not to kill me
and said I was sorry.

312
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,945
I kept begging him not to hit me.

313
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,158
How can I live a normal life like this?

314
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,454
Dating, falling in love…

315
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,332
I don't want to do any of that anymore.

316
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,627
And especially

317
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,338
not with the person

318
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,799
who knows what I went through.

319
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,975
So…

320
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,897
please promise me you will be all right.

321
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,774
Hey.

322
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,447
You're really mean. You know that?

323
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,618
How could you tell me to be all right
when you're leaving like this?

324
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,870
I can't be all right.

325
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,663
I won't!

326
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,758
Min-kyung!

327
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,180
I'm going to live like an alcoholic!

328
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,389
From now on,

329
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,517
I'm going to beat

330
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,812
everybody I see!

331
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,396
You'll see!

332
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,985
Damn it.

333
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,029
Sorry.

334
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,574
Stop right there!

335
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,534
Stop!

336
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,874
I said, stop, you punk!

337
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,378
-What's the matter?
-Stop. Don't move.

338
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,715
You little…

339
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,008
Don't move!

340
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,885
Let go!

341
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,263
Stop it! Get a grip!

342
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,723
Please don't lose it because of me.

343
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,393
Don't get angry because of me!

344
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,605
You're not the only one who gets angry.
I get angry too when you get hurt.

345
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,607
-Let go!
-So please let him go. Please.

346
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,401
It hurts!

347
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,778
Is that true?

348
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,905
What you just said.

349
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,701
Yes. So please…

350
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,578
Are you sure?

351
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,047
Look. Look who he is.

352
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,476
Stay still.

353
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,355
Do you get it now?

354
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,825
I love you.

355
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
I love you.

356
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,635
I love you!

357
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,391
You're crazy.

358
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,417
Hi.

359
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,310
I still can't believe
you don't live here any more.

360
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,608
Hello. I'm not a strange…

361
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,408
You seem like a sweet man.

362
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,618
Hasn't anyone told you this before?

363
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,245
You may look cold on the outside…

364
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,706
I look like a cold man on the outside,

365
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,418
but I have a warm heart, right? It's true.

366
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,335
I already know.

367
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,301
Things haven't changed much here.

368
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,720
If anything has changed…

369
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,768
Hey, Whitney.

370
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,644
Right.

371
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,732
The part-timer girl
is not preparing for the exam any more.

372
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,569
She said she's going to live
as a part-timer who sings well for now.

373
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,238
I asked her why she gave up
becoming a police officer.

374
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,492
She's been preparing it for three years

375
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,370
but she couldn't even solve
the first question.

376
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,293
And the Women's Association's
long-standing dream has finally come true.

377
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,420
The new name
of the apartment complex is now

378
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,006
"Mapo Noblesse Central Park."

379
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,717
Wait, no. It's "Central River."

380
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,803
PUBLIC OFFICIAL
NOH HWI-OH

381
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,013
Anyway, hurry back.

382
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,475
You said you would show up if I waited.

383
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,143
When are you coming back?

384
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,978
This is the news about Yang.

385
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,815
They found something
even more shocking while arresting him,

386
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,485
which is that a number of
current police officers had been involved.

387
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,196
Yang had given other offenders…

388
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,657
Hwi-oh, what are you doing here?
Everyone's waiting.

389
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,867
Okay, U-jin.

390
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,495
Don't tell me

391
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,957
you like it so much there

392
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,918
that you don't want to come back.

393
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,046
She abandoned us.

394
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,133
She's such a bad woman.

395
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,686
You asked me to drink with you
when it rained.

396
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,896
You asked me to sleep together,

397
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,440
eat noodles together,

398
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,569
and to keep doing what I was going to do.

399
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,989
You were going to leave anyway.

400
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,866
No.

401
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,954
Now that I think about it,
she must have planned this all along.

402
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,081
That's why she moved next door to me.

403
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,585
No.

404
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,421
It started when she was born.

405
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,716
She was born pretty

406
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,844
so that she could get me.

407
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,726
Do you miss her?

408
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,355
Me too.

409
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,806
HOWI (POTATO)
HOWI DOLL (SWEET POTATO)

410
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:53,247
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
MAD FOR EACH OTHER

411
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,332
