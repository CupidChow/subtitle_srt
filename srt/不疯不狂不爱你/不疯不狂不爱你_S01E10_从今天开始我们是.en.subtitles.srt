1
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:22,605
I heard you donated a lot of money
at the charity bazaar again.

2
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,734
There's nothing grand about
doing missionary work.

3
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,862
In the end,
it's about sharing what you have.

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,531
Well, it's not a big deal.

5
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:40,582
Your amazing character and faith
are beyond our imagination.

6
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,293
No wonder you have such a great son.

7
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,724
Who are you ladies?

8
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,650
We're from Hongjik-dong,
and she evangelized us.

9
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,196
Did I?

10
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,114
When did I…

11
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,536
It sounded like you were
talking about your son.

12
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,501
He must be working hard
living off our taxes.

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,964
I didn't know
your son worked for the government.

14
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,634
I thought he ran a business…

15
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,844
No, he's not a public official.

16
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,514
He's living off the taxpayers
behind bars--

17
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,558
My goodness, I almost forgot.

18
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,228
I finally remember you ladies.

19
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,396
You're those ladies from Hongjik-dong.

20
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,482
It's cramped in here.

21
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,735
So let's talk somewhere more spacious.

22
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,695
-Come this way.
-Sure. That sounds nice.

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,948
Then can we also get some cake…

24
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,704
How did you ladies find me here?

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,456
What are you trying to pull?

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,416
It was easy to track you down.

27
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,087
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,339
You humiliated our resident first.

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,051
So we came to take revenge on her behalf.

30
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,138
What does that have
anything to do with you?

31
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,933
You ladies from a rundown neighborhood
must have nothing better to do.

32
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,144
You're way too nosy.

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,986
How did you know?

34
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,698
It's true that we're nosy
because we have nothing better to do.

35
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,368
And because we're so nosy,
we plan to go to your church,

36
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,537
your apartment,

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,830
and the parent gathering

38
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,417
at the international school
your grandchild goes to

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,627
and tell everyone exactly why your son

40
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,423
ended up going to prison.
Is that okay with you?

41
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,300
No, I mean…

42
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,468
Fine. What is it that you want?

43
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:02,849
I want you to delete
all the online posts by midnight,

44
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,768
and don't ever come near
Hongjik-dong again.

45
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,646
If you don't, we'll go ahead and just--

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,814
Okay, fine.

47
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,733
I get it. I get your point.

48
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,401
You don't need to wait.

49
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,944
I'll do it right now.

50
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,864
I'll do what you ask. Here. Look.

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,660
Well, that was easy.

52
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,582
I know this isn't enough
to make up for what happened.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,462
We just wanted to apologize
for everything.

54
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,675
Anyway, thank you.

55
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,761
Sure.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,265
I know a lot of things happened,

57
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,519
but it doesn't hurt to look
on the bright side, right?

58
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,521
Right? Yes, that's right.

59
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,606
Cheers.

60
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,107
Cheers.

61
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,075
Anyway, now that we're all
on the same boat,

62
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,204
let's hope unit 506 will be able
to adjust to the association.

63
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,124
And we may not be exemplary executives,

64
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,503
but let's do our best
to guide her properly…

65
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,506
Sweetheart, you should
cut down on the alcohol.

66
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,675
Me?

67
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,592
Yes.

68
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,844
I don't drink that much.

69
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,721
My husband is the one who drinks.

70
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,392
Goodness,
stop dragging your husband into it.

71
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,602
You don't need to hide it from us.

72
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,937
We know everything.

73
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,940
What do you know?

74
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,486
Gosh, I guess you don't know.

75
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,282
You reek of alcohol every morning.

76
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,701
You're so drunk

77
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,495
that you miss the daycare bus sometimes.

78
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,455
I mean, come on. You're a mother.

79
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,459
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

80
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,753
Have you been spying on me?

81
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,758
I can't believe there's no privacy
in this apartment.

82
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,635
My gosh.

83
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,264
No, I mean…

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,474
Goodness.

85
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,059
Hey, wait.

86
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:23,614
People told me kids should be raised
by their mothers, so I quit my job.

87
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,618
But now they say
kids respect mothers who work

88
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,748
and that mothers need to be happy
in order for the kids to be happy.

89
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,625
But you know what?

90
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,380
I'm not happy at all.

91
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,092
I didn't study so hard
to live this kind of life.

92
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,345
This is a waste of my talents.

93
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,973
I don't get why I'm the account manager

94
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,517
of this worn-down apartment.

95
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,899
Goodness, don't say that.

96
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,903
I can't believe you just said that.
You're unbelievable.

97
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,821
-Calm down.
-Goodness.

98
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,990
Yes, I know how you feel.

99
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,868
We know that it's hard raising children.

100
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,790
But even so, you can't rely
on alcohol to relieve all your stress.

101
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,336
It's better than writing
hate comments online.

102
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,713
At least I don't harm others.

103
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,382
She's right. You need to stop

104
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,385
writing hate comments on the internet.

105
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,262
Don't you watch the news?
You could get in trouble.

106
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,806
You even caused the recent mess.

107
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:35,311
Are you, by any chance, the one who leaves
hate comments on my Instagram?

108
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,648
Someone keeps commenting
that I had plastic surgery done.

109
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,859
But I didn't. I only had braces.

110
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,319
What?

111
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,740
I don't care
if you got plastic surgery or not.

112
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,992
And I don't leave hate comments
just anywhere.

113
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,121
I only do it to those
who have more than 100,000 followers.

114
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,123
I didn't even know
you had an Instagram page.

115
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,416
And why are you so disrespectful to me?

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,628
You're always so polite and respectful
to Ms. Kim,

117
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,714
but you're nothing like that
when it comes to me.

118
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,633
What's wrong with being a bit friendly?

119
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,803
I know I look younger than I am,

120
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,055
but our age gap isn't that big.

121
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,557
What?

122
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,601
Is she asking for a fight?
Is that what this is, Ms. Kim?

123
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,229
Gosh, that's enough.

124
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:23,151
You should be embarrassed
in front of our new member.

125
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,362
It hasn't even been that long
since I talked about setting an example…

126
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,131
What's wrong with her?

127
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,718
Has she gone mad?

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,515
Do you know how funny you guys are?

129
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,601
You guys are unbelievable.

130
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,195
What's wrong with you?

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,281
Gosh, that's so loud.

132
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,824
What's the matter with her?

133
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,411
Why do you keep blowing the whistle?
It's too late for that.

134
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,954
Should I take it from her?

135
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,373
-Take that thing away from her.
-You got it.

136
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,501
Give me that. Give it to me.

137
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,585
Unit 506!

138
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,753
-Stop right there!
-Wait!

139
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,379
The whistle.

140
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,381
-Where is it?
-No, it's mine!

141
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,927
What's the matter?

142
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,564
What's the matter?

143
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,524
Hey.

144
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,442
You're here.

145
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,612
My gosh.

146
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,242
Why did you get her so drunk?

147
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,410
Why in the world

148
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,871
are you accusing us?

149
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:03,417
You all seem fine,
but she's the only one who's drunk.

150
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,754
Did you force her to drink
a ton of alcohol to haze her

151
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,048
just because she's a new member?

152
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,343
What are you talking about?
We didn't force her to drink anything.

153
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,222
Unit 506 drinks like a whale.

154
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,181
A whale.

155
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,476
We spent more than what we gathered.
We didn't even ask her to pay.

156
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,020
But she kept asking us to drink more.

157
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,814
We barely managed to stop her.

158
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,192
-Do you know how difficult it was?
-So!

159
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:32,488
Why do you always take unit 506's side
when you don't even know the full story?

160
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,950
Of course, he'd take her side.
Why would he defend us?

161
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,577
That's true.

162
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,579
-Yes, you're right.
-Isn't that right?

163
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,083
They have a point, you know.
Don't be like that to Ms. Kim.

164
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,794
-We're all on the same side now.
-Yes.

165
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,216
I love our apartment so much.

166
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,052
I'm going to live here forever
with you guys.

167
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,015
Goodness, what do you like
so much about us?

168
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,182
Goodness.

169
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,809
I like this apartment because

170
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,272
you're all nuts.

171
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,273
You're all crazy.

172
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,152
I'm the most normal person here.

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,529
Look.

174
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,240
She's an alcoholic.

175
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,200
She writes hate comments.

176
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,870
And she's the nosiest person
on this planet.

177
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,873
See? What did I tell you?

178
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,792
I told you everyone besides us is crazy.

179
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,752
Isn't that right?

180
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,047
You agree with me, right?
I was totally right.

181
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,840
You really did drink a lot.

182
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,425
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm good.

183
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,385
We're having a blast. Let me go.

184
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,511
Let's go.

185
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,347
-She's an alcoholic
-Come here.

186
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,556
She writes hate comments

187
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
-She's nosy
-Goodness, come here.

188
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,810
-Hey!
-She's drunk. That's why.

189
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,312
-Just forget it.
-She's nosy!

190
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,189
-She leaves hate comments!
-Bye, ladies.

191
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,191
My gosh.

192
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,112
Let's go. Come on.

193
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,032
Gosh, will you please be quiet?

194
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,076
What's with you?

195
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,118
My goodness.

196
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,578
Stop blowing--

197
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,373
Hey, give me that.

198
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,625
-You must've had a lot to drink.
-I'm free!

199
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,959
My goodness.

200
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,795
Stop joking around. Go home.

201
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,463
Why?

202
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,006
Go inside.

203
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,592
Okay. Careful.

204
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,232
Unbelievable.

205
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,903
Gosh, she's so heavy.

206
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,833
My gosh, seriously.

207
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,752
I didn't give that to you
so you can play with it.

208
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,131
I told you to use it
only when you're in an urgent situation.

209
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,971
I need you right now.

210
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,683
It's urgent.

211
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,228
I miss you urgently.

212
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,342
What are you doing?

213
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,428
You said you missed me,
but it feels like you're punishing me.

214
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,061
I missed you, so I'm looking at you.

215
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,065
Stay here until I fall asleep.

216
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,776
Then when do I get to sleep?

217
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,986
After I fall asleep.

218
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,156
When are you going to fall asleep?

219
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,493
Who knows?

220
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,205
I can't take my meds today
because I drank alcohol.

221
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,833
Can't you sleep properly

222
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,378
if you don't take your meds?

223
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,339
No.

224
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,842
I feel drowsy,
but it's hard to fall asleep.

225
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,763
And that scares me at times.

226
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay.

227
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,479
I'll wait until you fall asleep,
so go ahead.

228
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,398
Okay.

229
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,443
But what if I count one, two, three

230
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,029
and finish counting until ten,

231
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,322
what do I do after that?

232
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,284
After that?

233
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,620
Then you start counting backwards.

234
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,706
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

235
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,293
Backwards, I see.

236
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,562
I can't fall asleep
because you're so quiet.

237
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,188
Just talk to me about anything.

238
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,065
Anything?

239
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,694
Let's see…

240
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,697
Well…

241
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,703
I heard crying over sad movies

242
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,791
actually helps people who have
anger issues.

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,378
But I tend to be a little dry.

244
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,925
It's hard to make me cry
no matter how sad a movie may be.

245
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,593
While we're on the subject,

246
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,304
why don't we go watch a movie together?

247
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,266
It's a part of my therapy,
so I need to go alone anyway.

248
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,062
It'd be nice to have some company.

249
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,022
I'll buy the tickets.

250
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,195
By the way,

251
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,870
I'm just asking you this
out of pure curiosity,

252
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,748
so don't try to start a fight or anything.

253
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,129
Well…

254
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,050
You know when you invited me over

255
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,721
for some ramyeon last time?

256
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,558
What did you mean by that?

257
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,699
Hello?

258
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,097
There's no way she has insomnia.
She's so sound asleep.

259
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,188
Is she arguing with people
in her dream or something?

260
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,648
What's with the frown?

261
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,029
Wait a minute.

262
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,990
"Were you following me?
You did it on purpose."

263
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,533
I bet it wasn't an accident."

264
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,997
What are you doing?

265
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,833
What?

266
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,461
What were you about to do?

267
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,133
What do you mean?

268
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,887
You were just about to do something.

269
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,558
What's with you? You're scaring me.

270
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,645
What were you about to do?

271
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,818
I wasn't going to do anything.

272
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,743
Do what you were about to do.

273
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,996
What?

274
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,998
Go ahead and do

275
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,377
what you were about to do.

276
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,415
EPISODE 10

277
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,753
FROM TODAY WE ARE

278
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,013
-Ms. Lee Hyeon-suk, please come in.
-Eat this.

279
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,141
Thanks.

280
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,726
Is this your first time?

281
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,144
Good choice.

282
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,146
She's really good.

283
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,439
She gets everything right.

284
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:38,046
What was it that made you
force yourself to come here?

285
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,218
Shouldn't you be able to guess
if you're really that good?

286
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:52,728
So, your husband is…

287
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,855
not around…

288
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,189
so you're here about your child.

289
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,194
Goodness, you gave birth to a son,

290
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,864
but that son of yours…

291
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,202
Your daughter is like a son.

292
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:13,206
She's not friendly like other daughters.

293
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,876
She has no consideration
for her mother's feelings.

294
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,170
She only cares about her temper,

295
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,213
and she's extremely stubborn.

296
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:21,923
Yes.

297
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,594
APRIL 13, 1991, HOUR OF THE PIG

298
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,807
GYE GYE IM SHIN
HAE CHUK JIN MI

299
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,894
Your daughter is like water.

300
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,312
She's like rain.

301
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:41,318
She needs to meet a tree
before she gets swept away,

302
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,530
so that she can bloom during the spring.

303
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,786
Does she not have anyone
who's like a tree?

304
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,625
Can you please check this?

305
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,961
My son recently started seeing this woman.

306
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,338
Let's take a look.

307
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,842
APRIL 13, 1991, HOUR OF THE PIG

308
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,847
How did he manage
to find someone so perfect?

309
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,516
What?

310
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,768
She has the spirit of water.

311
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,520
She's like rain.

312
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:20,565
This tree will no longer have to worry
about burning to a crisp in a fire.

313
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,150
My goodness gracious.

314
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,069
Thank you so much.

315
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,363
This is finally putting me at ease.

316
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,489
I should go.

317
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,908
I'll come back next time. Bye.
I'll be off now.

318
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,867
Goodbye.

319
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,976
You're here because you're single.

320
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,062
My gosh.

321
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,273
How did you know that?

322
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,956
It takes a while for the bus to come.

323
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,166
It's always like this.

324
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,459
I see.

325
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,429
It was my first time
coming to a place like this.

326
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,098
I don't know if it's okay

327
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,019
to believe what a shaman says.

328
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,771
It's not about the shaman.

329
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:46,776
If she tells you your child will end up
marrying someone nice,

330
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,905
you feel relieved
and choose to believe her.

331
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,702
The shaman told me that my son

332
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,080
will meet someone nice
and live a happy life.

333
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,875
I don't believe everything she says.

334
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:08,340
He may be my son,
but he knows nothing about women.

335
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:13,345
He doesn't know how to say nice things,
and he's not that considerate either.

336
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,142
I wonder what kind of woman
would want to date a guy like him?

337
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,310
I worry the same.

338
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,731
She may be my daughter,
but she has a really nasty temper.

339
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,944
She doesn't know how to be coy
or act feminine.

340
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,280
I doubt any guy would want
to date a girl like her.

341
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,659
He'd have to be blind to fall for her.

342
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,954
That means she's honest.
It means she can't lie.

343
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,997
It's better to be honest than to be coy.

344
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,292
She'll find someone.

345
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,193
What's wrong? Who is it?

346
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,404
-Ms…
-Who? Who is it?

347
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,573
Ms. Kim and the members
of the women's association.

348
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,285
Go to my room.

349
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,120
My shoes.

350
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,166
Go to my room. Hide.

351
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,542
Hide.

352
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,754
I'm coming.

353
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,888
Hello.

354
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,306
What brings you here?

355
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,392
We forgot to tell you this

356
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,353
because you were so drunk last night.

357
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:12,565
The women's association is gathering
at 7:00 p.m. to patrol the neighborhood.

358
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,027
You can't skip out
even if you're embarrassed.

359
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,572
Okay. I should go back inside.

360
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,743
Gosh, this is a really nice lock.

361
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,371
Do you have a guest over?

362
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,124
What? No, I…

363
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,917
No, no one's here.

364
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,001
No one.

365
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,046
Yes, of course. We didn't think so.

366
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,299
Go away. Go.

367
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,806
Your dog never barked when I came.
Why is he barking so much today?

368
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,683
You're right.

369
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,644
Okay, I get it.

370
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,938
-It's at 7:00 p.m.
-See you at 7:00 p.m.

371
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,784
Goodness.

372
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,289
He always takes ages to answer the door.

373
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,388
Are they gone?

374
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,932
Yes, they're all gone.

375
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,143
You can go now.

376
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,145
Why did they come unannounced?

377
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,939
By the way,

378
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,484
I cooked that. You can eat it later.

379
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,909
I'll go now.

380
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,499
My goodness.

381
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,465
I'll see you.

382
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,385
-Hey, ladies.
-Hello.

383
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,886
-Hello.
-You're all here.

384
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,263
Hello.

385
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,684
We're going to pair up
and patrol the neighborhood

386
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,853
for about 2 hours and 30 minutes.

387
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,397
We're short one person today.

388
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,859
Anyway, watch out for drunk people.

389
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,610
My goodness!

390
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,614
My gosh, unit 507.
You weren't home earlier.

391
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,908
How did you know the patrol
started at 7:00 p.m.?

392
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,327
How did you manage to come just in time?

393
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:15,039
I looked down here from my window
and noticed you were all here.

394
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,041
I see.

395
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:22,171
Now that we have one more person,
you can all work in pairs now.

396
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,842
And our uniforms aren't ready yet,

397
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,094
so we'll just have to do without it, okay?

398
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,265
You can feel free to blow on your whistle.
It's great.

399
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,516
Pardon?

400
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,185
We have a nickname for you, unit 506.

401
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,437
You're the "Hongjik-dong

402
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,397
-Whistle."
-"Whistle."

403
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,608
Let's go now.

404
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,318
Let's go.

405
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,952
But what exactly do you do
when you're on patrol?

406
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,748
You just walk around the neighborhood

407
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,499
to prevent people from committing crimes.

408
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,085
To prevent crimes?

409
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,381
Then we should try to find people
who are being suspicious.

410
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,384
I'm getting nervous.
Do you think I'll do well?

411
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,678
Of course.

412
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,348
Just think of it as going on a walk.

413
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,186
Let's go!

414
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,022
It's safe here. It's completely safe.

415
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,690
-Hidden camera!
-What? What is it?

416
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,067
What's wrong? What?

417
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,944
-He's secretly taking photos!
-What's the matter?

418
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,989
-Hey.
-You're unbelievable.

419
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,533
Arrest him right now! Miss,

420
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,286
I just caught him
taking photos of you from behind.

421
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,454
-What?
-Take a look.

422
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,208
Babe, I told you to take the photo
from a lower angle

423
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,793
so my legs look longer.

424
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,710
I'm sorry.

425
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,712
What is it again?

426
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,006
No one's here. What? What's wrong?

427
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,676
Is that man about to throw away
a cigarette butt?

428
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,094
What if that starts a fire?

429
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,471
That's just his cell phone!

430
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,808
This place is quiet. It's very tranquil.

431
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,685
-Wait!
-What's wrong?

432
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,938
Look. He's not even ordering,
and he keeps looking at the owner.

433
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,231
He's being suspicious.

434
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,859
Look. Look at him.

435
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,819
He's stealing.

436
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,155
We need to catch him! He's stealing!

437
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,573
No, wait.

438
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,828
I think she's his mom.

439
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,081
See? She's his mother.

440
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:27,088
Listen. I understand
that you're very eager to investigate,

441
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,466
but police investigation
isn't about snooping around like this.

442
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,553
Plus, this area is going to be torn down,
so there's no one here.

443
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,179
I haven't even seen a single ant.

444
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,851
I'm not just snooping around.
I have my reasons.

445
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,894
How do you think
Shin Chang-won got caught?

446
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,440
He got caught because a plumber
found him suspicious and called the cops.

447
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,651
That's why we shouldn't ignore
even the smallest things.

448
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,778
Don't you know this saying?

449
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,073
"Suspect everything. Don't trust anyone."

450
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,080
See? There's something suspicious
about this place.

451
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:05,251
Why are the lights turned on
when no one even lives here?

452
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,296
The entrance is even blocked with a tape
that says "do not enter."

453
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,635
What is this smell?

454
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,889
This place is weird. Let's go inside.

455
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,225
No, wait. I know it's fun to play cop,
but let's call it a day.

456
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,435
Let's go home.

457
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,562
Forget it if you're scared.

458
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,064
I'll go in by myself.

459
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,440
Fine. Go ahead.

460
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,068
Why don't you wear this vest
while you're at it?

461
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,321
You can go ahead into that haunted house.

462
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,323
Sure.

463
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm sure nothing will happen to me.

464
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,369
In movies, if you enter a criminal's den
and get caught,

465
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,830
you just get killed
and have your organs taken out,

466
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,793
or get chased by gang members
for witnessing a drug deal,

467
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,921
or get locked up with the other victims
by a serial killer.

468
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,547
It can't get any worse than that.

469
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,760
All of that's horrible.
What kind of movies do you watch?

470
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,305
And there are no drug labs or gangs
in our neighborhood.

471
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,475
Are you really not going to go inside?

472
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,103
I'm scared of the dark.

473
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,648
Fine then. I'll go in there by myself.

474
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,358
You'd better run inside
when I blow my whistle.

475
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,484
You got it, ma'am.

476
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,860
Go on inside.

477
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:14,148
