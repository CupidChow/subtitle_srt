1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,183
There's a pervert here!

2
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,894
Catch the pervert!

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,314
Everyone! He's right here!

4
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,608
-Quiet down!
-It's a pervert!

5
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,403
Catch that pervert!

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,698
-The pervert! It's the pervert!
-Where?

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,118
My goodness! Don't come closer!

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,746
Don't come near! Don't go away either!

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,872
Stay there.

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,789
Just wait there.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,541
My gosh.

12
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,460
Goodness. What's going on?

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,421
Unit 507, what's with the outfit?

14
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,715
My gosh. And you said
you had an appointment today.

15
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,467
Was this your appointment?

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,843
It's not like what you think it is.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,387
-I'm just--
-I had no idea

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,097
you were this kind of person.

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,640
Gosh, you tricked all of us,

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,894
doing all kinds of nasty stuff
behind our backs.

21
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,271
I had no idea he was such a jerk.
My goodness!

22
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,065
That's not it.

23
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,692
Because of the case
I'm investigating lately--

24
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,487
What do you mean by investigation?
You're on a hiatus.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,863
Well, what happened is…

26
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,909
If you were not a pervert,
why would you be walking around like this?

27
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,578
She's right. Why would you run away
if you're so innocent?

28
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,662
Exactly.

29
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,247
Well, that's because you all
suddenly ran up to--

30
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,999
I said, don't come closer!

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,501
We don't need to hear anymore.

32
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,835
He's definitely a pervert.

33
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,506
No, I'm not! I'm not a pervert! Damn it.

34
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,633
Gosh.

35
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:39,224
EPISODE 5
A BIG BARKING DOG THAT DOESN'T BITE WOMEN

36
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,826
When I told you to stay dead quiet,
I meant dead quiet!

37
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,245
Since it's so hard for you,
I ought to just kill you!

38
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,705
I told you not to do
all the undercover stuff.

39
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,790
Do you have any idea how many times

40
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,251
-headquarters called me?
-Gosh, you're so loud.

41
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,170
Until when do I have to
defend you like this? You idiot!

42
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,339
Put your legs together, will you?

43
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,882
And what's with that wig?

44
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,926
Take that stocking off, you punk!

45
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,888
See? I told you.

46
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,348
There's no way he's a pervert.

47
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,558
I know, In-ja.

48
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,353
By the way, I didn't know cops actually
dress like women to go undercover.

49
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,813
I've only seen that in movies.

50
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,231
He should have explained it to us.

51
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,941
-Tell me about it.
-Why didn't he say anything?

52
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:30,859
He did though.

53
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,527
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

54
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,487
You've got to curb your temper sometimes.

55
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,405
Yes, sir.

56
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,289
Where did you even buy these clothes?

57
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,332
What's with the hiking clothes?
You don't even hike.

58
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,127
What now?

59
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,964
You know, all kinds of things
happen to cops during investigations.

60
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,132
You prick.

61
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,009
So are you a cop now?

62
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,386
I told you to lay low
if you wanted your job back.

63
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,763
Can't you keep away from the substation?

64
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,892
Come on. Don't talk like that.

65
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,518
I heard you met U-jin.

66
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,438
And you're still acting up?

67
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,481
How could you be like this
after seeing him?

68
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,319
I'm not doing this because of U-jin.

69
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,739
Yang was definitely there that day.

70
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,492
I will do whatever it takes
to catch him to prove that.

71
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,746
And I will reveal to everyone
why U-jin went there that day.

72
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,416
And why was he there in the first place?

73
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,838
Listen to me.

74
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,966
You're the reason
U-jin is like that right now.

75
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,054
It's because you used the investigation
as an excuse to do as you please.

76
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,680
That's why…

77
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,100
he's ended up crippled.

78
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,229
So don't tell me you're
doing this for him.

79
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,272
If I ever hear

80
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,276
that you're investigating Yang again,

81
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,363
I'll do whatever I can
to stop you from coming back.

82
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,114
Understand?

83
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,828
Hwi-oh.

84
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,307
It was definitely misleading.

85
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,851
So?

86
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,062
So what?

87
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,901
So?

88
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,076
You're not going to apologize anyway.

89
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,911
Right?

90
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,752
But seriously, what is it
that I have done so wrong to you?

91
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,673
Tell me.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,969
I mean, what have I done so wrong

93
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,764
to deserve all the beating
and the cussing?

94
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,808
You know, I helped you when you asked.

95
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,768
I found you the dog and everything.

96
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,894
What about you?

97
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,189
Do you have any idea
what I went through today?

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,737
I was…

99
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,119
Are you crying?

100
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,829
Why are you crying?

101
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,456
Don't cry.

102
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,250
Do you find this funny?

103
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,211
You suspect innocent people
and get them in trouble.

104
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,881
You enjoy watching them suffer, don't you?

105
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,007
Are you a psychopath?

106
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,343
That's why you go
to the psychiatrist, right?

107
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,097
Actually, I--

108
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,892
I don't even want to know.
You don't have to answer.

109
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,769
Why would I want to know that?

110
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,312
From now on,

111
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,815
since you hate me so much,

112
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,235
I will do my best
to stay out of your sight.

113
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,905
So keep your door locked like always

114
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,616
and keep suspecting
the people who try to help you.

115
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,533
Okay?

116
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,620
If I ever talk to you again,

117
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,873
Then I'm not human. I'm a dog!

118
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,758
What?

119
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,802
Go.

120
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,317
Stay away!

121
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,485
Hey!

122
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,905
Come here!

123
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,538
Are you okay?

124
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,290
Are you hurt?

125
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,003
Stay here. I'll be right back.

126
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,135
Don't go. Okay? Don't go.

127
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,512
What's wrong?
I'll be right back. Stay here.

128
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,792
Stand up!

129
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,961
-Stand up!
-Who on earth are you?

130
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:24,879
What's the matter?

131
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,173
What did you just do
in front of the woman?

132
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,217
-Answer me!
-I didn't do anything.

133
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,385
I do this to cool myself off.

134
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,346
What's the problem?

135
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,931
Come on. This is unfair!

136
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,891
Call the police!

137
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,100
Let go of me.

138
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,394
-Stay still. I'm going to call them.
-That really hurts.

139
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,480
You'd better say exactly
what you just said at the station.

140
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,775
Don't even think about settling
or whatever since that's a hassle.

141
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,984
Stop moving!

142
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,073
You little…

143
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,282
God damn it.

144
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,666
No.

145
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,667
It hurts.

146
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,627
Don't move or your arm might break.

147
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,048
What are you doing?
Hurry and call the police already.

148
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,925
What?

149
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,886
Okay. Sure.

150
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,098
It hurts.

151
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,558
That hurts.

152
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,274
-Thank you, sir.
-Not a big deal. Bye, then.

153
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,400
Bye.

154
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,335
What now?

155
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,796
Apologize if that's what you want to do.

156
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,007
You don't need to thank me.

157
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,431
Well, that's not it.
You said if you ever talk to me again,

158
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,641
you're a dog, not human.

159
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,647
And I told you not to go.

160
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,815
Why did you go?

161
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,278
I had to catch that pervert first.

162
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,404
I did, didn't I?

163
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,948
I said I'd be right back,
but you wouldn't let go.

164
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,117
I could have missed him.

165
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,120
Why are you bothering me now?

166
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
What?

167
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,542
You didn't believe me again?

168
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,298
You always go quiet when you're cornered.

169
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,179
I can't

170
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,766
trust people.

171
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,934
It's just hard for me.

172
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,895
That's my illness.

173
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,482
Your illness actually sounds quite normal.

174
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,235
Psychopath, sociopath,
or multiple personality disorder.

175
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,780
I thought you were
one of those three cases.

176
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,913
I have you all figured out now.
You don't even anger me anymore.

177
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,666
Your lingering around is more annoying.
So just come along.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,293
Come on. Come closer.

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,719
Are you okay?

180
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,055
Don't you need to see a doctor?

181
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,641
You were groaning like this before.

182
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,975
I'm okay.

183
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,144
That was just a temporary panic attack.

184
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,316
It happens when someone follows me
on rainy days.

185
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,737
I can't breathe
and my heart pounds for a while.

186
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,658
I get so dizzy I feel like I'll pass out,
I break out in cold sweat,

187
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,246
my entire body feels numb
and I feel like I could die soon.

188
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,457
But then I become completely normal again.

189
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,421
Are you sure that's normal?

190
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,801
That's all in your head.

191
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,180
You need to use your left brain then,
instead of the emotional right brain.

192
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,349
Didn't the doctor tell you about this?

193
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,684
Maybe she just told me.

194
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,520
How do you do that?

195
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,898
You can count numbers
while breathing deeply.

196
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,736
How can I breathe deeply
when I can't breathe at all?

197
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,489
Just try to take a deep breath in slowly.

198
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,032
Just try it. It works.

199
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,789
Take a deep breath
and then count one as you exhale.

200
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,795
Take a deep breath
and then count two as you exhale.

201
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:42,553
Take a deep breath
and then count three as you exhale.

202
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:48,517
Take a deep breath
and then count four as you exhale.

203
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,444
Now, count five as you exhale.

204
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,372
Anyway, that's how you do it.

205
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,756
Maybe I'm getting a panic attack.

206
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,470
Goodness.

207
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,084
Don't go. Okay?

208
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,608
One.

209
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,364
Two.

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,703
Three.

211
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,917
Four.

212
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,424
Five.

213
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,721
How is taking care of the puppy?

214
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,016
It should motivate you in your daily life.

215
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,727
Right.

216
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,023
Being with the dog makes me feel safer

217
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,108
than when I'm alone.

218
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,320
I feel secure.

219
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,448
He's like a guard dog
I want to take around.

220
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,868
Did you say your dog's name is Howi?

221
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,331
It sounds like
Howi is your great guard dog.

222
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,875
No, I'm not talking about Howi.

223
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,921
I'm talking about the dog
I mentioned earlier.

224
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,882
The big barking dog
that doesn't bite women.

225
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,344
So how is it going?

226
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,014
Could you avoid the anger triggers
as you planned?

227
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,893
Well, it turns out

228
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,648
that some situations are

229
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,777
just inevitable.

230
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,113
But there's this saying that goes,

231
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,784
"If you can't avoid it, fight it."

232
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,497
Or "If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."

233
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,376
And which would you rather do?

234
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,462
Well…

235
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,133
I've now reached the point
where I can enjoy fighting it.

236
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,684
It feels great having this punk caught.

237
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,269
Tell me about it.
Thanks for your hard work.

238
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,772
-You've all done well.
-Thank you. Bye.

239
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,484
Gosh, I can finally sleep in peace now.

240
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,527
Tell me about it.

241
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,862
-Wait. Unit 507!
-What?

242
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,114
Unit 507!

243
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,285
Did you sleep well?

244
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,579
I mean, we heard what happened.

245
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,207
We heard
you caught that pervert last night.

246
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,294
Gosh, we had no idea.

247
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,548
I'm sorry for all the fuss
we made yesterday.

248
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,385
But we trusted you. Okay?

249
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,097
-Unit 506 just kept insisting it was you.
-Exactly.

250
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,974
Forget it.

251
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,061
I remember how all three of you
ganged up on me last night.

252
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,063
But now you say
you trusted me and whatnot.

253
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,400
Now I get why Unit 705 ran away last time.

254
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,986
I mean, I saw how you guys
all cornered me.

255
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,071
No wonder he ran away!

256
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,489
What else would he have done?

257
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,408
Fine. We get it.

258
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,076
We're sorry. Okay?

259
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,662
That's why we're apologizing to you now.

260
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,748
She's right. We're sorry.

261
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,458
Please don't be mad.

262
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,918
You're not going to stay mad about this

263
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,047
and stop patrolling with us, are you?

264
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,631
All the ladies say
they don't want to do it

265
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,341
-without you.
-She's right.

266
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,344
You're the hero in this apartment.

267
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,889
We call you "Hero Noh!"

268
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:41,894
-Hero Noh!
-Hero Noh!

269
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,562
-I'm not joking.
-Hero Noh!

270
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,731
I don't need your apology.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,150
But rather, go apologize to Unit 705.

272
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,819
You didn't apologize to him
properly that day.

273
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,321
I understand how upset he was

274
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,615
having been through it too.

275
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,325
Fine.

276
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,244
We were going to do that anyway.

277
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,454
-Yes.
-Right?

278
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,206
Maybe we should bring him something.

279
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,291
I saw we have a new bakery
around the corner.

280
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,669
That sounds great.
I wonder if he likes bread?

281
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,129
I'll get going then.

282
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,911
I'll chew every bit of your body…

283
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,913
Damn it!

284
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,624
…except for your gold teeth!

285
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,338
I must have lost my mind.

286
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,060
Yes?

287
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,860
Come on. I have a lot of deliveries.
Open the door quicker.

288
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,153
What's all that?

289
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,612
I didn't order anything.

290
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,117
Unit 507, Building 105,
Hongjik Jungang Apartment.

291
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,579
That's you. And it's all paid for already.

292
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,956
It's my address,

293
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,667
but I didn't order that.

294
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,589
-Wait, sir. You found the right place.
-Okay. Enjoy.

295
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,424
Thank you. Bye.

296
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,218
What was that?
Why did you order it to my address?

297
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,221
I guess I wrote the wrong address.

298
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,891
And that's a lot of food
just for yourself.

299
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,352
I had to order a lot to meet
the minimum order price for delivery.

300
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,104
Do you want some?

301
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,231
No, I'm good.

302
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,361
Actually,
you can give me one jjajangmyeon.

303
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,906
You can't eat it if it gets soggy anyway.
Give me that.

304
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,657
Okay.

305
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,916
Here you go. Take this too.

306
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,169
How do we split this?

307
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,671
Do you have plates inside?

308
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,552
I do have plates, but…

309
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,100
Why don't you just come inside
so we can eat together?

310
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,729
Should I then?

311
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,022
Okay. Come on in.

312
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,523
Come in.

313
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,757
Wait.

314
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,053
You didn't drug this, did you?

315
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,555
Why are you suddenly being nice to me?

316
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,724
What are you trying to pull here?

317
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,936
I'm not trying to pull anything.

318
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,398
By the way,

319
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,901
about what you did yesterday…

320
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,532
Can you please tell me how you did it?

321
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,036
What? What are you talking about?

322
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,457
You know, what you did
with all the flashy moves.

323
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:38,755
Was it some kind of a special martial art?
Or is it Jeet Kune Do?

324
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,843
It's a practical compilation
of different martial arts.

325
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,932
Could you teach that to me…

326
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,226
please?

327
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,646
What?

328
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,191
Come on, please. Please?

329
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,905
You say "please"
only when you need something.

330
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,826
So what exactly is the thing
you want to learn?

331
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,495
-Self-defense?
-Yes. Something like that.

332
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,539
Something I can use when I'm in danger.

333
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,499
And what are you going to do with that?

334
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,585
Are you being chased? Are you a spy?

335
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,420
Who are you trying to hurt this time?

336
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,717
Well, I just thought
it would be nice to learn.

337
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,680
Then I'll teach you,

338
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,768
so don't use the stun gun ever again.

339
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,145
It might end up provoking the offender,

340
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,439
and even worse, they can take it from you.

341
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,357
Okay.

342
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,652
-Now, repeat after me.
-Okay.

343
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,697
When you're in danger,
the best thing to do is…

344
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,491
The best thing to do is…

345
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,284
-To clench your fists.
-To clench my fists.

346
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,786
And quickly move your elbows
back and front.

347
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,120
Back and front.

348
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,207
Run.

349
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,542
So fast you can't see your feet.

350
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,087
Until you feel like throwing up.

351
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,799
What's that?

352
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,259
That's just running away.
I don't want to do that.

353
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,262
Statistically, that's the safest way.

354
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:14,267
I want to learn
how to knock someone down in one blow.

355
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,144
Like vital or acupuncture points.

356
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,481
Right. vital points.

357
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,565
Yes.

358
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,692
It's simple.

359
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,069
Men have…

360
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,112
Men have?

361
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,530
…only one vital point.

362
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,617
Come on. I know that.

363
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,746
That's the only way
you can overpower a man.

364
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,373
Watch me.

365
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,544
Hold the guy's shoulders and use your knee

366
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,671
to knee him in the balls!

367
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,924
Got it?

368
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,349
Can I please try it once?

369
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,228
Try what?

370
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,064
Please. Just once. Please.

371
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,816
Please?

372
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,193
No way.

373
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,988
Let me just practice the pose.
Please. Just once.

374
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,323
Please let me practice
the pose just once. Please.

375
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,118
You're saying
you'll practice just the pose,

376
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,953
but you will actually kick me. So, no.

377
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,748
No way. I promise I won't kick you.

378
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,501
Why would I kick you
in your vital point?

379
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,795
I've never tried,
so I just want a feel for it.

380
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,631
Let me just practice the pose.

381
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,676
Please. Just this once.
I'll practice just the pose.

382
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,179
Okay, then.

383
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,474
This is just about the pose, okay?
Don't actually kick me.

384
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,101
Of course I won't.

385
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,437
Fine. Let me stand up.

386
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,438
Stand up straight

387
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,524
and hold the offender's shoulders tight.

388
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,775
Grab my shoulders.

389
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,237
And raise your knee
while looking at my balls.

390
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,822
Three, two, one, bam.

391
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,824
-Got it?
-Yes.

392
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,201
Good.

393
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,744
That's how you do it. Well done.

394
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,954
Let me try it just once.

395
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,539
Let me try it. Just this once.

396
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,208
-Okay. Let's try.
-Stand here.

397
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,293
All right. Try it. Hold my shoulders.

398
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,713
Pull his shoulders and then aim his balls.

399
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,965
Then…

400
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,592
There you go. Well done.

401
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,843
That's how you do it.

402
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,887
I didn't do it yet. Let me try again.

403
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,433
Here we go. Three, two, one!

404
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,562
Come on!
I said I'd practice just the pose!

405
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,190
Well, it's just
that I have very good reflexes.

406
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,650
I did this by reflex.

407
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,152
Come on and stand over here. Come here.

408
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,989
I will stop right before I kick you.
So please. Just this once.

409
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,783
Just this once, please.

410
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,827
Then make sure to stop
before you kick me, okay?

411
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,371
-I'll stop.
-Really stop, okay?

412
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,455
Okay.

413
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,833
Go on then.

414
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,670
-Hold the shoulders.
-Hold the shoulders.

415
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,047
-All right. And raise my knee…
-Toward…

416
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,674
-Toward the balls.
-Raise your knee.

417
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,259
Raise my knee!

418
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,843
Bam!

419
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,517
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

420
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,084
I'm sorry.
Should I take you to the hospital?

421
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,673
Stay out of my sight. Get lost.

422
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,219
I want you to go home. I said, go.

423
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,680
Go. Go away.

424
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,748
Who is it?

425
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,129
Gosh.

426
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,384
What is this?

427
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,516
What the hell?

428
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,310
Why do you keep feeding me?

429
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,729
This is not going to make up
for what you did, okay?

430
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,116
Damn it…

431
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,173
I guess she's human after all.
She feels sorry.

432
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,972
What is it though? Spicy fish stew?

433
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,645
What the…

434
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,941
Seriously?

435
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,944
You've got to be kidding me.

436
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,405
Is she picking a fight?

437
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,085
Where is she?

438
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,920
AWAY FOR A MOMENT

439
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,675
Where were you?

440
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,510
You missed so many customers.

441
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,804
Are you my boss or what?

442
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,306
I just went to the bathroom--

443
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,275
Welcome.

444
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,319
You said there was no bathroom.

445
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,414
That would be 8,700 won.

446
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,208
You're paying with a card.

447
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,463
-Thank you.
-Okay.

448
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,105
Hey, wait.

449
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,482
What's this?

450
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,193
You can have it. It's expired anyway.

451
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,573
Why does everyone want to give me food?

452
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,660
What if I get a stomachache
from the expired food?

453
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,414
If you get a stomachache,
I'll let you use the bathroom.

454
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,793
Well, it's too late now.

455
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,842
I heard you caught the pervert.

456
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,137
Yes, I guess.

457
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,683
I don't need to worry
about running into him anymore,

458
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,352
so this is a thank you gift.

459
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,438
Okay.

460
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,941
Thank you.

461
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,108
Okay.

462
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,364
By the way, there's a strawberry inside.

463
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,032
Have you never seen this before?

464
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,926
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

465
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,053
Welcome.

466
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,609
Bye.

467
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,694
Goodbye.

468
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,697
Please ring this up.

469
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,742
This is a buy-two-get-one-free product.

470
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,874
Did you enjoy the food?

471
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,421
When will you teach me the rest?

472
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,463
The self-defense.

473
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,841
Are you kidding me?

474
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,676
Self-defense, my foot.

475
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,095
Could you stay away from me?
Or just walk past me.

476
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,764
Why?

477
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,433
It was just a mistake.

478
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,398
I underestimated you.

479
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,692
If I involve myself with you anymore,

480
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,153
I might get seriously hurt or end up dead.

481
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,780
Stay away from me again.

482
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,160
That's not fair.
You always change your mind.

483
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,828
Gosh! Go away!

484
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,875
Come on, don't be so petty!
Did you forget about all the food you got?

485
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,668
As if it's such a big deal.

486
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,298
You know what?
If I ever talk to you again, I'm a dog!

487
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,176
Okay?

488
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,220
Gosh!

489
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:31,074
Honey! Come on. Let's get on the elevator.

490
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,620
What? What are you
trying to pull this time?

491
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,581
Come on. Let's get in.

492
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,625
What?

493
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,584
Honey.

494
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,711
Come on, honey.

495
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,055
Right.

496
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,891
Sorry I kept you waiting.

497
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:58,977
Go on.

498
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,853
Okay.

499
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:26,981
