1
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,768
The hood.

2
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,937
The rear-view mirror.

3
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,689
The door.

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,525
You needed to change them anyway, right?

5
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,237
What about it?

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:33,867
What?

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,994
What about it?

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,746
What is it?

9
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,750
What? Where are you going?

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,836
Where are you going? Okay, fine.

11
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,172
Fine. I'll help.

12
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,799
Really? Let's go.

13
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,137
Hello, sir.

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,639
Goodness. Salute.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,974
Everything's fine, sir

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,976
What?

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
I heard you're a cop.

18
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,648
Gosh, the association president
must have told you.

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,778
I always considered myself
as a police officer

20
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,530
whose job is to keep this apartment safe.

21
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,075
But here I am
talking to an actual police officer.

22
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,788
He told me I needed to come with a cop
to see the security footage

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,791
because of the Personal Information
Protection Act.

24
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,835
That's how the law works.

25
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,338
By any chance, can we check the footage?

26
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,381
Sure. Of course. Come this way.

27
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,552
Gosh, we're causing so much trouble.

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,649
What is that?

29
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,943
-That?
-Yes.

30
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,027
Okay.

31
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,278
Here.

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,367
What's this?
In front of those kids over there.

33
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,623
Yes, there he is!

34
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,385
What's wrong with you kids?

35
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,637
What are you doing to the dog?

36
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,563
No, no. You're just leaving
after making them cry?

37
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,191
I'm going to tell my mom!

38
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,985
He's going to tell his mom!

39
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,487
Mom!

40
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,822
Don't cry.

41
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,449
My mom's really scary.

42
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,079
My dad cries whenever she shouts.

43
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,042
I'm sorry. Don't cry.
Gosh, I'm sorry. Don't cry.

45
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,129
-My mom chops chicken like this.
-Mom!

46
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,631
She even lifts the table all on her own.

47
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,594
Okay, I'm sorry. I really am. Don't cry.

48
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,346
My goodness, don't cry.

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,349
-I'm going to tell my mom everything!
-I'm going to tell my mom everything!

50
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,934
Okay, okay.

51
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,650
Thank you.

52
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,403
Thank you.

53
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,490
Why did you take him?

54
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,453
I wanted to pet it,
but you wouldn't let us, old lady.

55
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,580
I like puppies.

56
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,540
I also wanted to give him candy.

57
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,543
First of all, I'm not an old lady.

58
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,882
Second of all, I didn't let you pet him
because he has a skin condition.

59
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,427
Third of all, dogs can't eat candy.
It makes them sick.

60
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,763
And last of all,

61
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,599
you can't just do whatever you want
just because you want to.

62
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,434
You can't read his mind.

63
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,895
You never asked him, did you?
I bet he felt dizzy.

64
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,108
And I'm giving you this
because I feel sorry for startling you.

65
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,570
Instead, don't tell your mom
what happened.

66
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,281
You can go now.

67
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,742
-Bye.
-Bye.

68
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,287
Seo-jun. Tae-jun.

69
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,748
What are you still doing outside
at this hour?

70
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,375
Did you finish your homework?

71
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,335
I forgot.

72
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,755
Where did you get this jelly?

73
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,091
Her.

74
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,142
-Let's go home now. Goodness.
-Right.

75
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,394
-Seo-jun, let's go.
-Let's go.

76
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,646
Tae-jun, you too.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,898
Let's go.

78
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,900
Let's go.

79
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,069
They were brothers?

80
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,072
They made a fool of me.

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,965
You didn't forget
the promise you made, right?

82
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,675
What promise?

83
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,928
Seeing a different doctor.

84
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,431
What?

85
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,974
Don't glare at me.

86
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,851
Avoid me at all costs.

87
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,063
Why aren't you answering me?

88
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,941
I'll just switch my counseling dates.

89
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:17,942
What?

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,612
I'll do everything else.

91
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,542
Are you going to keep the dog?

92
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,837
-Yes.
-Yes. Good choice.

93
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,006
It suits you.

94
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,216
Raising stray dogs.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,886
Feeding pigeons and cats.

96
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,727
Hey, your promise.

97
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,482
People who like animals are all nice.

98
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,319
Whatever.
I heard Hitler loved animals too.

99
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:09,410
Don't think you're so kind
just because you saved a stray dog.

100
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,373
Why do you keep talking to me
if you want to keep a distance?

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,876
Is it because I'm pretty?

102
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,634
I seriously can't believe

103
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,220
you just said that.

104
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,223
I know I'm pretty.

105
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,852
Women who are pretty know they are.
They just pretend to be oblivious.

106
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,940
Didn't you hear the kids
calling you "old lady"?

107
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,442
Kids these days are very cunning.

108
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,778
They only said that to offend me.

109
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,829
Okay, sure. Fine.

110
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,374
I guess you're not completely ugly.

111
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,668
But just know this.

112
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,003
You're not shockingly beautiful.

113
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,214
You're not pretty enough to turn heads

114
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:07,718
or get a guy excited about your looks
on a blind date.

115
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,220
Let's just say

116
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,724
you're pretty in a subtle way.

117
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,768
You just stand out…

118
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,107
in the neighborhood.

119
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,821
That's just about it.

120
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,745
So don't overestimate yourself.

121
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:51,387
EPISODE 4
THERE ARE NO BAD DOGS

122
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,191
A PERVERT IN A BLACK RAINCOAT HAS
BEEN SPOTTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

123
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,947
What is it this time?

124
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,033
Are you suspecting me again?

125
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,994
I didn't say anything.

126
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,584
Hey, your promise.

127
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:45,149
I feel great.

128
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,892
I'm handsome.

129
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,608
Gosh.

130
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,614
My gosh.

131
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,876
An electric shaver…

132
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,503
Gosh, they're expensive.

133
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,381
PET REGISTRATION AND PLEDGE

134
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,678
BREED, SEX: MIX, MALE
SIZE: SMALL DOG

135
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,276
NAME: HOWI

136
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,320
You named your dog "Howi"?

137
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,905
Is that the spell that Dooly casts?

138
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,577
No, it comes from the word "guardsman"
in Korean.

139
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,831
When we first met, he protected me.

140
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,126
Finding emotional stability
by connecting with an animal

141
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,753
will help you with your treatment.

142
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,922
Really?

143
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,552
Then what about raising a dog

144
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,263
that's really big and growls viciously?

145
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,557
I'm not sure.

146
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,019
But wouldn't it be hard
to raise a dog like that in an apartment?

147
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,439
I guess that's why someone abandoned it.

148
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,900
I think it's a stray dog.

149
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,073
I know you feel bad for it,
but it could be dangerous.

150
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,368
It's a matter of physical safety,
not just your emotional well-being.

151
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,662
But apparently, that dog

152
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,915
never bites women.

153
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,543
It never bites women?

154
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,175
Next is the dog pose.

155
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,054
When you do the dog pose,
your back could form an arch,

156
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,807
-My gosh.
-focus your weight on your wrists,

157
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,268
have a hard time
placing your entire feet on the ground,

158
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,979
or find it difficult
to keep your legs straight…

159
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,107
I'll be right there. Okay.

160
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,527
My goodness.

161
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,862
What is it this time?

162
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,031
Today, we need to patrol the area--

163
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,533
No, I can't make it today.

164
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,910
What?

165
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,246
Gosh, that's not good.

166
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,374
All the mothers are refusing to go
without the man from Unit 507.

167
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,709
Everyone's nuts about you.

168
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,295
Why is everyone always going nuts?

169
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,256
I'd love to go,

170
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,384
but I'm really busy today.

171
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,762
Gosh, you don't even go to work.
You're even home at this hour.

172
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,848
You're not busy. Come on.

173
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,392
My gosh, I really need to go somewhere.

174
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,810
Do you have a date?

175
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,689
No, it's not that.
I just need to meet someone today.

176
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,442
-Who?
-This guy named Jung U-jin.

177
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,195
He used to be my partner…

178
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,324
-Yes?
-Why am I even telling you this?

179
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,325
What?

180
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,243
And, also,

181
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,912
it's not like you know the guy anyway.

182
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,331
Of course, I don't know him.

183
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,917
You're so hilarious.

184
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,295
-Why do you keep slapping me?
-Is this Unit 507?

185
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,672
-You got a parcel.
-Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

186
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,132
Did you buy something?

187
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,425
It's a shaver.

188
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,761
That was quick.
Things get delivered so fast these days.

189
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,019
Let's take a look.

190
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,354
What is this?

191
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,153
What's this stun gun doing here?

192
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,321
My gosh.

193
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,370
HONGJIK JUNGANG APARTMENT
BUILDING 105, UNIT 506

194
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,624
Gosh, this is for Unit 506.

195
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,174
Here.

196
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,387
I asked you to try not to run into me,
but you keep breaking your promise.

197
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,849
This isn't my fault.

198
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,768
But who said you could open my parcel?

199
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,812
You're doing it again.
It's not like I knew.

200
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,814
I almost died because of this thing.

201
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,608
Why do you buy this kind of stuff?

202
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,860
Why else? I bought it to use it.

203
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,323
It won't do you any good to have that.
You'll end up hurting someone innocent.

204
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,076
What? What do you want?

205
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,537
Get going if you're done here. Go on.

206
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,081
Go away. Go!

207
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,375
My gosh.

208
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,681
PATIENTS
JUNG U-JIN, CHOI JAE-UK

209
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,952
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

210
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,039
Why didn't you come up?

211
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,585
What is the matter with you?
You told me U-jin was a lot better.

212
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,380
Did you go see him?

213
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,009
That is him a lot better.

214
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,017
My gosh.

215
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,227
Do you want some coffee?

216
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,145
No.

217
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,360
It's bad enough that he's injured.

218
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,864
But he's more concerned about paying
for hospitalization and rehab

219
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,741
since it's not covered
by police insurance.

220
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,535
So we tried to gather some money together…

221
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,996
But he was hurt on the job.
Why can't he get insurance?

222
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,123
Why do you think? They don't think

223
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,126
we went there that day for work.

224
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,504
Darn it.

225
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,259
I shouldn't have taken you guys there.

226
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,429
What are you talking about?
Don't blame yourself.

227
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,934
We should've caught Yang that day.

228
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,770
Do you have any updates on him?

229
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,188
You see…

230
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,232
Captain told me not to tell you anything.

231
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,777
You punk. Just tell me.

232
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,279
Well…

233
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,450
He was the reason why we ran into you
at the Hongjik Station the other day.

234
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,996
He's been quiet for a while,

235
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,749
but his products are being sold
on a chatting app these days.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,168
A chatting app?

237
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,963
INTRODUCTION
ICE PRINCESS, FEMALE, 25 YEARS OLD

238
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,508
A bunch of men who sold drugs got caught
luring people to buy drugs

239
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,885
on a chatting app.

240
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,013
And apparently,
they all had Yang's products.

241
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,353
COLA KIM: DO YOU LIKE ALCOHOL WITH ICE?

242
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,271
Okay.

243
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,190
COLA KIM: DO YOU LIKE ALCOHOL WITH ICE?

244
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,193
ICE PRINCESS: YES, DO YOU HAVE ANY?

245
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:32,491
COLA KIM: YES, BUT I WANT A GIRL
WHO'S WILLING TO BE MY SLAVE

246
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,662
ICE PRINCESS:
YES, MASTER. WHEN DID YOU ARRIVE?

247
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,955
COLA KIM HAS LEFT THE CHAT

248
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,834
My gosh.

249
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,544
Is this not how it's done?

250
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,129
MUSCLE KING: DO YOU LIKE ALCOHOL?

251
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,046
Okay.

252
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,966
ICE PRINCESS: YES. DO YOU?

253
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,967
MUSCLE KING: ME TOO

254
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,926
Okay.

255
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,845
ICE PRINCESS: DO YOU HAVE ICE?

256
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,762
MUSCLE KING: OF COURSE

257
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,680
Nice. Okay.

258
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,765
MUSCLE KING:
BUT SHOW ME SOMETHING FIRST

259
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:03,480
MUSCLE KING: SHOW ME YOUR ARMPIT

260
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,899
Why does this lunatic
want to see my armpit?

261
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,285
What a crazy jerk. My gosh.

262
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,494
Gosh.

263
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,836
IMAGE FILE

264
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,255
ICE PRINCESS: WHEN SHOULD WE MEET?

265
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,798
There. Happy?

266
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,843
MUSCLE KING:
SORRY, BUT YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE

267
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,638
Gosh, these disgusting perverts.

268
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,892
Why do these guys have to be so picky?
These damn assholes.

269
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,025
My gosh. Darn it.

270
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,319
Gosh. Now what?

271
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,157
MR STRANGER: DO YOU LIKE ALCOHOL?

272
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,119
ICE PRINCESS:
YES, I'D LIKE TO DRINK WITH YOU

273
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,621
MR STRANGER: DO YOU HAVE ICE?

274
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,290
ICE PRINCESS: I HAVE ICE, DO YOU HAVE ICE?

275
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,920
MR STRANGER: OF COURSE

276
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,589
ICE PRINCESS:
WHICH KIND? I ONLY DO ARNOLD THESE DAYS

277
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,761
MR STRANGER: THIS? YOU KNOW
YOUR STUFF. WHEN SHOULD WE MEET?

278
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,014
ICE PRINCESS: TODAY'S GOOD FOR ME

279
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,184
MR STRANGER: OKAY. 8 P.M. TONIGHT
I'LL TEXT WHERE LATER

280
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
Nice!

281
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,651
No, wait a minute.

282
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,029
I need to be a woman.

283
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,824
What?

284
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,809
May I help you?

285
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,441
We met once before for a short while.

286
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,442
Do you remember me?

287
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,362
Well, in order to punish someone,

288
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,616
you need to prove that the person
has legally damaged others' rights.

289
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,579
I mean, him wearing women's
clothes and makeup

290
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,123
didn't really harm you,

291
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,041
did it?

292
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:37,426
I came to ask you for a favor.

293
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,470
That wasn't me but Samantha.

294
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,223
-Come in.
-Okay.

295
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,442
Yes, thank you.

296
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,905
So you want me to bring out

297
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,156
the Whitney in you?

298
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,037
Right, Whitney. Yes, that's it.

299
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,207
It won't be easy,

300
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,418
but it'll be fun.

301
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,588
Okay, great. Thank you.

302
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,131
Never mind.

303
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,810
But you see,

304
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,773
I don't know if it's okay to ask you this…

305
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,403
Are you going to ask me whether
I'm gay, a pervert, a transvestite,

306
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,155
or a transgender?

307
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,449
Yes.

308
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,787
I gave it some thought,
but I couldn't find the answer.

309
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,665
I just like dressing up as a woman.

310
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,501
I see.

311
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,879
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

312
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,887
Gosh, I didn't know…

313
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,517
-this was such hard--
-Hey, stay still.

314
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,602
Okay.

315
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,826
You're done now. Open your eyes.

316
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,287
MADU STATION, EXIT 3

317
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,583
I've arrived.

318
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes, I'm here too.
Are you the one in front of exit three?

319
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,342
Yes, I guess you see me.

320
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,469
Yes, I'm right here.

321
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,933
Are…

322
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,895
you Ice Princess?

323
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,274
Yes, are you Mr. Stranger?

324
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,109
Yes.

325
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,819
Do you…

326
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:50,035
really have the drug?

327
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,745
Yes, of course.

328
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,789
Ready to have fun?

329
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,041
Yes.

330
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,752
Let's go.

331
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,300
Let's walk a bit faster.

332
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,344
I'm embarrassed.

333
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,679
Me too. Let's go.

334
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,768
You're under arrest for violating the law
against narcotics.

335
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,977
Based on Article 212
of the Criminal Procedure Code…

336
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,270
You are under arrest without a warrant.

337
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,524
You have the right to a lawyer
and can request a legality review…

338
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,275
What? What's going on?

339
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,653
Are you a cop? You're a detective?

340
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,072
Hey, hold him tight.

341
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,824
Let go of me!

342
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,991
He's a detective.

343
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,035
What? What do you mean?

344
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,375
Yes, yes. Okay. Bye.

345
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,756
What did they say?

346
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,217
He's Detective Noh Hwi-oh
from Gangnam Police Station.

347
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,885
He's the Gangnam Mad Dog.

348
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,805
The guy who was on the news
for beating someone up at a brothel.

349
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,100
I heard he was there hoping to catch Yang.

350
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,272
Gosh, he's a total mess.

351
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,067
Can I go now that you've checked?

352
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,403
Well…

353
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,907
I admire how determined you are
to catch Yang so you can clear your name.

354
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,410
So I'll let you go this time.

355
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:18,582
But now that you know
we're in charge of that case,

356
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,252
let's make sure we don't run
into each other again. Okay?

357
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,254
You get what I mean, right?

358
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,008
No, I really don't.

359
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,635
Listen.

360
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,429
It's up to me

361
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,725
whether I make a case of you
attempting to buy drugs or not.

362
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,852
So you'd better lose
that attitude of yours.

363
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:44,024
And what you did today
was an obstruction of justice.

364
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,734
Then go lock me up.

365
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,153
My gosh.

366
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,405
Keep up the good work.

367
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,159
I heard you're getting counseling.

368
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,370
Are you sure you weren't here for drugs?

369
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,499
Gosh, your makeup looks nice.

370
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,293
Keep that look.

371
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,505
Or was it always a personal hobby?

372
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,303
Those are nice legs!

373
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,431
Let's go.

374
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,936
If you ever run into a big dog
or get attacked by one,

375
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,273
you need to wait until it calms down

376
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,734
and protect yourself
from getting attacked.

377
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:33,448
People think they should
turn around and run,

378
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,659
but showing your back could provoke

379
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,371
-the dog's instinct to attack.
-Howi, do you also want a snack? Yes?

380
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,749
So always know that it could be dangerous.

381
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,669
What? There aren't any.

382
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,920
Do not be scared.

383
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,174
And don't ever try to run away.

384
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,596
Howi, wait just a bit. I'll be right back.

385
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:34,759
No, it's not what you think.
I had to be in disguise

386
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,386
for an investigation.

387
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,013
Don't come near me!

388
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,723
It's me in disguise.

389
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,475
What's the matter?

390
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,566
What's wrong?

391
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,362
Do not be scared.

392
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,824
-And don't ever try to run away.
-Get up. Stand up.

393
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,452
Are you okay?

394
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,306
My gosh, you startled me!

395
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,682
What? That's weird.

396
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,809
-Darn you.
-Is it not charged?

397
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,897
It's a pervert!

398
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,899
A pervert is--

399
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,317
Be quiet.

400
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,986
There's a pervert here!

401
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,863
-Help!
-My gosh.

402
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,990
-Everyone!
-Darn it.

403
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,451
Help!

404
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,495
Catch the pervert!

405
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,080
Everyone!

406
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,664
Hey, be quiet!

407
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:28,623
