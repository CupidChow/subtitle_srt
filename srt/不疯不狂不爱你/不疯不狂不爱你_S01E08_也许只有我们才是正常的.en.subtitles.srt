1
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,247
Hey, you're here.

2
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,460
Goodness.

3
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,215
Thanks.

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,968
Why did you suddenly invite me

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,471
over for ramyeon?

6
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,477
Don't you know what it means when a woman

7
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,771
invites you over for ramyeon?

8
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,194
I need to think straight.

9
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,945
Let's use my left brain.

10
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,782
I need to be rational.

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,953
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,749
But I don't fool around with drunk women

13
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,959
or women out of their wits.

14
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,713
I thought you'd fall for it,
but I guess not.

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,508
Eat up. The noodles will get soggy.

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,014
You added too much water.

17
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,560
Will I be able to get out of here alive?

18
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,229
You didn't drug this, did you?

19
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,023
Have a bite and find out.

20
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,027
You can leave behind a dying message
in the corner.

21
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,489
Gosh, don't say that. You're scaring me.

22
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,671
What language was that earlier?

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,715
What?

24
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,800
The swear word?

25
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,344
So you did swear!

26
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,058
It was Mongolian.

27
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,478
I'm going to leave for Mongolia
once I get my key deposit.

28
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,523
I wasn't supposed to leave until later,

29
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,775
but my plans were rushed.

30
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,943
Why Mongolia?

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,696
It has a low population density.

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:42,495
I'm hoping I'll be more comfortable there
since I won't be around as many people.

33
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,252
People apparently love it
when it rains there.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,255
Everyone's happy when it rains.

35
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,510
Why did you invite me over

36
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,805
for ramyeon

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,474
if you're going to leave?

38
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,686
You're a horrible woman.

39
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,357
You're so tacky.

40
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,485
By the way,

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,991
I've never met anyone
who hates the rain as much as I do.

42
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,786
Why do you hate it so much?

43
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,710
Whenever it rains,

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,712
my heart aches a lot more.

45
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,177
Like how it stings
when it seeps into a wound.

46
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,180
It's similar to that.

47
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,600
I finally managed to forget about it,

48
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,604
but it stings and hurts

49
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,440
and aches.

50
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,203
If you think about it,
we're the okay ones.

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,748
It's everyone else who's crazy.

52
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,961
You know how they say crazy people
love the rain?

53
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,380
Well, we don't, right?

54
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,177
That's right. We don't.

55
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,304
We hate it.

56
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,433
Come to think of it, everyone is crazy.
Except us. Don't you agree?

57
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,476
Yes.

58
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,771
You're right.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,440
-The ramyeon tastes good, right?
-Yes.

60
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,651
Should we have another drink?

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,528
I bought them.

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,988
Eat up.

63
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,992
EPISODE 8
MAYBE WE'RE THE ONLY OKAY ONES

64
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,162
Does it suit your taste?

65
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,081
Yes.

66
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,378
-Enjoy your time here.
-Sure.

67
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,005
-Sorry I'm late.
-Have a good one.

68
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,342
Hello, I'm Debrah.
I'll be serving you now.

69
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,980
Does she work everywhere
in this neighborhood?

70
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,529
You dropped this at the makeup store
a few days ago.

71
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,658
Thank you. Have a nice day.

72
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,456
I was the cashier that day.
Don't you remember me?

73
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,167
We met even before that.

74
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,419
That day when the ladies
wouldn't let you go.

75
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,257
I thought you wouldn't recognize me.

76
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,426
Why wouldn't I?

77
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,763
You come by
the convenience store often too.

78
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,266
Of course, you look different
from how you look now.

79
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,978
So you knew.

80
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,941
It's something I picked up
while working a lot of part-time jobs.

81
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,902
Minding my own business.

82
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,073
Especially at the convenience store.
People who turn out to be short of money.

83
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,784
Kids who hand me welfare cards to pay.

84
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,995
People who come back
the day after puking drunk.

85
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,792
And guys who come with different women
every weekend to buy condoms.

86
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,377
There are lots of things to ignore.

87
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,925
How many part-time jobs do you have?

88
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,763
I work at the convenience store,
cosmetics store,

89
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,766
hamburger joint, and this bar.

90
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,768
And sometimes I fill in occasionally.

91
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,978
Is that possible?

92
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,774
Many places hire for short hours,
so they won't have to pay more.

93
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,359
That's why.

94
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,654
That's quite interesting.

95
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,616
That sounded offensive.

96
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,910
What did you mean by that?

97
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,787
No, I didn't mean to offend you.

98
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,415
I've never seen someone with
so many part-time jobs.

99
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,379
And you're the first person
who wasn't startled to see me.

100
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:12,348
Don't you find me strange or scary?

101
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,023
The only thing that scares me is poverty.

102
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,904
By any chance,

103
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,740
if you're ever short on money,

104
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,245
and you need a sister to treat you
to a meal or drinks, let me know.

105
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,663
I can do that for you.

106
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,087
I'm sorry, but that's not necessary.
I prefer paying for my own stuff.

107
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,047
I see.

108
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,180
But who knows?
I might need your help for other things.

109
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,354
Is there anything else you need?

110
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,814
No.

111
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,987
HONGJIK

112
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,675
Gosh.

113
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,479
I had to get a family register
to find out where my daughter lives.

114
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,774
How could you treat your mother like this?

115
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,528
Unbelievable.

116
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,199
You guys live next door,
but I guess you practically live together.

117
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,038
I can't believe I was worried about you
and came all the way here.

118
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,045
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

119
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,422
So why did you come?

120
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,674
Is that all you have to say?

121
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,346
Haven't you gone through
enough nonsense with men?

122
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,141
You keep being so easy. That's why--

123
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,434
What about it?

124
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,352
You always blame me for everything.

125
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,607
You blame me for what I went through
and for living like this, don't you?

126
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,736
Of course, it's your fault.

127
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,322
What? Are you going to
blame that on me too?

128
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,951
So who is this guy?

129
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,578
What do you want to know?

130
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,749
He's a cop. He got dismissed
for having assaulted someone.

131
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,127
He goes to the same clinic as me
for anger management issues.

132
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,379
I asked him to sleep with me
yesterday after some drinks.

133
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,258
Howâ€¦

134
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,262
How could you say that to your own mother?

135
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,601
How is it that you're always
getting involved with guys who are soâ€¦

136
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,145
Can't you live without a man?

137
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,732
I can't.

138
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,027
Then just die, you brat.

139
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,199
Die! Just die, you brat!

140
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,409
We should both kill ourselves today.

141
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,164
Do you know how worried I was?

142
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,458
I never once felt at ease.

143
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,793
Just die! Die!

144
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,129
Cut it out! I'm so sick of this!

145
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,547
Let's die together!

146
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,652
Don't take things to court.
Just put an end to this.

147
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,824
Just settle and get it over with.

148
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,868
If you don't, I will.

149
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,456
You're my mother.

150
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,042
How could you say that?

151
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,755
Can you really forgive him
for what he did to your own daughter?

152
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,885
Or what? Is it because you need money?

153
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,720
Is that why?

154
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,313
Then how long do you plan
to keep living like this?

155
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,983
You always hide and run away.

156
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,694
You can't sleep without pills.

157
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,282
How long are you going to stay home
and make me worry about you?

158
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,328
Take a good look at yourself.

159
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,541
I didn't give birth to you

160
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,002
so you'd waste your life like this.

161
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,338
Why did you give birth to me?

162
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,176
You shouldn't have had me.

163
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,110
Goodness, that horrible brat.

164
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,823
My goodness.

165
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,452
What kind of mother would want
anything bad for her own child?

166
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:07,995
My gosh.

167
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,458
How can she be so harsh?

168
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,002
Goodness, that horrible brat.

169
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,300
My goodness gracious.

170
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,388
Excuse me, ma'am.

171
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,437
Lead the way.

172
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,064
Pardon?

173
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,191
I said lead the way!

174
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,464
Here you go.

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,893
Even normal people lose their minds
when they fall in love.

176
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,520
What are you two thinking?

177
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,897
What do you guys even talk about?

178
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,067
Do you talk about who's crazier
and make suicide pacts?

179
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,946
If you ever look down on her
just because she's mentally unstable,

180
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,156
you're going to regret it.

181
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,203
If anyone hurts my daughter again,

182
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,332
I'll hunt that person down
and tear them into little pieces.

183
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,753
I'll tear out their organs and place them
in different locations. Understood?

184
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,552
Minâ€¦

185
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,097
Minâ€¦ Min-kyung

186
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,226
takes after you a lot.

187
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,646
What does that mean?

188
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,735
You'reâ€¦

189
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,447
very beautiful.

190
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,199
What?

191
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,648
You seeâ€¦

192
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,279
Min-kyung started raising a dog.

193
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,949
What was his name again?

194
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,953
His name is Howi.
He's tiny, but he's pretty feisty,

195
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,413
and he barks a lot.

196
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,335
Howi is there to protect her,
and I'm here for her too.

197
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,586
So don't worry too much.

198
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,798
I mean, I used to be a cop.

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,176
So what if you were a cop?

200
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,598
Cops also drive under the influence,
kill their mistresses, rape women,

201
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,266
and do all sorts of awful things.

202
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,768
What's so great about that?

203
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,232
You do have a point.

204
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,489
Ever since Min-kyung was little,

205
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,283
she was smart but rude.

206
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,373
But she was never this harsh
to her own mother.

207
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,294
I guess it's all my fault.

208
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,967
I didn't trust her
when she went through what she did.

209
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,846
I haveâ€¦

210
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,433
I have trouble trusting people, you see.

211
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,854
But now,

212
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,983
you're the only person

213
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,318
I can trust.

214
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,325
For the first time in my life,

215
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,705
I'm going to take a leap of faith
and trust someone.

216
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,842
Pleaseâ€¦

217
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,931
Please take good care

218
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,851
of my daughter.

219
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,945
Don't trust me too much.

220
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,991
Instead of trusting me,

221
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,370
trust your daughter.

222
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,500
These days,

223
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,877
Min-kyung goes for walks with her dog,

224
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,962
works out,

225
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,507
and goes to the hospital.

226
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,385
She's managing pretty well.

227
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,099
I'm sure she'll endure it all.

228
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,102
So have some faith

229
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,941
and wait until she gets better.

230
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,421
Hey, your mother left.

231
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,758
I see.

232
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,513
By the way,

233
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,934
it rained yesterday,
so I couldn't take Howi out for a walk.

234
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:07,896
I see.

235
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,110
I normally go for walks at 4:00 p.m.

236
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,533
Okay.

237
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:24,913
Yes.

238
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,251
Oh, right. I get it.

239
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,128
You're leaving at 4:00 p.m., right?

240
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,423
Okay. You're going for a walk
at 4:00 p.m. Got it.

241
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,217
Okay. 4:00 p.m.

242
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,599
At 4:00 p.m.

243
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,767
At 4:00 p.m.

244
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,685
At 4:00 p.m.

245
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,651
What?

246
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,534
Howi!

247
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,037
Let's go for a walk.

248
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,289
You should pick one.

249
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,918
It's the Hulk.

250
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,462
He's just like you.

251
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,548
No, he's not.

252
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,634
Stop being absurd.

253
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,638
The Hulk is also a hero.
Don't you know the Avengers?

254
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,893
The Hulk is my favorite hero
out of all of them.

255
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,734
Let me give you a word of advice.

256
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,239
The world looks all gloomy and sad

257
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,576
because you wear such dark sunglasses.

258
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,413
Even celebrities wouldn't wear that.

259
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,624
Here. Try this.

260
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,057
How is it? Is the sky yellow?

261
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,183
Yes.

262
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,768
That's not good.

263
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
Here. Try this one.

264
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,538
Do you see the world in pink?

265
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,835
Obviously. They're pink lenses.

266
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,026
You should buy one for your girlfriend.

267
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,238
Those sunglasses cost over 20,000 won,
but I'll let you have it for 10,000 won.

268
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,448
Okay, sure.

269
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,949
We'll take it.

270
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,078
Thank you.

271
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,628
I'm going to run after I count to five.

272
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,962
Make sure I don't catch up.

273
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,424
You'll eventually catch up.
That always happens.

274
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,095
Try harder this time so you'll beat me.

275
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,847
If you win, I'll give you a gift.

276
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,267
-Really?
-Come on. Get ready.

277
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,228
Setâ€¦

278
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,438
go!

279
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,734
I'm coming!

280
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,698
I'm coming!

281
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,660
I'm about to catch up.

282
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,953
No, you're not!

283
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,960
I'm about to catch up.

284
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,848
Did you see that?
Did you see me sprint at the end?

285
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,060
Now give me my gift.

286
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,312
What a pity.

287
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,857
I could've won.

288
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,568
Oh, well.

289
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,280
Here.

290
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,534
Here's your medal.

291
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,330
What is this?

292
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,003
Will you show up if I blow this whistle?

293
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,842
Whoever hears it will probably show up.

294
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,059
Don't blow on it whenever.

295
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,855
Use it only when you're
in urgent need of help.

296
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,903
Gosh, I just told you not to do that.

297
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,324
Gosh, cut it out.

298
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,076
My goodness.

299
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,667
Who is it?

300
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,128
I'm from the real estate office.

301
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,842
How are you? I brought another customer.
It's okay in the afternoon, right?

302
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,427
Come this way.

303
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,681
The place is very clean.
It's pretty spacious too.

304
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
Come this way.

305
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,685
Isn't it nice?

306
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,480
Look at all this sunlight.

307
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,856
When it's not dark outside,

308
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,151
you don't even need to turn the lights on.
Isn't that right?

309
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,403
I'm not sure.
I always keep the curtains closed

310
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,906
because the other building is
too close with this one.

311
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,201
The air circulates nicely
because of the headwind.

312
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,869
It's great for cooking.

313
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,122
But it gets a bit loud
out in the corridor.

314
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,542
Take a look at the master bedroom.
This way. Yes.

315
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,965
Don't you want to move?

316
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,634
-What did I do?
-My goodness.

317
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,595
What do you think? Nice structure, right?

318
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,599
The veranda is very big.
The air ventilates nicely too.

319
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,601
Come this way.

320
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,104
Did you like it?

321
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,649
-Yes, it's nice and clean.
-You won't find a better place.

322
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,077
Who is it?

323
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,748
I'm the woman who just came
and took a look at the house.

324
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,251
I think I left my cell phone in there.

325
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,753
I'm sorry. Can you let me in?

326
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,340
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,051
I can't believe I left it here.

328
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,555
Why am I always so clumsy?

329
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,432
Oh, here it is.

330
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,310
Goodness, silly me.

331
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,064
Can I ask you something?

332
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,777
The realtor told me you live alone.

333
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,030
But I guess not.

334
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,991
No.

335
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,161
I heard you need to move out urgently?

336
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,246
Why are you moving?

337
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,250
Something came up.

338
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,919
Did you decide where to move?

339
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,130
No.

340
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,216
But why do you ask?

341
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,599
I'm actually Seon-ho's mother.

342
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,951
I wanted to apologize to you face to face.

343
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,246
But you moved and changed your number.

344
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,416
I didn't know how to reach you,
so it took a while.

345
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,127
Listen.

346
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,591
If you want me to get on my knees
and apologize, I will. So please--

347
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,094
I made myself clear
that I'm not willing to settle.

348
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,433
Things just got complicated
between you two.

349
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,937
And it's not like
we're complete strangers.

350
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,731
Don't be so harsh.

351
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,858
I mean, if you think about it,

352
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,362
you dated Seon-ho because you liked him.

353
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,659
What are you doing right now?

354
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,746
If the trial keeps going,
it'll only put a toll on yourself.

355
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,290
I also have a daughter myself.

356
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,503
This is an issue between a married man
and a single woman.

357
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,630
Who do you think will suffer more?

358
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,134
I'm only saying this out of concern.

359
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,344
So why don't you

360
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,139
become my daughter-in-law?

361
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,976
You should marry Seon-ho.

362
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,395
You don't need to prepare anything.

363
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,647
All you need to do is marry him.

364
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,112
So you have a daughter?

365
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,616
I hope your daughter
gets fooled by her boyfriend,

366
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,493
gets cussed at, and beaten up.

367
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,205
And I hope he uses her video
to threaten her too.

368
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,582
I hope

369
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,543
she goes through
everything I went through.

370
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,923
I'm just saying we should
handle this amicably.

371
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,927
Don't you think you've done enough?

372
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,096
Once Seon-ho gets released,

373
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,975
I'll have him apologize on his knees.

374
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,563
I'll make sure he makes up for everything,
so please--

375
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,939
I'll say this one last time.

376
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,442
Don't ever come see me again.

377
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,533
Then tell me.

378
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,246
Why do you want my son in jail so badly?

379
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,791
I didn't take you to be so sly.

380
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,958
Tell me.

381
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,171
I'll pay you
whatever amount of money you ask.

382
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,382
If you ever come see me again,

383
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,676
I'll write a petition

384
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,138
asking for a stronger punishment.

385
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,307
You'd better keep that in mind.

386
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,991
What is it? What's wrong?

387
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,252
You really came.

388
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,715
Are you serious?

389
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,425
Was it for fun again?

390
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,639
This time, it was real.

391
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,934
I really needed your help.

392
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,775
Did something happen?

393
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,034
Will you help me stand up?

394
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,656
I'm no longer going to run.

395
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,659
I'm going to endure it

396
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,704
and overcome it.

397
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,209
I'm going to do it here.

398
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,971
VICTIM OF DATING VIOLENCE
TURNS OUT TO BE A MISTRESS

399
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,143
MS. LEE POCKETED A HEFTY SETTLEMENT,
QUIT HER JOB, MOVED AWAY

400
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,148
MS. LEE STILL ACTS AS IF SHE IS A VICTIM,
WHILE STAYING MOSTLY AT HOME

401
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,234
My goodness.

402
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,821
So that's the unit
that smokes out on the veranda?

403
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,739
I caught you red-handed.

404
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,536
Gosh, that couple is fighting again.

405
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,289
They fight all the time.
I'm amazed they're still together.

406
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,166
How amazing.

407
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:34,132
Why is that person working out at home?
It'll be so noisy for the unit below.

408
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,009
I warned that unit so many times,
but they never listen.

409
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,761
My goodness.

410
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,477
I guess Samantha is coming home
late again.

411
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,105
I wonder if she's out having fun.

412
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:56,070
