1
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,939
My gosh.

2
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,775
What now? Jeez.

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,155
What now? What's up?

4
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,284
What's wrong?

5
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,911
Hey, what's going on?

6
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,121
Are you okay?

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,209
Who are you?

8
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,005
This is a woodwork factory, and there are
lots of dangerous machines.

9
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,674
You can't just break in like this.

10
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,218
You could have been seriously hurt.

11
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,847
I apologize.

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,434
Someone has filed a complaint
about a stench coming from here.

13
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,602
Of course, it smells.

14
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,645
This place is filled with glue and paint.

15
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,399
You don't seem like cops though.

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,653
Right. We are the neighborhood watch.

17
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,696
I apologize.

18
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,240
Sorry.

19
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,742
Please leave now.

20
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,452
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

21
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,667
Once you start getting suspicious,
even a stick would look like a snake.

22
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,212
Well, I was just…

23
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,801
But that place was really suspicious.

24
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,718
I…

25
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,304
There you go again.

26
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,848
You just saw it.
It's a woodworking workshop.

27
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,352
It might be a drug factory
disguised as a workshop.

28
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,731
Okay, ma'am. I'll make sure
to dispatch a police squad there.

29
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,649
Now, shall we?

30
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,611
There's nobody here.

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,700
Gosh, I thought they were cops.

32
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,457
By the way,

33
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,336
I think that woman saw my face.

34
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,965
Hey.

35
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,842
Are you okay?

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,766
Maybe not.

37
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,818
EPISODE 11
CLEAR AFTER RAIN

38
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,975
Baek Jong-woo.

39
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,811
I have something to tell you.

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,814
Do you hear me?

41
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,152
Jong-woo.

42
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,989
We promised.

43
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,285
We promised to stay by each other's side.

44
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,831
Keep your promise.

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,419
Come on! Look at this!

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,505
Open your eyes, Baek Jong-woo!

47
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,008
Look.

48
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,720
I want you to listen to this.

49
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,349
Jong-woo.

50
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,060
Jong-woo, please…

51
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,542
Let's sit here.

52
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,628
-I'll go use the bathroom.
-Okay.

53
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,304
Oh, boy.

54
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,733
Hey.

55
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,110
What's up? Where are you?

56
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,570
I was just around…

57
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,197
Why? Why do you ask?

58
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,992
You're home, right?
I'm in your neighborhood. Come on out.

59
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,285
Let's have a drink.

60
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,080
No, I'm far away from home right now.

61
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,499
Well, I'll call you back.

62
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,542
Talk to you later.

63
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,211
Hello?

64
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,590
What's wrong? What did he say?

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,467
He says he's not home.

66
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,138
He sounded like
he was drinking somewhere alone.

67
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,931
I knew it.

68
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,020
Captain, how did you know?

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,274
-That bastard…
-Unbelievable.

70
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,319
How dare you lie to me.

71
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,862
I got you.

72
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,532
What are you doing here?

73
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,783
You didn't order, right?

74
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
Two chickens and a bottle of soju, please.

75
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,787
Let's have beer. It's more refreshing.

76
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,497
-Three pints of beer too.
-Okay.

77
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,374
Why? Are you going to drink here?

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,834
Aren't you guys busy?

79
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,463
Well, even if we were,
we can't just leave you here alone.

80
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
We can't!

81
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,218
The three of us are finally reunited.
Let's get wasted today. Okay?

82
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,846
What do you mean, "get wasted"?
No, just leave.

83
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,223
I want to have
some quiet alone time today.

84
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,559
Fine. I'm sorry, okay?

85
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,145
Let's just drink it all away.

86
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,522
Can't you see why I did that to you?

87
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,107
I would rather bug you myself

88
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,278
than to watch those bastards from HQ
walk all over you like that.

89
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,196
Yang, that punk--

90
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,532
Yang is not just a small fry
we can lure with a low-level dealer.

91
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,910
The headquarters have been
digging this for ages,

92
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,496
but they haven't seen
hide nor hair of him yet.

93
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,957
Still? After all the bragging?

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,211
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

95
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,088
Do you want to see Yang?

96
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,297
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,967
This is him. Yang.

98
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,181
The waiter? Are you sure?
Do you have evidence?

99
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,683
I only have
circumstantial evidence for now.

100
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,060
That drug dealer told me

101
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,771
that he goes to the bar
Yang tells him to go to

102
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,316
and ask the waiter there to
bring him the kept liquor.

103
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,986
I'm sure I saw Yang
walking into that bar that day,

104
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,404
but then he disappeared into thin air.

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,325
I mean, how does
he slip away like this every time?

106
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,830
So Yang disguises himself as a waiter

107
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,498
to drop off the goods?

108
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,917
And it makes sense
because this waiter ran off

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,087
right before the bust,
and even avoided witness interviews.

110
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,755
So I totally forgot about him.

111
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,091
But later, I found out
he wasn't on the employee list.

112
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,385
Then who is this?

113
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,887
Fine. Then I'll send
the evidence to the head--

114
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,514
Gosh! Do you hear yourself?

115
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,184
Headquarters? Seriously? You don't see
the big picture here, do you?

116
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,228
What picture? I don't get it.

117
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,564
Can't you see what headquarters is doing?

118
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,400
They won't let others investigate
Yang's case.

119
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,152
So once they catch a mule or a dealer,

120
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,279
they would squeeze the names
of some celebrity junkies out of them

121
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,364
and then just wrap it up like that.

122
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,491
Then we can't catch the head honcho.

123
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,535
Can't you see what's happening?

124
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,246
Are they really failing to catch Yang,

125
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,581
or are they avoiding it?

126
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,416
So, the HQ

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,751
is in cahoots

128
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,754
with Yang?

129
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,802
Hey, you're taking this too far.

130
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,137
They can't be that…

131
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,641
I knew it! They're all in this together.

132
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,479
There are some forces within the police
that are in cahoots with the drug cartel.

133
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,190
The corrupt cops have
covered up the case and…

134
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,276
Who was the head of the cartel? Yang?

135
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,945
Yes, they're protecting Yang.

136
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,573
There must have been
some sexual favors and money traded too.

137
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,034
Dark connections! Unjust deals!

138
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,869
Drug cartels! Something like that!

139
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,288
I've seen it in movies.

140
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,582
Who is she?

141
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,043
Okay. Please calm down, ma'am.

142
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,546
I think you made some pretty good points.

143
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,632
This is the Yang-gate.

144
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,718
Until we shed light on the corruption,

145
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,931
we must keep this investigation
confidential.

146
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,143
Maybe they're eavesdropping on us already.

147
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,815
Please don't agree so strongly with me.

148
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,486
You're making my theory sound
much less convincing.

149
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,197
What? What is that supposed to mean?

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,657
Nothing.

151
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,244
Goodness. I didn't know he had company.

152
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,995
Please. Have a seat here.

153
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,830
-Come on.
-Thanks.

154
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,794
We've met before, right?

155
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,004
Yes.

156
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,258
Girlfriend!

157
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,385
You're his girlfriend!

158
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,428
Why haven't you introduced her to us?

159
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,721
Let me get you a drink.

160
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,682
Soju? Beer? What would you like to drink?

161
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,976
I'll have soju.

162
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,185
-Okay.
-Okay.

163
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,146
No, don't. Don't pour her any.

164
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,149
-What's wrong?
-She doesn't take drinks from strangers--

165
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,651
Sure, I'd like some.

166
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,860
Okay.

167
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,239
Now that I see you from up close,
you're very pretty.

168
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,992
Hey! Don't say that.

169
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,909
What? Say what?

170
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,078
Don't compliment her on her looks.

171
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,330
Why? I really do think she's pretty.

172
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,749
You're just trying to be nice, right?

173
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,377
No, I'm not. I mean it.

174
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,422
When I saw you the other day,
I didn't really get a good look.

175
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,882
But now that I see you up close,
you're gorgeous.

176
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,677
Tell me you're a celebrity,
and I'd believe you.

177
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,140
I know you're just being nice,
but thank you.

178
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,267
I'm not just being nice. I mean it.

179
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,060
I have met all his girlfriends,

180
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,022
and you're the prettiest among them all.

181
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,232
You're the most gorgeous.

182
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,696
Hwi-oh may not be so good-looking,

183
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,533
-but he was really popular with girls.
-He sure was.

184
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,703
One of the ladies
from a gambling wives' group

185
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,455
had a big crush on him.

186
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,874
She was let off with a warning,
but she kept getting herself arrested

187
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,084
because she missed him.

188
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,254
We'd let her go, but she would
keep gambling to get herself arrested.

189
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,547
That lady said,

190
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,716
"I can quit gambling,
but not Detective Noh!"

191
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,676
-She caused a scene.
-I remember that.

192
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,636
Right?

193
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,640
-There was that pickpocket too.
-Right! The pickpocket!

194
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,267
-She sent him love letters from prison.
-She did!

195
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,936
She may have been a pickpocket,
but she couldn't steal his heart.

196
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,857
It's all over now,
so tell us what actually happened.

197
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,193
You dated that pickpocket
for a while, right?

198
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,111
She was kind of your type. Am I right?

199
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,280
Hey.

200
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,121
You see, this doesn't mean Hwi-oh is

201
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,706
one of those playboys.

202
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,042
He's right. He didn't even have
any time to see girls.

203
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,544
He practically lived in the station.

204
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,965
He snored all the time
sleeping on the couch.

205
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,385
Now that I don't hear the snoring,

206
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,762
it feels so empty at the station.

207
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,848
How could you tease me about snoring,
when you snore yourself?

208
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,603
Well, your snoring
was on a different level.

209
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,146
I thought you were really dead.

210
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,622
Where did I put my lighter?

211
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,500
Hey, aren't you going to smoke?

212
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,044
I quit smoking.

213
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,422
You can't quit smoking.
It's just holding out.

214
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,048
You should smoke again.
It'll taste even better.

215
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,884
Trust me. It's delicious.

216
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,678
Can't you see Jong-dae all alone?

217
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,595
Come on.

218
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,362
He's crazy.

219
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,625
Wait. You're even wearing
matching clothes!

220
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,169
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Isn't it?

221
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,211
Will you stop?

222
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,298
Are you playing innocent now?
There's evidence, Detective Noh.

223
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,216
You sly bastard!

224
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,427
You had plenty of free time,
despite being crazy!

225
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,720
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,473
Gosh, I envy you. I really do.

227
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,432
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

228
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,058
Look at him laughing.

229
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,477
Why does he look so happy?

230
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,271
He's completely trash!

231
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,064
You sneaky bastard!

232
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,192
You sneaky little…
Drinks are on you, jerk.

233
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,154
They were talking nonsense.
They must have been drunk.

234
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,865
What did Won-cheol say earlier?

235
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,492
You were laughing.

236
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,745
Well, he said

237
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,747
you were crazy.

238
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,918
What a long conversation you had
over such a trifle.

239
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,338
I got what he was trying to say though.

240
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,173
He meant you're a good person.

241
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,260
You don't believe what others say anyway.

242
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,262
You said you didn't believe others.

243
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,680
That's not true. I do.

244
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,724
Because we're allies.

245
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,062
By the way, the man in the photo earlier.
That Yang?

246
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,773
Doesn't he look familiar?

247
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,196
I think I saw him yesterday
at that drug factory.

248
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,492
It wasn't a drug factory,
it's a woodwork factory, ma'am.

249
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,118
I really did!

250
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,287
How did he look?

251
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,373
He was blond and--

252
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,041
And had two eyes and one nose?

253
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,419
Did you forget
that you once called me a sex offender?

254
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,171
Gosh.

255
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,674
Come on, I believed you.

256
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,967
But you don't believe me.

257
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:09,265
By the way,
did you really date the pickpocket?

258
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,768
No way. I didn't.

259
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,271
Why not? They said she was your type.

260
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,982
What's your type?

261
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,609
Gosh, I said I didn't date her.

262
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,405
Then tell me. What's your type?

263
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,615
My type?

264
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,412
I like the type
who has a flower behind her ear

265
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,040
and has minor character flaws.

266
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,919
That's my type.

267
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,353
It also scares me a bit

268
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,356
that I have someone who's on my side.

269
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,821
Because when that person is
not on my side anymore,

270
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,992
I will really be alone then.

271
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,455
It scared me

272
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:20,294
when she said she believed
I was a good cop and a good person.

273
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,591
I'm afraid I might mess it all up again.

274
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,847
But I'm just going to trust him.

275
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,059
So this time,
I sincerely want to be better.

276
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,270
I want to be a good cop and a good person.

277
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,480
Because doing that is

278
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,608
easier than not doing so.

279
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,610
Do you…

280
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
think I can do it?

281
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,539
DOCTOR'S NOTE

282
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,291
I also believe

283
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,459
that you can do it.

284
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,672
You said you needed a doctor's note
to get your job back, right?

285
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,304
Hey.

286
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,182
Hey, where are you?
Captain wants you to come in now.

287
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,809
What? Now?

288
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,104
No, I have an important appointment later.

289
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,439
What's more important than cases to a cop?

290
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,024
Now, get moving!

291
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,360
You said I wasn't a cop.

292
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,536
There he is!

293
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,623
Why did you abuse your girlfriend
so brutally?

294
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,959
Did you know the victim died
while being treated?

295
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,210
Why did you do that?

296
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,753
Move!

297
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,338
I said, move!

298
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:56,098
Horrible dating violence cases are
occurring every day.

299
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,686
What are the characteristic features
of the perpetrators?

300
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,857
When we think of perpetrators
of dating violence,

301
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,028
we picture people who have
anger issues or sociopathic traits,

302
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,114
but in most cases, they are rather
successful people in society

303
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,199
and they don't show

304
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,953
any propensity for violence around others
outside of a relationship.

305
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,955
They commit violence

306
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,917
only towards those whom
that they deem weak,

307
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,461
which shows how vile they are.

308
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,715
They don't see their partners
as equal beings

309
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,008
but as their possession.

310
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,596
Due to their low self-esteem,
they cannot take rejections…

311
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,764
Hey, do you think I'm a joke?

312
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,350
…they take rejections personally,

313
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,895
which leads to dating violence.

314
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,066
I see. It looks like we need
a harsher punishment for these crimes.

315
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,778
Ms. Kang Jeong-a, how are these
crimes dealt with in reality?

316
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:55,365
According to data, only 4.4 percent
of the reported perpetrators

317
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,786
have been actually arrested
during the past three years.

318
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,499
Unfortunately,
the punishments are slaps to the wrists.

319
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,042
Though he was given
a conditional discharge,

320
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,003
I wasn't sure if he could be bailed
without a settlement.

321
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,049
But luckily, paying the deposit
seems to have been seen

322
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,550
as your will to help the victim recover.

323
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,219
I know.

324
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,180
It all worked out, just like you said.

325
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,225
Gosh.
Now I can finally get some sound sleep.

326
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,769
Now, we need to prepare
for the appeal thoroughly.

327
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:29,399
Assault is one thing, but
what's problematic is the illegal filming.

328
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,236
It's against the act on sexual violence

329
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,239
and the victim doesn't seem
to be willing to settle.

330
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,532
This is not a good situation for us.

331
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,536
But, our law firm
specializes in sexual crimes,

332
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,995
so we have the know-how.

333
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,166
We believe
you can sort this out too, Ms. Kang.

334
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,418
I can pay as much as--

335
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,879
We will talk about that later.

336
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,674
We have a lot to prepare.

337
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,135
This is kind of like a package

338
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,929
to create the proof of how sorry he is.

339
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,889
First, you'll have to write
a letter of apology.

340
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,600
Three copies for the police,
two for the prosecution,

341
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,935
and two for the victim.

342
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,855
Do we have to write that ourselves?

343
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,525
We can set you up with a professional
ghostwriting agency if you want.

344
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,777
They're quite famous in the business.

345
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,362
I'm sure it will be of much help.

346
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,283
And a petition, a sex education
program certificate and a report,

347
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,201
proof of donation
to any women's organization,

348
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,703
a certificate of community service,

349
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,664
a pledge for organ donation,
counseling records--

350
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,957
I don't need all that.

351
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,750
I'll take care of it.

352
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,962
Where are you going?
Ms. Kang isn't finished talking.

353
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,255
Mr. Lee.

354
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,384
You do know the conditions
for your release, right?

355
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,597
You must stay away from the victim.

356
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,932
Wouldn't it be better for you?

357
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,225
You'll make more money.

358
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,308
Gosh.

359
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,978
Here. Look what's written there.

360
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,399
My. Goodness.

361
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,236
You've been taking good care of my seat.

362
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,864
You're not that bad, after all.

363
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,325
It's been a while.

364
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,079
Are you sure the doctor isn't a quack?

365
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,374
Come on. Stop suspecting everything.

366
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,210
All right. Here's your coffee.

367
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,129
You know what to do, right?

368
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,548
Stay out of trouble

369
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,885
until your appeal is reviewed, okay?

370
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,096
And stay away from the police station.

371
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,391
That was my plan
but then you called me here.

372
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,517
Why did you call me?

373
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,727
Right. I called you over.

374
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,479
Well…

375
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,442
Headquarters is nagging us to hand over
everything we have on Yang.

376
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,653
What? Our investigation records?

377
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,365
Didn't they say what I did
wasn't an investigation?

378
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,950
What are they saying?

379
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,869
What are these punks up to?

380
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,746
Obviously…

381
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,833
they realized
they can't catch Yang like this,

382
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,421
so they're trying to find
any lead that might help.

383
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,175
Or maybe they're curious about
how much I know, those bastards.

384
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,427
Wait.

385
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,846
Did you tell them? Are you one of them?

386
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,014
What are you saying?

387
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,390
I mean, isn't it strange?

388
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,184
How on earth did HQ know
that I have Yang's photo?

389
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,396
Why do they suddenly
want our investigation records?

390
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,981
I remember what you said before.

391
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,776
You said something about transferring
the evidence to headquarters.

392
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,777
You heard him too.

393
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,404
Are you suspecting me now?

394
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,364
Well, who knows?

395
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,034
How can I trust anyone in this situation?

396
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,201
Anyway, tell them

397
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,829
I didn't do an investigation,
so I don't have anything.

398
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm not giving anything
to those shady bastards.

399
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,293
So you did see a quack.

400
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,504
You know how intuitive I am.

401
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,716
My gut feeling is telling me
that something shady is going on.

402
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,594
These punks must be up to something.

403
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,181
I know it all too well.
And I also know you lost it a while ago.

404
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,851
Check this out before you say anything.

405
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,981
-What is that?
-What?

406
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:38,940
What is it?

407
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,944
Gosh, he looks hideous.

408
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,987
Is he even human?

409
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,031
-What is it?
-Come here and look.

410
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,115
Look at that.

411
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,494
OFFICER OF THE MONTH
INSPECTOR WOO DO-HOON

412
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,538
OF NARCOTICS AND WHITE-COLLAR
CRIMES UNIT TEAM ONE

413
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,880
INSPECTOR WOO IS A VETERAN NARCOTICS AGENT
WHO ARRESTED 325 DRUG OFFENDERS

414
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,006
THE MOST DRUG ARRESTS IN THE COUNTRY

415
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,309
And what you did today
was an obstruction of justice.

416
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,270
A drug dealer? Who are you talking about?

417
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,441
We're here from Yeongsan Police Station
to investigate ongoing prostitution!

418
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,864
Hey, Jong-dae.

419
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,867
Could you take a look at the case files
of the case

420
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,411
Yeongdong's Violent Crimes Team Four
was in charge of?

421
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,830
All of those that are related to drugs.

422
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,914
-Now.
-All of a sudden?

423
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,165
Come on. Hurry.

424
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,376
Why? Is it another hunch?

425
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,721
Gosh.

426
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,183
Look at the time.

427
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,854
Hello.

428
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,856
Hey, did you forget?

429
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,609
I got an urgent call from the station
and I totally forgot.

430
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,572
But I made arrangements first.

431
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,701
What's up though?
Did something happen again?

432
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,621
Did you catch Yang?

433
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,959
Okay. I'll call you right back. Okay?

434
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,671
Hello?

435
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,214
Hello?

436
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,598
PERSONAL DETAILS
HAN PIL-HEE

437
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,933
CHARGE: ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF NARCOTICS
NAME: HAN PIL-HEE

438
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,768
Wait a minute.

439
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,454
Han Pil-hee?

440
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,164
Han Pil-hee?

441
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,625
-It's him, right?
-It's him.

442
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,336
Han Pil-hee is Yang.

443
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,837
What are you still doing here?

444
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,091
Hey, check this out.

445
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,511
Tell me. Do you still think I lost it?

446
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,557
What was that?

447
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,104
Hold on.

448
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,486
Howi, wait up!

449
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,074
Howi!

450
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,409
Howi.

451
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,871
Howi!

452
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,791
Howi!

453
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,074
Howi!

454
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,159
Howi!

455
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,039
Howi!

456
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,958
Howi!

457
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,460
Howi!

458
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,339
Howi!

459
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,926
Howi!

460
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,476
Howi!

461
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,146
So to sum it up,

462
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,317
Han Pil-hee, also known as Yang.

463
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,360
He's the head of
a nation-wide drug cartel.

464
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,490
Five years ago, Yang was arrested
for possession and distribution of drugs.

465
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,827
But during the investigation, his charge
was amended to recreational use.

466
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,038
The indictment on him was suspended,
and he was released.

467
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,123
And Yeongdong Police Station's
Violent Crimes Team Four

468
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,959
was in charge of this case.

469
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,630
And Yeongdong's Violent Crimes Team Four

470
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,967
arrested all the junkies in this country,

471
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,763
setting a record for the highest arrest
rate for narcotics-related offenses.

472
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,056
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

473
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,226
Hey, let's see.

474
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,353
Let's see.

475
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,645
How about Ji-won?

476
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,980
He knows his stuff.

477
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,608
We can only assume
that Yang had his sentence commuted

478
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,527
by selling some junkies' names,
from the circumstantial evidence.

479
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,031
None of the case files mention
his contribution.

480
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,991
It sounds like
it was a pretty successful deal.

481
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,494
It makes sense. Continue.

482
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,747
After that, Yang has never been
involved in drug-related investigations,

483
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,624
let alone witness interviews.

484
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,961
Yeongdong's Violent Crimes Team Four
arrested numerous junkies since then,

485
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,005
rising through the ranks.

486
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,511
Then one day,
when Yang was about to be caught

487
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,262
while giving the drugs to the VIPs,

488
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,975
the wonderful people from Yeongdong's
Violent Crimes Unit showed up again.

489
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,935
Hey, Mr. Park.

490
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,938
Detective Noh is here. What do we do now?

491
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,565
-Right.
-Come on. Hurry over.

492
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,902
-Yes?
-Hey, Han-pil.

493
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,821
Okay.

494
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,656
Damn it.

495
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,368
Did you call him?

496
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,413
Gosh! Hurry up!

497
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,790
The three evil, corrupted,
and depraved cops…

498
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,042
We're here from Yeongsan Police Station
to investigate ongoing prostitution!

499
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,419
Noh Hwi-oh?

500
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,170
They helped Yang flee,

501
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,967
hurt, defamed, and trampled over me,
a good cop,

502
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,970
and eventually stopped
our investigation on Yang.

503
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:48,601
So Yeongdong's Violent Crimes Unit
Team Four was in cahoots with Yang?

504
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,687
Precisely, Won-cheol! I mean, Captain.

505
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,189
Now you're looking at the big picture.

506
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,734
Those punks have missed one thing though.

507
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,319
This good cop

508
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,905
doesn't know when to give up.

509
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,949
Those bastards can never beat me.

510
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,244
-Let's catch Yang.
-Let's do it.

511
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,037
Let's catch those bastards.

512
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,164
Delivery!

513
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,582
Hey, Noodles.

514
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,959
Detective Noh, are you finally back?

515
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,753
Now, I'm just hanging out.

516
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,880
Come on. This isn't a playground.

517
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,215
I miss your noodles sometimes.

518
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,888
Wait. Who are those guys?

519
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,264
Hey, hey, hey. Don't look.

520
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,808
It's okay. Let him see it.
Take a look. Show him.

521
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,268
Here. Take a look.

522
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,853
You never know.

523
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,106
Howi!

524
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,359
Howi!

525
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,407
Howi.

526
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,204
Howi!

527
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,541
Howi, wake up!

528
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,891
Thanks.

529
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,409
OPERATING

530
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,977
Howi is--

531
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,305
Hwi-oh, that punk,

532
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,309
may look crazy,
but he's different when he works.

533
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,854
Sometimes, he just loses it
when he has to catch a criminal.

534
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,315
Then he becomes a complete nut.

535
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,775
Whenever someone shouts, "Get him!",

536
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,069
he's the first one to go.

537
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,280
I see.

538
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,076
That's why he's called "Mad Dog".

539
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,289
Just like a mad dog,
once he bites something, he never lets go.

540
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:04,839
