1
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,516
What? "A crazy jerk"?

2
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,560
If I'm crazy, what does that make you?

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,355
You crazy little…
My gosh! You crazy… Seriously!

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,273
Crazy what?

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,238
Seriously! My gosh!

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,700
Never mind. Just forget it.

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,827
Fine. I get it now.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,538
Fine. We don't need to talk
about this anymore.

9
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,957
The offer is off the table.
We're at war now.

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,168
You've rejected my generous offer,

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,379
and you're going to regret it for life.

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,340
You'd better withdraw all the money
from your savings if you have any

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,634
and sell all the valuables
you have at home. Why?

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,887
Because I'm going to be rich
with the settlement money.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,640
Habitual blackmailing.

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,102
Evidence One.

17
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,565
Let's go.

18
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,740
Apparently, that woman is famous.

19
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,742
She says stuff like
someone's stalking her,

20
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,494
someone's spying on her,

21
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,871
the gas is leaking,
there's a spy camera somewhere…

22
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,249
Well, I heard something happened to her
the other day.

23
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,960
What on earth happened to her?

24
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,047
Was she dispatched
to Afghanistan or something?

25
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,862
Crazy X in Unit 506
with the flower in her hair.

26
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,366
What the…

27
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,622
What?

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,751
Crazy bastard in Unit 507
with anger issues.

29
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,255
God damn it!

30
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,464
HATE THE TONE-DEAF SINGER NEXT DOOR

31
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,382
WILL MY SENSITIVE
DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR EVER MOVE OUT?

32
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,800
MY UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR
IS BANGING AROUND AGAIN

33
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,093
I WILL MOVE OUT
AND BE YOUR UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR!

34
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,096
YOU ARE BOTH MAD

35
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,564
SPEAK MONGOLIAN
MASTER MONGOLIAN IN 30 DAYS

36
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,732
LESSON 3. EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

37
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,318
I cannot move.

38
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,697
"I cannot move."

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,115
I cannot move.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,617
"I cannot move."

41
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,536
Help me.

42
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,079
"Help me."

43
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,539
Help me.

44
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,082
"Help me."

45
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,001
Call the police.

46
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,919
"Call the police."

47
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,880
Call the police.

48
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,631
"Call the police."

49
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,135
Help. Please, help me.

50
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,807
Help. Please, help me.

51
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,688
HELP! PLEASE, HELP ME!

52
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,919
EPISODE 3
HELP ME

53
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:51,189
The residents here hear
the sound of eerie laughter every day,

54
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,733
which makes them anxious.

55
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,988
And the residents ended up
calling the police.

56
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,117
The laughing sound that has been
terrifying the entire neighborhood was

57
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,537
the neighbor living next door.

58
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,234
Someone calls out for help,
breaking the peace one quiet afternoon.

59
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,903
Is there a fire?

60
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,365
But strangely enough,
no one is responding to the call.

61
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,368
She says someone's spreading
some toxic gas.

62
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,662
I can't live because of the smell!

63
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,290
The old lady beats the pot the entire day.

64
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,044
What has happened to her?

65
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,550
So the valve was closed.

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,219
The gas alarm didn't ring either.

67
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,805
What if there was a hole on the hose?

68
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,807
What if someone outside spread the gas?

69
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,895
What if I didn't know the alarm was broken
and lit a lighter?

70
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,565
But you don't smoke, Min-kyung.

71
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,150
So why would you light a lighter?

72
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,319
I might want to start smoking.

73
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:24,407
And my pajamas often
cause a lot of static.

74
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,994
If the static makes a spark
when I'm asleep…

75
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,955
Fine.

76
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,085
Rather than relying on probabilities,
why don't you trust yourself?

77
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,923
As far as I know,
you care about safety more than anyone,

78
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,967
have a sensitive nose,

79
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,678
and always check your gas valve.

80
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,013
Am I wrong?

81
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,808
"I checked it's okay.

82
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,353
Even if something dangerous happens,
I can cope with it well."

83
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,397
If you believe in yourself,

84
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,525
you won't have to be
as anxious as you are now.

85
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,451
What is the memory
that haunts you the most?

86
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,788
The memory that keeps you
from trusting yourself.

87
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,590
Min-kyung.

88
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,051
The memories that haunt me the most

89
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,971
are the memories when I was happy.

90
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,061
He was always by my side.

91
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,607
I laughed a lot.

92
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,110
I was loved

93
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,278
and was happy.

94
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,572
I was sure of that then.

95
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,453
Those memories won't leave my head

96
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,081
and haunt me.

97
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,876
I can't

98
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,671
trust myself any more.

99
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,134
FEELS EMPTY AND DEPRESSED
AFTER BREAKING UP

100
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,637
How do you feel about him now?

101
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,348
Do you still miss him?

102
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,982
I wish…

103
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,447
he would die.

104
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,077
I hope he struggles, begs, cries,

105
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,915
and fights for his life,
then tries to escape, gets caught again,

106
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,086
and ends up dying
in the most painful way possible.

107
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,099
NOTICE

108
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,768
A PERVERT IN A BLACK RAINCOAT HAS
BEEN SPOTTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

109
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,146
EXPOSING HIMSELF.
PLEASE TAKE CARE AND CALL THE POLICE.

110
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,440
HONGJIK JUNGANG APARTMENT
WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION

111
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,827
What the…

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,497
Who's doing that?

113
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,668
Gosh!

114
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,794
Who is it?

115
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,755
Hurry and open the door.

116
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,800
See? I told you he's home.

117
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,724
You could have just assumed I wasn't home,
since I wasn't answering for so long.

118
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,352
Who are you?

119
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,355
Don't you know us?

120
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,525
We are from the Hongjik Jungang Apartment
Women's Association.

121
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,443
I'm the president. And she is…

122
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,321
-I'm the vice president. And she is…
-I'm the account manager.

123
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,368
We are the ones who decorated the flower
garden in front of the apartment

124
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,372
and installed the air-conditioner
in the security guards' office.

125
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,124
In short, we are the people

126
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,961
who deal with all the matters
of this apartment building.

127
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,548
Right. I appreciate your hard work.
So what's the matter?

128
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,175
I heard you're not working at the station.

129
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,760
Pardon?

130
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,263
Come on. I know everything.
There's nothing to be surprised.

131
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,100
I want you to go out on patrol
later in the evening with us,

132
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,143
the women's association
neighborhood watch.

133
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,397
Well, I'm a bit under the weather today.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,692
Come on, young man.
Don't be such a crybaby.

135
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,361
That's because you don't exercise.
So why don't you just…

136
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:34,615
Thank you,
but I can take care of myself just fine.

137
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,286
Come on. Do some volunteer work
while you're on hiatus.

138
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,705
Who knows? This might
somehow benefit you later.

139
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,999
No, I'm good. Bye.

140
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,083
Come on.

141
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,755
You know your salary
comes out of our taxes.

142
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,341
Are you really going to just
sit back with arms crossed

143
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,219
when some pervert is stalking
the neighborhood half-naked?

144
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,555
What if I am?

145
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,016
And I pay taxes too.

146
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,436
And we know that too.

147
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,273
Still, it would be nice to have
someone like a cop with us

148
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,150
so that we look better.

149
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,235
And…

150
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,573
it's really scary patrolling at night
with just us women.

151
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,367
It's so dangerous these days.

152
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,372
So why would you ladies go on patrol
in the first place?

153
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,541
-Jeez.
-Come on.

154
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,877
By the way, are you and your wife
both working?

155
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,880
What? I'm single.

156
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,381
Don't spread such rumors.

157
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,302
Yeah? Didn't he say he was married
when he moved in?

158
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,970
Isn't that the lady from Unit 506?

159
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,180
Wait.

160
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,350
You took home the dog from
the recycling station with you, right?

161
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,976
Yes.

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,978
With so many cars, it seemed dangerous.

163
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,730
You've done it again.

164
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,315
Are you the owner?

165
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,192
No way.

166
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,944
I'm the president
of the women's association here.

167
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,404
-And I'm the vice president.
-I'm the account manager.

168
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,031
I see.

169
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,408
I guess you didn't know about the dog
because you're new here.

170
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,910
That dog doesn't have an owner.

171
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,579
It's been living at the recycling station
for months now.

172
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,831
The people felt bad for it, so they fed it

173
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
and made a house out of cardboard boxes.

174
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,796
We didn't take the dog to the shelter
because we didn't want it euthanized.

175
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,882
That's how kind the people here are.

176
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,593
An apartment like this
should be more expensive.

177
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,637
So are you going to keep the dog?

178
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,472
Well…

179
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,849
If you want to have a dog
in this apartment,

180
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,976
-you need to report it.
-To the administrative office.

181
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,562
Yes, there.
I just wanted to tell you that.

182
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,772
Okay?

183
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,607
-Okay.
-Good.

184
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,861
Right!

185
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,614
Make sure to come out
later this evening, okay?

186
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,825
-I'll be waiting.
-It's a promise.

187
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,600
Do the lights come on?

188
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,310
-Check if it works.
-Look at the color.

189
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,603
It's working.

190
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,688
Oh, my.

191
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,315
-It's working.
-Gosh.

192
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,234
-Are we all here?
-Yes!

193
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,571
Hey, you're here!

194
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,782
Hurry and put the vest on.
Come on. Put this on.

195
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,826
I think I should just go home.

196
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,327
-No.
-Come on.

197
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:30,207
Don't be like that. Look.
Can't you see their eyes sparkling?

198
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,919
We are all excited and nervous
to have a wonderful detective with us.

199
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,212
The best violent crimes detective.

200
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,340
-Mr. Detective!
-Mr. Detective!

201
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,426
-Mr. Detective!
-Mr. Detective!

202
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,762
I'm not going to put that hat on though.

203
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,558
-Okay. No hat.
-You don't have to wear the hat.

204
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,643
-You look great.
-It fits you perfectly.

205
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,353
So what do you want me to do now?

206
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,398
Well, teach us what to do while we walk.

207
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,150
We will do just as you say.

208
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,611
-Yes! How nice!
-That's great!

209
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,655
Why isn't the housing price rising?

210
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,909
-Is it that bad?
-We still need to pay attention to it.

211
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,018
If you keep doing this,
I'll talk to this detective here.

212
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,728
Please return home safely. Bye.

213
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,897
-Sir!
-Oh, my.

214
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,567
Hey! Aren't you students?
You can't be smoking here!

215
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,195
-One, two, three! Gosh!
-Pick up the cigarettes.

216
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,199
-Hurry and go. Don't smoke again, okay?
-But we can't just let them go like this.

217
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,951
What do we do then? Arrest them?

218
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,248
-Gosh, I'm so hungry.
-It looks delicious.

219
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
What should I order?

220
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,430
Ms. Lee.

221
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,228
Hi! It's been such a long time.

222
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,022
I see that you were eating.

223
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,192
-Ji-eun.
-Do you live around here?

224
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,821
-Yes.
-Have you been doing all right?

225
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,197
Yes.

226
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,201
I came to have dinner with my friends
after working out.

227
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,456
Well, then, enjoy your meal.
I'll see you around.

228
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,920
What should we order?

229
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,674
Chungmu gimbap and…

230
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,259
How about we order sushi instead?

231
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,771
Ji-eun, I'm leaving now.

232
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,981
Okay.

233
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,608
Bye, Ms. Lee.

234
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,694
Who is she?

235
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,945
I know her from work.

236
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,248
She's the woman from work
I told you about.

237
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,877
The one who dated a married man
and got fired?

238
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,170
Yes.

239
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,507
She acted like she was all that,
acting snobbish, but in the end,

240
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,426
she was being shady stuff in secret.

241
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,471
Women like her are the scariest.

242
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,349
-She's right.
-You know what's the creepiest?

243
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,601
She even bragged
that she was marrying soon.

244
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,563
She tried to wreck a home
and marry the married man?

245
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,856
How creepy.

246
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,984
-It's okay.
-I think this is harder than yoga.

247
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,112
That's true. But it feels so good.

248
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,115
But she doesn't seem to be doing well.

249
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,534
No wonder.

250
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,119
Why? What happened?

251
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,289
Well, that married man…

252
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,301
Ms. Lee.

253
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,886
Good morning.

254
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,889
-What would you recommend?
-Well, their latte is good and…

255
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,766
-Really?
-But their black coffee is the best.

256
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,104
Ms. Lee, you have a guest.

257
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,105
What?

258
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,911
You're a pretty girl.

259
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,414
And you work for a good company.

260
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,250
So why do you have to see a married man?

261
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,919
Did he say

262
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,923
that the building, the house,
and the car are all his?

263
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,469
This is just hilarious.

264
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,307
If I make that punk penniless,
will you take him?

265
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,184
You don't want that, right?

266
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,733
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

267
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,737
I heard you and Seon-ho

268
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,489
were divorced.

269
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
And you believed that?

270
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,124
Then I have nothing more to say.

271
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,628
If I was mistaken,
splash that on my face and leave.

272
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,009
What's wrong? You can't do that, right?

273
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,390
Because you knew he was married
but still decided to see him.

274
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,394
How dare you say
with that innocent face of yours

275
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,021
that you thought we were divorced?

276
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,298
Do you know what kind of women
married men cheat with?

277
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,679
Those from lowly families who can't do
anything to speak up for themselves.

278
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,808
Know your place.

279
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,613
We need to talk.

280
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,448
Let go.

281
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,387
Why didn't you answer the phone?

282
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,222
I kept calling you.

283
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,354
What did she tell you?

284
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,274
I told you she's crazy.

285
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,073
Whatever it is she said,

286
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,660
you have to believe me.

287
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,580
Why?

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,293
Are you worried she might have
said something? Is that why you came?

289
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,755
She said you were married.

290
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,800
She said your car, your house,
and everything you own

291
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,971
didn't belong to you.

292
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,642
Is that what she said?

293
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,935
Do you believe that?

294
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,482
If you think about it, it was so obvious.

295
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,111
I've always wondered who would
believe such lies, but it was me.

296
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,867
I pretended to be so smart and all.

297
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,744
It serves me right, doesn't it?

298
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,663
What are you saying?

299
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,666
Is that all?

300
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,001
Now that I'm poor,
do you see me differently?

301
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,920
Is this who you really are?

302
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,006
That's right.

303
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,929
The fact that you're poor
is much worse than you being married.

304
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,848
Do you have anything more to say?

305
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,353
I told you she's crazy. We're divorced.

306
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,355
Is that so?

307
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,856
Should I call and ask her?

308
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,317
Min-kyung.

309
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,737
Come on, what's wrong with you?
I said we're divorced.

310
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
I don't even know her number.

311
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,583
Are you happy now?

312
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,533
I guess you already forgot

313
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,286
how deeply in love we used to be.

314
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,495
Damn it.

315
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,919
Learn how to drive, you idiot!

316
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,379
How dare you try to cut in
with that lame car.

317
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,590
If you had hit my car, you would have
had to sell more than just your organs,

318
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,841
you poor bastard!

319
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,718
What a bastard.

320
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,852
Hey.

321
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,231
When did you film that?

322
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,526
Could you please delete them?

323
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,112
Why did you laugh earlier?

324
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,615
You'd better fix that habit.

325
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,660
Looking down and mocking people.

326
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,830
Do you know how dirty that makes one feel?

327
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,212
Okay, I'm sorry. So please…

328
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,172
I said it wasn't true.

329
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,508
I told you it wasn't true, but why?

330
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,885
Why won't you listen to me?

331
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,513
Hey, do you think I'm a joke?

332
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,765
Tell me. Why aren't you saying anything?

333
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,393
Answer me! I said, answer me.

334
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,938
Go on like you did back there,
you crazy bitch.

335
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,898
-I'm sorry.
-Answer me.

336
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,941
I said, answer me.

337
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,360
-Answer. Hey.
-I'm so sorry.

338
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,736
Are you ignoring me?

339
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,573
It's because
you look down on me like that.

340
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,532
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,449
Damn it!

342
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,637
She's coming out now.

343
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,641
-Hello.
-Hey.

344
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,186
He'll be joining us today.

345
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,479
He's my partner.

346
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,357
Hi.

347
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,692
Let's go now.

348
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,902
Come on.

349
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,573
So, she was on her way home

350
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,409
and that pervert showed up
and did all that.

351
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,621
But he hasn't been caught yet.
How scary is that?

352
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,750
So the neighborhood watch
is walking her home safely.

353
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,751
I appreciate it.

354
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:08,465
You see, this man is
a violent crimes detective.

355
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,718
He may be not in the best place right now,

356
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,970
but you don't need to worry anymore.

357
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,098
I mean, there's no reason
to be scared of that punk.

358
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,350
Well…

359
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,061
Actually, this is why…

360
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,604
What?

361
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,236
Gosh, my eyes!
What is this? Take a look at this.

362
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,278
Goodness.

363
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,489
What the…

364
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:37,118
What's this?
Why haven't you deleted this yet?

365
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,247
Well, I took this photo
because I was startled,

366
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,083
but now I'm scared
he might show up again because of this.

367
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,543
What a weirdo.

368
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,461
Hey.

369
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,922
What? Really?

370
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,881
Where?

371
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,591
Okay!

372
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,719
They say they just caught the pervert.

373
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,888
-The pervert?
-Let's go. They caught him.

374
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,099
-We need to hurry. Let's go now.
-Where?

375
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,854
Where is he?

376
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,439
What's happening here?

377
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,609
A pervert? I didn't do anything.

378
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,945
You are the pervert
who was walking around in the rain.

379
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,281
If you're innocent,
why would you run away?

380
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,992
Because I knew
this kind of thing would happen.

381
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,661
Is he the pervert?

382
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,548
No. Everything from his height to his face
is totally different.

383
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,633
Different?

384
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,884
Are you sure?

385
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,472
But you said you saw his face then.

386
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,058
Well, I saw him from far away.

387
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,561
-Were you very far away?
-Yes.

388
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,812
Then tell us.

389
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,606
Why were you here alone in the dark?
You look suspicious.

390
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,403
-I live here.
-What?

391
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,906
There's nothing wrong with
standing in front of my house.

392
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,453
You live here? But…

393
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,289
Wait, you…

394
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,874
Oh, my…

395
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:12,047
My goodness! Are you the guy
from Unit 705 of Building 103?

396
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,257
Am I right?

397
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,301
-Oh, my.
-My goodness.

398
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,179
-What's with the outfit?
-Wait. My goodness.

399
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,931
Can I go now?

400
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:31,149
Okay. He's in the clear now,

401
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,984
let's let him go.

402
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,653
-But…
-You can go now, sir.

403
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,448
-Goodness.
-But…

404
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,118
But…

405
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,870
You can't just let him go like that.

406
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,998
She's right.
Shouldn't we report him to the police?

407
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,249
Report?

408
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,585
Will you report him
for wearing women's clothes?

409
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,753
He did nothing wrong.

410
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,382
Look at the news. There are criminals
who dress up like that

411
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,217
and film women with spy cams in bathrooms

412
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,177
or do perverted things
in women's colleges.

413
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,136
Gosh, this worries me.

414
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,056
Well, you said
he was just standing here alone.

415
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,935
Well, in order to punish someone,
you need to prove that the person

416
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,770
has legally damaged others' rights.

417
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,398
I mean, him wearing women's
clothes and makeup

418
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,151
didn't really harm you, did it?

419
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,237
That's true, but…

420
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,781
That will drop the housing prices
around here.

421
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,909
You can't report him to the police
for that, though.

422
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,203
-That's ridiculous.
-But he looks so suspicious.

423
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay. Let's walk her home now.
Let's do that first.

424
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,045
Okay, whatever. Let's go now. Come on.

425
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,171
Hurry! Come on!

426
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,340
-I should talk to him later.
-Come on!

427
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,687
I know you're in there.

428
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,981
Open the door!

429
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,191
-Come on!
-What the hell?

430
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,986
-Geez.
-Open the door!

431
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,280
What? What's wrong?

432
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,495
The dog is gone!

433
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,252
I smelled some gas yesterday,

434
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,963
so I opened all the windows
in the terrace for ventilation.

435
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,923
Maybe that's why the door was ajar.

436
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,219
Okay. Calm down and look for it carefully.

437
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,973
I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find it. Please help me.

438
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,686
Me? Why? Why would I?

439
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,605
I heard you were a cop.

440
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,859
Check the security footage nearby
and see where the dog went,

441
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,277
take DNA samples,

442
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,323
and investigate ex-convicts around
here who had abused animals before,

443
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,325
and ask around the people here…

444
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,619
Are you filming a TV show?

445
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,287
Do you think that's easy?

446
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,291
The dog will probably return home
in the time we do all that.

447
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,293
And even if that works,

448
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,504
I can't do all that work by myself

449
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,130
just for that one damn dog?

450
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,383
And that dog always barks at me
and bites me.

451
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,220
Why would I…

452
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,304
Wait.

453
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,349
The offer is now off the table.
We're at war now.

454
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,476
You've rejected my generous offer,

455
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,270
and you're going to regret it for life.

456
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,442
What is it?

457
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,988
It was you!

458
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,573
What?

459
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,992
You did it! To get back at me!

460
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,662
You did!

461
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,873
I have all the evidence here
to prove you blackmailed me.

462
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,417
Give me back my dog!
Where did you take my dog?

463
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,254
A poor animal that can't speak
isn't guilty of anything!

464
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,506
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

465
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,176
What is it that I have done so wrong?
What is it?

466
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,387
What dog?

467
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,432
I was on patrol the whole day.

468
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,768
Here. Look.

469
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,354
See? It's evidence that you like so much.

470
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,022
Are you happy now? Do you see it?

471
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,111
Gosh!

472
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,407
You could have rather asked me a favor.

473
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,284
Then I would have helped you find it.

474
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,661
What do you take me for?

475
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,873
Please.

476
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,545
I beg you.

477
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,338
If you find me the dog,

478
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,718
I will go to a different clinic
and do whatever you want.

479
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,636
I won't talk to you.

480
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,515
I will avoid any eye contact with you
and avoid you on the streets.

481
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,101
So please. Okay? Please.

482
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,854
Please.

483
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,242
What a shame though.

484
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,538
I'm really tired today.
I don't think I can do you this favor.

485
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,541
I refuse.

486
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,544
Bye.

487
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,178
The hood.

488
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,138
The rear-view mirror.

489
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,140
The door.

490
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,685
You needed to change them anyway, right?

491
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,940
What about it?

492
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,734
What?

493
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,821
What?

494
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,782
What about it?

495
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,952
Seriously, what about it? Why?

496
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:14,909
