1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,767
Why won't this open?

2
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,647
Who is this?

3
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,482
You were home.

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,819
I'm the realtor. Please open the door.

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,120
What do you think you're doing now?

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,582
-Why would you try to unlock--
-I didn't know you were home.

7
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,169
I thought the house was empty,
so I tried the old passcode.

8
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,046
Are you kidding me now?

9
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,550
You popped up in the middle of the night
and tried to unlock my door.

10
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,510
This is just ludicrous.

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,513
Come on. I said it was just a mistake.
Don't be like that.

12
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,725
I talked to the landlord, and I heard
you needed to move out urgently.

13
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:02,062
I don't care. I can't open the door
to random visits like this.

14
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,481
Come during the day and call in advance.

15
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,816
People these days
only have time after work,

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,860
and that's when they check out apartments.

17
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,404
If you don't cooperate,

18
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,656
it will only delay your moving day.

19
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,534
I have plenty of other apartments
to show him.

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,496
I can't just wait like this
with a customer.

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,748
So what do you say? Should I just go?

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,211
A newlywed couple used to live here.

23
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,838
Then they bought a house with the savings
and moved out.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,299
It's built with good materials,
so there are no defects.

25
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,926
-The master bedroom is here.
-Okay.

26
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,010
Wait.

27
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,348
The young lady lives alone, so it's clean.
There's nothing to fix up.

28
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,974
-Is that so?
-Yes.

29
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,267
That's not true!

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,103
-I don't live here alone!
-Okay.

31
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,194
Thanks. We will call you.

32
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,488
Let's go.

33
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,542
I'm going to run away

34
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,045
before I get caught.

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,214
I don't get it.

36
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,425
She said she didn't want to run away.

37
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,763
EPISODE 7
THE BOLT OPENS

38
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,766
HONGJIK

39
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,403
Let's take this…

40
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,923
The young lady lives alone, so it's clean.

41
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,444
Is she taking the trash now?

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,405
I think so.

43
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,364
Hi, Ms. Kim.

44
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,241
-Hi.
-Hi.

45
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,618
Right. Today is trash day.

46
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,579
-Gosh. You're right.
-Gosh, I must take out the trash again.

47
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,887
Goodness. Why don't you just open a bar?

48
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,348
My husband always has a drink
during dinner.

49
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,975
Gosh, that can't be good for him.

50
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,980
You'll have your second child soon enough.

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,901
No way. I just got out of that nightmare.

52
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,945
-It would be a disaster.
-Goodness.

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,116
Are you still on a diet these days?

54
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,703
I'm trying to lose some belly fat,
but it's not easy.

55
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,791
Well, it's because
you're so nice and easygoing.

56
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,335
You need to be grumpy and sensitive
to lose weight.

57
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,463
Look at the lady in Unit 506.
She's skinny like a twig.

58
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,632
I guess you're right.

59
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,023
How diligent of you.

60
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,400
Hey.

61
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,193
You know us now, right?

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,654
We're the members
of the Women's Association.

63
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,489
Yes.

64
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,782
Right.

65
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,202
You know, the Women's Association has
so much to do.

66
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,330
If we don't keep a close eye
on the recycling station,

67
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,208
people just dump anything everywhere.

68
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,752
We also care about the security
within the apartment.

69
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,462
On rainy days,
we clean the cigarette butts

70
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,839
so the water doesn't flood.

71
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,424
We watch the parking lot too.

72
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,509
-And we hold the market as well.
-We hold the meetings too.

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,427
Right.

74
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,721
So what?

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,514
Right.

76
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,643
You see, I don't ask just anyone
to work with me.

77
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,646
But yesterday at the meeting,
I saw you were

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,649
greatly interested
in the future of our apartment.

79
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,402
And to my surprise,
you were very proactive.

80
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,611
And I

81
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:27,243
was convinced that it won't hurt us
to have you in the Women's Association.

82
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,203
I'm afraid I can't do that.

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,623
What?

84
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,502
Why's that?

85
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,963
I'm moving out soon.

86
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,300
Oh, my.

87
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,970
She's moving…

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,563
-Hi.
-Hey.

89
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,527
Wait. Are you sure that's all plastic?

90
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,279
-My goodness.
-Oh, no.

91
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,156
My gosh!

92
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,033
Take this out now. Gosh!

93
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,117
Jeez!

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,704
With this much food,
it should go to the regular trash bin.

95
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,206
Come on. Take it out already.

96
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,792
-Gosh.
-Or go wash them.

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,835
Gosh! I can't believe this.

98
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,922
I have food delivered
so that I won't have to do the dishes.

99
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,382
-I don't have time for that.
-Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,218
You don't even have a job.

101
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,844
Take them all out already.

102
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,638
-Gosh.
-Gosh. What to do with you?

103
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,265
By the way,

104
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,811
why is Unit 506 moving out suddenly?

105
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,814
I don't know. How am I supposed to know?

106
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,108
Gosh. Why don't you know?

107
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,776
You two hang out all the time.

108
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,320
You seemed to have gotten closer
after all that quarreling.

109
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,073
Now, you won't have anyone to fight with.
You'll get lonely.

110
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,367
No, I wouldn't.

111
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,912
It feels great to finally be
free from all the drama.

112
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,334
Well, if it feels so great,
why do you look so sulky?

113
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,254
By the way, I wonder why Unit 506 took
the sneakers someone dumped here.

114
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,840
Well, I guess she liked them.

115
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,968
The white ones?

116
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,928
-Those with colorful patches?
-Yes.

117
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,179
-Those with the air soles?
-Yes.

118
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,389
They're mine.

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,224
What?

120
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,934
You threw them away anyway.

121
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,936
No, I didn't.

122
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,688
I didn't throw them away.

123
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,606
They accidentally got mixed in the trash.

124
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,900
And even if I threw them away,

125
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,027
she can't take them just like that.

126
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,612
What kind of a lunatic does that?

127
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,532
Gosh, this is infuriating.

128
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,452
I've got to talk some sense into her.

129
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,704
What's his problem?

130
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,788
Geez.

131
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,666
Look at him all excited
to go pick a fight with her.

132
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,769
Honey!

133
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,813
I'll get the door!

134
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,693
Honey!

135
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,529
I told you to put your shoes aside!

136
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,788
How many honeys do you have?

137
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,834
Sorry to bother your date,
but I'm here to get my sneakers

138
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,504
that you picked up earlier.
Give them back to me.

139
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,882
Yes, there they are.
There. Give them back to me.

140
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,008
Those are mine.

141
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,259
But you threw them away.

142
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,222
Hey, lady.

143
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,641
I may have thrown them away,
but I changed my mind

144
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,601
and went to take them back.

145
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,353
And, you know,

146
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,564
if I had known you would take them,
I wouldn't have thrown them away.

147
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,858
So stop being stubborn
and give my sneakers back.

148
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,445
They're right there. Give them back to me.
Come on. Hurry.

149
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,216
This isn't what I expected.

150
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,344
Hurry up, okay?

151
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,470
Do you think this is
reserve forces training?

152
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,265
-Check out that lady.
-I'm putting them on now!

153
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,726
Are you okay? Wake up.

154
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,019
-Ma'am, wake up.
-What?

155
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,355
-Button it up.
-Do you recognize where you are?

156
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,898
I don't know.

157
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,568
How much did she drink
to end up like that?

158
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,903
I told you we are a couple.

159
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,656
What kind of lovers get wasted like…

160
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,160
-Hey. Take him away.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,580
Get your hands off me.
I can go by myself. Damn it.

162
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,345
-Hey.
-Hey, I found Yang's stuff.

163
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:57,972
What?

164
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,789
What do I do?

165
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,751
After all the fuss,
now you've locked yourself out.

166
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,798
Damn it. What's wrong with this?

167
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,634
Darn it.

168
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,177
What was it?

169
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,055
What's wrong? Can't you open it?

170
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,518
I don't know. I changed the passcode,
and now the door won't open.

171
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,686
I don't know why.

172
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,148
Seriously.

173
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,693
Use your left brain, okay?

174
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,196
It's driving me nuts!

175
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,909
010-0128-4550
LOCKSMITH

176
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,169
Hi. We tried to change the passcode
and something seems to have gone wrong.

177
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,379
The door won't open.

178
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,464
Hongjik Apartment.

179
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,716
It'll take about two hours?

180
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,344
Sure. Please come over.

181
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,137
This is Unit 506 of Building 105.

182
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,014
Okay. Bye.

183
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,267
He says he can open the door
without breaking the lock.

184
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,478
He's coming in two hours,
so wait until he comes.

185
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,398
But I definitely followed
the instructions.

186
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,025
Well, I guess you accidentally
pressed some other button.

187
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,113
Bye now.

188
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,496
Are you…

189
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,540
going to wait there like that?

190
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,917
Yes.

191
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,671
I can't go anywhere.
Both my phone and wallet are inside.

192
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,680
You can stay in my place if you want.

193
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,099
I was about to go out anyway.

194
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,978
Never mind if you don't want to.

195
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,898
Anyway, the passcode is 2345 and star.

196
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,037
INTERROGATION ROOM

197
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,049
Hey, the headquarters will come back
any minute to transfer him!

198
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,510
Come on. I can finish it in ten…
No, five minutes.

199
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,262
I'll finish it in five. Wait here.
Keep watch here.

200
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,727
Look, I told you everything.

201
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,522
You said you'd order me some soup.
What now?

202
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,065
It's coming.

203
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,569
We ordered one from a famous restaurant,
and it's on its way here now.

204
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,949
You know Yang, right?

205
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,325
Yang?

206
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,660
Of course!

207
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
Who's Yang?

208
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,496
What's his name?

209
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,290
Well, obviously, Yang is Yang.

210
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,252
That's just what they're called.

211
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,004
Why would we go by our real names?

212
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,590
I see.

213
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,095
Then what does Yang look like?

214
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,681
Well, obviously, Yang looks like Yang.

215
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,767
We're not doing anything good here.

216
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,602
What's the point
of knowing each other's faces?

217
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,774
So you're saying you don't know
Yang's name or his face.

218
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,027
That means you don't know him, idiot.

219
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,862
Why did you act like you knew him?

220
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,448
You're really getting on my nerves.

221
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,076
Then tell me.

222
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,580
Do you know Gangnam Mad Dog?

223
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,331
Of course I do!

224
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,459
No junkie in the business
doesn't know about Gangnam Mad Dog.

225
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,378
I heard he's a nutcase.

226
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,547
That nutcase is me, asshole.

227
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,135
It's dark in here.
What did you say earlier?

228
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,180
You tell us you know everything,
but you won't tell us anything.

229
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,016
What did you say earlier? Tell me.

230
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,225
Something about soup?

231
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,146
I'm going to thrust the radish pickles
up your nostrils, so you can't breathe!

232
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,648
Gangnam Mad Dog has still got it.

233
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,318
I'm not lying.

234
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,364
These days, we use the deep web
and social media for business.

235
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,492
There's no reason for a small fry like me
to see a head honcho.

236
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,954
Then how do you get the drugs?

237
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,874
I go to the bar Yang tells me to go to

238
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,792
and ask the waiter for the "keep bottle."

239
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,338
Then there's this little thing
inside the liquor bottle.

240
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,297
Wait.

241
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,174
Did you say the waiter?

242
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,011
One second.

243
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,061
So, all the footage from the entrance
and inside the bar were deleted.

244
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,395
This is all that's left.

245
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,689
The dashcam footage
from a car at the entrance.

246
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,692
Wait. Stop.

247
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,198
Damn it…

248
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,286
Damn it!

249
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,758
Zoom in.

250
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,220
Oh, my. You're awake.

251
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,598
Sorry. I tried to be quiet.

252
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,892
Hello.

253
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
I live next door,

254
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,107
but I got locked out of my apartment,
so Hwi-oh let me stay here.

255
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,862
That's one long story
to say you're his girlfriend.

256
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,823
-Please have a seat.
-I'm not his girlfriend.

257
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,367
I'm really not.

258
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,787
I should get going now.

259
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,996
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,376
You're not leaving.

261
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,630
You said Hwi-oh told you to stay here.

262
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:21,058
Help yourself. Eating alone
is what I hate the most.

263
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,393
Okay.

264
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,776
I'm really not Hwi-oh's girlfriend
or anything.

265
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,861
I just want to make that clear.

266
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,655
Okay. I get it.

267
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,448
Now eat up. Help yourself.

268
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,867
Okay.

269
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,000
It's tasty.

270
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,962
Eat up.

271
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,506
Well then. Thanks for the meal.

272
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,023
Are you a good cook?

273
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,071
No, I don't know how to cook.
I just eat out or get delivery food.

274
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,366
Oh, well.

275
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,450
That's great.

276
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,663
Don't ever learn how to cook.
You have to keep doing it once you do.

277
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,456
If you're good at it, it's just a pain.

278
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,754
Hwi-oh was such a tiny and weak baby
when he was born.

279
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,464
That's why he's such a picky eater.

280
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,674
Hey, mom.

281
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,967
Hey, son.

282
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,260
Go wash up.

283
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,219
When did you come…

284
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,056
What?

285
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,892
Why are you still here?

286
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,352
I told her to stay and have dinner.

287
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,688
Wait. Where were we?

288
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,814
Right.

289
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,776
Hwi-oh was born so tiny.

290
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,530
I took him to the women's sauna
until he was 11,

291
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,199
and nobody stopped me.

292
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,703
-So…
-Mom.

293
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,372
So you have one older sister.

294
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,957
-Is she married?
-Yes.

295
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,128
I guess your family wants you
to hurry and get married too.

296
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,632
What's your date and time of birth?

297
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,302
-I was born in April, 1991.
-That's the Year of the Sheep.

298
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,638
Come on. If you're finished,
you should go now.

299
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,097
Come on. Stand up.

300
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,141
Hey. She only had one bite.

301
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,392
She's finished.

302
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,061
Come on and stand up.

303
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,562
Come on. Stand up.

304
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,148
-Son, she can't just leave like…
-Come on. Hurry up.

305
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,942
Thanks for the food.

306
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,945
What are you thanking me for?
You didn't even get to finish.

307
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,740
-Goodbye.
-Gosh, I'm so sorry.

308
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,367
My goodness.

309
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,369
Come again, okay?

310
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,957
Why did you have to
send her away like that?

311
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,625
You really disappointed me.

312
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,003
She might be your savior.

313
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,381
Savior, my foot.

314
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,092
It's not like what you think.

315
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,263
She got locked out of her apartment,
so I let her stay here for a while.

316
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,056
I know. She told me.

317
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,104
She said the realtor
who got her the apartment

318
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,649
tried to unlock her door
in the middle of the night.

319
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,901
She must've been so scared.

320
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,071
You may not know it,

321
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,658
there are so many things to fear
when a woman lives alone.

322
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,476
There are so many things to fear
when a woman lives alone.

323
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,648
This is why Buddha said

324
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,987
one must not take
making acquaintances lightly.

325
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,517
Hey, unlock it.
This won't go in with the lock in the way.

326
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,437
What is that?

327
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,274
What you desperately need right now.

328
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,197
If you're not opening the door,
I'll just leave. What do you say?

329
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,367
Never mind. I'll just go.

330
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,494
Wait.

331
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,294
Gosh, where should I start?

332
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,277
Good. Now, it looks like a place
where a man lives.

333
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,030
Now, the bad guys
who try to get in here will think

334
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,491
Don Lee is living here

335
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,034
and run away.

336
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,161
I know you like him.

337
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,080
Don Lee.

338
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,541
Yes.

339
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,880
So did you decide

340
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,841
to move out?

341
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,635
When?

342
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,681
Well, when the place gets sold.

343
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,938
Okay. Then give my things back to me

344
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,357
when you move out.

345
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,609
That will do.

346
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,156
I'll get going then.

347
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,887
I guess this is like

348
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,806
a farewell party then.

349
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,685
What's wrong? Are you upset
now that I'm actually moving out?

350
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,980
Well, it's quite upsetting.

351
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,984
Now, I'll be the only crazy one
around here.

352
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,527
Well…

353
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,364
I guess we can't have
two suns under one sky.

354
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,085
You know…

355
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,256
if I'm the reason why you're moving out,

356
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,384
you shouldn't go.

357
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:19,267
I'm pretty used to you now.

358
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,606
I also like the free food I get sometimes.

359
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,693
And every day, I wonder

360
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,404
what will happen this time.

361
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,074
And…

362
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,623
You're not significant enough to me

363
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,459
to affect my decisions in life.

364
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,294
Get over yourself.

365
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,683
Are you that scared of people?

366
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,146
Is it so hard to trust them?

367
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,608
Yes.

368
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,819
I told you,

369
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,988
I can't trust anyone.

370
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,866
And the person I can't trust the most
is myself.

371
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:21,705
I'm not sure if I turned off the stove,
closed the window,

372
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,957
or turned off the gas valve.

373
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,127
And that scares me.

374
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,714
I saw an old lady on TV before,

375
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,010
who was beating a pot the entire day
with a mask on, saying she smells gas.

376
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,096
I might end up like her.

377
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,265
Actually…

378
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,351
I might end up worse than that.

379
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,359
I'm sure you will beat
something even weirder than a pot.

380
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,112
Something like a drum.

381
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,406
You might even bend back and play a gong.

382
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,160
Stupid idiot!

383
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,996
You just cursed at me, didn't you?

384
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,415
Gosh.

385
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,084
I hate rain.

386
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,046
I feel horrible.

387
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,224
I can't trust you either.

388
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,310
I can't trust what you say.

389
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,939
You said you can't beat women.
You only said that to look cool, right?

390
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,235
What?

391
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,279
"Hi, I don't beat women."

392
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,449
Is this supposed to make women like me?

393
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,786
Well, I'm a man. It's just normal.

394
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,537
Some men are not like that.

395
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,874
What kind of an asshole does that?

396
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,502
The kind of asshole

397
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,756
that whispers all sorts of sweet talk
in your ear,

398
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,551
but everything he says
turns out to be a lie.

399
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,595
A married asshole.

400
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,350
When things didn't go his way,
he would suddenly change and…

401
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,103
And that's not all.

402
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,231
He said I flirted with him,
knowing he was married.

403
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:16,569
He said I was a crazy, obsessive bitch
who threatened to

404
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,238
destroy his family.

405
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,784
He said that's why he beat me.

406
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,203
He said I deserved it.

407
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,541
People always told me

408
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:35,088
that I'm mean and crazy about money.

409
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,090
They called me a bitch

410
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,676
and a hussy.

411
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,805
Did you

412
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,642
just let them talk like that?

413
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,061
You should have said that's not true!

414
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,105
Who knows?

415
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,734
I might have actually known
that he was married.

416
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,695
Do you think I didn't know?

417
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:08,538
I'm not even sure if I turned off
the gas valve or not,

418
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:14,169
so how can I be sure
whether I knew or not?

419
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,517
It might be that

420
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,689
those people wished it was true.

421
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,402
They were probably jealous

422
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,030
because you're so pretty.

423
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,494
So don't listen to them.

424
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:53,082
In fact, people don't care about others
as much as you think.

425
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,753
Some people still think
that Choi Bool-am and Kim Hye-ja

426
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,546
are really a married couple.

427
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,884
From Country Diaries?

428
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,929
I know. I may not look old enough
to remember that show.

429
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,350
Fine.

430
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:14,354
I will go crazy,
if that's what you guys want.

431
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,731
Today on, I'm going to let myself go!

432
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,039
Speaking of which…

433
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,208
What?

434
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,419
Do you want to sleep with me tonight?

435
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,968
What do you mean by, "speaking of which"?

436
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,972
Is that what you meant by going crazy?

437
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,473
Are you saying

438
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:54,102
sleeping with me is going crazy?

439
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,522
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,587
I love the sound of police sirens.

441
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,298
I feel like they're coming to save me.

442
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,681
It must be your birthday. Congratulations.

443
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,433
Congratulations.

444
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,478
This is an ambulance.

445
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,105
And a fire truck goes…

446
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,533
But…

447
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,745
This one is a little sad.

448
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,914
Right?

449
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,258
The rain's stopped. Let's go.

450
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,304
Excuse me. Check, please.

451
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,372
Bye, then.

452
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,124
Bye.

453
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,686
Was the valve turned off?

454
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,315
What?

455
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,735
Yes.

456
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,571
How about the windows? Were they closed?

457
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,912
See?

458
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,957
So trust yourself.

459
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,793
You're one meticulous woman,

460
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,755
and there's no way
you let him fool you like that.

461
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,049
I'm saying…

462
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,386
you didn't do anything wrong.

463
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,411
Hey, wait.

464
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,167
Well…

465
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,215
Howi wants to say something to you.

466
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,973
"Hey, thanks for helping me the other day.

467
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,143
Do you want to come over for ramyeon?"

468
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,182
HI, I'M HOWI

469
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,393
I'M BUSY (LOOKING FOR TREATS)
IN THE MORNING

470
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,980
HWI-OH'S PLACE NEVER HAS
ANYTHING TO EAT

471
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,481
I'M HUNGRY

472
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,983
HERE WE GO

473
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,735
WHERE'S MIN-KYUNG?

474
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,571
IS THAT HER?

475
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,656
I GOT SOME TREATS

476
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,408
TIME FOR A WALK WITH
HWI-OH (HEART) MIN-KYUNG

477
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,787
THE AIR IS CLEAR TODAY

478
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,666
HWI-OH SAID I GET A TREAT
IF I PLAY DEAD WELL

479
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,044
WHO IS IT…
AT THIS HOUR…

480
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,006
I'M A GOOD PUP WHO GOES TO BED EARLY
AND WAKES UP EARLY

481
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,799
SEE YOU TOMORROW (WINK)

482
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:24,807
