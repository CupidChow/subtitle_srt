1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,309
It's raining all over the country today.

2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,812
I hope you didn't forget to
take an umbrella with you.

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,149
Due to the low pressure
in the west Pacific,

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,569
it will continue to rain
for the time being.

5
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,571
So make sure to be prepared.

6
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,781
Because there's going to be
quite a lot of rain.

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,826
Hello? Can't you hear me?
I guess it's because I'm on the bus.

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,494
I said I'm on the bus.

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,663
So I can't speak loudly.

10
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,874
And he picks on me all the time.

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,625
It's not like he's giving me the day off.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,586
He's legally obligated.

13
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,963
Yes. My stupid boss.

14
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,340
I think he comes to work
so he can pick on me.

15
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,761
Everything he does is just ludicrous.

16
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,389
-I hate the damn rain.
-He asks about my private life constantly.

17
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,933
And he makes me do all the research,

18
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,437
but I don't think he ever reads them.
He always makes me do it again.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,855
Tell me about it!

20
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,190
Then he says stuff like,

21
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,524
-"Is everything okay?
-This stop is

22
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,068
-You can tell me anything."
-Haeyeoul Apartment.

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,444
-"I'll take care of it for you."
-The next stop is

24
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,737
Haeyeoul Elementary School.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,115
I mean, does he really not get it?
He's the biggest problem to me.

26
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,992
All I want is that he shuts up.

27
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,205
Please place only one card
on the card reader.

28
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,040
-I should just cuss him out and quit.
-Please place only one card

29
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,583
-on the card reader.
-Right?

30
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,835
Yes. Who?

31
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,171
Darn it.

32
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,925
Wait, sir! I didn't get off the bus yet.

33
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,842
Sir?

34
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,969
Gosh.

35
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,015
-What do you think?
-Darn it.

36
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,143
Well, we're in touch, but I'm not sure.

37
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:48,107
One, two, three, four, five.

38
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,867
Darn it.

39
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,038
That darn woman talks
as if she owns the whole bus.

40
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,333
This is really annoying.

41
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,190
Darn it.

42
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,919
I guess you don't like rainy days.

43
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,090
Well, what is rain after all?

44
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,385
It's damp, wet, nasty, and gloomy.

45
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,555
The ground is soggy,
the traffic is horrible,

46
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,516
there's the smell of wet socks in the air,

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,269
and the floor is all wet

48
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,604
with dirty water.

49
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,982
PSYCHIATRIST HAN JIN-YOUNG

50
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,027
I mean, it's not like I'm crazy.

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,487
Why would I like rainy days?

52
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,157
Are you angry?

53
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,576
Am I angry?

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,244
No way. Not at all.

55
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,580
I've changed now.

56
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,248
You've changed.

57
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,334
Yes. I've changed completely.

58
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,795
I'm very well aware of my problem,

59
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,839
and am committed to treatment.

60
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,090
You know that, doctor.

61
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,677
I sit here and talk about everything
from how I wet my pants when I was eight,

62
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,389
to how I stole my mom's money, and if
I have a thing for stockings or bondage.

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,768
I tell you everything.
In order to learn what's wrong with me.

64
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,853
Do you know how that feels?

65
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,023
Every day, I'm high on medicine.
I spend more time asleep than awake.

66
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:56,527
Now, I can't even tell
if today is tomorrow or yesterday.

67
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,198
All I do is eat, sleep, and crap.

68
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,742
I feel like

69
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,702
I've become a machine that makes crap.

70
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,120
That's exactly how I feel.

71
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,291
POST-TRAUMATIC EMBITTERMENT DISORDER

72
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,584
I have PTED?

73
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,672
I don't even like what it's called,

74
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,590
but I'm trying really hard

75
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,384
to go back to the way I was before.

76
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,346
Why are your hands…

77
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,433
Are you worried I might have
gotten in a fight somewhere?

78
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,019
I didn't. I just hit the wall…

79
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,354
Is your hand all right?

80
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,903
Hello.

81
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,738
I'm conducting a survey…

82
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,120
Hello.

83
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm not a strange person.

84
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,792
I'm just a student who studies the mind.
Could you help me with a survey?

85
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,044
No, no, no.

86
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,380
You seem like a sweet man.

87
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,590
Hasn't anyone told you this before?

88
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,219
You may look cold,

89
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,723
but your heart is warmer
than anyone else's.

90
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,685
However, no one sees that,

91
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,521
and that's why you feel so frustrated.

92
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,898
That's what it looks like.

93
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,779
Have you ever thought it might be
because of your ancestors?

94
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,619
Go. You heard me. Go away.

95
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,664
Go away. Gosh, this is unbelievable.

96
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,837
Hello.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,466
You have the eyes of an innocent soul.

98
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,469
I'm not a strange person.

99
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,395
Hello.

100
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,856
I'm not a strange person.

101
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,281
Damn it.

102
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,326
Damn it.

103
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,413
Hey, you.

104
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,499
Could you kick that slipper over this way?

105
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,419
No, that. The thing under you.

106
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,754
Please kick it over here.

107
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,446
It's beautiful.

108
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,406
May I ask what flower that is?

109
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,991
I don't know much about flowers.

110
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,997
It's Aster yomena.

111
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,999
Don't I look crazy?

112
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,378
I wanted to make people avoid me.

113
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,132
But…

114
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,931
that crazy man was a little different.

115
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,057
Ten!

116
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,684
Nine!

117
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,601
Eight!

118
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,146
I think he's been following me
from the front.

119
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,274
I have no idea how he found me.

120
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,069
Shouldn't he be behind you to follow you?

121
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,365
You're right.

122
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,701
How did he know where I was going?

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,455
He tried to trick me as well.

124
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,539
Hey, you.

125
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,583
Could you kick that slipper over this way?

126
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,045
Could it be that you two were heading
to the same place?

127
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,924
No way.

128
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,261
If that was it,
I would have thought so too.

129
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,429
Is there more?

130
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,388
Yes.

131
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,100
I saw him in this building again,
on the first floor.

132
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,104
The moment I was about to walk
into the elevator, he walked in too.

133
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,159
Damn it.

134
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,786
Damn it!

135
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,417
Damn it.

136
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,072
Don't come closer.

137
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,868
I said, don't come closer!

138
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,003
He was trying to assault me.
I'm sure of it.

139
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,923
Gosh, it still gives me the creeps.

140
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,677
Luckily, I had an umbrella with me.

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,846
If not, who knows what would have
happened to me?

142
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,973
There's no telling.

143
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,933
Gosh!

144
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,935
God damn it!

145
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,145
Damn it! Seriously!

146
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,943
But seriously, I didn't hit her at all.
She's the one who hit me.

147
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
Go! Go away!

148
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,990
Get off me, you punk!

149
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,076
Go away!

150
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,870
Damn it!

151
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,123
She just started to beat me
with her umbrella.

152
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,458
Seriously, I wished I was with my mom.

153
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,465
I mean, how unlucky am I?

154
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,968
Why did I have to
bump into such a lunatic?

155
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,554
By the way,

156
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,890
she…

157
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,810
had a flower behind her ear.

158
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,230
One moment, please.

159
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,575
I turned off the gas.

160
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,713
DELUSIONAL DISORDER,
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER,

161
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,672
OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER

162
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,424
Where was I?

163
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,183
Welcome.

164
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,299
Thank you.

165
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,635
-Do you have any membership points?
-No.

166
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,387
-Would you like a bag?
-Yes.

167
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,685
Excuse me.

168
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,731
Is the man behind me looking at me?

169
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,192
No, don't.

170
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,777
Don't look at him like that.

171
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,946
Never mind.

172
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,116
Thank you.

173
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,624
Hey.

174
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,003
Be careful of that man.

175
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,256
Okay.

176
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,503
I think there's something wrong
with this one. I want a new one.

177
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,671
SESAME RAMYEON

178
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,092
I'm sorry, but it's open.
I can't give you exchanges or refunds.

179
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,303
Right. I know that,

180
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,388
but after pouring the water,

181
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,474
I realized that it was missing.

182
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,225
You know, the chili oil.

183
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,437
You can't eat this without that oil.
It'll be too bland.

184
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,607
It's like eating udon without kelp.
You know what I mean?

185
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,025
I want a new one.

186
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,779
Excuse me?

187
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,200
I didn't take a single bite yet.
because of the missing chili oil.

188
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,494
Please contact
the manufacturer about that.

189
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,331
But I bought it here.
You should do something about this.

190
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,999
This is no way to treat a customer.

191
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,292
What's this?

192
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,003
Are you recording this?

193
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,924
The security cameras
are recording everything.

194
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,926
I'll call the police
if you keep doing this.

195
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,138
What do you mean, call the police?
I didn't do anything!

196
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,807
You're being ridiculous.

197
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:33,562
I mean, seriously, it was…
The chili oil wasn't there.

198
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,105
Last warning.

199
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,566
If you say that one more time,
I'll call the police.

200
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,693
Fine! Forget it!

201
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,238
I'll just eat it like this.
Are you happy now?

202
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,532
Unbelievable.

203
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,951
All I wanted was to have
this cup noodle exchanged.

204
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,202
Have I committed a crime?

205
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,163
Gosh!

206
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,085
-Where is the bathroom here?
-We don't have one.

207
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,256
Isn't that the key to the bathroom?
That thing over there.

208
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,800
Where do you go
if you want to use the bathroom?

209
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,218
I just hold it in.

210
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,680
ALERT

211
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,516
Fine. Hold it in then.

212
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,104
Darn it.

213
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,525
Thank you. Come again.

214
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,709
Gosh, this is…

215
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,378
Why am I having diarrhea?

216
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,340
Gosh, this is bad.

217
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,896
-Mom, hurry and open the door.
-Okay.

218
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,648
-You're home.
-Hurry and open up.

219
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,650
-Why is this thing locked?
-Hurry up!

220
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,987
Hang on. I need to close it first.

221
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,363
Just hold on.

222
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,948
Come on in.

223
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,617
Hey, why are you sweating so much?

224
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,786
Wait. Is this blood?

225
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,163
Gosh, mom! Just sit down!

226
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,000
-Father.
-Why did you open…

227
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,335
-Come on out, Father.
-Have you lost your mind?

228
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,837
Go away!

229
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,757
-Why'd you do that?
-Mom, do we have a chamber pot?

230
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,593
-Just tell me. What happened?
-Never mind. It's nothing.

231
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,262
-Hurry and come on out.
-Hey!

232
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,263
Come on!

233
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,599
How dare you look at me like that.
Wait, you punk!

234
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,228
Why won't you tell me? What is it?

235
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,022
I'm out, you bastard. I'm out.

236
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,940
-What now?
-Honey.

237
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,358
Come on out, you punk.

238
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,527
I'm out now. What now?

239
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,862
Are you going to hit me?

240
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,740
Hit me! Go right ahead, you punk.

241
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,701
What are you going to do?
Are you going to hit me now?

242
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,286
-What? What?
-Hwi-oh.

243
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,623
-Just tell him you're sorry.
-What? Can't you hit me?

244
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,957
-Calm down, honey.
-Stay still.

245
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,293
-Father, let me go. Just let me go.
-Honey.

246
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,927
-You, punk. What now?
-Just let him off this once.

247
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,178
Hold on!

248
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,180
Just let go of me!

249
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,576
Mom.

250
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,998
Hwi-oh?

251
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,918
Gosh, it's hot.

252
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,014
Mom, I told you to just leave it.

253
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,016
You don't have to hand-wash it.
It's dirty.

254
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,185
It's not dirty.

255
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,106
I used to wash your diapers like this
when you were little.

256
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,903
Gosh, this takes me back.

257
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,114
Honey, do you remember?

258
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,660
Hwi-oh was so cute when he was little.

259
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,414
Cute, my foot.

260
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,751
That punk was born creepy.

261
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,628
Gosh, that grumpy geezer.

262
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,047
Oh, right.

263
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,550
I forgot that I came by
to tell you something.

264
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,093
Hwi-oh.

265
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,555
I'm so glad I got to know
this fortune teller.

266
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,018
She said you were born
with the energy of trees

267
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,731
and that your name is full of fire energy.

268
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,442
You're a tree on fire,

269
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,779
which means you're basically
burnt black like charcoal.

270
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,825
So you need some water energy
to subdue the fire.

271
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,579
Is that fortune teller still
ripping you off?

272
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,081
Gosh, she's got to know when to stop.

273
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,458
Doesn't she feel guilty?

274
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,836
You should watch what you say.

275
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,131
She always prays for you.

276
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,552
So I got a few good names from her.

277
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
Tell me which one you like the best.

278
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,849
Noh Ryu-ha,

279
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,559
Noh Cheong-ho,

280
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,604
Noh Yeon, and Noh Dam.

281
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:35,400
My favorite is Dam, meaning "clear pond."

282
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,987
Dam? Like a water dam?

283
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,156
Why don't you just call me Hoover Dam?

284
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,493
Actually, just call me "No Water,"
since my last name is "Noh."

285
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,289
Hwi-oh.

286
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,711
Come on, Mom. What is it this time?

287
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,172
No. Never mind.

288
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,133
I just felt sorry.

289
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:05,764
I put you through all this
by giving you a bad name.

290
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,726
Mom's sorry.

291
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,730
Don't even talk to that nut.

292
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,109
He might flip out
and poop his pants again.

293
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,070
Why do you always have to talk like that?

294
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,864
Stop being so negative
and angry all the time.

295
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,574
This is why he's…

296
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,832
Hwi-oh is ill
because he wasn't loved enough.

297
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,168
What? What do you mean, I didn't get love?

298
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,213
And stop washing that.
You're not here to work.

299
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,466
And stop bringing so much food.

300
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,344
We can just eat out,
so don't bother, okay?

301
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:51,768
I'm almost in tears
because of how caring you are.

302
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,771
If you cared about your mom so much,

303
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,732
you shouldn't have asked us for money

304
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,651
saying that you need a house
because you're getting married.

305
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,987
Then you ruined everything
a week before the wedding

306
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,447
and embarrassed the crap out of us.

307
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,407
Crap! Crap! Crap!

308
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,659
Stop talking about crap!

309
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,786
Do you really want to see me lose it?

310
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,913
You know how scary I can be.

311
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,040
Gosh.

312
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm sorry. What's wrong?

313
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,839
What's wrong?
I feel bad for what happened to my son.

314
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,432
My son was so lonely

315
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,978
that he pooped his pants.

316
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,484
Okay. I'm sorry.

317
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,405
You say that all the time.

318
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,792
HOT BATH

319
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,723
Don't come closer!

320
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,933
Go! Go away!

321
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,267
Go away!

322
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,605
Well, well.

323
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,651
So you're the crazy one around here, huh?

324
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,403
But you know what?

325
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm just as crazy as you are.

326
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,661
You'd better stay out of my sight.
Otherwise, I will rip you apart and…

327
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:12,409
HONGJIK JUNGANG APARTMENT, BUILDING 105
UNIT 506, LEE MIN-KYUNG

328
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,693
Wait a minute.

329
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,197
What are you doing?

330
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,698
What are you doing? Help!

331
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,991
Wait!

332
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,159
-Who's there?
-Help!

333
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,412
-Is everything all right?
-Help! Help!

334
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,498
Over there! He's running away!

335
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,460
Don't leave just yet. I'm finished now.
Wait there. I'll take you home.

336
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,879
Come on. It's raining now.
Don't take the bus home.

337
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,589
You said it's still raining.

338
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,008
Just wait there, okay?

339
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,127
CLOTHING BIN

340
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,969
What are you doing here alone?

341
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,185
Where do you live?
Do you want me to take you home?

342
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,568
Where are you going?

343
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,530
You can't go that way! Wait!

344
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,917
Doggy!

345
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,837
Doggy!

346
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,257
Hey, doggy!

347
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,802
Doggy?

348
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,518
Come on out.

349
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,984
Don't worry. I'll take you home.

350
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,612
Gosh, you're all soaked. You must be cold.

351
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,236
What in the world?

352
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,447
It's you again.

353
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,283
What are you doing sitting there?

354
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,163
What? What's the matter?

355
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,293
