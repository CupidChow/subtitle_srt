1
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,943
Here. Drink up.

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,589
How did you know where I was?

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,342
Hang on.

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,636
Did you follow me?

5
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,185
Now that's more like it.

6
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm relieved now.

7
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,363
When you said

8
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,327
you wouldn't run away,
it means you're not moving out, right?

9
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,415
Yes.

10
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,045
I tried to run away,
but then I got caught.

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,799
There's no reason to run away anymore.

12
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,933
His mother came to see me
and asked to settle.

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,396
So you met her?

14
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,652
You should have told me!

15
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,239
Why did you speak to her alone?
Weren't you scared?

16
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,450
So what did she say? Tell me.

17
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,037
What did she say to make you cry…

18
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,247
What did she say?

19
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,962
It's my business. I'll take care of it.

20
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,965
And why would I be scared?

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,301
They're the ones who did wrong.
Why should I be scared?

22
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,679
I didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,765
You're absolutely right!

24
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,936
I have this too.

25
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,826
So…

26
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,413
is that the only reason

27
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,250
you decided not to move out?

28
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,712
Well…

29
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,008
When I decided to leave,

30
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,428
it kind of bothered me.

31
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,182
What bothered you?

32
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,020
The Women's Association
offered me a position.

33
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,938
They said they needed someone like me.

34
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,857
And I felt bad turning them down.

35
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,321
That's it? That's the only reason?

36
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,474
EPISODE 9

37
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:49,020
TO HAVE AN ALLY

38
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,111
The truth of the Cheongdam-dong
dating violence.

39
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,821
The victim turned out to be
a home-wrecker.

40
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,323
The victim had been being
supported financially by a married man.

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,075
She threatened him to divorce his wife
with suicide attempts.

42
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,245
She bought a house and a car
with the hefty settlement,

43
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,579
so she'd be scared of the consequences.

44
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,511
WHAT A HUGE TWIST! THIS IS WHY THEY SAY
THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO SIDES

45
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,929
IT WAS A HOME-WRECKER PRETENDING
TO BE A VICTIM? SO CREEPY

46
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,305
LIKE ATTRACTS LIKE
I HAVE NO PITY WHATSOEVER FOR HER

47
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,182
MONEY IS GOOD FOR SURE,
BUT WHO WANTS A LIFE LIKE THAT?

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,225
IT WAS SO DUMB OF HER

49
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,060
YOU CALL HIM HONEY THEN YOU RIP HIM OFF

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,820
SHE'S BEEN FOUND OUT. LEE MIN-KYUNG.
SHE MOVED TO HONGJIK-DONG!

51
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,243
Oh, my god! This is where I live.

52
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,911
Can I share this post
to a mothers' community?

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,496
We must bring her to justice.

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,584
She cheated with a married man.

55
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,044
-She lives in our neighborhood?
-In our apartment building?

56
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,171
THE HOME-WRECKER SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
THAT'S RIGHT. I HOPE SHE DOES.

57
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,799
SHE WRECKED A HOME
AND EVEN GOT A NEW IDENTITY.

58
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,885
She came here? Really?

59
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,387
She did it to get money.

60
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,894
So this woman lives in our neighborhood?

61
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,812
-Yes!
-Yes!

62
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,689
Everyone is talking about it these days.

63
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,066
We must find her as soon as possible
and call her out.

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,109
Exactly.

65
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,989
Well, this is not a big neighborhood,
but what can we do about it?

66
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,034
Min-kyung is such a common name.

67
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,452
I mean, think about it.

68
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,246
That girl who lives in Unit 303
of Building 101 or 102. She's Min-kyung.

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,957
Come on. That Min-kyung is a baby.

70
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,959
-Is that so?
-Yes.

71
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,379
Then you know,
the woman who did that thing before.

72
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,714
-The former account manager?
-Yes.

73
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,965
Her name is Lee Min-jung.

74
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,467
Here. Look.

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,053
Her name is Lee Min-kyung,
and she moved to Hongjik-dong recently.

76
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,015
Well, if she moved in recently… Hang on.

77
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,018
Right! Unit 506.

78
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,021
Unit 506 is Lee Min-kyung!

79
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,733
So Unit 506 is that home-wrecking--

80
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,611
A home-wrecker?

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,988
Unit 506's name was Lee Min-kyung?

82
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,740
My gosh!

83
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,118
Goodness, it's her.

84
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,789
That's why this photo looked
familiar to me.

85
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,248
It's her. It's definitely her.

86
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,166
My goodness.

87
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,084
Wait. Hang on.

88
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,002
I don't have time for this.

89
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,545
-Let me just…
-This is unbelievable.

90
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,590
Even if we ask her about it,

91
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,259
she wouldn't say, "Yes, I'm that woman."

92
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,512
-What's the point of asking her that?
-I know. Home…

93
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,306
Gosh, I don't even want to say that word.

94
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,185
Still, I need to ask her
and see if it's true.

95
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,478
This is a serious matter.

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,439
-But, In-ja!
-Wait there. Let me get changed first.

97
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,899
-What do we do?
-Let's go.

98
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,699
Gosh. It definitely seems like it's him.

99
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,453
He's definitely Yang.

100
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,248
But I can't just push this through
without any evidence.

101
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,630
What time is it now?

102
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,965
Gosh.

103
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,811
Okay. Coming.

104
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,148
Hey.

105
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,367
I thought our conversation was over.

106
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,915
It's not over until we reach a settlement.

107
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,127
So if you don't want things to get ugly,

108
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,087
just accept the settlement. Just do it.

109
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,757
You can move somewhere else,
but I'll find you eventually.

110
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,678
Now you're just
straight out threatening me.

111
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,516
What's the point of acting coy
at this point?

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,226
I know you're playing hard to get

113
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,979
so you can get more out of the settlement.

114
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,398
So just be honest with me.

115
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,275
How much do you want?

116
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,988
Let's see how ambitious you are.

117
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,992
How much?

118
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,079
If you want to settle that badly,

119
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,874
why don't you bring everything you've got?

120
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,295
Who knows?
Maybe I'll accept the settlement then.

121
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:33,554
So, after all, it was for money.

122
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,475
You seduced my married son for his money,

123
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,268
destroyed his family,

124
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,146
put the blame on the poor man

125
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,150
trying to protect his family,
and tried to stigmatize him. Is that it?

126
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,361
Unbelievable.

127
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,364
How did a young lady like you
ever think of doing something so nasty?

128
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,324
Young lady.

129
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,160
This isn't right.

130
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,454
Money is surely important,

131
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,123
but you shouldn't harass and hurt others
because of that.

132
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,167
That's no way for anyone to act.

133
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,628
You are going to regret this later.

134
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,966
I'm going to regret this?

135
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,220
Your family being wrecked
is none of my business!

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,431
Get out of my sight! Now!

137
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,196
-Oh, no!
-Goodness.

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
-Are you okay?
-Ma'am, are you okay?

139
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,200
-Come on. Calm down.
-Let's help her stand up.

140
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,619
Thank you.

141
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,289
-Come on. Take a seat.
-Please take a seat here.

142
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,249
How could she…

143
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,149
DOG OWNER

144
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,032
AGGRESSIVE DOG

145
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,460
So…

146
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,962
when are you moving out?

147
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
I'm not moving out.

148
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,301
You said you were.
Why did you change your mind?

149
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,220
Now everyone knows who you are,
you don't need to? Is that why?

150
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,805
Enough.

151
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,101
I want you to move out
as soon as possible.

152
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,561
Why should I?

153
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,980
As the president
of the Women's Association,

154
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,524
I cannot let a home-wrecker live
in our apartment.

155
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,569
And I'm pretty sure
others are of the same opinion.

156
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,237
-Of course.
-Me too.

157
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,657
I'm a…

158
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,660
home-wrecker?

159
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,870
What's wrong? That's what we just heard.

160
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,789
Are you going to deny it?

161
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,542
I know you're one brazen woman,

162
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,587
but now everyone knows who you are

163
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,131
and word has spread
to all the mothers online,

164
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,218
I don't think you can live
in this neighborhood in peace.

165
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,429
What if people find out
the name of our apartment complex

166
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,015
and start calling it
the home-wrecker's apartment?

167
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,394
Then it'll tarnish our apartment's image.
What will you do about that?

168
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,897
Before it becomes inconvenient
for both you and the people here,

169
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,483
you'd better hurry and move out.
Understood?

170
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,256
Good.

171
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,300
She should have gotten my point now.

172
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,552
I think so.

173
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,803
Of course.

174
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,681
Goodness. Can you believe this?

175
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:10,938
Hey, Ms. Kim.

176
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,065
Hey, there!

177
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,316
Hi.

178
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,193
Actually,

179
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,362
about Unit 506…

180
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,322
-That's right! Unit 506!
-Gosh!

181
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,742
So you heard about it too.

182
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,579
Who would have guessed
Unit 506 was that kind of person?

183
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,496
Tell me about it.

184
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,417
Our hearts are still pounding
from what happened just now.

185
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,796
What about Unit 506?

186
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,257
What happened? What are you talking about?

187
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,342
What?

188
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,844
He doesn't seem to know.

189
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,888
Don't you know?

190
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,783
CHEONGDAM-DONG DATING VIOLENCE

191
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,163
THE TRUTH OF
THE CHEONGDAM-DONG DATING VIOLENCE

192
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,134
HER NAME IS LEE MIN-KYUNG.
SHE MOVED TO HONGJIK RECENTLY.

193
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,397
Because of that,
the entire neighborhood is--

194
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,649
Just wait.

195
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,487
That's Unit 506.

196
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,989
This shook the entire neighborhood.

197
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,075
I thought you knew.

198
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,993
Unbelievable.

199
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,371
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

200
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,123
This is not true.

201
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,960
-What?
-Do you want me to say it again?

202
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,045
This is not true.

203
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,505
This is not true.

204
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,590
This is not true!

205
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,800
Goodness!

206
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,593
Hey.

207
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,056
Why are you yelling?

208
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,059
Why do you believe something so blindly
without confirming it?

209
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,981
Look. We saw it.

210
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,275
We even asked her about it.

211
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,653
I told her to move out instantly,
and she quietly backed off.

212
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,196
That means she admits it!

213
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,658
Wait. You told Unit 506 to move out?

214
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,619
Yes.

215
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,957
She just started to get settled here

216
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,835
and was excited about joining
the Women's Association.

217
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,256
How could you people be like this?

218
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,549
If Unit 506

219
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,051
actually moves out because of this,

220
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,971
you take the responsibility for it. Okay?

221
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,139
What?

222
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,641
Gosh. Seriously.

223
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,313
But…

224
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,819
Why should I take
responsibility for that? Gosh.

225
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,903
-I'd like an order of the same here.
-Okay.

226
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,955
Why didn't you answer my call?

227
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,291
I've been looking for you.

228
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,419
You really are a handful.

229
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,421
I didn't ask you to find me.

230
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,427
I heard everything.

231
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,890
If you're not strong,
don't act like it in the first place.

232
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,476
You said you wouldn't run away.
Why did you run away?

233
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,354
I didn't run away.

234
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,439
Then what is this?

235
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,943
If it's not true, you should've just
told them so. Why are you avoiding it?

236
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,950
Because I know anything I say is useless.

237
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,793
She even came to my office
and spread nonsense.

238
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,547
She also wrote about me online.

239
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,173
I said it wasn't true.

240
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,884
I explained and denied it.

241
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,262
Do you think I haven't tried it?

242
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,599
But it didn't change anything.

243
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,439
Everyone believes it's true.

244
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,401
No matter what I say,

245
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,278
no one believes me.

246
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,614
No one is on my side.

247
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,242
I'm outnumbered from the start.

248
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,786
This is a losing game for me.

249
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,832
What do you mean, no one is on your side?

250
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,544
What about me? I'm a person too.

251
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,379
You have me.

252
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,763
You want to be on my side?

253
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,516
Why?

254
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,436
Well…

255
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,066
It would be scary to have someone like you
as an enemy.

256
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,403
I might as well be your ally.
That would make me feel better.

257
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,410
Then…

258
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,538
no matter what I do,

259
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,334
be understanding, trust me,

260
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,419
and stand up for me.

261
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,172
Can you promise to do that?

262
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,429
That doesn't sound so hard.

263
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,559
Sure. I can do that. I'll be on your side.

264
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,269
Here.

265
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,064
We're allies now.

266
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,027
Come on. Hold it.

267
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,964
We need evidence of the deal.

268
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,757
You love evidence.

269
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,552
Where's your phone? Take a photo of it.

270
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,636
Okay.

271
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,690
Make sure our faces are in it.

272
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,293
Enjoy.

273
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,966
So don't be scared
just because you're outnumbered.

274
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,843
I can beat all those ladies

275
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,345
on my own.

276
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,391
Now you're being silly.

277
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,226
You couldn't say anything either.

278
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,689
You should have

279
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,525
seen me earlier.

280
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,113
Eat up.

281
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,001
Thank…

282
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,967
Do you work here?

283
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:20,969
Yes.

284
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,138
Do you need a bag? It's 20 won.

285
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,140
Sure. Thanks.

286
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,649
How's your studying going?

287
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,317
Sure. Yes.

288
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,611
Honey, who is she?

289
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,155
Well…

290
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,909
Say hi. She's a friend I knew in school.

291
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,077
I see.

292
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,079
Hi.

293
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,080
Hi.

294
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,458
Are you seeing anybody?

295
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,673
Right. I guess you're busy studying.

296
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,300
I have a boyfriend.

297
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,594
He should be here any minute
to pick me up.

298
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,228
Hey, honey.

299
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,021
What took you so long?

300
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,189
I've been waiting.

301
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,358
I'm hungry.

302
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,993
Hey, honey. You must be starving.

303
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,621
Let's go eat something nice today.

304
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,622
Okay.

305
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,458
Thank you.

306
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,710
Okay.

307
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,321
Why haven't you left? It's embarrassing.

308
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,825
I thought today might be the day
you could use a sister.

309
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,496
He was your ex, right?

310
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,624
Can't you see I'm using earphones?

311
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,669
I know you can hear me.

312
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,007
Did I cross the line?

313
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,968
I thought of just
looking the other way, but…

314
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,011
Thank you.

315
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,556
Otherwise,
I would've looked really pathetic.

316
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,892
I'm glad I helped.

317
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,771
Did you see that girl though?

318
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,565
She was wearing so much makeup. Geez.

319
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,943
It was hard for you

320
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,737
We…

321
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,114
He said he couldn't afford to date anyone

322
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,784
while settling into
the new company and all.

323
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,285
And yet there he was, flexing.

324
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,997
Why did you stop cursing him?

325
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,750
You can cuss him out more
until you feel better.

326
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,336
I don't hate him that much actually.

327
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,004
I had to break up with him anyway.

328
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,508
I'm the one
who can't afford to date anyone.

329
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,802
I don't deserve it.

330
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,430
This isn't a good time for self-criticism.

331
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,724
I'm just seeing myself objectively.

332
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,435
I'm a mere part-timer
preparing for an exam.

333
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
How can I afford to date anyone?

334
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,899
I heard you're doing well

335
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:26,488
Though I didn't want to hear it

336
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,700
You did well

337
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,412
-You wouldn't have been able
-You wouldn't have been able

338
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:39,584
-To endure the emptiness
-To endure the emptiness

339
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,004
-Are you happy being in love?
-Are you happy being in love?

340
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,884
You have no idea

341
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,429
How beautiful you are

342
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,391
When you begin to love

343
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,644
I still cannot forget

344
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,856
How beautiful you were

345
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,276
I cannot get over you

346
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,321
Especially on days I hear news of you

347
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,324
Do you like that person?

348
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:16,830
To be honest, it's hard for me to bear

349
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:23,128
I wish you were more heartbroken

350
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,089
I wish you feel

351
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:30,552
One tenth of the pain that I feel

352
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:35,599
Before you

353
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:41,271
Become happy

354
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,447
Thank you.

355
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,748
You're not just a part-timer
who's preparing for an exam.

356
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,082
How do you sing so well?

357
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,085
Well, what's the point?

358
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,881
What's the difference
between a regular part-timer

359
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,925
and a part-timer who sings well?

360
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,845
Samantha!

361
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,681
Good evening, ma'am.

362
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,016
Hey.

363
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,601
What are you two doing together?

364
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,103
Well, I dropped by the convenience store.

365
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:23,980
What's the matter?

366
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,399
Right. Samantha.

367
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,820
You said you're good
with computers and stuff, right?

368
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:37,244
So you want me to find the person
who wrote this?

369
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,788
But why?

370
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,206
Well, the thing is,

371
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,501
this woman they're talking about here
is Unit 506 of Building 105.

372
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,878
Unit 506?

373
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,214
The young lady with dark sunglasses.

374
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,300
I know. Hwi-oh and she had something…

375
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,468
What?

376
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,553
That woman is the home-wrecker?

377
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,808
Well, based on this post,
it's likely the case,

378
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,644
but I just want to make sure.

379
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,941
So you want to find the person
who wrote this post to fact-check it?

380
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:08,858
Yes.

381
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,444
Do you think you can?

382
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,283
Well, officially, I can't,
but since this is for the public interest,

383
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,368
I can give it a try.

384
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,287
Wait. Hold on.

385
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,248
I'm not sure if this is necessary.

386
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,042
Of course it's necessary.

387
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,544
This is a very serious matter.

388
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,213
Didn't you see Unit 507 yelling earlier?

389
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,465
What?

390
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,885
This person's IP address matches
the IP address of this computer…

391
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,186
It's me. I wrote that post.

392
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,026
I posted on the mothers' community.

393
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,111
Hey.

394
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,195
What?

395
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,282
Well, I didn't write it.

396
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,409
I just copied the post.

397
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,829
My goodness. Are you…

398
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,624
one of those people who leaves
hate comments?

399
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,337
No way! Everyone was criticizing her,

400
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,339
so I just wrote one comment.

401
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,591
I only shared the post.

402
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,178
-Wait. I'll find it for you.
-What the…

403
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,055
-Okay.
-Let me show you where I saw it.

404
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,100
Sharing posts like that
and leaving hate comments

405
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,019
are basically the same thing.

406
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,521
-Here.
-Where?

407
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,275
There are so many comments.

408
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,402
My goodness.

409
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,737
Hang on. What is…

410
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,823
"It was a home-wrecker
pretending to be a victim."

411
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,325
Excuse me.

412
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,119
-Does this mean this is true?
-Excuse me.

413
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,579
-What? What is it?
-Excuse me.

414
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,166
Are we talking about the woman

415
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,043
who hangs out with the police officer?

416
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,002
-Yes.
-Yes.

417
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,462
Why?

418
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,465
Then I think I know the truth.

419
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,968
I made myself clear
that I'm not willing to settle.

420
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,762
So you have a daughter?

421
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,599
I hope your daughter
gets fooled by her boyfriend,

422
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,226
gets cussed at, and beaten up.

423
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,978
And I hope he uses her video
to threaten her too.

424
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,857
I hope she goes through
everything I went through.

425
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,322
My gosh.

426
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,659
She's one disrespectful wench.

427
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,832
I won't let her
walk all over me like this.

428
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,877
This is a fact. I saw and heard it myself.

429
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,171
Gosh, I had no idea.

430
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,006
What did we say to her?

431
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
We told her to move at once,
calling her a home-wrecker.

432
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,971
Ms. Kim, what do we do?

433
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,514
This is why I said earlier

434
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,933
that Unit 506 didn't seem
like that kind of person.

435
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,269
I guess you ladies caused trouble again.

436
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,687
Miss.

437
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,814
Or sister.

438
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,567
The writer of the original post
and most of the commenters

439
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,277
have the same IP address.

440
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,571
This means the malicious post,
the hate comments,

441
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,866
and her personal information were
all posted by the same person.

442
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,952
I think someone intended
to slander Unit 506.

443
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,245
Is it one person?

444
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,163
Someone…

445
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,497
Who?

446
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,665
…intended this?

447
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,960
Wait. This means what we saw earlier was…

448
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,964
-She did that on purpose!
-Yes!

449
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,675
What a sneaky old hag!

450
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,448
They say one truly sincere ally is
all one needs.

451
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,201
You know they say that.

452
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,373
Now I have someone on my side,
I feel like I understand what it means.

453
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:59,214
Knowing that I have someone
who trusts me and who I can trust

454
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,718
gives me the courage
to fight against it all.

455
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,684
So when you said, "someone on your side,"

456
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,480
you meant the big…

457
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,775
The big barking dog
that doesn't bite women.

458
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,070
Yes, it's him.

459
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,864
He's on my side.

460
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,995
These days, I feel pretty good at times,

461
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,998
and I laugh a lot.

462
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,250
But then…

463
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,169
Well…

464
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,506
But then I got angry again.

465
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,973
Is it the trigger
that you mentioned earlier

466
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,725
that made you angry?

467
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,561
Yes, that's right.

468
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:04,070
I got so angry

469
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,239
that I almost lost control.

470
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:16,457
SHOCKING! FOOTAGE OF CHEONGDAM-DONG
DATING VIOLENCE GOES VIRAL

471
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,336
I don't understand
how she endured this all alone.

472
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,554
I'm worried
something might have happened to her.

473
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,974
I'm worried she might be
crying alone somewhere

474
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:37,812
and might end up saying
she'll run away again.

475
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,525
I mean, I can't stop worrying about her.
I can't get her out of my head.

476
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,329
So that's what makes you angry.

477
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,001
Yes, that's right.

478
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,989
Hey, Unit 506.

479
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,242
Can we talk for a second?

480
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,086
I'll go first.

481
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,546
I can't move out.

482
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,465
In fact, I won't.

483
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,180
Of course. You don't have any reason to.

484
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,516
There is no place like this.

485
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,309
Right. It's not moving season either.

486
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,980
And weren't you joining the Women's
Association? You can't move then.

487
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,690
This is great.

488
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,358
We're short-handed these days.

489
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,442
That's right.

490
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,528
You really will be joining us, right?

491
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,036
Yes, I'm joining the Women's Association.

492
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,955
There's no reason not to.

493
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,708
You're right. You're absolutely right.

494
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,210
-There's no reason not to.
-This is great.

495
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,758
So…

496
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,055
I heard that the post
on the mothers' community

497
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,807
was not true.

498
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,270
You should have told us it wasn't.

499
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,440
Well, you know, because of that lady,

500
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,026
we had a misunderstanding.

501
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,612
We're sorry.

502
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,990
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

503
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,538
It's fine now that you know.

504
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,374
It's not fine.

505
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,878
You may say you're fine,

506
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,005
but we are not fine with this.

507
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,717
Now you're now a member of us,
the Women's Association,

508
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,136
it is not your own problem.

509
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,638
This is a challenge to us as a whole

510
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,849
and also an insult
to this entire apartment complex.

511
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,643
And there is no way
we will just sit back and watch.

512
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,189
Now, you can rely on us.

513
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,276
-Let's go.
-Okay.

514
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,494
Let's go.

515
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,374
Snap.

516
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,919
-Snap. That's weird.
-Just like that.

517
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,080
I heard you donated a lot of money

518
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,666
at the charity bazaar again.

519
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,085
Well, it's not a big deal.

520
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:37,885
Your amazing character and faith
are beyond our imagination.

521
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,638
No wonder you have such a great son.

522
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:44,118
