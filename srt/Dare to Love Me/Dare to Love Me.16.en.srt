Geez, my precious money.

62

Did you do all this for something so trivial?

63

Did you threaten someone's life...

64

Do you know what someone can get with money?

67

I suppose you never got the taste of money

68
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,370
in that tiny village. What would you know?

69
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,370
Even if you can conquer the world with money,

70
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,970
how could it be more precious than a person?

71
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,260
Don't act superior.

72
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,710

73

you look just like your father.

74
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,490
Your father said the same thing.

75
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,530
The treasures in the village storage might be precious,

76
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,420
but what would be the use of them without people?

77
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,380
But still. What if someone steals them after you reveal them?

78
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,180
No.

79
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,230
I want to reveal the treasures in the storage when we open up the village

80
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,850
so people can see and feel the treasures

81
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,650
we inherited from our ancestors.

82
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,810
Since it is a good day for the village, opening to the public,

83
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,380
I think I will reveal the most precious thing first.

84

90

94

How dare you think so lightly of people's lives?

95
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,100
Is superficial wealth more important than people's lives?

96
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,400
You people...

97
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,880

But money never dies.

101
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,220

As you said...

109
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,890

(Sounds like "can't sleep")

549
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,960
What do you do when you can't sleep?

550
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,670
You have me. Say, ah.

551
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,150
It's okay to eat during the day.

552
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,020
The next piece is the masterpiece of the late Joseon era you all know of.

553
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,020
It's Cheolhwa Baekja.

554
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:50,120
Yes, we'll start at...

555
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,250
200,000 won.

556
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,610
200,000 won, anyone?

557
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,840
200,000 won. 210,000 won.

558
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,360
220,000 won. 230,000 won, anyone?

559
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,170
Okay, I'll give you three seconds.

560
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,060
Three, two, one. Sold!

561
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,540
- What?
- What's this?

562
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,220
Geez.

563
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,260
What's going on?

564
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,800
What? Why won't it open?

565
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,120
It's not opening?

566
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,700
Geez, this feels familiar.

567
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,470
I heard there are people who buy and sell

568
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:45,810
counterfeit cultural heritage these days. So I stopped by.

569
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,390
Do you...

570
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,090
buy or sell?

571
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,880
Or do you create counterfeits?

572
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,530
Seongsan Village...

573
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,870
Long time no see.

574
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:06,330
Gosh, I know.

575
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,710
It's good to see you again.

576
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,310
Oh, this?

577
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,550
We didn't steal it. It's fake. Fake.

578
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,690
People are so skillful these days.

579
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,020
It's a Grade-A fake.

580
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,580
Could you forgive me just once?

581
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:33,230
Counterfeits like this decrease the value of cultural heritage

582
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:37,550
and confuse the public. How could you not know that?

583
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:42,740
I will warn you this time, but next time,

584
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,300
you will have to pay for the crime.

585
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,810
Thank you!

586
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,900
Attention, everyone. Salut!

587
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,060
Salut!

588
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,280
Let's leave. Let's leave. Take this.

589
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,180
Thank you.

590
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,800
What? I was in the restroom.

591
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
Is it already over?

592
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,540
Let us grab a meal nearby.

593
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:26,190
Seeing you two protecting our inheritance from the ancestors

594
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,960
make me feel very happy.

595
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,460
I think it is time for me to bequeath the village to you.

596
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,280
Before that,

597
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,530
let me ask you one thing.

598
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:46,290
What is the most precious treasure to you?

599
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:48,260
- It's people.
- It's people.

600
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,980
There are many expensive, rare,

601
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,190
and endlessly valuable treasures in this world,

602
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,150
but nothing is more precious

603
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,000
than people.

604
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,370
Yes, you are right.

605
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,800
Whether they are impressive, ordinary,

606
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,930
or seemingly humble,

607
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,820
everyone is a treasure you cannot look down on.

608
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,330
Remember that always.

609
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:21,660
I will.

610
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,090
I will.

611
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:45,430
Teacher, the night view is beautiful tonight as well.

612
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,820
How are you?

613
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,610
Hong Do.

614
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,890

615
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,130
Congratulations.

616
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,320

618
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,450
