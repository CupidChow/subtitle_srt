Your mother really wants to see you.

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,270
Yes, it is not your place.

22
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,660
You know nothing about it, but you reached a conclusion.

23
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,860
And you are forcing me like this.

24
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,250
I will not listen even though it is coming from you, Teacher.

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,940
Since you are already here-

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,850

How much longer will you keep your guard up like that?

32
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,810
Will you continue to close yourself up

33
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,880
for the rest of your life without letting anyone in?

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,700
I find that easier.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,960
Easier?

36
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,430
Is it really easy to ignore the people who love and worry about you?

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,880
No one can always live alone.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,640
Even though it's hard, you have to worry, care,

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,660
and try to understand each other.

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,550
Living together like that, even though it gets difficult.

41
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,730
Isn't that what happiness is about?

42
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,410
Being together is happy?

43
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,990
I mistakenly thought that briefly, too.

44
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,950
I mean,

45
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,400
I wanted to be mistaken.

46
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,840
But to me,

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,570
that is not everything.

48
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,930
I have things I need to do, protect,

49
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,420
and a heart that should not waver.

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,250
I cannot be tricked by the happiness of being together

51
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,630
and neglect those things.

walk toward where the cuckoos are cooing for about 30 minutes.

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,560
- My gosh!
- Aigoo! Aigoo!

187
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,550
My gosh, my gosh! My goodness!

188
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,750
Aigoo. Seriously. I cannot believe it.

189
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,280
I have things I need to do, protect,

190
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,140
and a heart that should not waver.

191
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,510
I cannot be tricked by the happiness of being together

192
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,910
and neglect those things.

193
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,080
How much longer will you keep your guard up like that?

194
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,160
Will you continue to close yourself up

195
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,650
for the rest of your life without letting anyone in?

196
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,310
Yoon Bok, I think Mom will pass away soon.

197
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,740
Young Master, are you awake?

198
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,620
Young Master.

199
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,430
[Pi *** Won]

200
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,200
You avoided me whenever I went to see you.

201
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,790
Is this how you avoid me this time?

202
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,620
I came to ask you something.

203
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,470
Why...

204
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,200
did you abandon me?

205
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,360
Do you know how much I waited for you?

206
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,760
I waited nonstop every day.

207
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,230
But you still did not come.

208
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,740
How could you show up in this state?

209
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,940
I cannot forgive you, Mother.

210
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,930
That is why I will...

211
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,790
abandon you this time.

212
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,130
Geez, we're so busy. Why isn't the part-timer here?

213
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,920
I know. She didn't even call in.

214
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,110
Why is the kitchen such a mess?

215
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,450
- I'm sorry.
- Tidy up immediately.

216
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,470
I'll clean up right now.

217
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,670
I don't think I could come to work for a few days.

218
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,150
- What's going on?
- I have a situation at home.

219
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,050
I'm sorry.

220
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,250
Yi Bok.

221
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm here.

222
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,570
Thank you.

223
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,870
[National Police Agency]

224
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,740
Young Master, did you stay up all night?

225
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,270
This is the only spot where the truck has been without a CCTV.

226
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,700
I need to find a way to find out what happened at that spot.

227
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,100
Oh, okay.

228
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,940
When did the weather get so cold?

229
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,860
What is this?

230
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,020
I bought it in Seoul while waiting for you. It's not much.

231
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,370
What is it?

232
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,260
Come on.

233
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,380
Open it after I go inside.

234
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,480
What's wrong with him?

235
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,250
My goodness.

236
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,280
Geez...

237
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,060
Geez, he's so silly.

238
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,820
Silly?

239
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,950
Silly...

240
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,370
How warm.

241
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,140
- Yeojudaek.
- Yes?

242
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,760
Deliver this to His Excellency Lee for me.

243
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,680
By chance, is this...

244
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,650
Let Yoon Bok know, too.

245
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,330
Okay.

246
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,820
What? We got what?

247
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,810
Father.

248
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,080
Father, is it true we received a wedding proposal from Yoon Bok's family?

249
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,430
is it true we received a wedding proposal from Yoon Bok's family?

250
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,530
We will have to choose a nice day.

251
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,560
Father!

252
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,300
Young Master.

253
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,990
What is going on?

254
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,120
I just heard from Yeokjudaek.

255
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,910
The Master sent...

256
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,720
a wedding proposal to Lady Se Ryeong's house.

257
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,600
Wedding proposal?

258
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,890
Young Master, are you getting married?

259
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,750
I thought I made myself clear to him.

260
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,480
But he ended up making that decision.

261
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,140
Is this an arranged marriage that I've only heard about?

262
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,030
Will you really do it?

263
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,670
I do not want to, but how could I avoid it?

264
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,220
I wonder if Camille is doing well over there.

265
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,310
I cannot reach her.

266
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,290
She needs to drink at least two cappuccinos a day.

267
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,740
She's probably doing okay since we haven't heard from her yet.

268
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,300
They say no news means good news.

269
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,020
[Yi Bok]

270
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,480
Excuse me.

271
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,440
Hey, Yi Bok.

272
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,310
Will you stay in the village today, too?

273
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,860
I will ask Grandfather about the wedding proposal

274
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,020
and practice swordsmanship all night.

275
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,730
- Hello?
- Is this Ms. Pi Hye Won's son?

276
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,460
Your mother has passed away.

277
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,120
[Pi Hye Won]

278
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,740
I feel so sorry for my mom...

279
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:49,350
...

280
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,150
I'm glad you came, Yoon Bok.

281
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,920
I came because I thought this was my last duty.

282
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,310
That is the only reason.

283
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,830
Wait, Yoon Bok.

284
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,480
Wait just a moment. I'll be right back.

285
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,710
Yoon Bok.

286
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,970
You're here.

287
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,210
You haven't eaten, right? Come. Let's eat.

288
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,880
No.

289
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,760
I am okay.

290
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,980
What is this?

291
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,890
Mom asked me to give this to you.

292
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,910
Make sure to open it.

293
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,580
And...

294
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,870
thank you for coming.

295
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,630
Mom asked me to give this to you.

296
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,900
My dear son, Yoon Bok.

297
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:20,960
I'm sorry I hurt you so much when I left you.

298
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:27,420
You might not be able to forgive me for what I did,

299
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,710
but consider this as my last wish

300
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,060
and listen to me just this once.

301
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,030
I married your father when I was 20 years old.

302
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,670
Since the marriage was arranged a long time ago,

303
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,630
I wasn't able to make a different decision.

304
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,010
There you go.

305
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,500
All right.

306
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,060
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!

307
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,740
Peekaboo!

308
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,260
What do you think? Isn't he cute?

309
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,480
Mom, Yoon Bok is so cute.

310
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,030
I was so happy when a precious and sweet baby

311
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,690
like you were born, Yoon Bok.

312
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,830
You're the Woorim family's eldest son who will lead this village.

313
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,390
You do not have enough time to study literature and martial arts.

314
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,670
How could you do something so useless?

315
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,680
How dare you shed tears?

316
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,710
But whenever I saw how much pressure you were under as a young boy,

317
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,620
my heart shattered into pieces.

318
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,660
Are you bringing that up again?

319
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,280
I told you many times that we cannot open up the village.

320
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:58,260
Father, the children should be able to decide what kind of life they want to live.

321
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,620
I cannot let them live like me.

322
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,010
Old things are bound to get destroyed if you leave them as they are.

323
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,520
I agree with her about this matter. So, please-

324
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,630
Quiet!

325
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,980
You are the Woorim family's eldest son and the village's future leader.

326
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,080
How could you say that?

327
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,620
Are you in the right mind?

328
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,200
What a fool.

329
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,770
Due to our relentless persuasion,

330
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,980
Grandfather allowed us to open up the village.

331
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,650
Brought to you from Seongsan Village-

332
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,920
Fire! Fire!

333
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,560
Fire!

334
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,770
What's going on?

335
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,920
But an unexpected tragedy occurred.

336
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,960
I opened up the village because of you, and as a result,

337
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,030
my son died.

338
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,650
You killed my son, Sa Do.

339
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,560
Leave immediately.

340
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,330
Father,

341
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,610
how could you-

342
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,220
I cannot let you care for my grandchildren.

343
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,350
Leave if you understand me! I cannot bear to see you!

344
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,770
How could you tell me to...

345
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,930
leave my children?

346
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,510
Please let me take the children with me.

347
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,080
What are you talking about?

348
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:20,300
Are you really trying to cut off the Woorim family's bloodline?

349
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,810
I will die if you tell me to.

350
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,880
Rather than leaving them behind,

351
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,840
I would rather...

352
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,850
I would rather follow Sa Do.

353
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,680
Father, please...

354
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,930
Yoon Bok will do his duty for the village.

355
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,980
Father!

356
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,700
I cannot. Please...

357
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,040
I cannot!

358
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,940
I will be generous and let you leave with Yi Bok.

359
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,320
Do not ever look for or think of Yoon Bok.

360
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,390
You will have to keep that in mind.

361
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,510
...

362
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,980
That is why I had to leave you behind alone

363
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,740
and leave with your sister.

364
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,160
Let me see him just once.

365
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,960
Let me see my Yoon Bok just once.

366
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,160
My apologies, Madam.

367
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,760
The Master told me never to let you in.

368
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,860
Stop coming here.

369
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,200
Father...

370
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,750
When I think about my son, who died so tragically,

371
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,210
I can never forgive you,

372
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,210
but I cannot stop your maternal love.

373
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,260
Once Yoon Bok inherits the duty,

374
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,050
I will bring you back, then. So...

375
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,680
promise me you will not tempt Yoon Bok and

376
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,070
live far away as if you do not exist.

377
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,500
But-

378
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,150
If you cannot accept that, do not even dream of

379
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,620
seeing Yoon Bok even til the day you die.

380
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,280
That is why...

381
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,770
I had to lose you...

382
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,500
in order to get you back.

383
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,520
Enjoy.

384
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,650
Welcome.

385
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,620
Is there someone named Pi Hye Won here, by chance?

386
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,030
A student in a school uniform and gat is here.

387
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,640
Please tell him there's no such person.

388
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,340
Wait, where are you going?

389
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,070
...

390
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,740
...

391
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,220
...

392
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,590
Yoon Bok...

393
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,760
I'm sorry.

394
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,640
It's my fault.

395
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,560
It's my fault.

396
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
Yoon Bok...

397
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,370
Yoon Bok...

398
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,600
In the end,

399
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,740
I was punished for leaving you behind.

400
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,290
She got over the critical state,

401
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,090
but she's in a very serious condition.

402
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,670
More than dying...

403
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,950
I was more afraid of leaving without

404
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,780
asking you for forgiveness.

405
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,790
Yi Bok,

406
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,800
make sure to find Yoon Bok.

407
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,520
Find him...

408
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,760
and stay by his side.

409
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,150
I will.

410
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:02,490
I'll stay by his side even if he doesn't want me to.

411
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,600
You don't have to forgive this foolish mom.

412
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:28,060
But I hope you don't hate your only sister, Yi Bok.

413
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,880
My son,

414
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,470
Yoon Bok.

415
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,310
I wish I get to see your face for one last time.

416
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,670
I cannot forgive you, Mother.

417
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,690
That is why I will...

418
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,500
abandon you this time.

419
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,500
You must've suffered so much all this time.

420
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,760
You must've felt so lonely.

421
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,300
I'll take all of your pain and loneliness with me.

422
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,360
Take down the wall you built because of me,

423
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,080
and I hope you love freely

424
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,050
and enjoy the things you like all you want.

425
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:40,500
I'm ashamed to even call your name. My son, Yoon Bok.

426
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,710
Although I've been a poor mother,

427
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,750
my heart has always been by your side.

428
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,440
Son,

429
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,350
I love you.

430
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,580
I mean...

431
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,260
I loved you.

432
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,490
Mother...

433
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,440
Camille is staying in the village?

434
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,370
I might be the leader of the village,

435
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,760
but I cannot force the villagers to open up the village.

436
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,080
If she considers the village only as a stage for her show for commercial reasons,

437
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,240
she would never get the villagers to be on board.

438
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,350
That is why I gave her a chance for her to persuade the villagers.

439
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,880
What is wrong, Young Master?

440
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,900
...

441
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,120
What are you doing?

442
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,200
How could you have done that?

443
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,450
I have a guest. Behave yourself.

444
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,460
Why did you tell me a lie?

445
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,460
You said, my mother...

446
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,440
abandoned me.

447
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,440
Sir, I'll get going now.

448
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,580
Telling the truth would not have changed anything.

449
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,630
You still should have told me the truth.

450
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,970
Do you know how I felt then?

451
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,630
99.

452
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,530
I thought I was left alone in this world.

453
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,660
Hoping that it is a prank,

454
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,170
I fell asleep every night counting numbers.

455
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,810
The ones I loved the most...

456
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,560
After the people I believed to have loved me the most left,

457
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,920
I could not love or...

458
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,900
believe anyone.

459
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,580
You are not the only one who lost your family.

460
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,480
I lost my son, too!

461
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,280
So, after I lost my father,

462
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,950
you took away my mother and sister, too?

463
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,560
You knew I visited Mother, too. How could you...

464
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,290
How could you be so cruel to me?

465
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,710
Because I did not want you to waver.

466
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,260
You are destined to lead this village in the future-

467
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,080
That stupid destiny!

468
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,700
I will put that behind me now.

469
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,590
If splitting up my family

470
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,910
and not being with my mother in her last moment is my destiny,

471
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,990
I will reject it now.

472
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:10,570
Y-Young Master, what do you mean by that?

473
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,700
Last moment?

474
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,590
Did Madam, by chance...

475
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,670
Not only did I not send her off,

476
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,730
I became the worst son who blamed her until the very end.

477
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,500
She wanted to see me so badly.

478
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,040
I really...

479
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,410
regret it so much that I might lose my mind.

480
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,860
I will no longer live like this anymore.

481
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,600
W-What do you mean...

482
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,020
by that?

483
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,840
I will free myself...

484
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,830
from preserving tradition, inheriting the village, or getting married.

485
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,980
I will not do anything you planned for me.

486
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,970
Like Mother said,

487
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,440
I will do what I want to do

488
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,520
and live freely.

489
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,530
Young Master! Young Master!

490
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,900
Aigoo! Master! Master!

491
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,900
[ ]

492
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,200
Is he home?

493
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,870
Yoon Bok.

494
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,140
Yoon Bok!

495
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,060
Yoon Bok, are you home?

496
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,050
I'm coming in, okay?

497
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,230
Yoon Bok.

498
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,980
Did he go somewhere?

499
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,280
[Ms. Kim Hong Do]

500
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,380
It's pouring.

501
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,890
Where did he go without an umbrella?

502
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,190
- Hi, Mom.
- Joon Ho.

503
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,770
Go see the Young Master.

504
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,650
Yoon Bok?

505
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,000
I heard the Madam passed away.

506
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,880
I have a situation at home.

507
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,360
I'm sorry.

508
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,810
[ ]

509
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,950
Father!

510
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,740
I cannot. Please...

511
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,930
Do not ever look for or think of Yoon Bok.

512
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,520
I did not realize my cruel words...

513
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,750
would actually come true.

514
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:15,310
You must have blamed your father-in-law

515
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:18,480
for forcing you to leave your son.

516
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,460
I am sorry...

517
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,060
my daughter-in-law.

518
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,730

01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:17,000
[Epilogue]

552
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,030
Where was the bathroom again?

553
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,110
Madam Yeoju!

554
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,930
Madam Yeoju!

555
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:15,200
Madam Yeoju!

556
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,640
♫ For me, if it's you, it's all right ♫

557
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,130
[Dare to Love Me]

558
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,620
Yoon Bok changed.

559
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,030
By chance, does Yoon Bok really like me?

560
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,420
I do not think so.

561
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,230
One can do that out of respect alone.

562
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,350
You must be mistaken.

563
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:40,130
Am I fooling myself because I like Yoon Bok so much?

564
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,400
Please do not leave.

565
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,100
♫ Waited for me like a tall tree ♫

566
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,880
♫ Just thinking about it warms me up ♫
