368
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,340
I had a really hard time after you left me.

369
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,440
I cried for a long time, blaming you.

370
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,810
It's important to do your duty.

371
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:36,580
But would it be meaningful if you hurt the ones you love to commit to it?

372
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,090
No duty is more important than a person.

Although I'm obviously grateful you did.

Seeing the Master being upset because of the Young Master

378
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,950

You worry about them whether you're with them or not.

Why are you talking as if you have a child?

Gosh, you must miss them a lot.

The thing is...

392
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,810
I guess he has a girlfriend outside the village.

They are indeed from China.

I confirmed that they checked into a hotel.

409
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,150
They made a reservation at a restaurant.

But that restaurant was...

411
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,210

- Yes.

412
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,840

Hello!

550
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,640
Director, you came early.

551
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,280
I'm not early. Looks like the event was delayed.

552
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,230
Not at all. Should we have champagne, Director?

553
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,350
I was inspired by the pichohye in Seongsan Village.

554
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,230
What do you think?

555
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,850
These are...

556
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,580
Hong Do Kim, are you okay?

557
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,870
Yes, I'm okay.

558
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:55,530
Go to the hospital first.

559
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,260
Let us do that.

Pardon me.

562
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,200
How did it go?

563
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,020
The fan in the village was fake?

564
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,520
Okay.

565
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,510
Going in now.

566
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,150
- Did you see Ms. Camille?
- Yes, she said I can go.

567
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,260
I'll look for a hospital nearby.

[Friday at Seongsan Hall]

569
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,210
Teacher, please wait a moment.

570
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,610
Okay.

[Run]

572
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,750
They're probably trying to make a deal with Gamjjok.

573
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,890
Is there a problem?

574
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,300
Sister!

575
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,760
Sister, are you okay?

576
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,180
I think they're here to meet Gamjjok.

577
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,650
What's with them? Follow them.

578
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,180
Don't ever ambush them alone.

579
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,530
Okay.

580
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,820
Young Master.

581
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,700
I sent my guys. What happened?

582
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,310
What's going on?

583
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,180
He asked where the back door was.

584
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,140
I asked why, and he started running.

585
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,230
What are you talking about? Let go!

586
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,720
I caught him because he seemed suspicious.

587
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,180
Who are you?

588
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,420
Well, I'm with the police.

589
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,950
Just one second.

590
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,000
What? Are you with the Cultural Heritage Administration?

591
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,700
Yes, I'm a government worker. A civil servant.

592
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,390
Is this yours?

593
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,260
Yes, why?

594
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,570
It is a piece of cultural heritage that was stolen in Seongsan Village.

595
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,190
What are you talking about? It's not mine!

596
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,860
You said it was yours just now.

597
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,870
- No-
- Let's talk at the police station.

598
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,470
Huh? That's not mine!

599
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,800
That's not mine!

600
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,900
We need witness testimony. Please stop by the station when you can.

601
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Okay.

602
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,430
Wow, what's happening?

603
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,640
Could you explain the situation of your arrest again?

604
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,410
I finally decided to buy a pair of Camille shoes.

605
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,590
I put them down very briefly, but...

606
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,790
Who's that? Hey! Hey!

607
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,960
Hey, you! Stop!

608
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,780
The owner happened to be leaving.

609
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,580
So I asked him where the back door was.

610
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,370
But he suddenly jumped on me.

611
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:38,610
Is that man really telling the truth?

612
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,900
Or is it a lie?

613
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,410
Aigoo, I'm so sorry.

614
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,110
You've been working so hard to catch Gamjjok.

615
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,700
But I ended up stealing your thunder.

616
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,140
Not at all. We can relax a bit, thanks to you.

617
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,960
They say it's always dark under the lamp.

618
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,770
Who would've thought Gamjjok has been using the Seongsan Hall to make deals?

619
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:13,930
I would've told you first if I had known.

620
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,470
- Are you done writing it?
- Yes.

621
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,570
I wrote down everything I saw and heard.

622
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,800
Okay. Please come to my desk for a moment.

623
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,230
Okay.

624
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,850
The fact that Gamjjok has been making deals in Seongsan Hall

625
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,500
is something only the police have been assuming.

626
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,960
