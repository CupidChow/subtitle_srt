Since all we ever knew was Seongsan Village and had to leave suddenly...

and live freely from now on.

187
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,590
Master, this is Yoon Ah.

188
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,530
Come in.

189
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,280
How is Yoon Bok doing?

190
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,750
Since the funeral,

191
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,190
he has been living with Lady Yi Bok.

192
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,540
Yes.

193
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,590
He needs time to feel comforted since he went through a lot.

194
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,560
You should help him get back to where he belongs soon.

195
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,540
- Yes, sir.
- Stop by and update me often.

196
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,930
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,580
He must be worn out physically and mentally grieving.

198
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,950
You should take good care of him, Yoon Ah.

199
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,470
- I will.
- Is he feeling sick at all?

200
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,020
He does not appear to be sick.

201
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,130
Is he not having a hard time?

202
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,190
He does not appear to be.

203
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,920
But he has been kind of strange.

204
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,590
Why? Is something wrong with him?

205
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,240
No, no. It is not like that.

206
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,830
He just changed a bit.

207
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,270
- What do you mean?
- He just...

208
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,710
did.

209
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,310
Yes.

210
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,420
Anyway, he is not his old self anymore.

211
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,980
Yoon Bok.

212
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,330
Teacher.

213
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,400
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,560
Artist Kim told me to draw that.

215
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,780
How was your day?

216
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,640
Did you stay warm?

217
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,990
Yes, thanks to you.

218
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,820
Have you had dinner?

219
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,450
Not yet.

220
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,470
Have you eaten?

221
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,710
I have not yet, either.

222
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,910
Should we eat together, then?

223
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,370
Yes!

224
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,510
Yes.

225
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,890
He has no issue sharing a table anymore, either.

226
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,070
Teacher,

227
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,210
eat more.

228
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,260
Okay, thank you.

229
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,710
By chance, am I fooling myself

230
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,610
because I like Yoon Bok so much?

231
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,800
- By chance...
- Where's a plate...

232
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,980
Do you want a plate?

233
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,170
I will get it.

234
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,530
No. To say I'm fooling myself,

235
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,360
Yoon Bok is acting too out of the ordinary.

236
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,740
Teacher,

237
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,110
please sit here.

238
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,970
- Next to you?
- Yes.

239
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,550
Okay.

240
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,780
By chance...

241
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,900
does Yoon Bok really like me?

242
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,020
Teacher, please have some.

243
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,240
Thank you.

244
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,890
- You should have some, too.
- Please go ahead.

245
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,280
Fine. Here.

246
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,100
He's a student who cares for his teacher. My student.

247
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,080
He's being polite, you know.

248
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,330
I say, "Be." You say, "Polite."

249
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,710
Maybe you got sick because you've been through a lot.

250
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,240
Take care of yourself.

251
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,290
Is it because I'm tired?

252
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,440
Here.

253
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,820
You used to want this whenever you got sick.

254
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,590
Mom used to make this for me.

255
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,830
Eat it while it's hot.

256
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,730
Thank you.

257
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,570
Let me do it.

258
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,990
It was a lot of work to make that.

259
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,700
So make sure to finish it.

260
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,860
Sitting here like this reminds me of the old days.

261
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,470
We were so happy then.

262
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,190
Right?

263
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,080
You bastard!

264
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,180
How dare you make the precious child sick?

265
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,610
I'm glad...

266
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,000
that it's a happy memory for you.

267
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,970
To me, it was a scar I couldn't recover from.

268
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,680
The villagers are complaining about your scream every night.

269
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,580
I told you to open their hearts, but you only open their eardrums.

270
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,970
Try living there for a day.

271
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,410
See if you can help screaming.

272
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,390
I don't know where the cuckoo is, either.

273
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,320
That is why I got you a room in the Woorim House.

274
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,200
Stay here from now on. Make yourself at-

275
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,640
I'll make myself at home, then.

276
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,450
This room is in much better condition.

277
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,080
Right.

278
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,610
I heard about what happened at the tea house.

279
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,340
Looks like you are having a hard time having people open up to you.

280
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,360
Feel free to leave anytime if you want to give up.

281
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm Camille.

282
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,010
I don't know how to give up.

283
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,720
So, don't worry about stuff like that.

284
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,400
I can manage to open up their hearts.

285
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,700
Come on. Stop touching them so much.

286
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,790
This is so pretty.

287
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,760
Which pair is the most popular?

288
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,830
These are popular...

289
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,540
and these are popular, too.

290
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,030
Ooh-la-la.

291
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,180
What's this?

292
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,210
You mean the pichohye?

293
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,030
Pichohye?

294
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,030
They are leather sandals that were trendy a few centuries ago.

295
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,370
No one wants them since they have been forgotten.

296
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,580
How could that happen to these beautiful shoes?

297
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,990
I'll buy these.

298
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,440
[#Pichohye #KoreanTraditionalShoes #CamilleinSeongsanVillage]

299
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,110
Where does the internet work again?

300
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,760
["Strong Woman, Oh Yoon Ah" Episode 1]

301
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,040
This must be a new series.

302
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,440
Okay. Let me make a comment.

303
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,200
Please upload the...

304
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,680
next episode soon.

305
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,350
Otherwise, I'll get sick waiting.

306
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,060
Gosh, I'm getting wi-fi here.

307
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,030
My gosh.

308
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,330
It worked!

309
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,560
Look at these. They're so pretty.

310
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,940
Wow, so pretty.

311
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,070
That woman made these.

312
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,010
- Have a look.
- Wow.

313
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,070
Wow, these are so pretty.

314
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,510
- They're daebak. Daebak.
- That lady made these?

315
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,100
Yes, yes. They are so pretty.

316
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,660
- Here you go.
- I hope you sell a lot.

317
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
I will have a pair of pichohye.

318
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,560
- What is your size?
- Two muns and a half.

319
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,410
Hold on a moment.

320
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,640
- Mr. Shoemaker.
- Yes.

321
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,170
I will take a pair, too.

322
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,710
- What is your size?
- Two muns.

323
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,500
Okay, got it.

324
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,060
Here you go.

325
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,040
Yes. Aigoo.

326
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,000
I want to buy pichohye.

327
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,830
My goodness. How does a young lady like you know pichohye?

328
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,010
- I will have a pair, too.
- Pardon?

329
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,020
- I will have them, too.
- Do you have a different style?

330
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,230
This is overwhelming.

331
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,860
Line up, then!

332
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,260
Aigoo. Here they are.

333
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,840
Are you in there?

334
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:27,780
By chance, if you're offended that I altered your work,

335
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,750
I apologize.

336
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,800
No.

337
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,240
I am here to thank you.

338
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,790
Thanks to you, the forgotten traditional shoes are getting popular again.

339
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,200
It makes me so happy.

340
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,170
You saved a tradition that could have been erased.

341
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,310
You're exaggerating.

342
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,480
Most of all, I was quite impressed with

343
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,370
your skills and creativity.

344
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,650
How about we do more, then?

345
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,130
If there are a few more items like pichohye,

346
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,690
you should collaborate with me.

347
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,580
Collaborate?*
(Sounds like "pick one" in Korean)

348
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,940
What am I supposed to pick?

349
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,700
My gosh.

350
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,010
She wants to open a popup store to collaborate with Mr. Shoemaker.

351
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,410
Wow.

352
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,610
The villagers must be starting to open up to her.

353
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,810
The stubborn old men are changing their minds.

354
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,570
They must finally start to like Camille, too.

355
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,240
By the way, why are you walking so far away from me?

356
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,960
I cannot dare to step on your shadow.

357
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,920
Why are you sitting there, then?

358
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,160
As I said, a teacher is like a king and father.

359
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,570
I cannot dare to share a table with you.

360
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,230
Teacher,

361
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,590
eat more.

362
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,460
I never thought Yoon Bok would change, either.

363
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,470
But he changed so much.

364
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,500
Is he starting to like me, by chance?

365
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,210
Or is he not?

366
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,610
Yoon Bok likes me. He doesn't like me.

367
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,470
He likes me. He doesn't.

368
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,110
He likes me.

369
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,020
He doesn't.

370
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,810
Should I just call and ask him?

371
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,320
No, what if we grow apart again?

372
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,340
I don't even want to think about it.

Your boyfriend cheated.

378
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,370
It's nothing compared to a cheating husband.

(Means, "Nothing compared to")

380
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,350
I'm torn between Korean and English majors.

381
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,970
You can't decide between Korean and English?

382
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,660
Yes.

383
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,610
If so, it's bubble tea.

384
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,760
- Bubble tea?
- Count each bubble and eat it slowly.

385
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,480
If it's an odd number, it's Korean.

386
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,450
If it's an even number, it's English. Okay?

387
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,010
Okay.

388
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,370
What's your worry?

Hong Do?

392
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,980
I was totally screwed after you left.

393
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,100
I got on the industry blacklist for copying your design.

394
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,770
It was difficult to stay.

395
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,110
So I decided not to stay.

396
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,220
She sure is privileged.

397
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,490
I thought about what I was good at besides making clothes.

398
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,900
You know, too. I'm good at listening to other people's worries.

399
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,470
- You are?
- Yes.

400
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,950
I thought about you a lot while listening to others' relationship issues.

401
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,720
I was reminded of getting duped by that Lee Do Yeong bastard, too.

402
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,570
Oh, did you break up?

403
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,000
What did he say when I said I'd quit?

404
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,080
Yes, "fake." He called me a fake!

405
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,490
He said you were the real deal.

406
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,480
That crazy bastard.

407
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,820
That's totally his repertoire.

408
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,950
He told me you were the real deal and I was fake.

409
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,390
Hong Do,

410
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,880
just one moment.

411
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,280
Okay.

412
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,920
It's an apple pie.

413
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,260
I apologize*.
("Apologize" and "apple" is the same word in Korean)

414
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm sorry I copied your drawstring bag

415
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,260
and I'm sorry I misunderstood you only after listening to Lee Do Yeong.

416
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,670
Thank you for the pie.

What? He separated the perilla leaves for you?

420
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,380
We know the answer, then. He likes you.

421
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,540
You do that for your family members, too.

422
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,950
Hong Do, does he smile or not when he looks at you?

423
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,200
He smiles.

424
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,780
He likes you. He totally likes you!

425
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,160
If everyone who smiles likes you-

426
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,140
Men don't smile if they don't like you.

427
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,350
He smiles whenever he sees you.

428
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,130
He doesn't often smile, but he smiles at you.

429
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,110
He only smiles at you.

430
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,770
If it's one of these three, he's fond of you.

431
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,960
If two, he's flirting.

432
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,400
If all three, it's true love.

433
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,170
True love?

Come on. It's not like that.

436
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,990
Yoon Bok must be here.

437
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,010
You smile whenever you see the teacher,

438
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,030
you want to know where she is, when she's coming back,

439
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,140
and you want to be with her. Why do you think that is?

440
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,620
It's because you totally love her.

441
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,980
That is truly love...

442
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,060
Love?

443
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,580
It is not.

444
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,570
I have to be like that because she is my teacher.

445
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,650
Come on, it's not like that.

446
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,830
You're like that because you like her.

447
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,700
Yes, that's right. Good!

448
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,890
I have to disagree.

449
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:23,030
One can do that out of respect alone without being in love.

450
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,140
If the other person misinterprets it,

451
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,590
it is nothing but misunderstanding.

452
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,720
I suppose you do that to my sister.

453
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,100
W-What did you say just now?

454
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,720
You can do that with respect alone?

455
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,890
Seeing you helps me understand it.

456
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:56,130
Hey, I just realized I made a great mistake.

457
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,460
What?

458
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,800
I need to talk to the Teacher so she does not misunderstand.

459
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,480
Where are you going? We were in the middle of a meeting.

460
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,550
Where should I start changing the story?

461
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:39,950
One can do that out of respect alone without being in love.

462
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,400
It wasn't true love.

463
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,130
It was respect.

464
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,060
Respect...

465
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:03,110
She might not have understood my intention at all.

466
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,420
I should tell her honestly tomorrow.

467
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,780
Is the Teacher home?

468
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,300
She went to work, of course.

469
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,650
Already?

470
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,260
She left earlier than usual today.

471
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,970
- What's that?
- It's-

472
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,900
Sswanghwacha*?
(Medicinal herb tea)

473
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,830
Wow, this is the real deal.

474
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,010
Hold on, hold on. This is not yours.

475
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,050
- Let me take a sip-
- No.

476
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,760
It is mine.

477
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,520
It is mine.

478
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,810
I'm not ready yet.

479
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm not ready to be heartbroken!

480
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,830
Seongsan Hall?

481
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,210
I was looking for the areas without CCTVs

482
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,710
and I found Seongsan Hall.

483
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,290
And we found out that...

484
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:17,560
the products were untouched before they reached Seongsan Hall.

485
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,550
Seongsan Hall seems to be linked to this case?

486
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,170
The gangsters we caught recently said Seongsan Hall is...

487
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,060
where Gamjjok does trading.

488
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,710
So, that means Gamjjok can be behind this, too?

489
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,660
I'll check if there are any suspicious activities at Seongsan Hall.

490
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,730
All profits will be donated to the retrieval of cultural heritage.

491
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,550
You can promote the fashion show, the brand image,

492
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,340
and help the Cultural Heritage Administration greatly, too.

493
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,520
What do we need to prepare, then?

494
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:08,830
We'd like you to recommend a popup store location.

495
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,180
A place that can accommodate both Camille and Seongsan Village is...

496
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,460
Oh, I have a place in mind.

497
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,060
It must've been a difficult decision since the restaurant needs to be run, too.

498
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,260
Thank you so much for helping us.

499
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,870
Of course, I should help. It was the Director's request.

500
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,290
Take time to look around and make suggestions.

501
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,990
We'll prepare accordingly.

502
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,390
Thank you.

503
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,850
Well, then.

504
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,360
Wow.

505
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,410
I love this so much.

506
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,420
We can set the stage up here.

V.

508
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,710
I'll check out the backyard.

509
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,480
Okay.

510
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,140
Look at the flowers. My goodness.

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,900
And the impeccable proportion.

514
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,020
Are you interested in modeling, by chance?

515
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,620
I think you mistook me...

517
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,480
Are you from Camille?

518
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Yes. I'm from Camille.

519
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,190
Really?

520
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,900
Someone I know works at Camille, too.

521
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,320
Do you know someone named Kim Hong Do?

522
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,030
Kim Hong Do?

523
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:05,060
Kim Hong Do? Hong Do Kim? You know Hong Do Kim?

524
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,860
She's here with me.

525
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,250
Is the Teacher here, too?

526
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,040
Where...

527
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,200
Hong Do!

528
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,970
What are you doing there?

529
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,510
Teacher.

530
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,100
Hey, Yoon Bok. Hi.

531
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,210
Yoon Bok is here, too.

532
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,910
Is something going on?

533
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,920
I stopped by to see you,

534
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,340
but I needed to talk to the Teacher, too.

535
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,170
This is perfect.

536
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,400
Teacher, could you set some time aside for me-

537
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,560
My gosh! Look at the time!

538
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,020
I'm sorry. I need to get back to the office.

539
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,300
We don't have time right now, right?

540
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,780
We don't?

541
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,380
Not even just a moment?

542
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,770
I need to talk to you urgently.

543
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,280
Camille is waiting. I'm sorry.

544
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,640
Let's go.

545
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,110

547
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,040
Call me.

548
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,150
For some reason...

549
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:37,190
I detected Hong Do Kim's scent from that man.

550
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,500
- Pardon?
- Was that scarf his?

551
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,800
Gosh! No, he's not.

552
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,150
Gosh, no, no.

553
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,990
Let's go now.

554
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,850
Yes, it is him. Come on, girl.

555
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,030
Wait for me.

556
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,260
Hong Do Kim! Wait for me, I said!

557
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,570
You said you needed to talk to me.

558
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,840
What could it be? Need relationship advice?

559
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,740
To be honest,

560
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,230
I overheard your phone conversation with Detective Park.

561
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,200
Are we talking about the case again?

562
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,840
I said I can take care of it myself.

563
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,450
Gamjjok also seems to have been linked to the fire at Seongsan Village 17 years ago.

564
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,710
- What?
- He apparently has a wound on his arm.

565
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:42,250
Pay close attention to the visitors' arms.

566
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,750
Okay! Let's hurry!

567
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,750
Is the main course for table No. 3 not ready yet?

568
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,780
It's almost ready.

569
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,700
Okay, please hurry a bit.

570
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,440
What do they say?

571
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,570
Are they saying it's terrible?

572
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,410
Do they want me to quit again?

573
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,550
It is not even that.

574
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,550
By chance, are there no comments?

575
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,500
Just have a look at it yourself.

576
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,230
Hong Hak is full of a sense of justice. I love you.

577
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,600
I know a hit when I see one.

578
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,730
I'm enjoying this so much.

579
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,240
Wow, I love Yeojudaek. She's amazing.

580
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,480
The artist must've made a deal with the devil. He's suddenly good.

581
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,160
Upload the next episode soon. Otherwise, I'll get sick waiting.

582
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,960
Are these really the comments for my series?

583
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,220
I'm not dreaming, right?

584
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,880
I wonder.

585
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,920
I think the comments are about the protagonist of the series.

586
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,660
Good work, Artist Kim.

587
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,880
You provided the story and inspiration.

588
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,840
You're giving me pastry now?

589
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,210
Do you ever stop being generous, Yoon Ah?

590
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,190
Yoon Ah!

591
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,860
I will go to the restroom real quick.

592
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,300
Just eat that while waiting.

593
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,960
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

594
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,810
Right?

595
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,470
That's why you want to break up!

596
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,610
It's not like that, I said!

597
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,240

Hey. Hey!

601
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,240
The artist must be a strong man who doesn't tolerate injustice.

Are you the bastard Hye Rim was with last night?

611
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,720
You need to gauge the opponent first.

What would you have done if I were not around?

613
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,460

615

You are nothing without courage, no matter how strong you are.

616
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,810
You are not strong, but you have courage.

617
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,680
You have plenty of...

618
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,940
potential to become a strong man someday.

619
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,940

Yes, that'd be better. I'll change the colors, too.

You need to consider marriage if you kiss someone.
