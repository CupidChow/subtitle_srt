188
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,100
[Woori Electricity]

189
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
We'll get going now.

190
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,900
Seeing strangers coming by

191
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,850
made us feel nervous at first, but...

192
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,340
Gosh, what is this?

193
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,130
I am not sure if it helps to preserve tradition.

194
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,510
Our village needs to change now, too.

195
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,470
The villagers' quality of life matters as much as tradition.

196
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,840
Your Excellency.

197
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,270
Thank you so much.

198
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,810
It was hard to go around since it gets dark in the evening these days.

199
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,780
Our village's future is looking bright now.

200
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,930
My child used to cry because he got scared at night,

201
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,690
but he fell asleep laughing last night.

202
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,450
I should have done it sooner. It took too long.

203
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,080
I will work hard for you to live more comfortably from now on.

204
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,160
Thank you.

205
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,190
Thanks to that, the village became brighter

206
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,920
and the moods lit up, too.

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,770
Our lives improved so much.

208
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,050
If His Excellency did not do that for us...

209
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,060
My gosh, I do not know how we would have lived.

210
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,350
You know how.

211
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,370
We would have had to hold our bladder at night and live like that.

212
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,140
He cared for us so much.

213
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,690
Heaven is so cruel.

214
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,610
You will continue his legacy going forward, right?

215
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,190
Will you not?

216
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,640
Yes.

217
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,500
How nice.

218
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,030
Yoon Bok,

219
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,100
your father...

220
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,090
must've been a great person.

221
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,800
Everyone misses him so much.

222
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,120
I heard he tried to reform the village for the villagers.

223
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,110
I do not remember well since he passed when I was a child,

224
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,190
but I remember a few things he said clearly.

225
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,920
Yoon Bok, the Seongsan Gate opens widely for the first time today.

226
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,780
Remember that our village was reborn today.

227
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,860
Since he passed away,

228
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Grandfather closed the village gate and paused everything,

229
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:01,060
but someone has to continue the work for the village.

230
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,830
I noticed it was broken last night.

231
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,990
Children run around here a lot around sunset.

232
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,000
Call a technician and fix it before they get injured.

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,370
Okay.

234
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,620
- This is daebak. It's so pretty.
- It photographs so well.

235
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,520
- It's so pretty.
- Take one of me.

236
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,280
Okay, how about like this? One, two, three.

237
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,050
Aren't Camille and Frankie kind of suspicious?

238
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,990
Huh? What do you mean?

239
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,050
They're always glued to each other.

240
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,470
- Right. That's what I'm saying.
- Right?

241
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,700
At first, I thought they were married.

242
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,360
Right?

243
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,210
I suppose Frankie is capable, kind,

244
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,320
and he doesn't look bad for his age. Even Ms. Camille could've fallen for him.

245
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,790
Right?

246
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,040
A handsome middle-aged man who's like an oppa?

247
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,850
Oppa?

248
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,200
Hey...

249
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,400
Her employees are chatting away instead of working.

250
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,040
What is she doing, anyway?

251
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,270
Between this and this...

252
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,400
This is a little cuter.

253
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,850
It's Grandpa.

254
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,780
- Hello, Grandpa.
- Hello.

255
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,660
Grandpa, are you busy? Grandpa!

256
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,640
Take care, Grandpa.

257
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,250
I miss you, too, Honey.

258
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,840
I'll come home as soon as the fashion show ends.

259
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes.

260
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,030
I love you.

261
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,170
What is this?

262
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,770
That...

263
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,430
That man...

264
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
acts like her husband outside, but he is actually

265
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,690
married to someone else?

266
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,380
Does Camille know about this?

267
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,490
What am I supposed to do about this?

268
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,440
My goodness.

269
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,650
Are you in there?

270
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,330
The Wives' Association made this. It's so tasty.

271
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,100
I didn't even realize I ate a whole basket in one sitting.

272
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,350
I will eat it later.

273
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,890
Don't be difficult. Just eat it!

274
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,490
I brought it because I heard you liked it.

275
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,180
Lady,

276
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,990
well...

277
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,500
may I ask you one thing?

278
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,300
That man named Frankie.

279
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,630
Frankie?

280
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,300
How much do you know about that man?

281
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,040
You could say I basically know everything.

282
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,210
You know everything?

283
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,830
About his family and people around him, too?

284
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,310
I always feel bad whenever I think of his family.

285
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,600
But what can I do? I can't do anything without him.

286
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,820
You cannot!

287
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,270
What do you mean?

288
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,750
How could you do that with a man with a family-

289
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,280
What?

290
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,250
Never mind.

291
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,900
You can leave.

292
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,230
What?

293
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,590
Hold on!

294
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,290
By chance, do you...

295
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,980
We're just business partners and best friends.

296
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,660
Friends?

297
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,250
How could a man and woman be friends?

298
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,000
People do that outside the village.

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,500
You're so old-fashioned.

300
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,690
By chance, are you jealous?

301
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,590
A-Am I what? Jealous?

302
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,780
Scholars are not allowed to feel that way.

303
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,160
Forget it, then. Why are you getting so upset?

304
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,760
You're making me think you're actually jealous.

305
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,260
I said I am not!

306
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,480
Fine!

307
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,300
Give it to me!

308
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
Here we go again!

309
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,850
I have told you many times that you will become a village guard like me.

310
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,950
Learn martial arts instead of doing useless things like this.

311
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,520
You're the Woorim family's eldest son who will lead this village.

312
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,920
You do not have enough time to study literature and martial arts.

313
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,190
How could you do something so useless?

314
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,240
You are talented.

315
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,790
I want you to paint my face next time.

316
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,050
Really?

317
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,020
But I will get scolded by my grandfather.

318
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,160
If he does,

319
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,220
tell him that I begged you.

320
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,160
20 years went by, but nothing has changed.

321
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,580
Teacher!

322
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,650
Yoon Bok, over here!

323
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,970
Looks like you practiced a bit.

324
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,520
You improved a lot.

325
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,480
It is thanks to your ability.

326
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,960
Let's practice top poses today.

327
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,900
You strike a top pose before you turn at the end of the runway.

328
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,750
Let me try.

329
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,350
Okay.

330
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,950
Walk confidently...

331
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,880
look in the center, left,

332
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,180
and right.

333
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,250
And show off your back like this.

334
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,120
Can you do it?

335
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,930
Yes. There are some poses I learned on my own.

336
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,940
Oh, really?

337
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,990
Let's have a look, then.

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,820
Where did you pick up these poses?

339
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,960
I saw people doing this on TV.

340
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,820
Yoon Bok, you will be on stage as the face of the Seongsan Village.

341
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:52,180
So, you just need to show your elegant self as a scholar.

342
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,140
Is that so?

343
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,550
Yes.

344
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,990
If so, I will try again.

345
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,420
Okay.

346
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,620
Go.

347
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,170
Yes, that's it! That's it! Well done.

348
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,530
Yoon Bok, what are you thinking about?

349
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,370
What do kids outside the village dream about at that age?

350
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,360
They dream about all sorts of things.

351
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,510
Athletes, idols, police officers, teachers,

352
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,130
astronauts, and so on.

353
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,720
You want to become a lot of things at that age.

354
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,350
I want those children...

355
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,740
to also have a range of dreams like that freely.

356
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,970
Since Father passed away,

357
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,740
Grandfather closed the village gate and paused everything,

358
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:49,830
but someone has to continue the work for the village.

359
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,470
There is something I thought about for that reason.

360
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,700
Would you like to hear it?

361
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,420
Seongsan Cultural Academy?

362
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,750
Yes, we will invite outside teachers to the village

363
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,800
and let them learn skills from the outside world

364
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,850
they could not have learned in Seongsan.

365
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,770
Then, the children and young adults could have a wider range of dreams.

366
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,620
But the traditions our ancestors have been protecting might disappear, then.

367
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,120
If traditions cannot keep up with the times, they will disappear anyway.

368
