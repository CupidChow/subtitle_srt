Does it mean someone is helping him from outside?

21

To find out who that is, we have to get close to Excellency Lee.

Would you be able to?

- Yes.

Looks like you were destined to sit on top.

60

To be honest, I didn't think the situation would change so quickly.

61
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,220
This is all thanks to the old servant of the Woorim family-

62
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,440
Who did you mention just now?

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,490
Excellency Lee definitely said...

64
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,970
that he used to be a servant for the Woorim family.

65
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,360
Does it mean Joon Ho was behind Excellency Lee?

66
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,720
How could Joon Ho do such a thing?

67
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,880
Yes.

68
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,890
I found it.

69
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,790
The door was unlocked.

70
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,140
The door was opened.

71
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,300
There should be a wooden box in the village storage.

72
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,120
Bring the letter that is in there.

73
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,570
Do I have to do it now?

74
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,460
You got to live a nice life after being at the bottom.

75
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,870
But that nice life of yours can be gone immediately.

76
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,260
Think carefully and consider your mother's safety.

77
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,120

Why is Joon Ho taking things so far?

83
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,900
Yoon Bok, this must be very hard for you.

84
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,120
Not at all. I am more worried about you.

85
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
You don't have to worry about me.

86
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,450
That is the village storage where we keep precious objects inherited from our ancestors.

87
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,690
I've seen that before.

88
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,400
Pardon?

89
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,250
Yes, the painting I saw inside the closet at Seongsan Hall.

90
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,970
It was of that.

91
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,840
There was a painting of the storage at Joon Ho's place?

92
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Yes.

93
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,340
Young Master.

94
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,860
Did you figure out Lee Joon Ho's whereabouts?

95
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,550
We are still looking for him.

96
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,060
The thing is, the black-market dealers are saying

97
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,780
Gamjjok is preparing a major deal.

98
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,870
A major deal?

99
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,080
Joon Ho had a map of the village storage

100
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
because he's been planning to break into it.

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,610
He even has the key to it.

102
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,440
Grandfather, who has been protecting the storage,

103
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,600
must have been a thorn on his side.

104
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,970
So,

105
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,570
while looking for a solution,

106
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,120
he probably decided to bring in Excellency Lee

107
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,150
who was dissatisfied with the Woorim family.

108
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,950
Because as long as Grandfather stepped down,

109
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,100
he can access the storage easily.

110
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,510
If so, I should open the door for him myself.

111
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,410
I have told you.

112
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,100
That I will...

113
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,250
catch you, no matter what.

114
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,970
It is all over now.

115
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,910
Quit now.

116
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,260
I did feel uneasy about how things were going too smoothly.

117
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,780
Shin Yoon Bok, you were pretty clever this time.

118
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,060
Why are you doing such a thing?

119
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,130
To make money off the cultural heritage?

120
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,520
Money?

121
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,460
Is that the best reason you could come up with your smart brain?

122
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,730
Why are you doing this, then?

123
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,020
Seongsan Village.

124
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,480
Tradition.

125
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,050
The Woorim Shin family.

126
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,250
Those must be just beautiful names that were handed down to you.

127
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,860
But not to me.

128
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,660
As a servant...

129
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,840
do you know how I've been living here,

130
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,660
what I've seen,

131
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,230
and what I had to go through?

132
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,640
Do you know?

133
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,880
- You bastard!
- My gosh!

134
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,280
I am sorry, sir. I am sorry.

135
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,630
I saw my mother apologize for everything, but I couldn't say a thing.

136
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,580
I wasn't even allowed to be affectionate to my mother. Do you know...

137
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,320
how I felt...

138
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,950
leaving this village?

139
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,640
Do you know?

140
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,840
I wanted to get rid of everything.

141
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,180
Everything your grandfather cherished.

142
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,670
The treasures.

143
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,400
Tradition. The Woorim Shin family!

144
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,580
I wanted to destroy everything! Everything!

145
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,210
- Hyungnim.
- Don't look at me like that.

146
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,230
You grew up without any worries as the young master.

147
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,370
Don't pretend as if you understand me.

148
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,080
No matter what the reason is...

149
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,310
you cannot justify your crime.

150
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,180
So...

151
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,630

Please...

153
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,410
do not destroy yourself anymore.

154
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,460
Mr. Lee Joon Ho,

155
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,940
you're under arrest for theft and breaching the Cultural Heritage Protection Act.

156
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,930
I took tradition for granted,

157
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,210
but I did not realize it could...

158
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,820
actually hurt someone.

159
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,720
As the new leader of Seongsan Village,

160
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,770
I will protect tradition and let Seongsan Village be known by many.

161
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,710
Excuse me, I have a question.

162
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,290
Go ahead.

163
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,850
Is it true that you assisted Gamjjok in stealing from the village storage?

164
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,980
Gamjjok? What do you mean-

165
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,910
Mr. Lee Jae Chool, you'll have to come with us regarding

166
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,140
Seongsan Village's theft case.

167
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,480

168
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,230
Please come with us.

170
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,630
Let go of me!

171
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,580

I'm so sick of it.

177
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,420

185
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,880
Mom used to make this for me.

186
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,650
Eat it while it's hot.

187
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,060
Here.

188
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,020
Come with me.

189
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,250
Welcome. It must've been difficult being away from home.

190
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,700
Thank you for your hard work.

191
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,970
You two worked very hard.

192
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,010
Everything worked out well.

193
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,050
Are you both going to Seoul today?

194
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,630
We need to prepare for the show.

195
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,390
What will you do, Yoon Bok?

196
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,430
Well...

197
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,430
I am planning to stay for a few more days.

198
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,390
It is okay. You can get going, too.

199
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,040
No, you are not feeling well yet.

200
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,390
How could I leave you alone-

201
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,410
You should leave now.

202
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,960
Will you be okay?

203
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,500
I am just tired because I was worried.

204
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,550
Do not worry.

205
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,310
Let's prepare for the fashion show here.

206
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,230
- Pardon?
- We cleared up the misunderstanding with the villagers

207
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,820
and it's cumbersome to go back and forth.

208
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,780
Why don't we move the HQ near the stage?

209
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,420
Go ahead and do so.

210
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,610
I will get things set up.

211
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,260
Why are you doing this?

212
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,210
I would be too ashamed to keep serving you.

213
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,480
I am sorry, Master.

214
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,260
I am sorry.

215
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,940
He was under my care, too.

216
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,620
But I have not taken good care of him.

217
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,420
Do not mention it.

218
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,550
You took me in when I had a newborn and had nowhere to go.

219
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,140
You took such good care of us.

220
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,060
But we returned the favor like this.

221
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,540
It is all my fault.

222
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:06,270
I will seek your forgiveness afar for the rest of my life.

223
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,800
Yeojudaek, do not do this.

224
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,290
Thank you for everything.

225
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,630
Yeojudaek.

226
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes!

227
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,510
I am so sorry.

228
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,900
I did that to Joon Ho.

229
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,540
You must resent me a lot.

230
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,330
Not at all. Why would you say that?

231
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,150
You just did what you were supposed to do.

232
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,630
I do not know how to face you anymore.

233
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,170
I know I am asking a difficult favor,

234
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,500
but could you just stay here with us?

235
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,670
You know that...

236
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,750
you are like a mother to me.

237
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,120
My mother died after suffering after leaving the village.

238
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,370
I cannot let you end up the same way.

239
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,430
Young Master.

240
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,900
No matter what happened,

241
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,890
you have always embraced me.

242
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,810
You are like home to me,

243
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,610
and my hometown, but if I let you go like this,

244
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,460
I will not be able to forgive myself.

245
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,630
I am sorry, Young Master.

246
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,480
Until Joon Ho comes back,

247
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,630
I will try to fill his empty spot.

248
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,620
So, please do not leave

249
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,840
and stay by my side.

250
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
I beg you.

251
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,530
Is she okay?

252
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,300
She must be having a hard time.

253
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,730
Please...

254
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,930
take good care of her by her side.

255
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,930
Lee Joon Ho, you have a visitor.

256
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,180
- Have you eaten?
- What do you want?

257
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,680
I am here to update you on your mother.

258
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,430
She was shocked to hear what happened,

259
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,630
but thankfully, she has calmed down now.

260
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,750
I will treat her like my mother while you are gone.

261
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,560
Do not worry about Yeojudaek, and be well.

262
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,840
And...

263
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,250
there is one thing I want to ask.

264
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,840
Hyungnim,

265
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,980
are you linked to my father's death from seven years ago?

266
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,010
The key chain you had in your possession.

267
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,930
My father had been wearing that...

268
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,340
until he passed away.

269
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,250
By chance, if you-

270
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,940
I know nothing about it.

271
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,220
We're done talking.

272
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,170
Okay.

273
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,100
I'll look further into Father's case.

274
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,900
Go back and care for the village.

275
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,270
Would you be okay on your own?

276
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,750
It's my duty.

277
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,960
I'll call you if I need your help.

278
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,880
Further inside. Further inside. Be careful.

279
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,800
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

280
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,630
That, too. That, too. That, too. Yes, yes, yes.

281
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,590
Model?

282
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,310
I heard Frankie gave you his business card already.

283
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:06,330
I also think you'd be the perfect main model for my fashion show.

284
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,620
I am not good at stuff like that.

285
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,420
I can make you become good at it.

286
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,170
What are your thoughts?

287
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,860
If Yoon Bok wants to...

288
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,300
The first fashion show in Seongsan Village.

289
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,750
The entire world would be watching.

290
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,650
I want to...

291
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,720
show them the true face of Seongsan.

292
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,760
Okay, I understand.

293
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,990
Okay!

294
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,660
Pardon? Yoon Bok will be the main model?

295
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,490
Bravo. I have excellent taste in models.

296
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,550
Okay, let's get busy.

297
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,400
We'll find a spot to build the stage

298
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,570
and check on the catering process, too.

299
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,330
Bring whatever inspiration you get from the villagers' fashion, too.

300
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,760
Ask Yoon Bok if you have any questions about the village.

301
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:35,000
Right, you have to be polite if you run into a villager.

302
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,340
There's nothing they value more than manners here. Okay?

303
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,350
- Okay.
- Okay.

304
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,230
What happened?

305
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,080
Ms. Camille said she wanted to show Seongsan's face.

306
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,660
I...

307
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,930
am its face, you know.

308
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,470
I am happy that I can be with you while you are working.

309
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,760
Look for a spot for the stage on the other side of the hill.

310
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,620
We'll be looking around here.

311
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,280
On the other side of the hill?

312
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,600
I have a cardio exercise allergy.

313
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,110
I can't climb hills or stuff like that.

314
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,670
W-What? Cardio exercise allergy?

315
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,500
Is there such a thing?

316
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,910
Okay, then. We'll go that way.

317
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,210
Let's go, Yoon Bok.

318
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,670
Yes!

319
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,160
Seriously, she's too much.

320
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,510
She's always wearing headphones and doesn't hear me.

321
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,360
She doesn't get work done in time unless I give her a deadline.

322
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,560
I feel like I'm my assistant's assistant.

323
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,300
Just now, too.

324
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,540
She comes up with all sorts of excuses if something seems a bit hard.

325
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,680
I can tolerate her doing that with just us,

326
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,710
but she can't do this in front of you, too.

327
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,980
I do not think it is too bad that we came this way.

328
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,380
I have always wanted to come here with you someday.

329
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,900
- Let us go.
- Okay.

330
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,460
Gosh, it's so beautiful here.

331
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,530
When it is time for the fashion show,

332
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,960
things will turn red because of azaleas that way.

333
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,360
And that way, there will be sprouts popping up.

334
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,610
It will be as picturesque as five-colored silk.

335
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,590
When I was a kid,

336
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,460
my father brought a boat here

337
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,070
and let me ride it.

338
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,640
He must have been very sweet.

339
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,920
Yes.

340
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,150
Since this is a place of fond memories to me,

341
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:40,890
I want it to leave fond memories for you, too.

342
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,580
Yes, I'm sure it will.

343
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,890
Look!

344
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,600
Should we go check it out?

345
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,260
- Yes.
- Let's go. Let's go.

346
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,070
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

347
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,440
She moved the HQ to my house,

348
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,870
but it would be impolite not to stop by

349
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,310
as the owner of the house.

350
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,390
Hold on.

351
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,860
I cannot go empty-handed.

352
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,770
Who are you?

353
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,940
It's me. Camille.

354
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,670
Gosh, you scared me.

355
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,650
By the way, what's that?

356
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,910
You can't get a spa treatment at Seongsan Village.

357
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,380
My skin got so dry these days.

358
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,350
So, I brought it to care for my skin.

359
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,360
Let me try it, too.

360
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,670
Geez, you want to try everything that's good for you.

361
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,070
Here.

362
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,940
My gosh, it's so warm.

363
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,630
Lady, are you in there?

364
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,570
Gosh, the wrinkles are gone. The wrinkles are gone.

365
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,400
Really?

366
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,130
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

367
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,940
They're gone!

368
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,120
Oh, Shin Soo Geun.

369
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,710
I-I found this plant on the way.

370
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,440
Keep it here, or throw it away.

371
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,510
Anyway, I will leave since you look busy.

372
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,110
Men and women need to stay separated. How could they?

373
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,980
Did the location scouting go well?

374
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,040
Yes.

375
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,110
Oh, really?

376
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,240
Can I look at the pictures, then?

377
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,530
What's...

378
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,500
By chance...

379
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,900
- did you take just one?
- Yes.

380
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,570
Wait, you didn't check out other places?

381
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,390
- Other places? Where?
- What?

382
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,070
You told us to look around here. So we stayed here.

383
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,140
So, you only checked out here. Just here?

384
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,310
- Yes.
- You little-

385
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,490
Teacher, there is a famous soup place nearby.

386
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,090
Let us stop by before you go.

387
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,540
Okay. Let's.

388
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,900
Geez, that sounds tasty.

389
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,540
I love soups.

390
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,070
I'll post on social media.

391
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,780
Me, too. Me, too. I love it.

392
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,800
- Let us go.
- Geez.

393
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,200
How old are you?

394
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,330
I am 24.

395
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,630
Huh? We're the same age. Same age.

396
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,380
Can I talk to you casually?

397
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,000
It is okay.

398
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,350
Do you have a girlfriend?

399
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,290
I'm curious. I'm curious.

400
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,630
Yes, she is right there.

401
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,650
- What?
- Whoa.

402
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,340
Tonight's dinner is on me.

403
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,920
- Really?
- Really?

404
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,870
I heard you are my girlfriend's assistants.

405
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,890
I would like to ask you to assist her well going forward.

406
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,220
So, enjoy yourselves.

407
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

408
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,070
Teacher, help yourself.

409
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,510
Thank you.

410
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,280
Please eat, both of you.

411
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,050
- Okay.
- Okay.

412
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,530
Wow, this is good.

413
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,780
Will Yeojudaek cheer up if she ate this, too?

414
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,460
Here, have some, Yoon Bok.

415
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,340
Thank you, Teacher.

416
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,390
That's my Hong Do.

417
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,360
It's so tasty.

418
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,220
Hong Do.

419
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,320
I missed you.

420
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,290
Is she not back yet?

421
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,920
Who are you?

422
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,570
Kim Chil Bok?

423
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,340
Dad?

424
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,820
"Dad"?

425
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,620
I did not know you were the Teacher's father.

426
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,670
I am very sorry.

427
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,680
Hong Do.

428
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,760
Why are you here, Dad?

429
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,860
Why would you talk to him that way?

430
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,090
Do not criticize Hong Do.

431
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,340
There is a reason for it.

432
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,980
And who's the one to blame for it?

433
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,900
When I think about how much I suffered with Hong Hak...

434
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,680
I...

435
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,490
find it difficult to face you like this.

436
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,020
So, don't show up in front of me.

437
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,580
Okay.

438
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,470
I'm a sinner.

439
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,820
I'm sorry, Hong Do.

440
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,440
S-Sir...

441
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,360
Sir.

442
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,860
I am letting you see all sorts of things.

443
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,740
I am sorry.

444
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,110
It is okay.

445
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,220
After Hong Do's mom passed away early on,

446
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,490
I acted out a lot.

447
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,530
I had no desire to keep on living.

448
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,230
So, I even tried to follow her path, but...

449
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,270
it was a terrible thing to make the kids go through.

450
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,180
So trying to start things over,
[Grand Opening]

451
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,610
I took out loans here and there

452
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,620
and opened a restaurant.

453
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,810
Welcome.

454
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,370
What are you doing?

455
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,840
Pardon?

456
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,000
What are you doing at my shop right now?

457
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,030
- Who are you?
- I'm the owner of this shop.

458
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,960
- Pardon?
- It turns out I was scammed.

459
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,020
I even lost the house we were living in.

460
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,010
I felt too guilty to face my kids.

461
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,590
I didn't see the point of living.

462
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,020
Are you okay?

463
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:15,930
I was going to go back to the kids once I paid off the loans, but...

464
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:24,070
I completely understand why Hong Do is so angry.

465
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,910
So, please comfort her for me, Young Master.

466
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,310
I beg you.

467
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,670
He should've done better for himself if he abandoned his kids.

468
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,740
Yoon Bok, you must be tired from walking around with me today.

469
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,690
Go ahead and rest.

470
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,960
Teacher, are you okay?

471
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:31,310
Of course. Why would I not be okay?

472
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,490
He abandoned us when we were kids.

473
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,660
Not only did he try to kill himself...

474
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,100
I'm starving.

475
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,020
he even put us out on the streets.

476
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,450
I stopped caring for him a long time ago.

477
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:49,390
I got angry earlier because I remembered how much Hong Hak and I went through.

478
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,840
I'm really okay.

479
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,270
Don't worry about it, and get some rest.

480
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,530
You must have...

481
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,530
had a tough time.

482
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,810
I know.

483
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,290
I know.

484
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,410
I thought I brought it.

485
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,770
I found it.

486
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,790
The wrinkles are gone. The wrinkles are gone.

487
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,490
Really?

488
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:35,770
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

489
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,250
What does that have to do with me?

490
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,470
Why am I so bothered by it?

491
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,810
Are you in there?

492
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,930
What is going on?

493
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,100
I was just curious about something.

494
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,030
Are you done working?

495
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,950
You seemed very busy.

496
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,630
How could I be done with work? You have to keep at it.

497
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,160
What brings you here?

498
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,850
Well...

499
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:19,490
I brought too much by mistake.

500
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,550
Take one every morning and evening.

501
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,010

502
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,050
joints supplements, circulation supplements, and calcium.

503
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,750
You brought all these by mistake?

504
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,900
I know. I'm all over the place.

505
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,580
Go to bed. I'll leave.

506
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,170
That was smooth.

507
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,520
Here are the catering menu options from the Village Wives' Association.

508
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,510
Here are the photos of the sites.

509
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,900
- This one's nice.
- Right?

510
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,620
It's even more beautiful in person.

511
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,710
We can use this square as the runway.

512
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,320
If you put lights here, it'd look so cool.

513
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,630
Tres bien.

514
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,360
Share the photos and info with the stage director.

515
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,890
Okay.

Hello, I'm Kim Hong Do, a designer at Camille Korea.

517
00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:00,970
We picked the fashion show site. I sent the photos.

Hong Do Kim!

00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:15,100
When did you study French?

521
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,600
You can go to Paris now without a hitch.

522
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,860
I still have a long way to go.

523
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,410
Yoon Bok,

524
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,070
did you practice walking at all?

525
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,730
- Pardon?
- Starting today and until the fashion show day,

526
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,860
be on stage every day and practice walking.

527
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,860
You'll need to practice since you're not a pro model.

528
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,190
Okay, I will.

529
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,540
Hong Do Kim can help him with it.

530
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,150
Okay.

531
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,750
You have to practice every single day without skipping a day.

532
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

533
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,010
When would you be free?

534
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,180
Should we do it every lunch break?

535
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,020
Yes, that works for me.

536
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,810
I will go with your schedule.

537
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,360
Okay, let's do that.

538
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,790
Okay.

[National Police Agency]

540
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:23,230
Are you linked to my father's death from seven years ago?

The key chain you had in your possession.

542
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,990
My father had been wearing that...

until he passed away.

By chance, if you-

545
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:45,950
By chance, did he kill Excellency Shin?

Come out, Lee Joon Ho.

547
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,400
You'll be transferred to a detention center.

548
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,070
May I make a phone call?

549
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,710
You can't.

550
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,480
- Just one phone call.
- No.

551
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:33,640
♫ I wander and extend my arms ♫

552
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:41,350
♫ But you disappeared like mirage ♫

553
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,970
[Epilogue]

554
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:54,660
Have you known Camille for a long time?

555
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,250
I've probably known her for 40 years.

556
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,190
That's so unexpected.

557
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:06,200
She has never told me about you.

558
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,670
Really?

559
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,550
I've heard so much about you.

560
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,400
Looks like you are very close to her.

561
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,300
People tell us that we're like a married couple.

562
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,500
I suppose she worries about me a lot.

563
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,510
She brought me all these supplements.

564
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,930
Two, four, six, eight, and ten.

565
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,340
What's the deal?

566
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,470
You asked me to get good supplements.

567
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,030
Were they for your ex-boyfriend?

568
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,270
How did you know?

569
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:16,300
[Dare to Love Me]

570
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,930
What should I do if Yoon Bok inherits the village?

571
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,390
I will be by your side, no matter what I do.

572
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,240
Even if it means on the other side of the planet.

573
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,030
Go and tell Young Master Yoon Bok...

574
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,930
that I will meet with him just once.

575
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:33,980
Joon Ho said he would meet with you just once.

576
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,690
Teacher, I will be away from the village today due to an urgent matter.

577
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:41,420
I will return in the evening. Let us practice walking then.

578
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,470
Yoon Bok, is something going on? Call me.

579
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,210
Two stab wounds on the stomach. BP is 70/40.

580
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,750
It's dropping rapidly, and the organs might be damaged.

581
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,730
Yoon Bok.

582
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,050
Yoon Bok!
