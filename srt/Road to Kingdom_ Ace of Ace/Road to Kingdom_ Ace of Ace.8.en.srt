- Let's all do it together. - Can we all do it together?

111
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,398
- Do it together. - We need to really be in sync.

112

113

We're going to the Final Round.

127
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,870
In a way, everything we've done so far was for this moment.

128
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,470
We prepared and gave four performances...

129
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,070
- Right. - for this moment.

130
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,940
It was a long journey of six months, right?

131
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,080
- It was both long and short. - Right.

132
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,879
It doesn't even feel like a month.

133
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,580
Really? It feels like eight months for me.

134
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,949
It feels like we've been preparing for this for about a year.

135
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,950
It was so tough.

136
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,450
(I really gave it my all.)

137
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,090
This has been so intense.

138
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,058
- A year or two of experiences... - Exactly.

139
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,259
We did about a year or two's worth of physical work too.

140

(They used all of their energy for their performances.)

141
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,528
- That is true. - Exactly.

142
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,100
We know that the harder we work, the better the results are.

143
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,258

144
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,730
for us, ONEUS, to be on Road to Kingdom.

145
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,339
We came on this show again...

146
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,470
because we really wanted to prove...

147
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,679
what kind of team we are and how good our performances are.

148
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,609
(From the Evaluation Match, Round 1,)

149
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,980
(and Round 2, they got 1st in the Ace Ranking.)

150
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,320
(ONEUS showed everyone their strong stage presence.)

151
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,590
We were worried whether we could satisfy everyone even more.

152
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,659
We were able to overcome our own limits,

153
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,929
so we were very happy.

154
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,428
When I think about the day of the Evaluation Match...

155
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,429
The Evaluation Match...

156
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,370
(He became dark from the first day.)

157
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,668
I think that was the start of YOUNITE's identity...

158
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,799
in Road to Kingdom.

159
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,138
(YOUNITE's expected ranking for the Evaluation Match was 7th.)

160
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,579
When I saw that number seven,

161
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,778
I thought, "We need to use this as a chance to prove ourselves."

162
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,779
Okay.

163
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,778
We wanted to make our name, YOUNITE, known to many fans...

164
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,480
no matter what it took.

165
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,990
I think we've really made an impression.

166
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,859
If we had gotten 1st or 2nd in the beginning,

167
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,190
I don't think we would've come up with a performance like this.

168
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,990
It made us work with a bit more determination.

169
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,629
Road to Kingdom...

170
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,259
is a little joy and lots of sorrow.

171
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,169
(The joy just came and left.)

172
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,370
It was our first performance that we got to show people...

173
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,700
after debuting as The CrewOne.

174
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,668
(Let's prove ourselves! Let's show everyone!)

175
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,869
I was very nervous and anxious...

176
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,080
and felt a lot of pressure.

177
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,378
(From in both the Evaluation Match and Round 1, they got 6th place.)

178
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,980
That 6th place will remain in my heart forever.

179
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,749
We wanted to get a higher ranking than 6th place...

180
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,419
and avoid becoming elimination candidates.

181
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,659
(In Round 2, they faced the risk of being eliminated.)

182
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,528
Have I ever wanted something so desperately in my life?

183
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,558
(The fate of their team rested on the Elimination Battle.)

184
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,299
(The CrewOne wins.)

185
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,469
(The CrewOne received another chance.)

186
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,470
We were at the risk of being eliminated in every round.

187
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,210
We must be in the netherworld.

188
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,809
We survived and made it to the Final Round.

189
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,480
Our first debut song as The CrewOne.

190
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,250
We'll show you The CrewOne that came back from the netherworld.

191
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,419
We're the youngest team on Road to Kingdom.

192
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,820
We got first place in the Evaluation Match.

193
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,089
(They got 1st place in the Team Battle.)

194
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,690
I won't be able to forget the moment we got first place.

195
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,529
Ever.

196
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,659
We got that precious first-place ranking,

197
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,999
but right after that, we got last place.

198
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,569
(They fell to last place in both the Team Ranking...)

199
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,799
(and the Ace Ranking in Round 1.)

200
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,409
In that moment, I thought, "What should we do for Round Two?"

201
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,139
In Round Two, a team was going to be eliminated.

202
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,980
So we put everything on the line to prepare for it.

203
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,289
(JAE YUN and MYUNG HO were the aces for the 1st round of Round 3.)

204
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,518
(By getting 2nd for the overall Ace Ranking, )

205
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
(they succeeded in raising their position in the chart.)

206
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,319
(We hit rock bottom when we got 7th place.)

207
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,989
(Then we worked hard to climb up to 3rd place.)

208
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,399
(Do you see the pattern?)

209
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,730
(Look at that confidence the youngest team has.)

210
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,500
The youngest team's uprising is not over yet.

211
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,799
We still have one more shot to take.

212
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,798
Hey, guys.

213
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,539
You'll have to bring your A-game.

214
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,539
The one who's being chased has the biggest fear.

215
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,609
We've been through everything on the show.

216
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,850
We were once in last place and climbed all the way to the top.

217
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,249
(HYEONGJUN was the ace for the Evaluation Match...)

218
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,779
(as their chance to perform as a group was at stake.)

219
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,119
(He was ranked 7th in the Ace Battle at the Evaluation Match.)

220
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,288
After getting placed seventh in the Evaluation Match,

221
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:00,018
I was that much determined.

222
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,929
Our teamwork has gotten stronger, and we bonded more as a team.

223
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,229
(They prepared their first stage with determination.)

224
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,258
Three.

225
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,269
(They won a great victory with their strong teamwork.)

226
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,768
We won't be satisfied with this.

227
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,670
I think we worked even harder and with more determination.

228
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,568
After winning first place with our group performance,

229
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,509
our ace also won first place.

230
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,739
(CRAVITY proved their talent to everyone.)

231
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,880
So we're getting close to winning the entire competition.

232
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,548
- It gave us a lot of confidence. - Well done.

233
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,749
(It boosted their confidence as they were close to winning.)

234
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,008
I'm glad we decided to join the show.

235
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,150
- Me too. - Totally.

236
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,220
It was really difficult in the beginning.

237
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,348
But we found our teamwork while working together.

238
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,758
It elevated my self-confidence too.

239
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,990
We were recognized for our talent.

240
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:36,029
All the hard effort we put into this was well worth it.

241
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,400
Our determination for this final stage is different.

242
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,399
Actually, we accomplished all the goals...

243
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,430
on the show except for winning the competition.

244
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,269
Only our last goal remains.

245
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:48,508
CRAVITY will remain in first place...

246
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,269
and win the competition.

247
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,009
Our team never won first place.

248
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,609
We'll show you...

249
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,779
a great performance at the final match.

250
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,980
We came back from that awful Elimination Battle.

251
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,990
The drama of The CrewOne isn't over yet.

252
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,390
We'll show people the essence of YOUNITE's performances...

253
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,789
and go all the way to victory.

254
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,159
It will be the last blow from the challengers.

255
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,529
That's what we'll show you,

256
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:14,400
my dear senior singers.

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,940
(Which group will be named the Ace of Ace in K-pop?)

258
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,609
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

259
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:26,109
Here's the journey they have been on to be named the winning group.

260
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,309
They were ranked in three preliminary rounds...

261
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,149
in the Team Battles and Ace Battles.

262
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,720
Their rankings from both battles of the three rounds were combined.

263
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,950
The preliminary scores could be accumulated...

264
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,289
to the total of 70,000 points.

265
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,318
The number of views was counted for the score...

266
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,690
which could go as high as 30,000 points.

267
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,588
In total, 100,000 points were given out...

268
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:42,659
from the preliminary rounds.

269
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,730
(The composition of the final preliminary score)

270
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,598
And a total of 100,000 points will be given out today...

271
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,829
during the live broadcast which will be added to their scores.

272
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,069
The highest score will determine the winning group.

273
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,400
Here's the breakdown of the 100,000 points from today.

274
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,739
Last week, their new songs were released at the same time.

275
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,609
Their scores from the new songs can add up to 30,000 points.

276
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,278
And the number of the votes...

277
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,109
during the live broadcast today can add up to 70,000 points.

278
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,079
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

279
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,788
Which group will have the honour of being the ace group of K-pop?

280
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,990
(Which group will have the honour of being the ace group of K-pop?)

281
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,029
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

282
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,930
- TAEMIN! - Yes!

283
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,289
Hello.

284
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,529
I'm TAEMIN, the host of Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

285
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,500
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

286
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,199
We're joining the K-pop fans in Korea...

287
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,740
and all over the world on Mnet Plus...

288
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,480
as well as other global streaming platforms.

289
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:46,349
We have our five finalists here with us.

290
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,390
As they have been working hard toward performing as finalists,

291
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,589
this must be the most nerve-racking moment.

292
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,089
But as this is my first time being the host of a live broadcast,

293
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,230
I may be even more nervous than them.

294
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,528
- No! - No!

295
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,768
- No! - You're great!

296
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,130
- You're killing it! - You're great!

297
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,939
- Yes! - Let's go!

298
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,969
My gosh, thank you.

299
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,740
I might lack as a host, but I will surely try my best.

300
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,779
At last, tonight,

301
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,289
one of the groups here will be named...

302
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,619
the K-pop Ace.

303
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,058
With the 100,000 points from the preliminary rounds...

304
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,429
(The winning group will be decided with the pre-match and final score.)

305
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,099
the 100,000 points from the live broadcast will be added.

306
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,598
The group with the highest combined scores...

307
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,099
will win first place.

308
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,910
Then let's check the scores...

309
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,308
from the three preliminary rounds...

310
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,910
which took place over the past seven weeks.

311
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,950
As for the pre-match scores I'm about to reveal now,

312
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,920
these are combined scores of the team and ace performances.

313
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,758
We converted all the scores...

314
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,130
based on the percentage of number one group's points.

315
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,470
Then the pre-match score of 70,000 points goes to...

316
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,539
Please reveal the scores now.

317
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,368
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

318
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,608
(Pre-match Scores)

319
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,880

320
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,548
(CRAVITY, ONEUS, 8TURN, YOUNITE, The CrewOne)

321
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,589
The scores from the Team and Ace Rankings were combined...

322
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,359
for the pre-match score. And CRAVITY got the highest score.

323
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,868
We will add up to 30,000 points based on the total number...

324
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,268
of views from their videos.

325
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,339
Then we will have the final pre-match scores.

326
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,950
I wonder if there's any change to the current rankings.

327
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,849
- No! - No!

328
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,460
I will now reveal the final pre-match scores...

329
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,930
once the points from their videos were added to the scores.

330
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,599
Wait!

331
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,039
A total of 100,000 points...

332
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,079
went to one of the groups. Please reveal the scores now.

333
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:31,349
(Final Pre-match Scores)

334
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,149
(CRAVITY: 100,000 points, ONEUS: 89,280 points, )

335
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,018
(YOUNITE: 61,444 points, 8TURN: 60,775 points, )

(The CrewOne: 58,415 points)

337
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,049
My gosh, we caught up a lot.

338
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,960
- Goodness. - I can't believe this.

339
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,269
All right.

340
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,399
Here are the final pre-match scores after the number of views...

341
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,099
from the videos have been taken into account.

342
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,380
In 5th place, we have The CrewOne with 58,415 points.

343
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,078
- Great! - Nice!

344
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,180
- That's great. - Great job.

345
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,548
- Good. - Yes!

346
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,920
In 4th place, we have 8TURN with 60,775 points.

347

In 2nd place, we have ONEUS with 89,280 points.

349
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,720
Thank you!

350
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:50,029
In 1st place, we have CRAVITY with 100,000 points.

351
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,758
Thank you.

352
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,660
(CRAVITY has the highest pre-match score.)

353
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,769
SERIM of CRAVITY, your group has the highest score.

354
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,439
As your group received...

355
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,480
the highest number of views with your video,

356
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,838
your group came in first place with the maximum pre-match score...

357
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,549
of 100,000 points.

358
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,980
Could you tell us how you feel?

359
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,450
I'm very happy because it feels like the performances...

360
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,259
we worked hard to prepare were well-received by the viewers.

361
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,029
I'd like to thank our dear fans, LUVITY.

362
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,009
However, no one can tell what will happen tonight...

363
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,108
as a group can earn...

364
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,950
up to 100,000 points from the final match.

365
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,380
A total of 30,000 points can be given out from their new songs.

366
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,819
Then a total of 70,000 points based on the votes will be added.

367
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,289
The winning team of the show will be decided based on these scores.

368
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,598
As the votes collected during the live broadcast...

369
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,759
can add up to 70,000 points,

370
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,500
There are plenty of chances to turn the table around.

371
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,899
Then I will inform you how to vote...

372
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,569
during the live broadcast as it takes up...

373
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,579
the biggest percentage of the final score.

374
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,910
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

375
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,150
Here's how you can vote during the live broadcast.

376
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,848
We will accept votes via text...

377
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,859
and on our app, Mnet Plus, simultaneously.

378
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,990
The votes received via text will be counted for 70 percent...

379
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,529
while the votes received on our app will be counted for 30 percent.

380
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,199
After watching all of their performances,

381
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,000
please vote for one group whom you consider the ace.

382
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,839
The voting numbers will match the order of the performances.

383
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,710
Number one, YOUNITE.

384
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,609

or the name of the group, CRAVITY.

398
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,950
All right. We will now begin collecting votes.

399
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,619
Five, four, three,

400
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,690
two, one.

401
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,959
The live broadcast voting begins now.

402
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,700
(The live broadcast voting begins.)

403
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:42,970
Hello, viewers...

404
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,339
and fans from all over the world.

405
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,940
The live broadcast voting has begun just now.

406
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,439
(Information on the use of personal information)

407
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,008
(The program may collect or use personal information...)

408
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,279
(through Infobank for the purpose of text voting and broadcasting.)

409
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,750
As the live broadcast voting takes up...

410
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720
seventy percent of the final score,

411
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:05,589
the live broadcast voting will be very important.

412
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,490
Let me go over the voting numbers for each group one more time.

413
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,829
Number one, YOUNITE.

414
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,670
(Write YOUNITE or number 1 and text it to pound, 0, 0, 1, 1.)

415
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,240
Number two, The CrewOne.

416
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,309
(Write The CrewOne or number 2 and text it to pound, 0, 0, 1, 1.)

417
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,450
Number three, ONEUS.

418
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,049
(Write ONEUS or number 3 and text it to pound, 0, 0, 1, 1.)

419
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,619
Number 4, 8TURN.

420
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,630
(Write 8TURN or number 4 and text it to pound, 0, 0, 1, 1.)

421
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,299
Number 5, CRAVITY.

422
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,369
(Write CRAVITY or number 5 and text it to pound, 0, 0, 1, 1.)

423
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,279
Text your vote to pound, 0, 0, 1, 1.

424
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,979
Or you can vote on our app, Mnet Plus.

425
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,318
(Proceeds will be donated to Mapo Foundation for Arts and Culture.)

426
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,018
However, for each text message,

427
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,049
you will be charged ten cents. Please keep that in mind.

428
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,819
You can only write down numbers for your votes to count.

429
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,528
Please don't put any spacings...

430
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,759
when you spell out the names of the groups.

431
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,099
The names in both upper and lower cases will count.

432
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,298
Please note that you cannot send in more than one message...

433
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,640
or vote for more than one group.

434
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,309
Number four.

435
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,650
- Number 5. - Number 5.

436
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,220
You will be the one...

437
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,250
to choose the Ace of Ace in K-pop.

438
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,559
Please vote wisely to only one group that you think deserves...

439
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,160
to be named the ace.

440
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,568
You're watching...

441
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,200
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

442
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,309
It's time to watch the performances by the five groups here.

443
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,779
This group will kick us off with their performance.

444
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,119
They always surpass our imaginations.

445
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,119
They make it impossible for us to predict their performances.

446
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,759
As they put on performances of different genres for each round,

447
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,588
for the final performance,

448
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:24,160
they've prepared a fantasy movie for us.

449
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,528
They incorporated their determination...

450
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:32,038
to be the winners of this journey on the show...

451
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,369
while following their conviction.

452
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,538
Let's see if they can prove to us...

453
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:40,480
that they have a shot at doing so with this performance.

454
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,750
Here's the first group of the final match.

455
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:50,249
Ace of Ace, YOUNITE.

456
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,390
("Conviction" by YOUNITE will be revealed shortly.)

457
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,058
It's been a while.

458
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,289
- Is it a picnic? - Let's take a break.

459
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,829
Gosh, something's wrong with the weather.

460
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,470
- Hey, the weather... - It's so cold today.

461
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,400
- Hurry! - Gosh, it's so cold.

462
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,400
Armageddon?

463
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,798
Something is very wrong here.

464
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,710
Is it because we performed "Armageddon?"

465
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,140
We're facing our own apocalypse right now.

466
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,710
(A strong wind greets them.)

467
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,649
Won't we need to recuperate given the harsh weather?

468
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,450
We're not taking a break. We'll need to recuperate.

469
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,449
Hey, let's hurry.

470
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,650
(A refresh day in Inje with a good mountain and clean water)

471
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,859
(But what's going on?)

472
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,989
Only the final match remains now.

473
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,088
- Gosh. - A round of applause, please.

474
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,558
(YOUNITE, congratulations on advancing to the final match.)

475
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,799
I'm sure the CEO is very proud of us.

476
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:37,700
(He's coming over.)

477
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,369
"It's as expected."

478
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:41,268
"I knew you could do it."

479
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,209
"If you guys do well,"

480
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,808
"I'll buy you something tasty."

481
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,479
"I'll treat you guys."

482
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,380
I don't think he says stuff like that.

483
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,778
There has to be a reward if we do well.

484
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:51,779
- Right. - Yes.

485
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,578
Won't that push us to work harder?

486
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,318
- Right. - Should we film a video?

487
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,349
Why don't you say something to the CEO then?

488
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:58,719
(Let's see.)

489
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,889
Well...

490
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,890
(Crunchy)

491
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,359
(Who just made a crunchy sound?)

492
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,758
Go ahead and eat.

493
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,059
If you're hungry, you should eat.

494
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,029
I want to eat beef again.

495
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,599
(Let me just say this in advance. You're the best.)

496
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,700
(I also want beef instead of bread.)

497
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:17,768
Anyway, the final match is around the corner already.

498
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,808
Has it been four months?

499
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,240
I never thought this day would come.

500
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,849
- It felt so far away. - Totally.

501
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,348
Let's reflect on our journey.

502
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,848
It's been a while, but I'm reminded...

503
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:28,819
- of the identity mission. - Oh, that.

504
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,788
(They incorporated their story to showcase...)

505
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:34,089
(their energetic charm through "WATERFALL.")

506
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,189
Our fans loved it.

507
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,529
- Really? - I always read the feedback.

508
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,230
I took screenshots of some comments.

509
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,328
- Screenshots? - Should I read them?

510
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,368
Yes, go ahead.

511
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,828
"After watching this performance,"

512
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,900
"I watched all of your performances on music shows."

513
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,098
"You made me get curious about all of your performances..."

514
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,269
"only after one performance."

515
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,740
We got a new fan.

516
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,009
(Gosh, she's curious about us now.)

517
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,108
"You went for the energetic theme on a competition show."

518
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,409
"I'm a fan of another group, but I'm also rooting for you."

519
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,818
(Touched to be acknowledged by a non-fan)

520
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,619
- We were successful then. - That's an objective comment.

521
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,949
Come on. Let's hype us up more.

522
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,250
(Give me more compliments.)

523
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,719
"Personally, this is my favourite performance..."

524
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,618
"of all the performances I've watched from the show."

525
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:07,919
- "I wanted..." - Wait.

526
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,960
- Did you read this too? - I think I read this comment too.

527
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,159
- But the last part is important. - I think he took a screenshot...

528
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,529
for the last part.

529
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,969
"To be honest, I think it was all WOONO's face."

530
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,799
(To be honest, I think it was all WOONO's face.)

531
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,568
I knew it.

532
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,269
- That jerk. - I saw it coming.

533
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,439
That was the first screenshot I took.

534
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,109
(Energetic YOUNITE was acknowledged and loved by many viewers.)

535
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,808
We got another crazy mission after this.

536
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,480
- Right. - Water and Fire.

537
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,979
- Gosh. - What is it?

538
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,450
You guys don't look so happy.

539
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,578
- They practised a lot for it. - Right.

540
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,450
They practised almost every single day.

541
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,588
(They gave up Chuseok and practised for the entire month.)

542
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,190
(They passionately gave their all to this mission.)

543
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,758
(A sneak peek in the practice studio)

544
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,990
(You're killing me, SION!)

545
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,460
Who said you could be that sexy?

546
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,200
(HYUNGSEOK's powerful dance for the Fire Stage)

547
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,470
Isn't this how people say it? "He made me a convert."

548
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,240
(Bursting into laughter)

549
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,769
That's what people say nowadays, right?

550
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,039
You made me a convert!

551
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
(Fully comforted)

552
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,880
HYUNGSEOK! Well done!

553
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:02,980
You guys did well. You gave your all.

554
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,649
My gosh. Maybe, I shouldn't have washed their feet.

555
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,280
(Right! There was that too.)

556
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,889
What do you mean you shouldn't have?

557
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,058
(STEVE washed their feet with a hope that they would win 1st place...)

558
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,119
(in the 1st round of Round 3.)

559
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,429
(Rubbing meticulously)

560
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,800
This is nice.

561
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,099
(Washing their feet affectionately as they had to perform on stage)

562
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,469
(Thanks to STEVE, they worked hard to prepare for the performance.)

563
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,268
(Good job, my hands.)

564
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:28,237
- But still. They worked hard. - Right.

565
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,440
Then...

566
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,579
should I wash CRAVITY's feet?

567
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,139
(Why would you do that?)

568
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,447
(Glancing)

569
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,908
Because of me...

570
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,678
(He doesn't finish his sentence.)

571
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,078
- You think you jinxed them? - Yes.

572
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,118
- I jinxed them. - I see.

573
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,248
("They Ranked 6th Place after He Washed Their Feet")

574
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,158
You should visit all of the groups before the final match.

575
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,118
Okay. Then we'll be able to win first place.

576
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,158
(Innocent)

577
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,058
Only the final match remains now.

578
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,800
- Gosh. Okay. - Right. We worked hard!

579
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,598
We only have one performance to go now.

580
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,299
I wrote the song for the final match.

581
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,198
To give you a hint,

582
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,309
- I brought an item. - My gosh.

583
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,879
(A sword?)

584
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,779
We're "NITE."

585
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,210
- NITE. - YOUNITE?

586
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:10,809
We'll be knights.

587
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,448
While starring on this show, I personally believe...

588
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:17,389
that we came all this way thanks to our conviction.

589
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,158
So I wrote a song called "Conviction."

590
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,190
"Conviction?"

591
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:23,988
The message of the song is that we will keep our conviction...

592
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,328
for the final match...

593
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,659
as well as the next step we take after the show.

594
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,999
("Conviction" by YOUNITE)

595
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,198
(This song featuring 808 bass and drum sounds...)

596
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,468
(was produced by EUNSANG...)

597
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:33,638
(and conveys their conviction...)

598
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,800
(to persevere toward victory without giving up.)

599
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,538
Since I produced the song,

600
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,368
I'll be the ace.

601
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,678
I wanted to put other members...

602
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,308
who didn't get a chance to shine yet in the spotlight.

603
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,948
So this time, I want our group, YOUNITE,

604
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:44,448
- to come across as the ace. - Right.

605
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:46,820
- I'd like to end it on a good note. - I agree.

606
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,779
Don't you think we ought to win first place?

607
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,419
- Sounds great. - We'd really love to.

608
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,359
- It's a very difficult challenge. - Right.

609
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,820
Let's end the show after winning first place at least once.

610
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,889
Should we show them our passion?

611
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,759
(That's how they ended up here.)

612
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,129
There goes our ace.

613
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,098
- My gosh. - How much farther will he go up?

614
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,829
Will he bungee jump like an ace too?

615
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,198
(Stepping out)

616
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,670
There he is.

617
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,538
(Slightly nervous)

618
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,739
Can he actually jump?

619
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,638
(Since he's at 63m above ground, the highest point in Korea, )

620
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,480
(he'll need more than just his passion.)

621
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,980
(Will EUNSANG, the first one to go, be able to succeed?)

622
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,179
Is there anything you would like to say?

623
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,319
EUNHO, STEVE,

624
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,658
KYUNGMUN, HYUNGSEOK,

625
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:30,089
SION, DEY, and WOONO.

626
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,529
I love you!

627
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,529
- We love you! - You got this!

628
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,759
- I love you! - Yes!

629
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,469
- Let's go! - Let's go!

630
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,099
I'll do the countdown. Three, two, one.

631
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,510
Three, two, one, go.

632
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,709
One, go.

633
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,979
(EUNSANG flies.)

634
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
One, go.

635
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,650
(Throw yourself freely.)

636
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,090
He's a real man. EUNSANG, the man.

637
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,730
That's our ace.

638
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,828
- Gosh. - You're so cool.

639
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:06,960
That's legendary.

640
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,670
Let's go, members of YOUNITE.

641
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,869
Why are my eyes watering?

642
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,698
My eyes are watering because of the cold weather.

643
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:13,699
(Because of both the cold weather and being touched)

644
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,809
YOUNITE! Let's win first place!

645
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,879
- Let's win first place... - Okay.

646
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,509
- on Road to Kingdom. - Take a step forward.

647
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,050
Let's hang in there.

648
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,178
Jump.

649
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:28,750
(It doesn't matter if waves or storms swallow us up.)

650
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,689
(We can get through it together.)

651
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,519
Let's win first place on Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

652
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:37,730
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace gave us a chance...

653
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,260
to become more determined, and I love it.

654
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:44,070
YOUNITE's journey will continue.

655
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,469
Let's fight through the long journey together.

656
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,909
- Our family. Go. - Go.

657
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,010
- Are you ready? - Let's go.

658
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,649
In the Final Round,

659
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,679
I will do my best thinking it's the final battle.

660
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,519
I will give it my all so I have no regrets.

661
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,519
We will show you the conviction of YOUNITE.

662
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,369
("Conviction" by YOUNITE)

663
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,699
Awesome.

664
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:11,869
Princes.

665
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:14,269
That was good.

666
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,669
- Awesome. - That was good.

667
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,368
- Princes. - You were great.

668
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,308
(YOUNITE)

669
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:22,309
The princes.

670
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:42,260
The first stage by YOUNITE has ended.

671
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,199
It was an amazing opening for the Final Round of the show.

672
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,809
JUNGMO of CRAVITY,

673
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,980
I thought the frantic fan in you must've loved the performance.

674
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,750
What did you think?

675
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,519
First of all, the members of YOUNITE...

676
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:06,659
that are as handsome as I am danced with swords.

677
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,090
It was amazing.

678
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,090
It felt like I got a glimpse of a world from an animation.

679
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,899
It made me very happy.

680
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,469
I heard YOUNITE's member EUNSANG wrote the song.

681
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,539
That made it seem even more meaningful and appropriate...

682
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,440
for the Final Round.

683
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,010
Just like YOUNITE had hoped,

684
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,349
they completed a piece of art.

685
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,449
HAE MIN of 8TURN,

686
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,789
your eyes were glued to the stage the whole time.

687
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,949
How did you like the performance?

688
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,530
I had very high expectations for the stage,

689
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,860
and I was satisfied.

690
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,570
My friend and senior SION of YOUNITE...

691
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,030
was touched...

692
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,639
I mean it was touching to see him do his best.

693
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,340
Do you want to go have a tasty meal after this, SION?

694
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,280
Me too, SION.

695
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,449
Those were heartwarming words that also showed us...

696
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,820
how strong their friendship is.

697
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,860
It was a stage that showed us YOUNITE's conviction...

698
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,630
to make a lasting impression on us to the end.

699
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,829
A team that gets stronger in crises like a phoenix...

700
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,369
is getting ready for the next stage.

701
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,539
They have transformed into mischievous boys,

702
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,309
which is a totally different look for them, for the Final Round.

703
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,880
Their theme is the 90s street culture.

704
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,989
They will make their winning move with a carefree performance.

705
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,289
Will they be able to show us...

706
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,630
an unexpected twist in the result like they always did?

707
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,630
This is the second team in the Final Round.

708
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,999
(Final Round, The first performance of "Hit the Floor" by The CrewOne)

709
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,969
Ace of Ace, The CrewOne.

710
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,940
(The CrewOne, Final Round strategy meeting day)

711
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,079
(There is heavy silence in the air as always.)

712
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,190
Everyone.

713
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,759
Congratulations. We made it to the Final Round.

714
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,690
(Celebrating The CrewOne making it to the Final Round)

715
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,698
We're going to the Final Round.

716
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:27,860
Who are we?

717
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,530
- The CrewOne. - The CrewOne

718
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:31,500
We will never die.

719
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,869
- What's that? - What's that?

720
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:34,539
When did you prepare that?

721
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:36,709
The UndyingOne. Phoenix.

722
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,069
- What is that? - What is that?

723
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,908
(Celebrating The CrewOne making it to the Final Round)

724
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:42,750
(A surprise event for The CrewOne for making it to the Final Round)

725
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,308
(Final Round, bring it on.)

726
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,380
- What is that? - Wait a minute.

727
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,848
Stop it.

728
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,218
(Junseok desperately covers something.)

729
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:51,118
- Why? - Move him.

730
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,549
- Stop it. - Move over.

731
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,018
- He's crying. - He's crying.

732
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,559
(Junseok is crying.)

733
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:57,259
- Stop it. - He's crying.

734
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,730
(Junseok's bawling moment is one of the show's highlights.)

735
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,730
(1. When they survived from the Elimination Battle)

736
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,329
(2. When they were chosen to go to the Final Round)

737
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,900
(Crying)

738
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,999
These are your highlights.

739
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,009
Even if you have three photos like this,

740
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,539
this photo trumps it.

741
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,739
Look at that.

742
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,079
- Is that black blob Doyeom? - Yes.

743
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,110
- Doyeom is flying. - He's flying.

744
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,979
Bin has nothing special other than his face.

745
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,279
His face is special.

746
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,050
At least you have faces. I don't even have a face.

747
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,589
(Stealing the spotlight)

748
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,089
It's your biggest weapon.

749
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,389
It's okay. You look chiselled.

750
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,658
What do you think? Bin, Bain, and I prepared it.

751
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:34,959
- This is awesome. - Really?

752
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
That's right.

753
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:37,400
How did you find all those scene-stealer moments?

754
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,199
When did you prepare this?

755
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:40,768
Let's put it up here.

756
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:41,799
(30 minutes before The CrewOne arrived)

757
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,069
All these photos are great memories.

758
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,110
You bet they are.

759
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,509
The members will love it when they see it.

760
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,079
- They'll be very surprised. - Right.

761
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,178
Come to think of it, time flew by.

762
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:53,049
- You're right. - When we were practising...

763
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,479
for the Evaluation Match, we thought we'd win for sure.

764
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,518
Yes, we thought we'd take over the world.

765
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:57,649
That's what we thought.

766
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,589
We were so confident during our first interview.

767
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,819
- Then we slowly became modest. - Right.

768
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,618
- We hid our tails between our legs. - We're like roly-polys.

769
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,158
At first, I said, "I don't know why we are in sixth place."

770
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,698
"Something must've gone wrong."

771
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,800
"I regret it."

772
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:10,400
"I think it's over for us."

773
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,469
There was a gradation in my attitude.

774
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,999
There were many obstacles, but we made it to the Final Round.

775
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,638
We thought we were going to be eliminated...

776
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,238
but became 1 of the 5 in the Final Round.

777
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,578
You're right.

778
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,109
Those who survive...

779
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,210
are strong.

780
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,979
- Yes. - That's right.

781
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,518
Anyway, congratulations on making it to the Final Round.

782
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,018
(Patting themselves on the back for doing a good job)

783
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:31,819
We only have one mission left.

784
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,319
- That's right. - The New Song Mission.

785
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,959
- New song? - New song.

786
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,788
- New song? - New song.

787
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,259
Our song.

788
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,058
The CrewOne's debut song.

789
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,130
- That's right. - That's right.

790
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,268
Do you remember how many songs we listened to before choosing it?

791
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:45,768
- We listened to almost 200 songs. - That's right.

792
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:47,570
- My ears were burning. - I thought my ears were bleeding.

793
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,109
Should we call out the name of our song together?

794
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,839
- "Hit the Floor." - "Hit the Floor."

795
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,309
(What kind of song is "Hit the Floor?")

796
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,880
It has an old-school street hip-hop vibe.

797
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,579
The title means "let's dance like crazy."

798
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,888
"Hit the Floor" is a very free and hip song.

799
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:07,118
I think we'll be able to come up with a performance...

800
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,659
that will show you our various charm.

801
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,928
(A hip-hop song with fun synth riffs and a heavy 808 bass, )

802
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,129
(the song contains the energy of The CrewOne...)

803
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,500
(jumping around freely and having fun on stage.)

804
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,899
"Hit the Floor" is Junseok.

805
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,599
Junseok is the member that dances like crazy the best.

806
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,570
Junseok dances like crazy.

807
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,909
He is the ace that took us to a high rank.

808
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,849
So we chose Junseok as our ace again.

809
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,449
(I'll do my best in the Final Round!)

810
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,819
Isn't this the first time all the members are going together?

811
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,889
- Yes. - Yes.

812
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,619
This will be fun.

813
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:45,090
(They listen to their new song even in the van.)

814
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,429
(Where are they headed?)

815
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,368
(They open the window.)

816
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,399
Man.

817
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,569
(Junseok is in a different vehicle.)

818
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,269
Where are you going?

819
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,610
I'm going to the Han River.

820
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,779
In order to find our free vibe...

821
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,979
to show you the 90s hip-hop street culture,

822
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,408
in our "Hit the Floor" performance,

823
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:06,449
we came to the Han River.

824
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:09,619
(Do you want to be free? Follow me.)

825
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,089
Okay, let's go feel the vibe.

826
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,860
- Let's go. - Free the free.

827
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,058
This is really nice.

828
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:18,789
- I feel refreshed. - It's so refreshing.

829
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,760
The air is different from that of our studio.

830
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,729
We're here to be free.

831
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,299
We have to be free. Go with the flow.

832
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,899
The flow? Okay.

833
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,038
(Let your body feel the vibe.)

834
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,138
- We can't walk normally, right? - No.

835
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:32,010
- Like this? - Like this.

836
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,179
(Looking around)

837
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:36,979
Dogs.

838
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,049
- And kids. - I am honestly...

839
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,820
embarrassed when people look at me.

840
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,089
We're The CrewOne.

841
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,320
(He makes time to promote the group to people.)

842
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,888
- Gosh. - This is embarrassing.

843
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,659
(This is too embarrassing.)

844
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,260
- He's talking to people. - That embarrasses me.

845
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:56,199
It's really embarrassing.

846
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:58,630
We have the Han River master.

847
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,469
- He's the HM. - Geonu, the Han River master.

848
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:05,939
(Geonu, the Han River master that feels no embarrassment)

849
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,739
Have you ever gone to the Han River together?

850
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,380
I sometimes go with Sangwoo and dance there.

851
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,309
You dance at the Han River?

852
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,780
(Geonu and Sangwoo regularly danced at the Han River.)

853
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,820
(Wherever we dance becomes the stage.)

854
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:19,089
- I'm shy. What should I do? - I don't know what to do.

855
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:23,329
You have to get rid of the shyness and awkwardness.

856
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,158
When people pass by,

857
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,658
you become timid.

858
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:28,659
- That's right. - Of course.

859
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,999
You have to overcome that.

860
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,169
(Overcoming your embarrassment is true hip-hop, HM Geonu)

861
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,638
The world looks different.

862
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:34,840
I feel so free.

863
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,169
What's that?

864
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,170
(They see other members.)

865
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:38,510
- What are they doing? - What are they doing?

866
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,739
They look different.

867
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,449
They're finding their vibe.

868
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,050
Show us.

869
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,880
Were you dancing?

870
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:51,019
(HM Geonu suddenly led them into a dance session.)

871
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,889
This is how you have fun.

872
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,320
This is hip-hop.

873
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,089
How do you feel about being at the Han River?

874
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,690
This is it. There's freedom.

875
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,429
- I'm so happy. - This is it.

876
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,530
- This is what we wanted. - Have fun.

877
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:08,899
Just having fun and taking in the fresh air at night...

878
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,070
with all the other members...

879
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,239
made me feel liberated.

880
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,109
We were able to think...

881
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,578
about what freedom is...

882
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,550
and what kind of performance we want to create.

883
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,050
This is it.

884
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,650
This is what we have to express on stage.

885
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,150
I wanted to include the street vibe...

886
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:29,788
we experienced at the Han River...

887
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:32,428
like skateboarding and graffiti.

888
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:33,530
A skate park.

889
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:37,928
I want a cute skate park.

890
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:40,639
Wouldn't it be nice to ride a skateboard on stage?

891
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,698
(The CrewOne starts practising skateboarding right away.)

892
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,709
All right.

893
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,710
(The CrewOne starts practising skateboarding right away.)

894
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:47,639
(The skateboards will give the stage a nice vibe.)

895
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,509
For the Final Round after the long journey,

896
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,150
we came up with a festive performance.

897
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,149
(They are free and confident! What kind of performance...)

898
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,889
(will The CrewOne put on for the Final Round?)

899
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,759
- It's okay. - Go, The CrewOne.

900
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,259
- We got this. - Let's go.

901
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,389
He got up.

902
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:12,199
("Hit the Floor" by The CrewOne)

903
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,809
- Let's go. - Let's go.

904
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,119
- Let's go. - Let's go.

905
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,849
- Let's go. - Let's go.

906
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,690
- Let's go. - Let's go.

907
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,488
- Let's go. - Let's go.

908
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:39,189
- Let's go. - Let's go.

909
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,799
- Go for it. - Yes.

910
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,029
- Go. - Go.

911
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,099
- Yes. - All right.

912
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,599
- Let's go. - Let's go.

913
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,429
Champion.

914
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,309
Let's go.

915
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,928
The CrewOne!

916
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,099
Let's go.

917
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,199
Let's go.

918
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,669
Hey.

919
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,800
Don't come closer.

920
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,269
Stage.

921
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,879
Is that all you got?

922
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,179
We have more.

923
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:45,780
- Let's go. - Let's go.

924
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:49,980
Look at that move.

925
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,519
Hey.

926
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:17,949
Let's go.

927
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:24,989
Come on.

928
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,789
Let's go.

929
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,670
- Yes! - That was incredible.

930
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:48,138
You guys killed it.

931
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,409
You guys killed it.

932
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,579
Amazing!

933
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:57,949
Great job, guys!

934
00:56:58,349 --> 00:56:59,419
Nice!

935
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,989
- Nice. - Nice.

936
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,360
Great job!

937
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:08,429
- They did so well. - That was perfect.

938
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,670
The second performance by The CrewOne has ended.

939
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,340
Even I can feel their energy.

940
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:23,980
EUNHO of YOUNITE.

941
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,210
What did you think about their performance?

942
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,719
First off, The CrewOne is a band that I adore,

943
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,189
and it was such a pleasure and an honour...

944
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,489
to watch the performance of their debut song.

945
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,389
Watching them enjoy the performance,

946
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,159
I wanted to run up to the stage...

947
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:40,630
and sing, "Hit the floor."

948
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:42,630
Thank you for the great performance.

949
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,940
That was a performance of 200-percent teamwork.

950
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,769
Next, YOON SUNG of 8TURN,

951
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,039
what did you think about The CrewOne's performance?

952
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,710
This is what I really wanted to see.

953
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,619
It was so hip and cool.

954
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,689
The CrewOne's unique...

955
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,219
How should I put it?

956
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,459
Their attitude and funky theme...

957
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,259
mixed so well together.

958
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,029
That's my thought about it.

959
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,900
I've become their fan once again.

960
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,340
Nice.

961
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,780
We were able to discover The CrewOne's new charms.

962
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:31,650
Next, it's the third team.

963
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,219
Though they have the least amount of members,

964
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,289
they fill the whole stage with their skills.

965
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,659
Apparently, they put their souls into this performance...

966
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,329
to win the championship.

967
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,129
This time, they'll turn into vampires...

968
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,599
and show us something we've never seen before.

969
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,369
As it's their second attempt,

970
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,139
I can't wait to find out if they'll prove themselves...

971
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,639
with their polished skills and experience.

972
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,280
This is the third team in the finals.

973
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,279
Ace of Ace, ONEUS.

974
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,619
(Premier of "I KNOW YOU KNOW" by ONEUS)

975
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,360
(Sometime before the finals)

976
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,590
(What's this place with a bright, red sign?)

977
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,360
(Full of delicious-looking ingredients)

978
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,030
(The spicy broth is also boiling.)

979
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,170
(It's the food in trend, hot pot!)

980
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:27,039
(Stirring)

981
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:29,098
(Someone is making something.)

982
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,670
(It's KEON HEE?)

983
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,909
It's about time they got here.

984
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,439
- Is this it? - What is this place?

985
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,280
- He said he'd buy us tasty food. - What is this place?

986
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,480
Knock, knock.

987
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,110
- Hi. - Hi.

988
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:41,920
(The table is full.)

989
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:43,919
(They smile brightly at the thought of eating tasty food.)

990
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,149
I missed you.

991
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,388
You look so rich.

992
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:47,419
Welcome.

993
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,988
- That's a lot of food. - I know, right?

994
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:50,159
I'm happy.

995
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,959
We've been working so hard on Road to Kingdom until now.

996
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,698
- Right. - For the members who worked hard...

997
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:57,800
Is it a team dinner?

998
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,428
It's a team dinner.

999
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,170
(It's a team dinner for ONEUS.)

1000
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,598
- We still need to eat. - I'm touched.

1001
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,908
I came up with a new sauce,

1002
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:08,979
and my own teammates haven't tried it.

1003
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,578
- Right. - You're right.

1004
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:11,879
We've been dying to try it.

1005
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,050
- We should also try it. - It's literally our first time.

1006
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:15,980
My fans have loved me so much,

1007
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,989
but their love for my sauces was especially big.

1008
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:21,888
There are so many people...

1009
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:24,788
who know about my sauce and not know who ONEUS is.

1010
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:26,488
I came up with a new type of sauce,

1011
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,529
hoping that people would come to watch our show more.

1012
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,928
I think your sincerity came through.

1013
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:32,929
Is that right?

1014
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,800
(It's even famous among other singers.)

1015
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,499
This sauce is really good.

1016
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,739
What kind of sauce is it?

1017
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,369
It's KEON HEE's sauce.

1018
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,678
Can I go to a hot pot restaurant with you?

1019
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,679
Let's go.

1020
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,709
(A thumb-up)

1021
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,179
I'm dying to taste your sauce.

1022
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:47,019
(Are you curious about the viral sauce?)

1023
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,150
The sauce made by the creator.

1024
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,550
I'll show you right now.

1025
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,289
First, onions.

1026
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:55,218
This is a very important part of the recipe.

1027
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,329
We eat shredded onions when we eat meat, right?

1028
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,760
You need a lot of onions just like that.

1029
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,699
That's filled with onions.

1030
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:04,199
This is the highlight. This is the kick.

1031
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,599
And...

1032
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,399
Swamp the onions with soy sauce.

1033
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,799
Do you know the sauce for dumplings?

1034
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,339
It's something like that.

1035
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,969
I'll give it that touch.

1036
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,879
You guys like spicy food, right?

1037
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,510
You're really quick.

1038
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,380
Of course. A little bit of crushed garlic,

1039
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,079
and sprinkle...

1040
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:22,679
sesame seeds.

1041
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,189
There you have it.

1042
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,119
(KEON HEE's sauce number 2 is finished.)

1043
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,518
(KEON HEE's sauce number 2 recipe)

1044
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:29,889
You can easily make this too.

1045
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:33,259
Can we finally try the sauce made by KEON HEE's love?

1046
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,260
Before that...

1047
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:36,860
(What is it?)

1048
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,968
(He takes something out.)

1049
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,070
What's that?

1050
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,500
He's a chef!

1051
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:44,969
What is it?

1052
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,010
(A mysterious, black cloth)

1053
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:49,110
(He puts a blindfold on SEO HO.)

1054
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,379
(Laughing)

1055
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,380
(KEON HEE is unstoppable.)

1056
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:54,178
Sir, may I give you a taste of it?

1057
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:55,848
(He's ready.)

1058
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,789
There are three types of sauce.

1059
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,549
They're numbers 1, 2, and 3.

1060
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,460
(Guess KEON HEE's sauce among these 3 sauces!)

1061
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:02,689
Here goes sauce number one.

1062
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,859
When do I open my mouth?

1063
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,729
You need to smell it first.

1064
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,759
(Sniffing)

1065
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,959
- Wait. - Does that smell like KEON HEE's?

1066
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,199
(What do you think?)

1067
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:12,670
I can only smell mala.

1068
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,939
(The first sauce only smells like mala sauce.)

1069
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,968
(Excited)

1070
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,340
Why are you making that sound?

1071
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,840
(Mr. Lee slowly savours it.)

1072
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,678
- Do you like it? - It's not bad.

1073
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:22,908
- It's not bad? - It's not bad.

1074
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,149
Here goes sauce number two.

1075
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,209
(Open your mouth!)

1076
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,280
You need to open wide.

1077
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,849
What do you think?

1078
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,749
(Thinking)

1079
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,049
(Nervous for some reason)

1080
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,090
Is it good?

1081
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:34,018
Okay. Next.

1082
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:35,989
- What? - What was that?

1083
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:38,259
I think he actually believes he's Mr. Paik Jong Won.

1084
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,760
Maybe you're just hungry.

1085
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,459
(He tries the third sauce while they laugh.)

1086
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,468
If you eat today's hot pot...

1087
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,829
with only one of these three sauces...

1088
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,570
(What's SEO HO's choice?)

1089
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,440
I'd go with sauce number two.

1090
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:52,768
Sauce number two.

1091
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,109
The second one was fine. It was the neatest.

1092
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,679
Do you mean that?

1093
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,510
Is sauce number two not KEON HEE's?

1094
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,549
Please take off your blindfold.

1095
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,649
What if I'm wrong, KEON HEE?

1096
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,989
It'll just be embarrassing.

1097
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,888
They're sauce numbers 1, 2, and 3.

1098
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:06,988
(Was the 2nd sauce SEO HO chose made by KEON HEE?)

1099
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:09,659
SEO HO has chosen...

1100
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:11,659
(Nervous)

1101
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,759
KEON HEE's sauce!

1102
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,899
(That's a relief.)

1103
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,598
- That's fortunate. - That's fortunate.

1104
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:19,599
I'm glad that I have the approval from a fellow member.

1105
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:21,899
- Can we try it now? - Let's try it.

1106
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,738
- We haven't tried it yet. - I can finally taste it!

1107
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:25,939
Let's give it a go.

1108
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,210
(A big bite)

1109
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,839
It's so good.

1110
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,849
(XION, today's assistant, also tries it.)

1111
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,550
Do you like it?

1112
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,550
(Enjoying it)

1113
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:36,279
I hope ONEUS is more loved than this sauce.

1114
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,518
- Let's cheer up. - Let's look great in the finals.

1115
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:39,549
I'm confident.

1116
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:42,319
WOONG, who's been doing great since the Evaluation Match.

1117
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,360
(Dancing out of gratitude)

1118
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:45,428
You did great.

1119
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:46,730
(A thankful spoon of hot pot)

1120
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,099
You've eaten that,

1121
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,859
so good luck with being the ace again!

1122
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,030
(Good luck with being the ace in the finals, HWAN WOONG!)

1123
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:55,139
Thanks to Road to Kingdom,

1124
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,699
Great work.

1125
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:00,210
I feel a stronger bond with the members.

1126
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,078
I think I have come this far thanks to the members...

1127
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:04,849
who were there for me.

1128
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,709
I believe...

1129
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,118
we did our best until Round Three.

1130
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,150
Now, it's time to become the best.

1131
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,848
Did you all enjoy the food?

1132
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:15,118
Yes.

1133
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,459
Now, we need to prepare for the finals.

1134
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,029
- Yes. - We'll be performing...

1135
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:20,729
a new song, right?

1136
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,629
I'm thinking about showing people...

1137
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,268
our new side, even in the finals.

1138
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:27,840
- Our new side? - Yes.

1139
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:30,499
There is something that we haven't tried yet.

1140
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,639
(We haven't tried it? What is it?)

1141
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,238
A sexy theme.

1142
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:35,638
(That's true.)

1143
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,678
You're right.

1144
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:40,078
Our fans are also waiting for the return of the lords.

1145
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,150
Right.

1146
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,988
("COME BACK HOME" was their song in the finals in the last season.)

1147
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:47,359
("COME BACK HOME" by ONEUS is a medieval-themed song...)

1148
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,718
(depicting the desperate struggle of the lords...)

1149
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,760
(who turned into vampires due to a curse.)

1150
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,729
We'll keep the vampire theme,

1151
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,629
while portraying...

1152
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,428
sexiness and something modern.

1153
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:00,000
I think that'll be nice.

1154
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,638
It's true that we've never tried modern vampires.

1155
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:03,639
Right.

1156
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:05,768
Ta-da.

1157
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:08,480
We're practising for the finals.

1158
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:10,380
(SEO HO is moving gym equipment?)

1159
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,079
(There's a dance which he has to do upside-down.)

1160
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:17,489
The song that ONEUS will perform in the finals...

1161
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:20,249
is "I KNOW YOU KNOW" by ONEUS.

1162
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,658
(This boom-bap rhythm track samples Khachaturian's "Masquerade Suite,")

1163
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:23,419
(featuring an elegant atmosphere...)

1164
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,059
(reminiscent of a vampire performing a seductive dance.)

1165
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,029
The members of ONEUS turn into seductive beings...

1166
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,959
like vampires.

1167
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,428
And we'll be so maturely sensual...

1168
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:36,440
to bewitch all the viewers.

1169
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:39,268
So, I hope you will be careful when you watch it.

1170
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,679
You might be captivated by us in an instant.

1171
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,979
It's our final performance.

1172
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,949
First place as a team, which I've always said.

1173
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,018
A performance that's undoubtedly number one.

1174
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:53,219
That will be our goal.

1175
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,559
- Let's go! - Five, six.

1176
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,139
(Can they be number 1 as they wished with the final performance?)

1177
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,519
("I KNOW YOU KNOW" by ONEUS)

1178
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:22,789
(KEON HEE, buy me hot pot.)

1179
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:25,960
Nice.

1180
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:31,829
That was excellent.

1181
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,539
That was the third performance by ONEUS.

1182
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,639
The CrewOne has tried a vampire them before,

1183
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,279
so, Seunghwan,

1184
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,649
what did you think about the performance by ONEUS?

1185
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:48,019
In Round One,

1186
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,579
we did a vampire-themed performance,

1187
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,789
and the vampire-themed performance by ONEUS...

1188
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:55,689
seemed maturer,

1189
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:58,689
and it gave me the impression of a 1,000-year-old vampire.

1190
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:03,460
When SEO HO sang upside-down...

1191
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,699
hanging on the bar,

1192
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:08,699
it was so attractive that I was willing to give my neck.

1193
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,409
It was fantastic.

1194
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,479
ONEUS, do you know how much we love you?

1195
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,310
I know, and you know.

1196
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:21,720
Thank you for the performance!

1197
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,119
Next, SEONGMIN of CRAVITY.

1198
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:32,460
ONEUS said they'd give us a show that would make them...

1199
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,659
undoubtedly number one.

1200
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,899
As the current number one, what would you say to them?

1201
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:41,698
First, I thoroughly enjoyed...

1202
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:44,840
the sexy, vampire-themed performance.

1203
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,908
But CRAVITY has also practised hard...

1204
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:49,909
aiming to be number one,

1205
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,380
so we won't let you take it away that easily.

1206
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,720
How dare you? Never!

1207
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,760
All the teams are eager to be the champion...

1208
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:08,899
of Road to Kingdom.

1209
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,129
That was the final performance by ONEUS...

1210
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,869
that surprises us with their transitions.

1211
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,109
While the groups are giving us fabulous shows of their new songs,

1212
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,779
the finals are almost halfway done.

1213
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,220
Now,

1214
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:31,489
we will reveal...

1215
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,720
the chart rankings of the five teams of their new songs...

1216
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,560
that were released last week.

1217
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,600
No!

1218
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,409
We have gathered the data...

1219
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,750
of the 5 new songs for 3 days...

1220
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:02,119
from November 1 to November 3.

1221
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,859
Let's find out the new song chart rankings.

1222
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,630
Please reveal the rankings that will distribute 30,000 points...

1223
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,529
right now.

1224
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,970
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

1225
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:23,140
(CRAVITY, ONEUS, 8TURN, The CrewOne, and YOUNITE)

1226
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,869
- Hey! - What?

1227
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,010
There's no way!

1228
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,020
(CRAVITY is number 1 in the new song chart rankings.)

1229
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:46,329
CRAVITY places first in the new song chart rankings.

1230
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,470
Now, we have to hear from CRAVITY, the number-one team.

1231
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:01,510
MINHEE of CRAVITY, please say a few words.

1232
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,909
First, we'd like to thank everyone...

1233
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,710
for listening to "HISTORIA..."

1234
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,220
to root for CRAVITY in your busy days...

1235
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:12,250
and giving us support.

1236
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,289
Please look forward to our performance of the song...

1237
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:16,659
that will live up to your expectations.

1238
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,899
For the teams ranked 2nd to 5th,

1239
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,100
converted scores will be applied...

1240
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,300
based on the percentage of number one group's points.

1241
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,239
The pre-match scores...

1242
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,609
and the new song chart rankings have been revealed.

1243
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,479
We only have the 70,000 points...

1244
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:43,750
from the live broadcast voting of the finals remaining.

1245
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,789
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1246
01:14:50,689 --> 01:14:51,789
The final winner...

1247
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:55,630
will be decided by you, the viewers.

1248
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:02,038
Please vote for the only team that you think deserves to be the ace.

1249
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,938
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace, Final Voting)

1250
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:06,439
We encourage you to participate by voting through text messages...

1251
01:15:06,539 --> 01:15:08,340
and the Mnet Plus app.

1252
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:29,899
Now, we'll move on to the fourth team in the finals.

1253
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,770
Just like their dynamic rankings, this team has been showing...

1254
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,840
amazing progress on Road to Kingdom.

1255
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:42,679
They've prepared a teenager-themed performance,

1256
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,909
which they're the most confident in,

1257
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:48,019
and they promise to surpass that of the Evaluation Match,

1258
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:49,119
which placed first.

1259
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:54,220
Can they make this a turning point...

1260
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:57,119
with their vigour and young energy as the youngest team?

1261
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:01,500
The fourth team in the finals.

1262
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:05,368
Ace of Ace, 8TURN.

1263
01:16:05,369 --> 01:16:07,228
(Premiere of "SPEED RUN" by 8TURN)

1264
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,039
- Let's go! - Go, 8TURN!

1265
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:11,739
Today's weather is as amazing as my face.

1266
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:16,979
When is he coming out? He is coming out today, right?

1267
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,310
He's late.

1268
01:16:19,149 --> 01:16:20,210
There's SEUNG HEON.

1269
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,449
- Is he here? - He's coming.

1270
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,049
- Where? - There he comes!

1271
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,289
(Making a fuss)

1272
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:26,489
Oh, my gosh!

1273
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:29,460
- Hey! - Hey!

1274
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,959
(They successfully surprised him on his day after school.)

1275
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,328
SEUNG HEON, why couldn't you make it to the school trip?

1276
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,460
- Please explain. - Explain yourself!

1277
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,868
- Talk. - Explain yourself!

1278
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:41,999
I heard you advanced to the finals of Road to Kingdom.

1279
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,599
Tell us how you feel about choosing the finals...

1280
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,068
over the school trip.

1281
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:47,170
I appreciate everyone for helping me get to the finals.

1282
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:48,939
What are you doing here?

1283
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,339
- We came here to see you. - To see you.

1284
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,108
We felt bad that you couldn't go on the school trip.

1285
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:53,148
Exactly.

1286
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:55,419
We'll do a great job in the finals and send you on a vacation.

1287
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,719
You look like such a student...

1288
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,288
- in school uniform. - He's so cute.

1289
01:16:58,289 --> 01:16:59,549
- So tiny. - By the way,

1290
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,049
I think it suits our theme in the finals.

1291
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,158
What do you think about performing in this?

1292
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,159
- On the stage? - Yes.

1293
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,159
That's not a bad idea.

1294
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:08,028
The theme of our new song in the finals is...

1295
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:09,059
High teen!

1296
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,099
High school teenagers and youth.

1297
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,569
Sweet eighteen, you know.

1298
01:17:14,369 --> 01:17:16,100
I feel like I'm actually going to school.

1299
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,438
That looks scrumptious.

1300
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:20,608
You know that tteokbokki sold in front of schools is the best.

1301
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:22,439
They used to sell it in a cup.

1302
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,108
Think of it as a large cup.

1303
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:25,509
(JAE YUN is a logical type.)

1304
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,949
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1305
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,180
(They don't talk and only focus on tteokbokki.)

1306
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,249
(It's delicious!)

1307
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,550
- Do you usually come here? - Yes.

1308
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,260
It's been so long since I last had this.

1309
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:38,759
This is tasty.

1310
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,889
(Eating at the same time)

1311
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:41,599
- We ate so fast. - That was great.

1312
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,129
I'm so full.

1313
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,770
I can't practice like this.

1314
01:17:45,029 --> 01:17:46,469
No, we need to practice.

1315
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:48,469
Let's go and experience being Korean teenagers.

1316
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:50,469
The young energy from when we were students.

1317
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:52,068
That's the only way we can perfectly pull off...

1318
01:17:52,069 --> 01:17:53,939
- the teenager vibe in the finals. - Right.

1319
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,478
- Shall we go now? - Let's go.

1320
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:57,439
- You should guide us. - Let's go!

1321
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,250
Welcome to my class.

1322
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:03,948
(They enter the youngest member's class.)

1323
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:05,519
They have great desks these days.

1324
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,219
"Don't regret who you were,"

1325
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,019
"and focus on improving who you are now."

1326
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,618
- Do you also have a locker? - Yes.

1327
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,059
Number 17, SEUNG HEON.

1328
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,759
(There will be a quick inspection.)

1329
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,329
You have a textbook?

1330
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,528
(I'm a student, guys.)

1331
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,529
Of course, I do.

1332
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,828
Where's your desk?

1333
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:19,970
- Here. - Where is it?

1334
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,000
Gosh.

1335
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,499
Were you eating chips in secret during class?

1336
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,970
- That's so wrong. - This was a setup!

1337
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:29,279
- The teacher's coming! - He's coming!

1338
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,648
- Go to your seats. - The teacher's here.

1339
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:33,948
- Be quiet. - Oh, gosh.

1340
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:35,118
Hi, guys.

1341
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:36,680
- Hello. - Hello.

1342
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:38,220
Attention.

1343
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,319
(Attention, everyone.)

1344
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:42,359
Bow to the principal.

1345
01:18:42,619 --> 01:18:43,619
(YOON SUNG, student teacher)

1346
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:44,619
(YOON SUNG, principal)

1347
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,828
(Bursting into laughter)

1348
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:47,229
We'll be good sons.

1349
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,600
Okay.

1350
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:50,430
No more jokes, guys.

1351
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:51,969
(Laughing)

1352
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:55,269
We came here for our new song for the finals.

1353
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,438
- Right. - Right.

1354
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:57,639
We even wrote the lyrics.

1355
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,068
- We did. - Who were they?

1356
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:00,640
Raise your hands if you wrote the lyrics.

1357
01:19:00,739 --> 01:19:02,109
- That's a lot. - Raise them up high.

1358
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,538
I realized why yours was picked...

1359
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,948
when I saw the introduction part of your lyrics.

1360
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:09,019
As soon as it began, it went, "Gather up, guys,"

1361
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,220
and got everyone's attention. That was so cool.

1362
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:14,188
- I thought, "He did a good job." - I liked that part.

1363
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:15,889
"What can't we overcome?"

1364
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,419
(Humming the lyrics)

1365
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,060
- Really? - That was...

1366
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:20,728
"Yours and my belief on this stage?"

1367
01:19:20,729 --> 01:19:23,228
"What can't we overcome" was mine.

1368
01:19:23,229 --> 01:19:24,499
"Yours and my belief on this stage" was mine.

1369
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,629
It was you?

1370
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,769
(Perfect chemistry)

1371
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,538
I like these lyrics too.

1372
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:31,908
I wrote it while thinking about Road to Kingdom.

1373
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:33,510
"What can't we overcome?"

1374
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:36,278
("SPEED RUN" by 8TURN is an alternative hip-hop track...)

1375
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:38,849
(highlighted by a funky and addictive guitar riff, )

1376
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:42,020
(showcasing 8TURN's unique boldness and useful energy.)

1377
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:46,090
We've suffered many times in the competition, right?

1378
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:50,189
We could survive only when we had good results.

1379
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,158
We struggled...

1380
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,759
to stand out so that we wouldn't be eliminated.

1381
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,398
We've been fiercely trying to add more things.

1382
01:19:57,399 --> 01:19:59,728
But we can enjoy it in the finals,

1383
01:19:59,729 --> 01:20:01,328
and I'm grateful that we can focus on making a performance...

1384
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:02,399
that we can be satisfied with.

1385
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:05,670
The song in the finals itself...

1386
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:08,109
suits the finals so well.

1387
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:09,908
- It's truly a finale. - It is.

1388
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:12,049
We have a part where we use basketballs,

1389
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:13,408
- so we should go to the gym. - Yes.

1390
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:15,318
You can feel the high school vibe in the school gym.

1391
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:16,648
Let's go to the school gym!

1392
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:17,749
(They move to practice their choreography.)

1393
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,849
Let's go!

1394
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,389
(8TURN is practising a dance using basketballs...)

1395
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:21,989
(for the finals.)

1396
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,989
Like a musical in a high school.

1397
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:30,060
The audience will also go back to the time when they were students.

1398
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,130
The song is called "SPEED RUN."

1399
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,538
This song holds the ambition...

1400
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,539
to announce a new start for 8TURN...

1401
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:40,810
through the final stage and to soar even higher.

1402
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:44,339
It's a lot of pressure that I'm the ace...

1403
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,049
at the end of this long journey,

1404
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,849
but we tried to prepare a performance...

1405
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:52,050
where there are eight aces instead of just one.

1406
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,349
I'll fly to the sky with the members...

1407
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,359
with no fear in my heart.

1408
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,858
We'll prove to you that no one can beat...

1409
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:00,260
those who enjoy the game.

1410
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:01,960
Seniors,

1411
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,099
the youngest group's revolt hasn't ended yet.

1412
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,399
- Whose turn? - 8TURN!

1413
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,100
- We never die. - Let's go!

1414
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,469
(Let's check out 8TURN's performance...)

1415
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,239
(that's full of young energy.)

1416
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:16,078
8TURN!

1417
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:18,140
Let's go!

1418
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:22,079
Go, 8TURN!

1419
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:25,750
("SPEED RUN" by 8TURN)

1420
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,640
- Hey! 8TURN! - Hey! 8TURN!

1421
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:35,710
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

1422
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,759
Whose turn?

1423
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,459
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

1424
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,560
Let's go!

1425
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:09,939
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

1426
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,449
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

1427
01:25:15,649 --> 01:25:17,549
(KEON HEE will buy you guys hot pot.)

1428
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:21,249
(Stop crushing it out there, 8TURN!)

1429
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,659
- Thank you. - 8TURN!

1430
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,329
- YOUNITE! - Yes!

1431
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:28,600
You guys killed it!

1432
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,899
What did you say?

1433
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:38,739
The fourth performance was by 8TURN.

1434
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:43,079
They've heated up the stage with their pleasant energy.

1435
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:45,409
DEY of YOUNITE,

1436
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:49,119
may I ask you to rap your thoughts about the performance?

1437
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:50,479
Yes.

1438
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:53,390
I did write some beforehand.

1439
01:25:55,319 --> 01:25:57,188
I'm going to need you to react loudly.

1440
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:58,219
- Yes! - Yes!

1441
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,229
Okay.

1442
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:02,159
What I'm saying right now is 100 percent

1443
01:26:06,869 --> 01:26:09,539
Young boy, They're truly the best

1444
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,839
8TURN, turn the world upside down

1445
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,970
Let's go get it!

1446
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:19,449
Nice!

1447
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:27,049
That was DEY's opinion...

1448
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,460
as impressive as his family.

1449
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,960
Next, HWAN WOONG of ONEUS.

1450
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:36,259
We have information that you know about 8TURN's eagerness...

1451
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,728
to win the championship better than anyone.

1452
01:26:38,729 --> 01:26:40,930
What did you think about today's performance?

1453
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:45,809
I think I know...

1454
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,809
how passionate 8TURN is...

1455
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:50,179
more than the others.

1456
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:52,309
Recently, I was invited...

1457
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:55,149
to 8TURN's group chat.

1458
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,179
Back then, the group chat's name...

1459
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:00,420
was "Road to Kingdom Winner Team."

1460
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:03,658
I felt 8TURN's potential...

1461
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:07,129
and 8TURN's unique energy through their performance.

1462
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,229
They were really awesome.

1463
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:16,170
Nice. Seniors are praising 8TURN highly.

1464
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,969
It was 8TURN's performance showing the youngest team's...

1465
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,439
spirit and identity.

1466
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,409
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace, the Final Round.

1467
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:32,250
There's only one last performance left.

1468
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:34,720
Already?

1469
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,859
Although they started at the tear-jerking seventh place,

1470
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:42,100
this team got first place in the Team Ranking in every match...

1471
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:45,430
and advanced to the finals as first place in the Overall Ranking.

1472
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,699
In the final performance,

1473
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,568
this team will prove their strong ambition...

1474
01:27:52,569 --> 01:27:54,840
of making their own history.

1475
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:59,408
Will they be able to confirm...

1476
01:27:59,409 --> 01:28:02,379
their reputation as the strongest performance team...

1477
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,520
regardless of genre?

1478
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,859
Here's the last team of the finals.

1479
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:13,759
Ace of Ace, CRAVITY.

1480
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,229
(Revealing "HISTORIA" by CRAVITY)

1481
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:22,600
(A day in October filled with autumnal mood)

1482
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:27,439
(Where did CRAVITY visit before the Final Round?)

1483
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:30,609
(CRAVITY is meditating in a temple.)

1484
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,108
From the Evaluation Match to Round Three,

1485
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:35,979
we worked hard like crazy.

1486
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,519
Before the finals, this was necessary for us.

1487
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,618
(To shake off the pressure)

1488
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:41,919
Peace of mind.

1489
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,319
(We came to find peace of mind.)

1490
01:28:45,489 --> 01:28:47,760
This place has good energy.

1491
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,158
I can feel the hard feelings...

1492
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,799
I had until now are being washed away.

1493
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,528
I've become calm.

1494
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,898
Road to Kingdom started in early summer.

1495
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:58,868
It's already the chilly early winter.

1496
01:28:58,869 --> 01:29:00,709
- I know, right? - It's cold.

1497
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,010
It's really winter.

1498
01:29:02,409 --> 01:29:05,179
We've only got the finals left. How do you feel?

1499
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,908
I feel very proud of myself...

1500
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:09,419
and the members for advancing to the finals.

1501
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,219
It's as if we've become stronger.

1502
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,188
You're right. Time passed by quickly.

1503
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:15,688
We performed four group performances.

1504
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:17,189
Right. No, three.

1505
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:18,760
The Evaluation Match.

1506
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,289
We couldn't do it.

1507
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:22,129
Right.

1508
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:23,429
(Looking away)

1509
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,600
We couldn't.

1510
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:26,699
While we're at it...

1511
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,629
Inner peace.

1512
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:30,898
(Looking for the peace of mind that has left him)

1513
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:33,039
How do you feel now? Are you better?

1514
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,170
(Exhaling)

1515
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:36,409
Yes.

1516
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:38,609
Putting aside coming in seventh place,

1517
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,849
it was cruel that we couldn't show...

1518
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,249
what we had prepared.

1519
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,250
But...

1520
01:29:45,619 --> 01:29:47,089
I still can't accept it.

1521
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,519
- What? - That HYEONGJUN came in seventh.

1522
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,318
It's okay. Forget about that moment.

1523
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,389
No.

1524
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:53,429
(I will protect my friend.)

1525
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,929
Go back to meditating...

1526
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:57,158
learn how to accept things.

1527
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:58,358
Fine, you came in seventh.

1528
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:00,270
(Accepting right away)

1529
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:01,828
(Fine, you came in seventh.)

1530
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,369
- Inner peace. - Inner peace.

1531
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:07,239
(Where is his inner peace?)

1532
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:09,180
(Joking around)

1533
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:10,738
In both Team Ranking...

1534
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,380
and Ace Ranking, we got first place.

1535
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,049
Our goal was to get first place for both of them.

1536
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,879
- We did it. - We achieved it.

1537
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,919
Our four aces...

1538
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,049
did their very best,

1539
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,519
and so did the other members.

1540
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,589
I want to talk about our members...

1541
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,529
who weren't aces.

1542
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:29,959
ALLEN's...

1543
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,568
attitude on stage.

1544
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:34,999
ALLEN has taught me that...

1545
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,199
the short scenes in between can play a critical role.

1546
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,969
He catches the highlights well.

1547
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,339
ALLEN is indispensable.

1548
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,608
(Main dancer ALLEN showed the highlights...)

1549
01:30:45,609 --> 01:30:46,809
(as well as the aces did.)

1550
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:48,309
He was the best member who led...

1551
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:50,279
the performance so it wouldn't be boring.

1552
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,390
He had high expectations for himself.

1553
01:30:53,689 --> 01:30:56,358
Although he was already good, ALLEN never stopped practising.

1554
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:58,288
- You're right. - That makes him cool.

1555
01:30:58,289 --> 01:30:59,589
He practices nonstop.

1556
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:01,358
Even if I'm not the official ace,

1557
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:03,359
I should perform like one of the aces.

1558
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,068
I performed with such a mindset.

1559
01:31:07,069 --> 01:31:08,469
I feel rewarded...

1560
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,800
- because you brought it up. - Right.

1561
01:31:09,869 --> 01:31:11,669
TAEYOUNG was the Super Ace.

1562
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:13,909
Let's give ALLEN a nickname too.

1563
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,339
ALLEN was like a hidden ace,

1564
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:16,738
so how about the Hidden Ace?

1565
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:18,408
As a member who laid out the performance well,

1566
01:31:18,409 --> 01:31:20,710
- I'm the Base. - "Base."

1567
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,849
(ALLEN knows himself well.)

1568
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,719
- Right. Without a base, - Base.

1569
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,249
- the stage would feel empty. - The foundation.

1570
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,118
- Nice. - Base.

1571
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:29,420
(Base of CRAVITY, ALLEN)

1572
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,519
- I also want to mention a member. - Go ahead.

1573
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,688
JUNGMO.

1574
01:31:32,689 --> 01:31:34,829
MINHEE and I were the ace for the Fire Stage and Water Stage.

1575
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,229
(How are MINHEE, TAEYOUNG, and JUNGMO correlated?)

1576
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,568
When I was leaving early in the morning,

1577
01:31:40,569 --> 01:31:43,198
JUNGMO sent a long text message.

1578
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,368
(Impressed)

1579
01:31:45,369 --> 01:31:46,608
- What he sent was... - Read it to us.

1580
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:47,739
It's only two lines long.

1581
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:50,009
It's two lines and a half.

1582
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,739
But it was nice of him to send one.

1583
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,949
"TAEYOUNG. You must be tired early in the morning."

1584
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,648
"Good luck in the Fire Stage."

1585
01:31:55,649 --> 01:31:58,648
"You'll do well. I'll be rooting for you." He added a fire emoji.

1586
01:31:58,649 --> 01:32:00,519
Goodness, how heartwarming.

1587
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,689
It gave me the confidence I would do well that day.

1588
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,219
- JUNGMO is very sweet. - He's a sweet guy.

1589
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,589
He sent me one too.

1590
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:08,429
While preparing for the Evaluation Match,

1591
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:10,560
he sent, "HYEONGJUN. How's your injury?"

1592
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,130
"My heart broke when you got hurt." Something like that.

1593
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:16,839
It made me upset even though my injury was nothing to me.

1594
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,199
JUNGMO's ears are red.

1595
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:20,469
His ears are red.

1596
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:22,068
(JUNGMO is embarrassed.)

1597
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:23,380
This is embarrassing.

1598
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:25,779
How adorable.

1599
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,880
Now then, look at the forest.

1600
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:31,520
(Finding inner peace)

1601
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:35,890
(Next to the members who needed comfort and cheering)

1602
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:37,188
Great job.

1603
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:39,089
(JUNGMO quietly cheered the others.)

1604
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:41,430
You killed it. Good job.

1605
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:44,959
JUNGMO got rid of the members'...

1606
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,399
anxiousness and worries.

1607
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,538
So he's Erase.

1608
01:32:49,539 --> 01:32:51,299
(Erase of CRAVITY, JUNGMO)

1609
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,170
- Erase isn't bad. - I like it.

1610
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:54,509
As for SEONGMIN...

1611
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:57,079
We talk about unnecessary things a lot.

1612
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:58,479
He's the Ace of Arbitration.

1613
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:01,408
What's the antonym of the back?

1614
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:02,750
- The stomach? - The stomach?

1615
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:05,118
(The stomach? All of a sudden?)

1616
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:06,488
(We won't lose anything.)

1617
01:33:06,489 --> 01:33:07,749
(It was gains and losses.)

1618
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,358
(Laughing hard)

1619
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:11,089
(When the interview was getting longer due to a mistake)

1620
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:12,090
(Go-home mood, off)

1621
01:33:12,091 --> 01:33:14,329
(Go-home mood, on)

1622
01:33:14,529 --> 01:33:16,999
(A bug interrupts their clock-out time.)

1623
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,729
(Go-home mood, on)

1624
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,340
(He's in the go-home mood today as well.)

1625
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:25,669
Thanks to SEONGMIN acting as the arbitrator,

1626
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:27,640
we went home at least five hours early.

1627
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:29,608
He helped us get off on time...

1628
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:31,879
and also helped the production crew.

1629
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:32,949
SEONGMIN was a great help.

1630
01:33:33,579 --> 01:33:36,179
I will work hard so we can go home early today.

1631
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,380
He likes going home early and being at home.

1632
01:33:38,449 --> 01:33:39,719
- House. - House.

1633
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,289
- House. - House.

1634
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,788
I like it.

1635
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:44,059
(House of CRAVITY, SEONGMIN)

1636
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,459
We can't forget about...

1637
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:47,390
our main vocalist, WOOBIN.

1638
01:33:48,029 --> 01:33:50,760
As the main vocalist, WOOBIN sang well.

1639
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:54,170
But he also left golden sayings off stage.

1640
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:56,670
(Too many cooks spoil the broth.)

1641
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:59,039
(The one in the lead is the most insecure.)

1642
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,239
(A growing sprout should be crushed.)

1643
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,009
(Creator of golden sayings)

1644
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,238
But the golden sayings weren't ones everyone could relate to.

1645
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,978
- No. - He was in charge of the trailers.

1646
01:34:06,979 --> 01:34:07,979
Exactly.

1647
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:09,350
(We'll crush them all.)

1648
01:34:09,949 --> 01:34:11,318
(Scared?)

1649
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:12,749
The best golden saying was, "Scared?"

1650
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,419
- That was pretty good. - "Scared?"

1651
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,589
Mouth.

1652
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:17,689
(That makes WOOBIN the Mouth.)

1653
01:34:17,789 --> 01:34:20,329
(Mouth of CRAVITY, WOOBIN)

1654
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:22,959
- You're the ace of today. - The ace of the day, WONJIN.

1655
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,999
Today's joke reward goes to WONJIN.

1656
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,198
You can be the ace.

1657
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:28,069
Just become the ace, WONJIN.

1658
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,840
With this, all nine of us are aces.

1659
01:34:32,039 --> 01:34:33,238
Great work.

1660
01:34:33,239 --> 01:34:35,239
(Everyone has done well.)

1661
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:37,538
We have the most crucial final performance left.

1662
01:34:37,539 --> 01:34:38,578
Yes, the finals.

1663
01:34:38,579 --> 01:34:40,809
Our last ace, TAEYOUNG!

1664
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,049
Nice.

1665
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,350
(The last ace is TAEYOUNG for the finals.)

1666
01:34:43,449 --> 01:34:45,948
The title of our final song is "HISTORIA."

1667
01:34:45,949 --> 01:34:47,288
- Yes. - Yes.

1668
01:34:47,289 --> 01:34:49,759
It's a song containing...

1669
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,960
CRAVITY's history on Road to Kingdom.

1670
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:55,528
The lyrics have all the songs we have done...

1671
01:34:55,529 --> 01:34:56,929
- until now. - It does.

1672
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:59,169
It'll be a song that will...

1673
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:01,500
put an end to our journey.

1674
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,139
(Encompassing CRAVITY's journey...)

1675
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,868
(on Road to Kingdom, their strong ambition...)

1676
01:35:04,869 --> 01:35:06,840
(to finish with victory is expressed dramatically.)

1677
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:09,879
There are powerful parts in this song.

1678
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,509
But sentimental parts also exist.

1679
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,049
You know what we're good at.

1680
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:16,778
- Being lyrical? - I think it'd be nice...

1681
01:35:16,779 --> 01:35:19,989
if we prepared a sentimental stage.

1682
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:22,289
All that's left is the finals, the most important.

1683
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:24,759
To the question of what kind of nickname we want,

1684
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,589
along with the many we already have,

1685
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:29,728
my reply was...

1686
01:35:29,729 --> 01:35:32,398
wanting to simply make CRAVITY itself...

1687
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:34,970
- known to others. - Yes.

1688
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:36,938
Let's remind ourselves of that again...

1689
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:38,470
and work hard until the finals.

1690
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,609
All right.

1691
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:44,879
It's the last performance on Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace...

1692
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,908
as well as the start of CRAVITY's new journey.

1693
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,020
(For a brighter beginning)

1694
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,179
After the war ends,

1695
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,520
our history begins.

1696
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,889
We want to perform with no regrets.

1697
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,560
(Will they make a historical final stage?)

1698
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:02,028
Let's win the finals!

1699
01:36:02,029 --> 01:36:04,828
- Remember who we are! - Who we are!

1700
01:36:04,829 --> 01:36:05,930
Let's go!

1701
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:14,769
Go, CRAVITY!

1702
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,880
- Let's go! - "HISTORIA!"

1703
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:55,149
("HISTORIA" by CRAVITY)

1704
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,869
With CRAVITY's performance,

1705
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,340
the Final Round came to an end.

1706
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,880
The live broadcast voting will be closing soon,

1707
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:20,380
so if you haven't voted yet, please do so quickly.

1708
01:41:22,979 --> 01:41:26,249
Then let's take a moment to talk about CRAVITY's performance,

1709
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:28,050
which brought the Final Round to a close.

1710
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:34,829
KEON HEE of ONEUS, what did you think about their performance?

1711
01:41:37,659 --> 01:41:40,368
First of all, they came out...

1712
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:42,729
of so many doors, which was surprising.

1713
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:46,609
I've always liked their performances.

1714
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:49,170
I think they showed a legendary performance today,

1715
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,310
which became my new favourite.

1716
01:41:51,739 --> 01:41:55,049
The title of the song is "HISTORIA."

1717
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:58,750
And I think it showed their history on the show, which fits the title.

1718
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:01,019
So it touched my heart.

1719
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,420
Thank you for showing us a great performance.

1720
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:09,289
Great.

1721
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,029
Won Bin of The CrewOne,

1722
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,100
what did you think about their performance?

1723
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,299
It was a charming and touching performance...

1724
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,538
that showed their journey...

1725
01:42:22,539 --> 01:42:24,380
and their view of the world.

1726
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:27,210
It felt like I became a LUVITY while watching their performance.

1727
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:29,479
So what's the most important thing when it comes to a performance?

1728
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:31,978
- Energy! - Energy!

1729
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,250
That's right. Your performance was full of energy.

1730
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:35,590
You worked hard.

1731
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,430
(Energy)

1732
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,430
Yes. Just as their colleagues said,

1733
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,069
CRAVITY delivered a flawless performance...

1734
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:52,939
with a well-crafted narrative and an incredible amount of energy.

1735
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:59,109
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1736
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,920
The final winner will be decided in the Final Round.

1737
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:12,159
The performances of the five teams' new songs have come to an end.

1738
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:28,340
As a host and their senior who have been watching...

1739
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:30,710
their performances closely for eight weeks,

1740
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,379
I think all the teams here...

1741
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:35,979
deserve to become the ace team.

1742
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:41,189
However, only one team...

1743
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,750
can become the final winner.

1744
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:44,390
Oh, my gosh.

1745
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:47,959
In the Final Round, out of 100,000 points,

1746
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:50,228
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace, Final Voting)

1747
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:53,930
CRAVITY earned the chart score of 30,000 points became 1st place.

1748
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,699
The live broadcast voting, with 70,000 points at stake,

1749
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,539
is about to close.

1750
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:05,079
With the votes of the viewers...

1751
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:08,409
and global fans,

Vote for number five.

01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,189
Vote for number four.

1763
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:06,239
All right. The Final Round broadcast live.

1764
01:45:10,439 --> 01:45:12,010
The live broadcast text voting...

1765
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:14,909
and the Mnet Plus app voting will be closed now.

1766
01:45:15,079 --> 01:45:16,649
- Oh, no. - Oh, my.

1767
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,318
It's over!

1768
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:23,589
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

1769
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:25,289
Five, four,

1770
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:28,460
- three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

1771
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:30,658
(Voting closed)

1772
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:32,399
The voting is closed.

1773
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:35,028
Thank you.

1774
01:45:35,029 --> 01:45:37,470
(The live broadcast voting for the Final Round is closed.)

1775
01:45:41,569 --> 01:45:44,140
The live broadcast voting is closed.

1776
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:50,720
I'd like to thank all the viewers...

1777
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,289
and the global fans for voting.

1778
01:45:53,789 --> 01:45:56,090
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1779
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:04,930
While the final scores are compiled,

1780
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:09,199
the ace vocalists of the five teams on the show will gather...

1781
01:46:09,699 --> 01:46:11,969
to share a very special story.

1782
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:15,009
("CONTINUE" by the ace vocalists will be revealed.)

1783
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:16,880
Let's watch it right now.

1784
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,640
Let's go!

1785
01:46:20,649 --> 01:46:22,310
The weather is nice.

1786
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:25,318
(A sunny afternoon)

1787
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:27,189
(EUNHO is here without other members.)

1788
01:46:28,819 --> 01:46:29,960
When is the car coming?

1789
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:31,618
(Glancing)

1790
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:33,489
Will a convertible take me?

1791
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:36,630
(The Mnet car is here.)

1792
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:40,329
(Is the car going to leave with only him inside?)

1793
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,170
Hello.

1794
01:46:42,171 --> 01:46:44,470
(EUNHO of YOUNITE gets in the car.)

1795
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:47,868
(He still feels awkward to be on the show by himself.)

1796
01:46:47,869 --> 01:46:49,010
I'm nervous.

1797
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:50,609
(Let's get going for now.)

1798
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,710
I'm so nervous.

1799
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:53,179
(Why is EUNHO here alone today?)

1800
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:57,448
I monitored the previous seasons.

1801
01:46:57,449 --> 01:47:00,049
And they always had a special performance.

1802
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:03,119
If there were to be a special performance for this season,

1803
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:06,489
I wanted to represent my team and participate.

1804
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:10,300
And I got to do it, which makes me very happy.

1805
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:13,528
(From "Road to Kingdom...")

1806
01:47:13,529 --> 01:47:16,199
(to "Kingdom,")

1807
01:47:16,539 --> 01:47:19,340
(they all had a special vocal performance in the finals.)

1808
01:47:19,569 --> 01:47:22,710
The song is heartwarming and nice.

1809
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:26,209
I hope we can show a good performance.

1810
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,680
(The first day to meet other vocalists to create a great stage)

1811
01:47:28,449 --> 01:47:30,149
I think EUNHO will come.

1812
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:32,420
Am I the first one? Probably not.

1813
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,149
(Meanwhile, someone is waiting desperately.)

1814
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:38,859
I really hope someone who is the same age as me comes.

1815
01:47:40,189 --> 01:47:41,759
(MYUNG HO of 8TURN is waiting for EUNHO.)

1816
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,760
(Nervous)

1817
01:47:42,761 --> 01:47:44,028
I hope I'm the first.

1818
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:45,099
(Please...)

1819
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,930
It'll make me feel a little bit more comfortable.

1820
01:47:48,229 --> 01:47:49,670
It'll be awkward.

1821
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:52,039
(He failed to scan it.)

1822
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:53,739
Hello.

1823
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:55,469
(Bowing quickly)

1824
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:56,608
Hello.

1825
01:47:56,609 --> 01:47:57,938
- You can get in. - Gosh.

1826
01:47:57,939 --> 01:47:59,849
(MYUNG HO of 8TURN gets in the car.)

1827
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:00,850
Hi.

1828
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,380
(So awkward)

1829
01:48:03,819 --> 01:48:06,020
(They set off awkwardly.)

1830
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,019
- We have something in common. - What is it?

1831
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,189
You're MYUNG HO. I'm Myung EUNHO.

1832
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:11,519
- You are? - Yes.

1833
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,889
Is your last name Myung?

1834
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:15,390
People call me Myung Ho sometimes.

1835
01:48:16,529 --> 01:48:17,760
And we were both born in 2001.

1836
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:19,430
It's nice to meet you.

1837
01:48:20,029 --> 01:48:21,670
We've never talked before.

1838
01:48:22,869 --> 01:48:25,000
My gosh. I don't know.

1839
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:28,109
(There's another one who can't stay still.)

1840
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,810
I think we're here.

1841
01:48:31,609 --> 01:48:33,109
Someone is standing there and talking.

1842
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:37,020
- It will go well - It's Bain.

1843
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:38,680
(Opening)

1844
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:40,988
- Hello. - Hello.

1845
01:48:40,989 --> 01:48:41,989
Hello.

1846
01:48:43,789 --> 01:48:44,959
- Hello. - It's nice to see you.

1847
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:45,960
Hello.

1848
01:48:45,961 --> 01:48:47,728
(He gives up his seat for Bain.)

1849
01:48:47,729 --> 01:48:49,358
(More than half of the members have gathered for the special stage.)

1850
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:50,500
You're finally here.

1851
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,329
- What's your MBTI? - MBTI?

1852
01:48:54,199 --> 01:48:56,000
- MBTI is important. - I'm...

1853
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,469
Mine is ISTJ.

1854
01:48:57,470 --> 01:48:58,639
ISTJ?

1855
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,108
We're all STs.

1856
01:49:00,109 --> 01:49:02,269
- Are you an ST? - His is ISTP.

1857
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:04,908
Mine is ESTJ. And yours is ISTJ.

1858
01:49:04,909 --> 01:49:06,510
You're extroverted, though.

1859
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:09,250
- Yes. But I'm shy around strangers. - Me too.

1860
01:49:09,579 --> 01:49:12,720
We've been filming the show for about four months,

1861
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,519
but we've never talked before.

1862
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,118
- This is our first time. - Right.

1863
01:49:16,119 --> 01:49:18,488
I couldn't make any friends.

1864
01:49:18,489 --> 01:49:20,089
Me neither.

1865
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:21,159
Me neither.

1866
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:23,800
- It's the same for all of us. - This is the first time.

1867
01:49:24,199 --> 01:49:26,669
This is almost my first time to talk with the members of other teams.

1868
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:27,699
Right.

1869
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:29,469
(Will today's shoot go well?)

1870
01:49:29,470 --> 01:49:30,470
Yes.

1871
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,509
I feel shy around strangers.

1872
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:34,909
(There's another one who feels shy around strangers.)

1873
01:49:35,239 --> 01:49:37,339
I don't think I'll be able to talk because I feel shy.

1874
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:38,510
(The fourth member is shy but strong.)

1875
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:40,979
I wonder who will get in the car.

1876
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:42,609
(Spotting)

1877
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:44,648
- What? - It's WOOBIN.

1878
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:45,680
- I see. - Oh, my.

1879
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,549
(The fourth member is WOOBIN of CRAVITY.)

1880
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:49,149
(Stiff)

1881
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:52,419
- Hello. - Hello.

1882
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:54,358
Hello.

1883
01:49:54,359 --> 01:49:55,829
(Perplexed)

1884
01:49:56,729 --> 01:49:58,659
This is suffocating. Do I really have to get in?

1885
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:01,170
It's so suffocating that I can't get in.

1886
01:50:01,329 --> 01:50:02,369
No.

1887
01:50:02,699 --> 01:50:04,038
We're very friendly.

1888
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:05,969
- Is that so? Are you sure? - Yes. We were having fun.

1889
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:07,569
- It's good to see you. - It's good to see you too.

1890
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:09,769
The camera is right in front of me.

1891
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,408
(He even feels shy around a camera.)

1892
01:50:11,409 --> 01:50:12,939
I'm happy to see you.

1893
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:14,409
Hi.

1894
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,549
(Even though he feels shy, he does what he has to do.)

1895
01:50:17,550 --> 01:50:18,649
It's good to see you guys too.

1896
01:50:19,149 --> 01:50:22,448
I'm WOOBIN, the main vocalist of CRAVITY.

1897
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,589
What's your MBTI?

1898
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:24,590
(It's his fourth time to ask this, and it's not going to be the last.)

1899
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:25,590
- MBTI? - Yes.

1900
01:50:25,591 --> 01:50:27,189
TP? Is yours ISTP?

1901
01:50:28,689 --> 01:50:30,399
- That's correct. Mine is ISTP. - Oh, gosh.

1902
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:32,459
I know MYUNG HO's is ISTP.

1903
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:34,698
- How do you know? - ISTPs can recognize...

1904
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:37,470
- each other. - I see.

1905
01:50:37,869 --> 01:50:40,009
I knew when you broke the wine glass...

1906
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:41,809
- in the beginning. - Since then?

1907
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:44,408
MYUNG HO, you're my favourite 8TURN member.

1908
01:50:44,409 --> 01:50:46,079
(They feel connected as they share the same MBTI type.)

1909
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:48,408
(While they're talking, )

1910
01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:50,619
(SEO HO of ONEUS is waiting for the four.)

1911
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:53,180
(He's holding coffees for them in both hands.)

1912
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:55,019
It's him.

1913
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,219
- He got coffee for us. - He got coffee.

1914
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,559
(They found the coffee.)

1915
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,658
- Hello. - Hello.

1916
01:51:01,659 --> 01:51:02,728
Hello.

1917
01:51:02,729 --> 01:51:04,028
- Oh, my. Thank you. - Oh, my gosh.

1918
01:51:04,029 --> 01:51:05,759
(SEO HO of ONEUS gets in the car.)

1919
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:06,828
Thanks for the coffee.

1920
01:51:06,829 --> 01:51:09,469
All right. The final customer got in.

1921
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:11,869
It's SEO HO of ONEUS. Let's give it up for him!

1922
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,909
What's your MBTI?

1923
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:16,139
MBTI? Did you all share yours?

1924
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:17,509
- Yes. - Yes, we did.

1925
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:18,778
Mine is INTP.

1926
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:21,509
- You're the only N among us. - You're the first.

1927
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:22,749
- Seriously. - I'm the first N?

1928
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,050
We're all STs.

1929
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:27,889
(His exclamation tells a lot.)

1930
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,519
We're supposed to be vocalists with sentimental voices,

1931
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,259
but we're not sentimental.

1932
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,488
(They depart for the recording studio in a friendly atmosphere.)

1933
01:51:32,489 --> 01:51:34,358
Shall we see if our voices go well together?

1934
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:35,960
It sounds good. Let's go.

1935
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:38,198
- I'm so excited about the intro. - I know.

1936
01:51:38,199 --> 01:51:39,299
- I wonder how he will do it. - Let's go.

1937
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,699
He went to an English kindergarten.

1938
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:43,898
(Bain who went to an English kindergarten...)

1939
01:51:43,899 --> 01:51:46,099
(opens the new song "CONTINUE.")

1940
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,140
(Shy)

1941
01:51:48,439 --> 01:51:49,710
(He's good.)

1942
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,140
(It's followed by SEO HO's sweet voice.)

1943
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,800
(Story, continue)

1944
01:52:17,069 --> 01:52:18,538
(The genre of "CONTINUE" is a blend of a sentimental ballad...)

1945
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:19,938
(and cinematic medium tempo.)

1946
01:52:19,939 --> 01:52:21,340
(The song is about their journey of dreams that will continue.)

1947
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:23,938
The title is "CONTINUE."

1948
01:52:23,939 --> 01:52:27,509
The members came to my mind first...

1949
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:29,849
probably because we've been working hard during this tough journey.

1950
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:32,148
We wanted to prove ourselves. "We're this good."

1951
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:34,049
"We're a group capable of doing this much."

1952
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:37,318
We worked hard to show it on the show.

1953
01:52:37,319 --> 01:52:38,759
It's bound to be tough.

1954
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,889
But seeing the results...

1955
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:43,529
after going through it,

1956
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,229
I feel that we worked hard and did well.

1957
01:52:46,329 --> 01:52:49,470
This interview is the last one.

1958
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:51,568
It makes me sad.

1959
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:53,469
But when I perform...

1960
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:57,640
To wrap it up, I want to express my gratitude...

1961
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:00,679
to all the teams and the fans.

1962
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:03,649
"We all worked hard." That's what I'll think while singing the song.

1963
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,579
Lastly, the eldest member...

1964
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:08,519
- of Tears... - The eldest member.

1965
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,158
- Yes. - Let's have SEO HO...

1966
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,759
- Okay. - shout out the slogan...

1967
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,118
- and wrap it up. - Sounds good.

1968
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,988
The performance of "CONTINUE" by the five sentimental vocalists.

1969
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,429
Please look forward to it.

1970
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:19,528
And we were...

1971
01:53:19,529 --> 01:53:22,399
- Tears! - Tears!

1972
01:53:23,539 --> 01:53:24,539
We got this!

1973
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:27,810
(The special performance that tells their final story begins now.)

1974
01:53:30,279 --> 01:53:35,109
("CONTINUE" by MYUNG HO, Bain, SEO HO, WOOBIN, and EUNHO)

1975
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,319
(You guys are so beautiful. Is this the voice of divine beings?)

1976
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,899
(Myung)

1977
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:52,309
(Bain, MYUNG HO)

1978
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:54,109
(The voice of divine beings)

1979
01:56:58,279 --> 01:57:01,420
Everyone's so cool!

1980
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:04,920
(10 days until the finals)

1981
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:07,430
It's the first time greeting all the members.

1982
01:57:07,689 --> 01:57:09,689
Isn't this the first time we've gathered without having to compete?

1983
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:11,559
Can everyone lift their glasses up?

1984
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:13,829
- Okay. - Okay.

1985
01:57:14,029 --> 01:57:17,199
All right. Road to Kingdom Ace Awards.

1986
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,000
Here it is!

1987
01:57:19,869 --> 01:57:21,469
Party time!

1988
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:23,239
- Let's go! - Yes!

1989
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:24,939
What awards are we getting?

1990
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:27,108
I bet there are aces for good reactions.

1991
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:29,180
The Greeting Ace. I greeted everyone.

1992
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:31,719
If it's for smooth hair, wouldn't XION get it?

1993
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:34,049
- Is there a candidate for that? - There could be fun ones.

1994
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:35,948
I'm thinking of MC's Loving Ace.

1995
01:57:35,949 --> 01:57:36,988
It'll be ALLEN.

1996
01:57:36,989 --> 01:57:38,689
What are the awards? I'm curious.

1997
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,358
(What category will start the Ace Awards?)

1998
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:43,359
What?

1999
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:44,929
(Reaction Ace)

2000
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:47,269
- I told you, didn't I? - You were spot on.

2001
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,669
We might get it.

2002
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:50,839
- Get ready. - We could win it.

2003
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,038
- Do we have a candidate? - I think TAEYOUNG will get it.

2004
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:54,310
TAEYOUNG had great reactions.

2005
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:56,368
I kind of want that award.

2006
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:57,879
- What? - The reaction category.

2007
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,379
What did you do to win the Reaction Ace?

2008
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:00,778
I want it.

2009
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:02,549
I reacted a lot, okay?

2010
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:05,219
Just be happy with being the ace, not the Reaction Ace.

2011
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:06,979
I'm addicted to being the ace.

2012
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:09,390
This is making me nervous for no reason.

2013
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,789
- I want to be a candidate. - This truly is nothing.

2014
01:58:12,859 --> 01:58:14,689
(Reaction Ace Award)

2015
01:58:14,859 --> 01:58:17,260

2016

(The cheerleader boosting the leader, 1st candidate, Oh Junseok)

2017
01:58:20,229 --> 01:58:21,369
It's me.

2018
01:58:21,869 --> 01:58:23,999
Let's go, Oh Junseok!

2019
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,939
(Loud)

2020
01:58:26,069 --> 01:58:27,309
(Quiet)

2021
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:29,310
Help me out here.

2022
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:31,779
(Laughing)

2023
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,079
He's really cute.

2024
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,319
(An expert at summoning pigeons)

2025
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:39,520
(Reacting like a pigeon)

2026
01:58:39,819 --> 01:58:41,949
(He's Pigeon Junseok, not Oh Junseok.)

2027
01:58:42,119 --> 01:58:43,789
(That's hilarious.)

2028
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:45,259
(An addicting reaction)

2029
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,359
He's a pigeon.

2030

(During 8TURN's "Future Perfect" performance)

2031

2032
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:52,529
(Getting up)

2033
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:56,329
(Junseok copies them right away.)

2034
01:58:57,699 --> 01:59:00,069
(Thank you for the great reaction.)

2035
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:01,710
You're the best.

2036
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:02,869
(The display is opening.)

2037
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:05,609
Why is it opening again? Don't open it!

2038
01:59:05,779 --> 01:59:07,010
What is that?

2039
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:08,408
A car!

2040
01:59:08,409 --> 01:59:09,550
(Getting up)

2041
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:11,350
(Reaction Ace Award, 1st Candidate, The CrewOne's Oh Junseok)

2042
01:59:11,619 --> 01:59:13,019
(Infinite respect for him)

2043
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:14,448
Honk!

2044
01:59:14,449 --> 01:59:16,389
(His encore of honking...)

2045
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:18,619

(Honking)

2047

HWAN WOONG.

2048
01:59:22,189 --> 01:59:23,389
- He killed it. - Were you as good as him?

2049
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:25,898
- I can't be nominated. - He can't get nominated.

2050
01:59:25,899 --> 01:59:27,300
That's what you call a reaction.

2051
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:29,629
Isn't he the winner, not a candidate?

2052
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:31,569
Were there others who reacted more than him?

2053
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,600
(Yes, there is.)

2054
01:59:32,601 --> 01:59:33,640
(Ta-da!)

2055
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:36,510

(Open up, eyes, nose, and mouth.)

2058
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:44,779
He made that expression just now too.

2059

(A voluntary encore)

2065
01:59:58,359 --> 01:59:59,728
- I love it. - His reactions...

2066
01:59:59,729 --> 02:00:01,198
- I love it here. - are gold.

2067
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:02,770
(We're proud of you, TAEYOUNG.)

2068
02:00:02,869 --> 02:00:04,899

- Hey! - How funny.

2078
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,390
(Everyone is addicted to saying "Hey!")

2079
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:24,658
The candidates are outstanding.

2080
02:00:24,659 --> 02:00:26,359
I know, right? Goodness.

2081
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,630

2082
02:00:28,829 --> 02:00:29,889
(Speechless)

2083

- This background music! - This background music!

2084
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:33,728
(Their whole bodies reject the music.)

2085
02:00:33,729 --> 02:00:35,800
Turn the background music off!

2086

What's with the background music?

2090
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:46,538
It's that music again.

2091
02:00:46,539 --> 02:00:47,949
I hate that music already.

2092
02:00:47,979 --> 02:00:49,750
(The background music was bad for the heart.)

2093
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:52,279
How can they turn that background music on here?

2094
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:54,350
Stop playing the background music.

2095
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,250
I'm starting to get nervous.

2096
02:00:56,449 --> 02:00:57,460

(The Reaction Ace is TAEYOUNG.)

2103
02:01:08,369 --> 02:01:09,398
(Unexpected Charm Ace Award)

2104
02:01:09,399 --> 02:01:10,670
- "Unexpected." - "Unexpected Charm."

2105
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,500
It's a novel idea.

2106
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,969
DEY might be a candidate.

2107
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:15,068
- Me? - Yes.

2108
02:01:15,069 --> 02:01:16,069
You were a tennis ball.

2109
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:17,578
It could be EUNSANG.

2110
02:01:17,579 --> 02:01:19,180
Will we have two candidates?

2111
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:21,608
(Disappointed)

2112
02:01:21,609 --> 02:01:22,609
(1st candidate, ONEUS's LEE DO)

2113
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:24,220
(Laughing)

2114
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:26,050
(His contradicting voice, 1st candidate, LEE DO)

2115
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,889
(The benefit to fill the cue sheet depended on the Ace Battle.)

2116
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:29,389
(HWAN WOONG felt a lot of pressure.)

2117
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:31,659
(Staring)

2118
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:34,189
(Sweet LEE DO embraces him with his muscles.)

2119
02:01:34,289 --> 02:01:35,989
I was held really well.

2120
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:38,100
(LEE DO's unexpected charms are shown only to his members.)

2121
02:01:38,329 --> 02:01:39,528
- He's a loving older brother. - Yes.

2122
02:01:39,529 --> 02:01:40,898
LEE DO's really sweet.

2123
02:01:40,899 --> 02:01:41,969
How cool.

2124
02:01:41,970 --> 02:01:44,069
I don't like refreshing vibes.

2125
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:45,738
(During 8TURN's Evaluation Match)

2126
02:01:45,739 --> 02:01:47,069
(Glaring)

2127
02:01:47,239 --> 02:01:49,270
(Secretly upset)

2128
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:50,509
(He started to get interested in...)

2129
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:52,140
(8TURN's refreshing and youthful stage.)

2130
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:53,510
They were good.

2131
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:55,709
(During YOUNITE's cute and refreshing stage, )

2132
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:58,050
(LEE DO fell in love with it.)

2133
02:01:58,279 --> 02:02:00,350
(I don't like refreshing vibes.)

2134
02:02:00,579 --> 02:02:03,750
(Unexpected Charm Ace Award, 1st Candidate, ONEUS's LEE DO)

2135
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,919
(Highly satisfied)

2136
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,158
How cute.

2137
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:09,228
Become a fan of refreshing vibes.

2138
02:02:09,229 --> 02:02:11,759
- I don't know about that. - Become a fan of it.

2139
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,259
That was very unexpected.

2140
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:14,499
LEE DO is adorable.

2141
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,829
Who's the last candidate?

2142
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:18,300
(It's YOUNITE.)

2143
02:02:18,569 --> 02:02:20,938
(Appearing fiercely, 2nd candidate, EUNSANG)

2144
02:02:20,939 --> 02:02:22,739
(EUNSANG put on an impressive acting.)

2145
02:02:22,939 --> 02:02:24,938
(EUNSANG, who was like this...)

2146
02:02:24,939 --> 02:02:26,239
He turned out scarier.

2147
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:28,449
(A twist ending by TEMPEST's HANBIN)

2148
02:02:28,609 --> 02:02:30,649
(Everyone was shocked by it.)

2149
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:34,719
(How romantic.)

2150
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,550
(Clapping and cheering upon seeing his unique sensibility)

2151
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,789
(Embarrassed)

2152
02:02:38,819 --> 02:02:40,560
(Other people's business is more entertaining.)

2153
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,760
(Usually very delicate)

2154
02:02:41,761 --> 02:02:42,858
He's a different person.

2155
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:44,629
- That's beautiful. - He's delicate.

2156
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:46,859
(On stage)

2157
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:48,769
(Offstage)

2158
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:50,669
(On stage)

2159
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:53,000
EUNSANG indeed has an unexpected charm.

2160
02:02:53,239 --> 02:02:55,970
(Unexpected Charm Ace Award, 2nd Candidate, YOUNITE's EUNSANG)

2161
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:57,438
(Even his members are speechless.)

2162
02:02:57,439 --> 02:02:59,409
He was both an evil being and an angel.

2163
02:02:59,579 --> 02:03:02,279
Please reveal the Unexpected Charm Ace.

2164
02:03:02,979 --> 02:03:04,579
(Unexpected Charm Ace Award, YOUNITE's EUNSANG)

2165
02:03:04,819 --> 02:03:06,149
(Cheering)

2166
02:03:06,279 --> 02:03:07,849
(Unexpected Charm Ace, YOUNITE's EUNSANG)

2167
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:10,519
- We got won! - We won an award!

2168
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,359
(Acknowledging)

2169
02:03:12,489 --> 02:03:13,489
Isn't there a more interesting one?

2170
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:14,590
Do you need more stimulation?

2171
02:03:16,029 --> 02:03:17,960
(Provocation Ace Award)

2172
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:20,358
- Okay! - "Provocation."

2173
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:22,869
Provocation Ace.

2174
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,199
Is it Geonu?

2175
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,600
(Correct)

2176
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:26,938
He showed up right away.

2177
02:03:26,939 --> 02:03:28,109
(Overflowing with vigour, 1st candidate, Geonu)

2178
02:03:28,369 --> 02:03:30,839
(Encouraging the morale with his veins popping out)

2179
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:33,140
- He's cool. - His eyes are shining.

2180
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:35,380
(Fierce eyes)

2181
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:37,619
(What's with that high spirit?)

2182
02:03:38,149 --> 02:03:39,420
Provoking with his eyes.

2183
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,220
(Trembling)

2184
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,189
(However, )

2185
02:03:43,489 --> 02:03:47,158
(The CrewOne ranked 6th place in the Ace Ranking.)

2186
02:03:47,159 --> 02:03:48,858
Seunghwan, you're not in sixth place.

2187
02:03:48,859 --> 02:03:50,158
- You did a great job. - Good job.

2188
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:51,199
You were cool.

2189
02:03:51,229 --> 02:03:53,100
(I wanted to knock over everything.)

2190
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:55,199
(Geonu's honest feelings shock everyone.)

2191
02:03:55,329 --> 02:03:56,429
Hey!

2192
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:58,198
I hit the roof.

2193
02:03:58,199 --> 02:04:00,470
Regardless of how good the other groups were...

2194
02:04:00,569 --> 02:04:03,369
(The fact that Seunghwan ranked 6th made me furious.)

2195
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:04,679
(I kept thinking the world was unfair.)

2196
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,810
(Provocation Ace Award 1st Candidate, The CrewOne's Geonu)

2197
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:09,350
Watching that again moved my heart, Geonu.

2198
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:11,220
That was quite nerve-racking.

2199
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:12,448
How cool.

2200
02:04:12,449 --> 02:04:14,149
He's a true leader.

2201
02:04:14,649 --> 02:04:15,850
Who's next?

2202
02:04:16,050 --> 02:04:18,920
(The next candidate was hurt by the youngest, 8TURN.)

2203
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:20,760
It says, "The next candidate was hurt."

2204
02:04:20,789 --> 02:04:22,930
- It's HYEONGJUN. - It's HYEONGJUN.

2205
02:04:23,529 --> 02:04:24,959
(We won't lose!)

2206
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,198
(A loud voice, 2nd candidate, SEONGMIN)

2207
02:04:26,199 --> 02:04:27,329
It's you.

2208
02:04:28,699 --> 02:04:30,169
(Defying the odds, it's SEONGMIN.)

2209
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:31,539
It's SEONGMIN?

2210
02:04:31,699 --> 02:04:33,270
(Like we'll lose it!)

2211
02:04:33,399 --> 02:04:34,438
(Who's taking it?)

2212
02:04:34,439 --> 02:04:35,509
(Nobody will.)

2213
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,010
(Laughing)

2214
02:04:37,069 --> 02:04:38,380
(Embarrassed)

2215
02:04:39,779 --> 02:04:41,979
(There was a performance that made SEONGMIN furious.)

2216
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:44,519
(A big aircraft appeared.)

2217
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,349
- An aircraft. - That's overdoing it!

2218
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,590
Seriously?

2219
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:49,390
(Laughing)

2220
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:51,389
(2nd round of Round 3, "Sherlock" by The CrewOne)

2221
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:53,659
(What's with those wires?)

2222
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:54,988
(What is that?)

2223
02:04:54,989 --> 02:04:57,130
(What are they doing, seriously?)

2224
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:58,800
(Say something as the senior.)

2225
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:00,869
(The stage isn't yours alone.)

(Provocation Ace Award, 2nd Candidate, CRAVITY's SEONGMIN)

2227
02:05:03,869 --> 02:05:05,539
You were full of anger.

2228
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,938
(A cute face...)

2229
02:05:06,939 --> 02:05:08,739
(with an unexpected charm)

2230
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:10,009
He's a strong candidate.

2231
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:11,738
- Beating SEONGMIN won't be easy. - What a shocker.

2232
02:05:11,739 --> 02:05:13,238
(Time to reveal the result)

2233
02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:14,608
(Anxious Geonu versus regretting SEONGMIN)

2234
02:05:14,609 --> 02:05:15,949
It's a close game.

2235
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:17,309

2238
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:22,448
It's you.

2239
02:05:22,449 --> 02:05:24,520
(Giving a big hand)

2240
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:25,760
A cool provocation.

2241
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:28,060
You could feel his anger.

2242
02:05:28,189 --> 02:05:29,328
From now on,

2243
02:05:29,329 --> 02:05:32,028
I will live out my convictions more.

2244
02:05:32,029 --> 02:05:33,029
Thank you.

2245
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:35,029

2247
02:05:37,869 --> 02:05:40,499
- "Visual Ace." - "Visual Ace."

02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:41,969
(The Visual Ace makes the crowd go wild.)

2249
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,039
Is it me?

2250
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:44,340
What?

2251
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:46,140
Give it to me!

(YOUNITE's WOONO, CRAVITY's JUNGMO)

2254
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:50,210
This one's highly competitive.

2255
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:52,079
Was there a time I was pretty?

2256
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:53,520
You were always pretty.

2257
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:54,819
No.

2258
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,618
You're in the top three, KYUNG MIN.

2259
02:05:57,619 --> 02:05:59,189
Being a candidate makes me happy.

(Here's the proof.)

2264
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:08,699
He's really tall and has a small face.

2265
02:06:08,869 --> 02:06:10,470
He looks like a beautiful spotted deer.

2266
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:12,538
- KYUNG MIN is super tall. - Right?

2267
02:06:12,539 --> 02:06:14,640
- Being tall is foul play! - He's right.

2268
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:16,938
You shouldn't be tall if you're handsome.

2269
02:06:16,939 --> 02:06:18,579
Don't work out, okay?

2270
02:06:19,479 --> 02:06:21,648
(The senior banned KYUNG MIN from working out.)

2271
02:06:21,649 --> 02:06:23,380
He's right!

2272
02:06:23,479 --> 02:06:26,079
(I was joking.)

2273
02:06:26,619 --> 02:06:30,020
(The seniors praised his good looks.)

(Even during the Campus Attack)

2275
02:06:32,689 --> 02:06:34,688
- You're handsome. - Thank you.

- I saw it. - You met them.

2279
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,500
I remember it now.

2280
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,269
- What's your name? - I'm KYUNG MIN.

2281
02:06:44,270 --> 02:06:46,368
KYUNG MIN? From which team?

2282
02:06:46,369 --> 02:06:47,639
8TURN? You're so handsome.

2283
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:48,869
- You want to know? - No.

2284
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:52,439
(The video ends with him disciplining his fan.)

2285
02:06:52,539 --> 02:06:57,050
(Bursting into laughter at his true reaction)

2286
02:06:57,649 --> 02:06:59,050
(He loves it.)

2287
02:06:59,149 --> 02:07:00,349
(TOMOON smiled in front of me while talking to a member...)

2288
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:01,589
(from another team. It was a big smile.)

2289
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:02,850
She got caught.

2290
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:04,618
Well done, KEON HEE.

2291
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:06,090
You need to keep them disciplined.

2292
02:07:07,289 --> 02:07:09,430
I don't know how to make an acceptance speech for this.

2293
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,829
Just show off your good looks all you want.

2294
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,728
Right, show it off.

2295
02:07:13,729 --> 02:07:16,670
(Showing off his good looks instead of making a speech)

2296
02:07:18,369 --> 02:07:21,139
(They want to copy his pose for no reason.)

2297
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:23,239
- Good job. - That was fun.

2298
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:25,278
Great work for making it to the finals!

2299
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:27,779
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2300
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:51,699
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

2301
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,340
It's time to put an end...

2302
02:07:54,739 --> 02:07:57,439
to the long journey to find the K-pop Ace.

2303
02:07:59,739 --> 02:08:00,979
Before announcing the final results,

2304
02:08:01,609 --> 02:08:05,279
I'd like to ask the five teams how they feel.

2305
02:08:08,649 --> 02:08:11,020
The team that performed first.

2306
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:12,720
HYUNGSEOK of YOUNITE.

2307
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:16,159
You guys made it to the Final Round,

2308
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,029
giving an impactful performance each time.

2309
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:20,800
Are you satisfied with today's performance?

2310
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:25,239
Each time we perform,

2311
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,869
there are parts that I'm not satisfied with.

2312
02:08:29,239 --> 02:08:32,409
But I think we gave a satisfying performance today.

2313
02:08:32,909 --> 02:08:36,049
We showed five performances from the Evaluation Round...

2314
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:37,350
to the Final Round.

2315
02:08:37,819 --> 02:08:41,448
The eight members became one and performed.

2316
02:08:41,449 --> 02:08:45,060
I think we found our colour through this show.

2317
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:48,760
We'll show our colour through our future performances.

2318
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,630
So please look forward to it.

2319
02:08:53,229 --> 02:08:54,229
All right.

2320
02:08:57,130 --> 02:09:00,439
STEVE, could you share a word too?

2321
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,839
Thank you to the viewers overseas...

2322
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,810
- who are watching at home. - He likes to thank the viewers.

2323
02:09:09,779 --> 02:09:11,949
I can't believe it's over already.

2324
02:09:12,449 --> 02:09:14,550
He's suddenly speaking in Korean. Please continue.

2325
02:09:15,689 --> 02:09:17,449
It doesn't feel real.

2326
02:09:18,189 --> 02:09:20,319
I made great memories here.

2327
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,859
I'm disappointed that it's ending...

2328
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:27,630
because I had a great time with these amazing artists.

2329
02:09:31,699 --> 02:09:33,369
But I'm happy.

2330
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:37,169
- In the future... - Thank you, everyone.

2331
02:09:37,170 --> 02:09:38,209
- Thank you. - Thank you, everyone.

2332
02:09:38,210 --> 02:09:40,210
Please support YOUNITE.

2333
02:09:40,409 --> 02:09:41,479
Thank you.

2334
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:43,180
Yes.

2335
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:51,020
All right. I also...

2336
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:54,389
enjoyed YOUNITE's performances that showed...

2337
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:56,789
their endless potential. I was always impressed by them.

2338
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:03,069
Next up, Junseok of The CrewOne.

2339
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:07,139
I rooted for you sincerely because I could tell...

2340
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,569
your desperation in each performance.

2341
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:12,039
Tell us how you feel about making it to the finals.

2342
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:19,720
It wasn't an easy journey for us to make it to the finals.

2343
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:21,789
As it wasn't easy,

2344
02:10:22,119 --> 02:10:24,050
I want us to have a beautiful ending.

2345
02:10:25,159 --> 02:10:27,859
JOURNEY, our fans, thank you for supporting us.

2346
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,689
It was thanks to you that we could make it.

2347
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:33,099
We'll fill the final round's stage...

2348
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:36,100
with our colour!

2349
02:10:36,569 --> 02:10:38,199
All right, then. The CrewOne.

2350
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:40,640
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2351
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:50,180
Junmin, please share a word also.

2352
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:55,020
Through Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace,

2353
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:58,260
we got to meet a lot of seniors and juniors, and I'm glad we did.

2354
02:10:58,590 --> 02:11:01,019
JOURNEY, our fans who love us,

2355
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,630
we love you so much.

2356
02:11:02,829 --> 02:11:05,930
We'll work hard to become a group you'll be proud of.

2357
02:11:06,029 --> 02:11:09,199
Also, I'm really happy that I got to meet the members of The CrewOne.

2358
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:12,340
I'm really happy. I love you guys.

2359
02:11:24,779 --> 02:11:27,319
All right. I'll also keep my eye on their future endeavours...

2360
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:29,720
and root for them.

2361
02:11:31,989 --> 02:11:36,560
This is the only team that made it to the finals twice.

2362
02:11:38,359 --> 02:11:40,300
ONEUS, the team with the most experience.

2363
02:11:40,699 --> 02:11:43,300
I bet they have mixed feelings.

2364
02:11:44,939 --> 02:11:48,539
SEO HO of ONEUS, please tell us how you feel.

2365
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:53,978
This is our second Final Round.

2366
02:11:53,979 --> 02:11:56,909
I realized that ONEUS improved a lot...

2367
02:11:57,010 --> 02:11:58,880
through this experience.

2368
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:01,149
I'd like to thank the production crew...

2369
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:02,890
for giving us this chance.

2370
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:05,489
And the artists who competed with us...

2371
02:12:06,319 --> 02:12:09,130
and created amazing performances.

2372
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:11,529
Thank you so much.

2373
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:15,770
Also, TOMOON, our fans, we love you so much.

2374
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:20,869
Please look forward to our amazing performances...

2375
02:12:20,970 --> 02:12:22,770
and growth. Thank you.

2376
02:12:32,619 --> 02:12:34,890
All right. KEON HEE, how was it for you?

2377
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:41,020
First of all, I feel grateful for the chances we had.

2378
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:44,629
In the last season, we had a goal...

2379
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:47,299
to show a lot of performances...

2380
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:49,129
by making it to the finals.

2381
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:51,739
But in this season, our goal...

2382
02:12:51,939 --> 02:12:53,839
is to become the winner.

2383
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:57,238
As that's our goal, I could feel that our team...

2384
02:12:57,239 --> 02:13:00,039
has improved a lot. I'm grateful that we were given this chance.

2385
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:03,879
I want to thank the other artists who gave amazing performances...

2386
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:06,679
and had a healthy competition.

2387
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,948
There are so many people who worked hard...

2388
02:13:09,949 --> 02:13:12,219
to create our performances.

2389
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:15,658
I want to thank our staff who always work hard...

2390
02:13:15,659 --> 02:13:16,828
to create our performances.

2391
02:13:16,829 --> 02:13:19,029
RBW family, thank you so much.

2392
02:13:19,229 --> 02:13:21,829
Most importantly, TOMOON, who supported us,

2393
02:13:22,029 --> 02:13:24,569
we always felt confident thanks to your support.

2394
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:27,198
I want to thank you guys...

2395
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:29,109
for making us confident today as well.

2396
02:13:29,609 --> 02:13:31,639
Even after the show ends,

2397
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:32,810
please look forward...

2398
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:36,979
to our future journey and our growth.

2399
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:39,179
That was long, right? They told me to make it long.

2400
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:40,579
Thank you.

2401
02:13:47,890 --> 02:13:51,130
All right. ONEUS showed growth through the show.

2402
02:13:51,229 --> 02:13:53,029
I'll continue to watch them.

2403
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,130
Next up is the youngest team.

2404
02:13:58,170 --> 02:13:59,840
8TURN's leader, JAE YUN.

2405
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:04,169
I fell for your team every time I saw the energy...

2406
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:05,409
and skills that didn't seem like the youngest team's.

2407
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:08,979
Tell us how you feel about making it to the finals.

2408
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:17,250
First of all, when we first came on the show,

2409
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:20,819
we were really scared, and the future seemed bleak.

2410
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:23,560
Still, the eight of us stuck together,

2411
02:14:23,789 --> 02:14:26,159
and thanks to TURNING's endless support,

2412
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:29,699
we could bravely finish each round's performance.

2413
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:32,840
That's why we could make it to the finals.

2414
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:37,109
No matter what the results are,

2415
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:40,840
our young energy and vigour...

2416
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:42,449
has just begun.

2417
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:46,020
So please support...

2418
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:48,119
the long journey we'll have.

2419
02:14:48,590 --> 02:14:49,590
Thank you.

2420
02:14:54,289 --> 02:14:57,489
MIN HO, please share a word too.

2421
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:02,500
I learned a lot by watching our seniors' performances.

2422
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:05,539
We are still young,

2423
02:15:06,039 --> 02:15:08,770
but we could make happy memories...

2424
02:15:09,170 --> 02:15:11,010
by being on a survival show with the seniors.

2425
02:15:11,369 --> 02:15:14,479
Based on this experience, we'll show great performances.

2426
02:15:14,949 --> 02:15:17,479
Please continue to support us. Thank you.

2427
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:19,779
Great work.

2428
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:27,390
That was 8TURN, who is always confident and energetic.

2429
02:15:30,529 --> 02:15:32,760
Next, HYEONGJUN of CRAVITY.

2430
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:37,029
I still remember seeing you cry during the Evaluation Round.

2431
02:15:38,770 --> 02:15:40,269
Tell us how you feel...

2432
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:42,770
saying goodbye to Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

2433
02:15:45,539 --> 02:15:48,179
I can't forget the tears I shed...

2434
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:52,420
during the Evaluation Round.

2435
02:15:52,819 --> 02:15:55,188
We went through twists and turns...

2436
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:57,789
after placing seventh in the Evaluation Round.

2437
02:15:57,890 --> 02:16:01,059
Through that experience,

2438
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:03,260
our bond became stronger.

2439
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:07,460
We got to have dogged spirit thanks to that.

2440
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:12,039
By competing with the six teams,

2441
02:16:12,739 --> 02:16:15,608
we got more motivated.

2442
02:16:15,609 --> 02:16:17,809
As a team and an individual,

2443
02:16:17,810 --> 02:16:22,010
this experience helped us grow.

2444
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:24,278
I don't think I'll be able...

2445
02:16:24,279 --> 02:16:26,850
to forget the precious memories I made on the show.

2446
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:31,760
Now, only the results of the finals remain.

2447
02:16:32,489 --> 02:16:35,727
We had good results...

2448
02:16:35,728 --> 02:16:38,398
in all three rounds.

2449
02:16:39,228 --> 02:16:40,529
With this energy,

2450
02:16:40,530 --> 02:16:44,728
we'll become the true ace of the finals.

2451
02:16:45,770 --> 02:16:47,699
Let's go! Thank you.

2452
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:48,770
Great job!

2453
02:16:51,909 --> 02:16:55,510
ALLEN of CRAVITY. Please tell us how you feel as well.

2454
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:57,909
All right. First of all,

2455
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:02,318
I always got nervous when you called my name.

2456
02:17:03,818 --> 02:17:05,689
Thank you.

2457
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:09,189
Through this show,

2458
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:12,430
we got to meet a lot of great senior artists...

2459
02:17:12,728 --> 02:17:16,270
and great colleagues.

2460
02:17:16,430 --> 02:17:19,940
And TAEMIN, whom I really adore.

2461
02:17:20,068 --> 02:17:23,370
It was a huge honour, and I was really happy to be here.

2462
02:17:24,308 --> 02:17:28,750
I think all 53 artists who participated on the show...

2463
02:17:29,478 --> 02:17:33,520
are all aces tonight.

2464
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:38,590
Pat yourselves for doing a good job.

2465
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:45,859
And a quick shout out to all the K-pop fans...

2466
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:48,670
all around the world. That includes you guys, LUVITY.

2467
02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:52,269
Without you guys' love and support throughout this whole show,

2468
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:54,237
we wouldn't be the aces that we are today.

2469
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:55,568
So, thank you so much.

2470
02:17:55,870 --> 02:17:57,370
- Yes! - Yes!

2471
02:17:58,308 --> 02:17:59,808
That was sweet.

2472
02:18:00,978 --> 02:18:03,379
- That was so sweet. - That was great.

2473
02:18:06,318 --> 02:18:09,148
We heard how the five teams felt...

2474
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:12,218
with ALLEN as the last one.

2475
02:18:16,388 --> 02:18:18,628
I was really inspired...

2476
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:20,827
by your performances as well.

2477
02:18:20,829 --> 02:18:23,600
I also thought you guys were amazing.

2478
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:27,239
I may be your senior who debuted before you,

2479
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:32,339
but I found you reliable and was proud of you...

2480
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:34,577
as you're the artists who will lead the K-pop scene.

2481
02:18:34,579 --> 02:18:35,680
Thank you so much.

2482
02:18:37,049 --> 02:18:38,648
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2483
02:18:55,629 --> 02:18:57,870
The future of the five teams here...

2484
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:02,010
and THE NEW SIX and TEMPEST...

2485
02:19:02,510 --> 02:19:06,879
who joined Road to Kingdom, I'll always root for you.

2486
02:19:18,989 --> 02:19:23,388
Now, only the result announcement remains.

2487
02:19:28,129 --> 02:19:31,000
It's time to announce the final winner...

2488
02:19:32,568 --> 02:19:35,110
who will become K-pop's Ace of Ace.

2489
02:19:38,379 --> 02:19:39,638
The final winner...

2490
02:19:40,739 --> 02:19:42,110
will receive 100,000 dollars...

2491
02:19:42,648 --> 02:19:45,718
and join KCON as a special guest.

2492
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:52,318
The end of becoming the ace of Road to Kingdom.

2493
02:19:52,319 --> 02:19:54,119
(Which team will take the honour of becoming the Ace of Ace?)

2494
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:57,930

2497
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:18,780
ONEUS.

2498
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,020
8TURN.

2499
02:20:29,459 --> 02:20:30,489
CRAVITY.

2500
02:20:35,129 --> 02:20:36,469
Among the five teams,

2501
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:41,340
I'll announce the two teams, the final candidates.

2502

2506
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:40,000
(The final winner candidate, CRAVITY)

2507
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:45,170
CRAVITY, please come forward.

2508
02:21:49,069 --> 02:21:50,069
Congratulations.

2509
02:22:23,809 --> 02:22:27,010
I'll announce the second candidate.

2510
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:55,909
The second candidate is...

2511
02:23:03,809 --> 02:23:04,850
ONEUS.

2512
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:10,920
(The final winner candidate, ONEUS)

2513
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:17,260
ONEUS, please come forward.

2514
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:48,629
CRAVITY and ONEUS...

2515
02:23:50,290 --> 02:23:55,129
became the final candidates of Road to Kingdom.

2516
02:23:57,870 --> 02:24:00,770
Let's hear from them first.

2517
02:24:07,739 --> 02:24:09,180
Let's start with CRAVITY.

2518
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:12,879
Yes.

2519
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:18,189
For about 4 to 5 months,

2520
02:24:18,190 --> 02:24:21,359
we became one as a team...

2521
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:25,559
worked hard, thinking this would be...

2522
02:24:26,059 --> 02:24:28,769
our only chance.

2523
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:31,229
I think that's why we could...

2524
02:24:31,729 --> 02:24:34,770
become the final winner candidate.

2525
02:24:35,469 --> 02:24:37,839
I want to bring the team to victory...

2526
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:40,610
for our beloved LUVITY.

2527
02:24:42,309 --> 02:24:43,909
We'll win.

2528
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:53,459
Next, ONEUS. Tell us how you feel.

2529
02:24:55,790 --> 02:24:57,860
Yes. First of all,

2530
02:24:59,959 --> 02:25:02,068
unlike the last season...

2531
02:25:02,069 --> 02:25:05,169
where we made it to the finals,

2532
02:25:05,170 --> 02:25:08,968
this time, we have a goal of becoming the winner.

2533
02:25:08,969 --> 02:25:10,968
I'm grateful that we grew so much...

2534
02:25:10,969 --> 02:25:14,179
to be where we are now.

2535
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:16,809
I want to tell the members that we did a good job.

2536
02:25:17,479 --> 02:25:21,780
It wasn't an easy challenge,

2537
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:26,089
but our fans, TOMOON, continued to support us.

2538
02:25:26,090 --> 02:25:28,359
I'd like to thank them.

2539
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:31,489
We'll continue to show you amazing performances.

2540
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:33,399
Please look forward to it. Thank you.

2541
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:43,340
Now then, which team...

2542
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:46,809
is the final winner among the two?

2543
02:25:50,309 --> 02:25:53,819
I will announce the final results.

2549
02:26:30,389 --> 02:26:32,719
will be announced in a bit.

2550
02:26:38,329 --> 02:26:40,399
Come on. What's this?

2551
02:26:42,799 --> 02:26:44,069
We're out of time.

2552
02:26:45,569 --> 02:26:46,870
How can you do this to us?

2553
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:09,260

will become...

2557
02:27:22,969 --> 02:27:25,209
the K-pop Ace now.

2558

The sum of the scores from previous matches,

2559
02:27:35,790 --> 02:27:37,388
the number of video views,

2560
02:27:37,389 --> 02:27:39,119
(The final winner is decided by the sum of all scores.)

2561

the new song chart score,

2562
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:44,159
and the live broadcast voting score...

2563
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:46,760
will decide the final winner.

2564
02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:53,770
The winner candidates...

2565
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:00,180

And the most important, to our LUVITY!

2632
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:45,090
Don't cry!

2633
02:32:45,959 --> 02:32:47,229
I really...

2634
02:32:49,729 --> 02:32:53,399
Right. I want to express my gratitude and love to you.

2635
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:57,270
I'm thankful we had this great opportunity...

2636
02:32:57,909 --> 02:33:01,540
to prepare and perform many cool performances.

2637
02:33:03,979 --> 02:33:06,680
It's an invaluable result.

2638
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:14,489
I'm sorry.

2639
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:22,229
Through this journey with the incredible seven artist groups...

2640
02:33:22,459 --> 02:33:24,370
and LUVITY,

2641
02:33:24,530 --> 02:33:27,068
I learned lessons...

2642
02:33:27,069 --> 02:33:30,309
and gained experiences much more valuable than winning.

2643
02:33:35,979 --> 02:33:38,510
In the beginning,

2644
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:41,620
we heard many remarks.

2645
02:33:45,049 --> 02:33:47,590
Saying it myself is embarrassing.

2646
02:33:48,059 --> 02:33:51,759
"CRAVITY has to win."

2647
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:54,798
"Either way, CRAVITY will win."

2648
02:33:54,799 --> 02:33:56,629
We were often told those.

2649
02:33:56,670 --> 02:34:00,100
Honestly, it was a lot of pressure.

2650
02:34:17,219 --> 02:34:18,219
It's okay!

2651
02:34:23,690 --> 02:34:24,729
Okay.

2652
02:34:26,430 --> 02:34:28,600
As we...

2653
02:34:29,899 --> 02:34:33,170
truly love CRAVITY and LUVITY,

2654
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:38,010
we wanted to prove it.

2655
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:42,279
It was also time to prove it.

2656
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:44,209
We did our best.

2657
02:34:51,450 --> 02:34:55,620
We gave it our all to maintain CRAVITY...

2658
02:34:55,719 --> 02:34:56,729
for a long time.

2659
02:35:00,629 --> 02:35:03,869
Though we started off like that,

2660
02:35:03,870 --> 02:35:06,440
I'm very happy right now.

2661
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:08,969
I dare say that...

2662
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:13,208
CRAVITY and LUVITY...

2663
02:35:13,209 --> 02:35:16,078
will last for a very long time...

2664
02:35:16,079 --> 02:35:17,978
and to look forward to us.

2665
02:35:17,979 --> 02:35:20,250
And I earnestly request that...

2666
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:23,319
you look forward to and show love...

2667
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:25,090
to all the outstanding...

2668
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:30,760
seven groups' upcoming journeys and works.

2669
02:35:34,329 --> 02:35:36,930
Lastly, thank you very much to LUVITY. We love you!

2670
02:35:42,069 --> 02:35:44,969
Can we also hear from ONEUS...

2671
02:35:45,069 --> 02:35:47,479
who, unfortunately, got second place?

2672
02:35:49,079 --> 02:35:53,179
Right. Even second place...

2673
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:56,090
is a priceless and grateful result for us.

2674
02:35:56,319 --> 02:35:59,558
All the artists must have felt the same.

2675
02:35:59,559 --> 02:36:02,790
We really hoped to win first place.

2676
02:36:02,889 --> 02:36:06,559
But the main purpose of this show was to put on amusing performances.

2677
02:36:07,659 --> 02:36:09,399
We're grateful...

2678
02:36:09,799 --> 02:36:13,569
we executed great performances and received much love.

2679
02:36:14,139 --> 02:36:17,209
I wanted to express my appreciation...

2680
02:36:17,309 --> 02:36:20,578
and how invaluable the experience was...

2681
02:36:20,579 --> 02:36:22,708
that those who watched our performances...

2682
02:36:22,709 --> 02:36:25,408
realized how much effort we had put in.

2683
02:36:25,409 --> 02:36:27,479
To all the artists here,

2684
02:36:27,579 --> 02:36:29,988
including TEMPEST and THE NEW SIX.

2685
02:36:29,989 --> 02:36:33,789
It would not have been strange...

2686
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:37,190
for any of the teams to win.

2687
02:36:37,489 --> 02:36:40,099
Thank you to the artists for putting on great performances.

2688
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:41,628
Congratulations to CRAVITY.

2689
02:36:41,629 --> 02:36:44,430
And to those who love ONEUS,

2690
02:36:44,770 --> 02:36:46,069
thank you very much.

2691
02:36:50,010 --> 02:36:52,109
Lastly, watching our fellow artists' performances...

2692
02:36:52,110 --> 02:36:54,078
through this show...

2693
02:36:54,079 --> 02:36:56,378
has motivated us.

2694
02:36:56,379 --> 02:36:58,610
We will continue to learn...

2695
02:36:58,909 --> 02:37:01,680
and make great use of this experience...

2696
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:04,489
to show our growth.

2697
02:37:05,719 --> 02:37:09,318
Like the role model of all idols, TAEMIN,

2698
02:37:09,319 --> 02:37:12,958
we will do our best to become a great, long-lasting artist.

2699
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:16,629
We've challenged ourselves with this tough competition.

2700
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:17,969
So, I hope...

2701
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,170
the examinees do their best.

2702
02:37:21,299 --> 02:37:23,568
Let's keep it up together.

2703
02:37:23,569 --> 02:37:26,510
Last but not least, TOMOON. We love you loads.

2704
02:37:26,780 --> 02:37:29,809
Please be with us for a long time.

2705
02:37:30,149 --> 02:37:33,218
Thank you very much. And to the production crew...

2706
02:37:33,219 --> 02:37:35,579
and all the staff, thank you.

2707
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:37,149
Thank you.

2708
02:37:48,159 --> 02:37:52,500
The long journey of Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace...

2709
02:37:55,239 --> 02:37:58,209
has ended with CRAVITY's final victory.

2710
02:38:03,079 --> 02:38:06,680
To the viewers, it was short eight weeks.

2711
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:11,049
But the five teams here practised and thought for a long time,

2712
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:14,190
waiting for the moment to perform.

2713
02:38:15,389 --> 02:38:17,259
I hope the Road to Kingdom performances,

2714
02:38:17,260 --> 02:38:19,129
capturing the passion and effort of these teams,

2715
02:38:19,659 --> 02:38:22,260
will be remembered forever.

2716
02:38:26,969 --> 02:38:30,770
The teams will set off on a more wonderful journey from now on.

2717
02:38:32,239 --> 02:38:35,280
Please look forward to the top five concert,

2718
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:38,780
where you can watch Road to Kingdom's performances...

2719
02:38:38,979 --> 02:38:40,349
in person.

2720
02:38:40,350 --> 02:38:41,519
(You can watch the top 5 teams' performances in person...)

2721
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:42,579
(on January 4 and January 5, 2025.)

2722
02:38:42,819 --> 02:38:45,649
It is now time to say goodbye.

2723
02:38:48,819 --> 02:38:51,489
Shall we say it for the last time?

2724
02:38:54,930 --> 02:38:56,059
Road to Kingdom...

2725
02:38:56,530 --> 02:38:59,399
- Ace of Ace! - Ace of Ace!

2726
02:39:00,569 --> 02:39:01,869
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2727
02:39:01,870 --> 02:39:03,940
(Thank you for watching Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.)
