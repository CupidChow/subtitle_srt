You did well.

- CRAVITY is here! - Look confident, guys.

86
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,568
We got first place.

87
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,740
(CRAVITY happily comes to the studio after getting 1st in Round 1.)

88

I think we're looking pretty good.

89

Even the bird here is welcoming us.

90
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,280
- I thought it was a real bird. - Me too.

91
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,713
Stay there.

92
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,152
It feels like home.

We're back again.

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,229
This is an important competition. I feel so nervous.

100
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,999
We have to do well today.

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,069
We can't back down any farther.

102
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,509
I've grown attached to this place.

103
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,339
Really? I'm a bit traumatized.

104
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Oh, my.

105
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,449
I couldn't sleep one bit after getting 7th place,

106
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,249
You guys.

107
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,120
(You guys!)

108
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,619
It's been a while.

109
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,120
It feels like home now.

110
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,824
What?

111
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,989
It's the cue sheet.

112
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,119
- What? - What is it?

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,860
It's empty.

114
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,730
(They can only see their order on the cue sheet.)

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,299
- What is it? - What is it?

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,429
- What is it? - Is something there?

117
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,229
- It's there! - What?

118
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,370
As soon as we walk in, we see the cue sheet.

119
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,040
- In front of us. - What?

120
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,609
(TEMPEST notices the cue sheet too.)

121
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,939
Each cue sheet must only show their own team.

122
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,180
Should we walk around and look?

123
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,410
This is the order...

124
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,550
- ONEUS decided on, right? - Yes.

125
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,208
That was their benefit from last round.

126
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,220
- Right. - Right.

127
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,448
- Everyone's must be like this. - Everyone's must be like this.

128
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,319
Nobody knows who's before and after them.

129
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,148
(ONEUS's HWAN WOONG won Round 1's Ace Battle.)

130
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,059
(As a benefit, they got the right to set...)

131
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,790
(Round 2's cue sheet.)

132
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,528
(We're getting to set all of the cue sheets.)

133
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,560
(Smoothly taking all of the right to set the cue sheets)

134
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,629
ONEUS'...

135
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,999
cue sheet setting time is back.

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,028
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

137
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,540
This is an official segment now.

138
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,369
ONEUS is in charge of this now.

139
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,109
Since this is Round Two,

140
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,110
I think we'll be able to decide on an even better order.

141
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,980
Should we pick our spot first?

142
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,449
I definitely want to go last.

143
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,349
(Agreeing)

144
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,919
THE BOYZ always chose...

145
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,119
to go seventh too.

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,250
(THE BOYZ always chose to have the ending in Road of Kingdom.)

147
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,449
Who was first place this time?

148
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,659
CRAVITY.

149
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,889
They went last.

150
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,829
(CRAVITY was Round 1's finale.)

151
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,659
(After performing last,)

152
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,060
(they won the triple match.)

153
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,828
(Round 1 Team Ranking, 1st, CRAVITY)

154
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,699
(They finished Round 1 with 1st place in the Team Ranking.)

155
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,398
If they're well-prepared,

156
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,169
I don't think anyone can beat whoever goes last.

157
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,638
Lucky seven. Yes.

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,869
(They strategically decide to go last for Round 2.)

159
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,579
Should we decide from the first performance?

160
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,109
When we make our concert set lists,

161
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,878
we place a lot of importance on the first song.

162
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,350
Because it starts everything off.

163
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,019
I want 8TURN to go first.

164
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,420
(Oh, my.)

165
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,389
I really look forward to their performance,

166
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,888
and even if their ranking changes by a lot,

167
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,360
I don't think they'll be a threat to our team.

168
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,160
If I were 8TURN, I would be resentful.

169
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,459
They need to accept it.

170
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,029
This is a competition.

171
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,600
(Round 2's opening goes to 8TURN.)

172
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,768
(8TURN sees their decision in their waiting room.)

173
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,009
- Why are we first? - Oh, we're first.

174
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,309
Because we're right at the top...

175
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,439
(8TURN is at a loss for words after seeing they'll go first.)

176
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,878
(Next, they'll decide when TEMPEST will perform.)

177
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,378
I think, strategically,

178
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,180
TEMPEST should go sixth.

179
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,850
For us to stand out...

180
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,550
(During the Evaluation Match)

181
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,188
(To make sure our performance stands out as much as possible!)

182
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,458
(ONEUS put TEMPEST right before them...)

183
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,300
(when making the Evaluation Match cue sheet too.)

184
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,398
(They're saying we're the weakest!)

185
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,040
If you give a bright and shining performance before us,

186
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,339
I think we'll look a bit cooler.

187
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,069
As long as we stand out.

188
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,279
(ONEUS places TEMPEST in the 6th spot.)

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,709
I think ONEUS is going seventh.

190
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,479
- Sixth? - Oh, my.

191
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
(They sense it's the same situation as the Evaluation Match.)

192
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,550
They placed us sixth...

193
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,490
to dominate the room with a strong performance after.

194
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,259
I think that's their strategy.

195
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,589
(How will the cue sheet order affect the rankings this time?)

196
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,028
Who should we put 2nd and 3rd?

197
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,128
(The middle spots in the cue sheet are left.)

198
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,499
I think it'll be hard...

199
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,300
to get a good score if you're in the middle.

200
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,639
Those teams placed higher than us in the Team Ranking.

201
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,439
Realistically,
I think it's best to put them in the middle.

202
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,539
So are we putting the strong teams back to back?

203
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,410
(They decide to place high ranking teams back to back.)

204
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,119
(How does ONEUS' Round 2 cue sheet look?)

205
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,119
This is so frustrating.
We need to get first place...

206
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,818
so we get the right to make the cue sheet.

207
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,620
Right. They're really trying to weaken us...

208
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,019
So much.

209
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,559
It's really iffy.

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,990
- It's iffy. - It's iffy.

211
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,560
We're right in the middle,
so it'll be hard to remember us.

212
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,429
We made them worried.

213
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,769
Yes!

214
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,899
They should be worried. We got first place.

215
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,068
It's about what theme we have...

216
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,669
and what kind of performance we show the audience.

217
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,809
In the end,
you need to do well to get first place.

218
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,909
Okay. Let's go.

219
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,109
(Trying to be okay with the order and motivating themselves)

220
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,110
I think we'll try even harder because we're going first.

221
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,579
- Let's go! - Let's go!

222
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,620
(All teams are ready for Round 2.)

223
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,490
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

224
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,019
I'm MC TAEMIN.

225
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,659
(The on-site judges' screams signal the start of Round 2.)

226
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,990
- It's starting. - Here we go.

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,799
(Oh, my.)

228
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,860
I'm nervous.

229
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,069
Long time no see.

230
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,029
Road to Kingdom, Round Two.

231
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,800
This is the day that 1 of the 7 teams...

232
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,170
will be eliminated of the competition.

233
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,810
The teams with the lowest Ace Ranking and Team Ranking...

234
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,879
calculated by totaling...

235
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,449
the scores from Round 1 and Round 2 will be up for elimination.

236
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:31,879
Oh, my gosh.

237
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,419
The first team to be eliminated.

238
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,990
I'm nervous.

239
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,059
I think the mic will pick up the sound of my heartbeat.

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,829
- Don't eliminate us. - Seriously, don't.

241
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,529
- Don't eliminate us. - Don't eliminate anyone.

242
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,129
Are you curious...

243
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,399
what Round Two's mission will be?

244
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,699
- Yes! - Yes!

245
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,070
Round Two's mission is Identity.

246
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,939
(Round 2, Identity)

247
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,169
Seven teams will compete with their own songs.

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,679
In Round Two, each team...

249
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,009
will have not 1, but 2 aces.

250
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,378
(Two?)

251
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,419
Really?

252
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,519
- Two aces. - Two aces.

253
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,619
We already saw one ace from each team.

254
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,649
- Right. - Right.

255
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,158
(ONEUS, HWAN WOONG)

256
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,830
(Each team revealed 1 ace.)

257
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,059
(The CrewOne, Oh Junseok, 8TURN, MYUNG HO)

258
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,929
(The CrewOne's ace, Oh Junseok, 8TURN's ace, MYUNG HO)

259
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,798
(THE NEW SIX's ace, JUNHYEOK)

260
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,528
(YOUNITE's ace, EUNSANG)

261
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,669
(ONEUS's ace, HWAN WOONG)

262
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,808
(First time as an ace, CRAVITY's TAEYOUNG)

263
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,840
(First time as an ace, TEMPEST's HYUK)

264
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,038
(Round 2's ace lineup, HWAN WOONG, Oh Junseok)

265
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,679
(MYUNG HO, EUNSANG, TAEYOUNG, JUNHYEOK, HYUK)

266
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,008
I wonder who the other teams chose as their second ace.

267
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,049
I'm so curious.

268
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,679
The scores will be calculated in the same way as Round One.

269
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,619
The Self-Evaluation score will make up 30 percent,

270
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,119
and the on-site judges' score...

271
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,919
will make up 70 percent of the total score.

272
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,129
The Identity Mission,
through which the first team...

273
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,600
to be eliminated from Road to Kingdom,

274
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,269
will begin now.

275
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,839
(Round 2, Identity)

276
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,138
Because this is the Identity Mission,

277
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,039
we'll make sure to get first place.

278
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,479
We have the same mindset we had when we started.

279
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,609
Always first place.

280
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,049
It's first place or death.

281
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,820
We can only go up from here.

282
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,179
No matter what.

283
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,918
As if elimination means death.

284
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,049
We'll show everyone that 8TURN doesn't die.

285
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,388
We need to win first place!

286
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,919
- Let's go! - Let's go!

287
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,859
- Let's have fun together. - We'll have fun together,

288
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,460
but we'll be the ones smiling at the end.

289
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,429
(Let's go.)

290
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,899
- Let's go. - Let's go.

291
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:32,969
Road to Kingdom.

292
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,808
Round 2, Identity Mission.

293
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:35,870
ONEUS...

294
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,109
(ONEUS is starting?)

295
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,909
ONEUS chose this team to go first because...

296
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,109
(The members and on-site judges were all fooled.)

297
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,279
The fans were fooled too.

298
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,519
I was so surprised.

299
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:47,994
They must've thought it was us.

300
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:48,860
Because...

301
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:52,559
Because they can give Round Two a strong start.

302
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,919
- A strong start? - A strong start?

303
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,758
- Isn't that us? - Why didn't they let us go first?

304
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,789
Isn't that us?

305
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,798
I think it'll be 8TURN.

306
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,168
They put Round 1's 7th place team in the 1st spot.

307
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,599
- To be cruel? - Yes, to be cruel.

308
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,168
They're reminding everyone that this is survival.

309
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,639
This is a competition.

310
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,440
Round 2's 1st team...

311
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:08,970
is 8TURN.

312
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,709
(8TURN)

313
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,080
(So excited)

314
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,949
(Round 1's 7th place team is going first?)

315
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,419
- 8TURN. - ONEUS is scary.

316
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,888
- Isn't that good for us? - Why?

317
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,048
Because they had the closest score to us.

318
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,850
Right. They're our rivals.

319
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,719
I hope 8TURN does well.

320
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Seriously.

321
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:28,189
They must be...

322
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,259
burning with the passion to redeem themselves.

323
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,100
(8TURN)

324
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,999
(Serious expressions, 100 percent full of passion)

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,330
They look so determined.

326
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,370
- Whose TURN? 8TURN! - 8TURN!

327
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,110
- Hello, we're 8TURN! - Hello, we're 8TURN!

328
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,979
I heard you saw the cue sheet...

329
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,649
when you arrived at your green room.

330
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,648
How did you feel when you saw that you were chosen...

331
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,720
to perform first?

332
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,518
(Surprised)

333
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,519
(Sorry, 8TURN...)

334
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,889
- Let's hear them out. - How did you feel?

335
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,919
I was surprised at first,

336
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,288
but we'll show you...

337
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,490
an impactful performance...

338
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,600
so you remember us even after seeing everyone else.

339
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,070
Okay.

340
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,740
Guys. You must be watching us from your green room.

341
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,070
(The senior singers who were watching them are startled.)

342
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,739
I'll show you that those determined...

343
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,269
to take the throne are scarier than those who want to keep it.

344
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,509
(Their fighting spirit is crazy!)

345
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,378
(Oh, my. He sounds so scary!)

346
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,779
Did you hear that, CRAVITY?

347
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,419
(Check out his determination to win.)

348
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,518
- We'll never let you take it! - You punk!

349
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,860
- How dare you? - You punk!

350
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,360
By the way, his gaze seems so different.

351
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,528
Seriously. This could be their last chance to perform.

352
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,529
(What happened to them while preparing for Round 2?)

353
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,269
(The meeting to discuss the song selection for Round 2)

354
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,269
(It's quiet in the practice studio.)

355
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,009
The mood is quite different compared to before.

356
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,679
(They were excited when they were preparing for Round 1.)

357
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,648
(To showcase their unique spirit and energy,)

358
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,049
(they mainly focused on the choreography for Round 1.)

359
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,519
(But they ranked last in both the Team Battle and the Ace Battle.)

360
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,860
(Their ranking dropped drastically from 1st to 7th place.)

361
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,669
(The ace member of Round 1 couldn't face the members.)

362
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,699
(8TURN is at risk of getting eliminated over 1 performance.)

363
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,009
But still, good job.

364
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,340
- Good job. - I know it was tough.

365
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,779
We weren't bad or anything.

366
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,509
- We can do it. It's okay. - Right.

367
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,279
If we were to get a similar result after Round Two...

368
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,419
Hey.

369
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,589
Come on. Shake off the bad energy.

370
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,590
Okay.

371
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,489
But we need to accept the facts.

372
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,590
- Right. - Let's analyze what went wrong.

373
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,288
From other groups' perspectives...

374
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,658
- It wasn't so original. - Right.

375
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,159
It could've been more original.

376
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,370
Personally, we could've utilized the props better.

377
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,969
We did have some props.

378
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,039
But they weren't so visible on the stage.

379
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,639
The first performance was THE NEW SIX's.

380
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,209
When I watched their performance,

381
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,350
I realized that we missed a big part of this competition.

382
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,679
I think they did a great job at utilizing the cameras too.

383
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,648
We wanted to show our energy on stage with our performance.

384
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,989
But it's hard to deliver...

385
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,319
that energetic feel through the cameras.

386
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,289
We could've been more thoughtful with that too.

387
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,029
Let's review what we missed in Round One.

388
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,960
Then we'll have a good result with Round Two.

389
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,668
So it's too early to be disappointed about our standing on the show.

390
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,768
- You bet. - It's too early to feel that way.

391
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:26,869
(We still have Round 2.)

392
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,840
What kind of song should we choose for Round Two?

393
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,340
But isn't it obvious?

394
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,309
"TIC TAC?"

395
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,249
Our song for Round Two is...

396
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,179
It's our debut song, "TIC TAC."

397
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,519
This song showcases our unparalleled youth,

398
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,329
kitschy vibe, and unique style the best.

399
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,129
It was a unanimous decision.

400
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,699
(This debut song portrays their passion and energy.)

401
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,329
(The catchy chorus and whistle sound are...)

402
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,870
(the key points of this title track from their 1st mini-album.)

403
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,969
Okay. Now that we've chosen our song, we should...

404
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,700
(What will they decide on next?)

405
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,710
(Avoiding his eyes)

406
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,638
(Choosing the ace members is harder this time around.)

407
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,879
- For Round Two. - We must pick the ace members.

408
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,779
The most important decision still remains.

409
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,779
Right.
Actually, it's the most important decision.

410
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,779
We have to pick two ace members for this round.

411
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,750
(Sighing)

412
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,320
I don't think I can do it.

413
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,689
- Come on. Don't say that. - Don't say that.

414
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,289
- You did well. - Come on.

415
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,058
But I understand the sense of pressure.

416
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,499
- What? - What?

417
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
But I understand the sense of pressure.

418
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:26,860
- What? - What?

419
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,299
MYUNG HO?

420
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,939
(MYUNG HO put on an intense performance...)

421
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,169
(as the ace in the Evaluation Match.)

422
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,769
Honestly, I'm scared too.

423
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,038
But the possibility that this may be our last performance...

424
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,024
makes me want to go for it.

425
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:41,679
I think I can do a good job.

426
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,350
- We'd be grateful. - Right. We'd be grateful.

427
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,320
But we need to pick one more ace.

428
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,350
We have to pick one more ace member.

429
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,664
If you guys are okay with it,

430
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,823
I'll do it.

431
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,659
Yes, you're our leader indeed.

432
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,100
Our position in this competition was quite unstable.

433
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,100
We either survive this or don't.

434
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,369
I didn't want my group to feel a sense of pressure...

435
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,309
at times like this.

436
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,940
So I decided to take that risk.

437
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,639
I'll be working with MYUNG HO whom I can rely on.

438
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,850
I think we'll be able to bring a good result to our group.

439
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,179
I confidently volunteered for the position.

440
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,980
Both of our ace members are the main dancers...

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,850
and lead vocalists.

442
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,519
They're the most expressive members on stage too.

443
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,559
When they're given a task,

444
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,029
they complete the task with such resilience.

445
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,000
We can totally rely on them.

446
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,798
So our ace members are me, the leader, and the oldest member.

447
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,398
(JAE YUN and MYUNG HO, the most reliable members,)

448
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,469
(are the ace members for Round 2.)

449
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,470
I think we already won.

450
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,980
They totally crushed me.

451
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:46,909
Please crush them back.

452
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,980
To ensure that we're not eliminated,
we'll kill it.

453
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,378
We have faith in you.

454
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,879
(Just trust us.)

455
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,148
We told the others that we would make sure...

456
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,659
we didn't end up in the Elimination Battle.

457
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,758
(They acted tough and strong in front of the group.)

458
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,099
(But they have a lot on their minds now.)

459
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,829
So...

460
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,140
should we show people how determined we are to win?

461
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,239
Actually, there's a high chance that we may be...

462
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,279
eliminated for now.

463
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,949
Well, you know that this show is our last chance.

464
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,549
Right. We should show exactly that to people.

465
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,190
I think it will be nice if we can incorporate that.

466
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,588
In Round One, YUN GYU didn't do a bad job.

467
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,559
- Right. - But looking at the result,

468
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,200
we might not have fully understood the role of ace.

469
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,599
Whether it's the outfit or whatnot,

470
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,368
there should be a dance break or something...

471
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,000
that can bring attention to the ace members.

472
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,640
Or the chorus part. You know?

473
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,268
I think we should take the part.

474
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,680
We should mainly lead the performance.

475
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,139
Now, this has become a very important performance.

476
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,509
We're hanging by a thread.

477
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,518
As the theme is about our identity,

478
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,419
incorporating the concept of the music video would be neat.

479
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,489
(JAE YUN thought of the concept from an Egyptian myth.)

480
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,490
Ace Number 1 is Anubis. Ace Number 2 is the dead king.

481
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,089
We can assign these characters first.

482
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,130
Then the rest of us can be dead...

483
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,159
That sounds a bit off.

484
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,069
The rest of us could be spirits heading over to the afterlife.

485
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,000
- The spirits? - The spirits.

486
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,469
I think it will fit nicely.

487
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,568
(That's nice.)

488
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,439
JAE YUN is the deity that guides the dead spirits...

489
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,869
to the underworld.

490
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,210
MYUNG HO will be playing the dead king.

491
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,009
But we refuse to be dead and come back to life.

492
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,679
The plot also shows our determination that...

493
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
we'll keep climbing up.

494
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,419
- That's where we are now. - Right.

495
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,319
So you're the member who ranked last in Round One.

496
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,160
I'll climb up to a higher ranking from seventh place.

497
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,729
We never die.

498
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,730
(8TURN never dies.)

499
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:48,200
Then having props to portray the king's tomb would be nice.

500
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,599
Like a coffin.

501
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,338
We can also work on the dancers' costumes too.

502
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,399
We can make it clear that they work for you.

503
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,710
How about dressing them up as mummies?

504
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,239
Anubis has some kind of cane.

505
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,838
- Right. - When you lift that,

506
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,179
the choreography can depict a picture or something.

507
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,349
- It could... - Like a tree of life.

508
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,578
I like it.

509
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,619
(They gathered ideas to complete their performance.)

510
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,249
(A few days later, the day of the rehearsal)

511
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,289
What's this?

512
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,460
- A coffin. - That? Why is that so big?

513
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,429
It looks bigger on the stage.

514
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,028
(A huge coffin)

515
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,399
- Does it look magnificent? - That's your house.

516
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,859
(Utterly satisfied)

517
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,430
Compared to Round One,

518
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,799
we're using more props to make our stage look grand.

519
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,239
Instead of doing our best...

520
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,970
to sing and dance well on the stage,

521
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,440
we thought about what could impress the audience the best...

522
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,079
and how we could deliver it through the cameras the best.

523
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,549
We analyzed our strategy and studied how to improve it.

524
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,549
What should we do to make our moves look bigger?

525
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,419
- After this... - That's it.

526
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
You got it.

527
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,230
Our performance itself is impressive as well as the scale of our stage.

528
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:53,328
Everything worked out.

529
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,669
(They paid attention to every single component of the performance.)

530
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,229
Not to be eliminated from the show,

531
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,469
we studied a lot, made a lot of effort,

532
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,000
and practiced hard.

533
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,609
We don't have any intention to get eliminated.

534
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,079
This performance doesn't deserve to rank last.

535
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,180
We'll show you that we never die.

536
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,980
Let's keep working hard, so we can win first place.

537
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,318
- Let's go. - Let's go.

538
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,749
- Let's go, 8TURN. - Let's go.

539
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,289
(Let's go, 8TURN. Let's not get eliminated.)

540
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,230
Team 8TURN.

541
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,440
But the sense of pressure must be crazy.

542
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:36,069
Well, this could be their last performance on the show.

543
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,309
I think they'll do well.

544
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,609
I hope they do well, but I'm a bit scared.

545
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,749
Let's see if the 8TURN we saw...

546
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,980
from the Evaluation Match has returned.

547
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,559
- What is this? - My gosh.

548
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,789
It's out of focus, but it already looks so grand!

549
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,759
Hey, that thing is huge!

550
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,730
They must have gotten it from Egypt.

551
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,529
("TIC TAC" by 8TURN)

552
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,739
(They adopted the story of Anubis from Egyptian mythology.)

553
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,768
(The deity of death, JAE YUN, tries to guide the dead king,)

554
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:06,868
(MYUNG HO, and his men to the underworld.)

555
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,900
(But instead of accepting the fate, they'll resurrect like 8TURN.)

556
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,068
- What was that? - What?

557
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,240
- My goodness. - What was that?

558
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,089
What's going on?

559
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,460
My gosh, what is that?

560
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,430
They're putting on a magic show from the get-go.

561
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,910
Hey, this is fascinating.

562
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,119
My gosh, his voice is unreal.

563
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,880
He took off the costume.

564
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,539
Yes, he did. He changed the costume.

565
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,049
My gosh.

566
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,130
They're great dancers!

567
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,650
Oh, my. Their performance rocks.

568
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,759
Oh, yes.

569
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,930
Their dancing is flawlessly in sync.

570
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,180
- It's slowing down. - What's going on?

571
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,380
What?

572
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,750
- Gosh, it's slowing down. - What's happening?

573
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,950
There he comes.

574
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,160
- What? - My gosh!

575
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,990
What? When? Wasn't he in the front?

576
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,759
- Gosh. - He's got blood on him!

577
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,400
Come on, please.

578
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,779
That's enough. Come on.

579
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,819
Check out their perfectly synced-up dancing!

580
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,670
Hey, something just passed by.

581
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,589
They're dancing as a pair.

582
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,859
Gosh, that move looked so feathery.

583
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,240
- What's happening in the back? - They're really determined.

584
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,680
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

585
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,779
- They prepared so much for this. - This is so grand.

586
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,019
What? Come on, stop it.

587
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,949
Gosh, look at the special effects.

588
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,849
- That's enough. - Enough!

589
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,259
Stop it!

590
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,429
The door closed.

591
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,199
It's not over yet.

592
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,229
What is it?

593
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,868
There's more!

594
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,069
- More? - There's more!

595
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,299
Stop it.

596
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,410
(8TURN's ace, MYUNG HO)

597
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,720
(8TURN's ace, JAE YUN)

598
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,479
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

599
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,019
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

600
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:26,059
(You can find "TIC TAC" on music streaming services.)

601
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,789
The audience is going wild.

602
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,730
(Approving)

603
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,229
You should have done this in Round One.

604
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,798
They didn't go all out in Round One.

605
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,470
They definitely did.

606
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,368
Hold on. A timeout.

607
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:41,400
Their performance is way too strong.

608
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,839
(They're also just amazed by it.)

609
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,039
They did a killer job.

610
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,650
Hey, the other groups must be nervous after this.

611
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,549
Honestly, after watching 8TURN's performance,

612
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:53,880
I was slightly nervous.

613
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,650
I was concerned that...

614
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,190
they might have raised the bar too high.

615
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,359
The ace members clearly stood out, and their concept was clear.

616
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,960
8TURN improved their performance.

617
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,259
And we're doomed.

618
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,059
- They are determined to win. - They are.

619
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,469
(A sense of relief washes over them as they're no longer nervous.)

620
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,838
Everyone, well done.

621
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,008
- Hey. - Gosh.

622
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,809
- By the way, this was great. - I almost cried.

623
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,309
I have no regrets about this performance.

624
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,409
That's all we need.

625
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,909
Whatever the result may be...

626
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,449
If we end up in the Elimination Battle,

627
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,920
- we'll win. - That's right.

628
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,249
- Well done. - We believe in you.

629
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,788
Well done. I mean it.

630
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:30,490
(Everyone thought so hard to complete this performance.)

631
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,518
It felt like we were making our debut again.

632
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,759
When we debuted with this song, "TIC TAC,"

633
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,558
we dreamed...

634
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,598
of performing on a big stage with a lot of props...

635
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,200
and coming up with our own storyline.

636
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,900
So it felt like our dream came true.

637
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,169
After the performance, I sort of got emotional too.

638
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,568
(Will they be able to avoid getting eliminated?)

639
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,479
Gosh, they did a fantastic job. The next group must be nervous.

640
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,079
I bet the 2nd group will be as good as the 1st group.

641
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,849
Round Two of Road to Kingdom.

642
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,649
This group's ideas left...

643
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,990
a strong impression every time they performed.

644
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,150
Their ideas?

645
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,659
Is it THE NEW SIX?

646
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,489
They're known to have creative ideas.

647
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,490
THE NEW SIX?

648
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,029
The second group to perform is...

649
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,858
THE NEW SIX.

650
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,730
(The 2nd performance of Round 2, THE NEW SIX)

651
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,470
(THE NEW SIX)

652
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,099
(TAEHUN)

653
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,609
Their outfits look pretty plain.

654
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,939
Based on their outfits, I can't tell who the ace members are.

655
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,079
Is that their strategy?

656
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,880
Let us introduce ourselves.

657
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,618
- Hello, we're THE NEW SIX. - Hello, we're THE NEW SIX.

658
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,819
- I hope you like our performance. - I hope you like our performance.

659
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,489
Just like Round One,

660
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,818
ONEUS picked you...

661
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,189
as the second group to perform.

662
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,828
Come to think of it,

663
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,358
THE NEW SIX was either 1st or 2nd to perform.

664
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,858
I like you guys.

665
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,130
(That's the reason.)

666
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,699
HWAN WOONG must have felt threatened...

667
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,199
by us again in this round.

668
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,799
So he placed us in the first half.

669
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:56,969
(Nicely said!)

670
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,180
"He must have felt threatened."

671
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,579
(Did you hear him?)

672
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,980
You were spot on!

673
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,308
I'm grateful that he feels threatened,

674
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,818
but we'll try to win the benefit...

675
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,689
of completing the cue sheet for the next round.

676
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,089
So we'll put on a great performance.

677
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,449
(He's brimming with confidence.)

678
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,258
He's provoking them.

679
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:15,359
Gosh, HWI can be scary.

680
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,190
Show us!

681
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,429
Then could you introduce the performance...

682
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,829
you have prepared for us today?

683
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,599
(We must focus!)

684
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,338
We have a lot of great tracks from our album...

685
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,200
that people don't know about.

686
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,608
A great track people don't know about?

687
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,609
Is it a B-side track?

688
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,568
We thought about what to perform for this round...

689
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,180
and settled on this song.

690
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,808
(The meeting to discuss the song selection for Round 2)

691
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,250
Should we pick the song first?

692
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,249
The theme is identity.

693
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,548
"Show us your identity."

694
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,180
- "What does your group stand for?" - Right.

695
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,889
People would usually pick their debut song.

696
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,219
Right, that's the usual pick.

697
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,459
- Ours was... - It was "Move."

698
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,490
- But we already performed it. - Right.

699
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,858
We did a mash-up of "Move" and "Fuego."

700
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,259
Right. We used up two of our songs.

701
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,499
So we must perform either...

702
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,298
- "Love or Die" or "Kick It 4 Now." - Right.

703
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,669
"Kick It 4 Now" has a youthful vibe.

704
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,899
- It's like drinking up Sprite. - Right, totally.

705
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,970
Let's mash those two up.

706
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,308
It's like a fruit bowl.

707
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,309
"Kick It 4 Now" is like drinking up sparkling water.

708
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,078
But we have to think about our performances...

709
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,249
for the Evaluation Match and Round One.

710
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,348
Going with a youthful performance all of a sudden might seem off.

711
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:14,348
To argue that's our identity,

712
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,719
- it doesn't fit. - Right.

713
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,689
Which one do you like?

714
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,819
Me?

715
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,220
Well, there's only one choice.

716
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,690
- "Love or Die." - Right, it's just that.

717
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,199
(The title track of their 2nd mini-album has a catchy chorus.)

718
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,929
Our fans like "Love or Die" too.

719
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,169
Actually, a lot of people remember us with "Love or Die."

720
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,239
- Right. - That's true.

721
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,299
(THE NEW SIX let their name known with "Love or Die.")

722
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:36,639
We've been showing only intense performances.

723
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,008
And this song isn't too youthful.

724
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,179
I think this song can show a great harmony of our different identities.

725
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,980
- We can balance them out. - Great.

726
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,848
(It's the title track of their 2nd mini-album.)

727
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:46,078
(HWI participated in writing the lyrics about the pain...)

728
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,480
(after a breakup. The mellow vibe stands out in the song.)

729
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,058
Well, we're very good at performing these sorrowful songs.

730
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,359
- Look forward to it. - Yes.

731
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,829
Now, it's time to make this important decision.

732
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,258
We must pick the ace members.

733
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,029
- Right. - I'm already getting a headache.

734
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,358
Actually, this member came to mind right away.

735
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,399
- Me? - Here's why.

736
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,500
- What? - What?

737
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:05,368
- Do you want to do it? - Well...

738
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:06,569
He seems disappointed.

739
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,739
(THE NEW SIX ranked 4th 2 consecutive times...)

740
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,910
(in the Evaluation Match and Round 1.)

741
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,979
(Disappointed)

742
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,209
(We must rank higher next time no matter what.)

743
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,250
(Right.)

744
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,409
"I'm ranked fourth."

745
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,379
- That pierced my heart. - My gosh.

746
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,319
But here's who I had in mind. It's JUNHYEOK.

747
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,919
The five of us usually performed this song.

748
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,119
- Right. - Yes.

749
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,159
I wasn't able to join you when you guys performed the song.

750
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,960
Since you couldn't perform the song on stage,

751
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,098
- you must have a clingy feeling. - Right. You must have it.

752
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,358
- The desire to perform this song. - He must have that passion.

753
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,568
What do you think?
What if you were to be the ace member?

754
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:38,298
I was also ranked fourth.

755
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,368
Right.

756
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,338
We should try to redeem ourselves from fourth place.

757
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:42,538
I think HWI would be good too...

758
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,239
because he wrote the lyrics for the song.

759
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,508
But in my opinion,

760
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,380
KYUNGJUN might be a better fit than me for this song.

761
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,779
He's easy on the eyes.
So it could work to our advantage.

762
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,048
You know what? He did go viral.

763
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,049
- Mr. Viral. "Yes, I pledge." - Right.

764
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,490
- He's the Pledge Guy. - Right, the Pledge Guy.

765
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:00,858
(He went viral as the Pledge Guy on social media.)

766
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,758
He can draw people in.

767
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,828
(This Pledge Guy is going viral.)

768
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:06,529
Your face is your weapon.

769
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,499
Don't look at me. My heart is beating fast.

770
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
- My heart is beating fast. - Okay.

771
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Hey.

772
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,268
Also, if I looked like you,

773
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,369
I'd be the ace all the time.

774
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,739
He's also a good dancer.

775
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,778
- You're right. - Right.

776
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,710
(KYUNGJUN looks dazed as they continue complimenting him.)

777
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,150
I'm so nervous.

778
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,450
You guys be the next ace.

779
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,419
- I can't. - I don't think I can do it.

780
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,289
(The members are overwhelmed by the ace's responsibility.)

781
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,159
(Nervous, anxious)

782
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,118
I'm worried after seeing JUNHYEOK perform.

783
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,529
- Oh, my gosh. - I'm scared.

784
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,828
- You can do it. - Of course.

785
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:39,829
Yes, just do it.

786
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,759
It's time for you to show them what you got.

787
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,799
- Then... - Yes?

788
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,099
- if you trust me, - Yes?

789
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,298
- I'll give it a try. - Okay.

790
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,499
- Okay. - Sounds good.

791
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,268
- We have our 2 aces. - Our 2 aces.

792
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,838
I want to be on the list of trending things too.

793
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,239
- Okay. - With the help of KYUNGJUN?

794
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,278
With the help of KYUNGJUN?

795
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,348
- Okay. - Let's make it together.

796
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,608
Don't do it by yourself.

797
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,508
The pressure I feel...

798
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,190
about having to bring up the Ace Ranking is high.

799
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,150
(After being 4th twice in a row, they have to bring up the ranking.)

800
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,890
I really have to do well.

801
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,930
I'm very worried.

802
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,160
(He stays up all night worrying.)

803
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,528
Let's keep this up.

804
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,429
(He constantly practices even during breaks.)

805
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,500
KYUNGJUN.

806
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,099
Aren't you tired?

807
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,910
- We have to win this time. - That's right.

808
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,440
So...

809
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,380
I'm worried.

810
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,778
- Let's practice together then. - We should practice together.

811
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,179
Let's do it together.

812
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,710
All right. Let's see how it goes.

813
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,449
(Practicing repeatedly)

814
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,318
He took up the responsibility of the ace and practiced hard.

815
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,589
I was truly grateful.

816
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Wait a second.

817
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:42,429
(A few days later, Formation rehearsal day)

818
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,529
How do you get up there?

819
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,959
KYUNGJUN is going to stand on that?

820
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,599
- Yes, with me. - KYUNGJUN and JUNHYEOK.

821
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,500
It's really high.

822
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,768
He has to climb up like that?

823
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,538
(He tries climbing up the ladder.)

824
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,599
Be careful.

825
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,339
This is hard to climb up.

826
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,038
(Easily pulling himself up)

827
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:58,813
Don't let go.

828
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,240
- Don't let go of me. - I won't.

829
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,549
(They have to climb up the high structure together.)

830
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,348
(Gasping)

831
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,749
It's really high up here.

832
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,488
- It's high. - It is high.

833
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:10,619
Can you dance?

834
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,218
You have to rap here too.

835
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,420
I'll try my best.

836
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,730
Let's do our best. We got this.

837
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:19,000
(The formation rehearsal begins.)

838
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,428
(Despite their concerns,)

839
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,828
(KYUNGJUN and JUNHYEOK practice together with ease.)

840
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,069
When they see our two aces,

841
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,399
the other teams will think they're awesome.

842
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,010
- They're awesome. - Even we can see they're awesome.

843
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:30,969
- You got this, right? - Yes, I got this.

844
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,379
I'll try my best.

845
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,479
(We got this. We'll do our best!)

846
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,779
- The Pledge Guy. - Yes.

847
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,210
I want to give it a try too.

848
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,050
Good luck.

849
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,348
- Let's do our best. - Let's go.

850
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,678
- In 1, 2, 3. - Let's go.

851
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,750
(Let's go, THE NEW SIX!)

852
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,159
It was a lot of pressure,

853
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,860
but we'll show you the perfect performance...

854
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,130
of "Love or Die" as a whole group.

855
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,599
- It's KYUNGJUN. - Really?

856
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,670
Is he going to do the pledge?

857
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:56,769
Pledge.

858
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,098
I can't imagine what KYUNGJUN will be like as the ace.

859
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,339
I didn't expect this.

860
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,638
I have no idea what kind of props they will use.

861
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,909
I can't wait to see it.

862
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,050
Team THE NEW SIX.

863
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,119
Two aces.

864
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,659
- Let's go, KYUNGJUN. - Let's go, JUNHYEOK.

865
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,340
("Love or Die" by THE NEW SIX)

866
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,538
(They depicted love and death through props...)

867
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,539
(and by adding emotions to their choreography...)

868
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:38,539
(to express loneliness...)

869
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,610
(and a heart that is frozen after being hurt by love.)

870
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,079
- "Love of Die." - I see.

871
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,480
I love this song.

872
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,518
I love this song. I hope they do well.

873
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,718
I love this song too.

874
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,788
Since the song is good,

875
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,119
I hope they don't do that well.

876
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,519
- Yes. - All right.

877
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,320
- "Love or Die." - "Love or Die?"

878
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,989
They look desperate.

879
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,159
They know how to put together a dramatic stage.

880
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,230
Yes.

881
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,379
(It makes them sing along.)

882
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,448
(It's love)

883
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,449
Here it comes.

884
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,098
- Wait. It's an arrangement. - They totally changed it.

885
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,530
It's mixed with that song.

886
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:11,929
They used a sample.

887
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,269
(They used a sample of "Swan Lake.")

888
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,158
They're doing something.

889
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,159
- A ladder? - It's a ladder.

890
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,759
- I think he'll climb up later. - He's going to climb up.

891
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,030
- He's going up. - They're going up.

892
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:02,619
(Nice kick, TAEHUN.)

893
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,849
TAEHUN.

894
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:05,419
Are those two the aces?

895
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,659
- No. - No.

896
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,489
I can't see the aces.

897
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,399
I didn't know ladders could look so beautiful.

898
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,030
They make good use of the props.

899
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,630
That's novel.

900
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,019
Gosh, KYUNGJUN.

901
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,820
It's the prince.

902
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,139
My gosh.

903
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,809
What are you doing?

904
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,308
(Everyone starts stirring.)

905
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:33,609
This is PG-15.

906
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,109
Gosh.

907
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,209
(Protect the youngest.)

908
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,750
- No. - I have to see this.

909
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,099
- They're going up. - They're going up.

910
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:03,769
(Gosh! What is this suddenly?)

911
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,670
- What is this suddenly? - They suddenly turned dark.

912
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,440
They turned over to the dark side.

913
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,570
It's over.

914
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,840
- No, it's not. - He has a rapping part.

915
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,670
- It isn't over yet. - What?

916
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,289
It's totally a different vibe now.

917
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,960
- That was a plot twist. - It was awesome.

918
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,439
(Surprised at the unexpected ending)

919
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,538
(Gosh.)

920
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,709
He chose death.

921
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,050
He didn't choose it. He was a victim.

922
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,419
It has a sad ending.

923
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,848
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

924
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,119
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

925
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,218
(You can find "Love or Die" by THE NEW SIX...)

926
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,989
(on music streaming services right now.)

927
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,929
(THE NEW SIX's ace, JUNHYEOK)

928
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,388
(THE NEW SIX's ace, KYUNGJUN)

929
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,459
He's good-looking.

930
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,529
(They marvel at his looks.)

931
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,829
- Is he not an actor? - Gosh.

932
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,268
- He looks like a noir movie actor. - He chose death.

933
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:38,829
He's handsome.

934
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,300
(What kind of reaction is that?)

935
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,169
(THE NEW SIX leaves the stage after their performance.)

936
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,539
- Good job. - Good job.

937
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,038
- Good job. - Good job.

938
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,279
- We did great. - You did a good job.

939
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,409
The aces did amazingly well.

940
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:49,980
- Good job. - Good job.

941
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,618
- Everyone did so well. - Yes, we did.

942
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:53,749
- You did great. - Good job.

943
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,078
You all did a good job...

944
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,789
doing something different from our usual thing.

945
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:59,518
- You seriously all did so well. - Nicely done.

946
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,519
They did a good job.

947
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,519
(Standing ovation)

948
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,559
Seriously.

949
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,159
I thought it was a drama.

950
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,459
- It was very lyrical. - I know.

951
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,399
They are competent in things like this.

952
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,629
I think they were able to express their identity.

953
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,329
After watching the stage,

954
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,768
I was wondering who the aces were.

955
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,570
- They didn't stand out. - No, they didn't.

956
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,578
What made a lasting impression...

957
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,010
was the part...

958
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,408
- when TAEHUN did the kick. - Right.

959
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,408
- And when SUNGJUN was trapped. - Yes, when he was trapped.

960
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,718
I thought that part was cool.

961
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,319
They actually gave the impressive parts...

962
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,848
- to the other members. - They gave it all out.

963
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,419
It would've been nice if they'd let the aces stand out...

964
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,760
- a bit more. - Right.

965
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,590
Who do you think is next?

966
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:38,058
I think it'll be CRAVITY.

967
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,599
- It's just a feeling. - I think it'll be YOUNITE.

968
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,759
- I think it'll be CRAVITY. - CRAVITY?

969
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,268
- I think so too. - Right?

970
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,070
- It's time for them to show up. - They should be up now.

971
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,070
This is the 3rd team of Round 2.

972
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,669
During the last round,

973
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,480
this team won over not only the other teams,

974
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:57,280
but also the on-site judges with their unexpected dark charm.

975
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,349
- Unexpected charm? - Unexpected charm? It's YOUNITE.

976
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,649
It must be YOUNITE, isn't it?

977
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,619
No, I think it's CRAVITY.

978
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:06,690
(The other team members have different opinions.)

979
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:09,659
The 3rd team to perform in Round 2 is CRAVITY.

980
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,699
(CRAVITY)

981
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,730
- I was right. - What?

982
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,199
- CRAVITY. - Why are they performing after us?

983
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,980
Who was their ace? Was it TAEYOUNG?

984
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,679
You can guess who their aces are.

985
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:31,893
Yes, those two are the aces.

986
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,480
It's the two members wearing white.

987
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,219
Is it MINHEE?

988
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,590
MINHEE?

989
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:38,549
(Even the outfits of MINHEE and TAEYOUNG stand out.)

990
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,760
TAEYOUNG and MINHEE?

991
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,119
I can tell who the aces are.

992
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,158
CRAVITY will say hello in 2, 3.

993
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:45,159
- Get closer. - Get closer.

994
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,829
- Hi, we're CRAVITY. - Hi, we're CRAVITY.

995
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,769
(High expectations)

996
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,170
Please introduce CRAVITY's aces for Round Two.

997
00:43:55,656 --> 00:43:59,510
Round Two is about the identity of the group.

998
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,880
So we chose the member with the strongest pride...

999
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,380
and competitive spirit which is me.

1000
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:04,908
(We agree.)

1001
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,780
And MINHEE, who is just as proud and competitive as I.

1002
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,848
(Round 2, CRAVITY's aces, MINHEE and TAEYOUNG)

1003
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,889
- He's good-looking. - He looks like a prince.

1004
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,360
I already feel your competitiveness.

1005
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,159
What song did you choose for the Identity mission?

1006
00:44:20,517 --> 00:44:22,599
- "Love or Die?" - That would be crazy.

1007
00:44:22,942 --> 00:44:23,942
Could it be "Love or Die?"

1008
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,469
They won't do "Love or Die," will they?

1009
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,538
The odds will be against us if they do "Love or Die."

1010
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,169
(Highly worried)

1011
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,038
CRAVITY chose this song hoping to win first place...

1012
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,579
on Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1013
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:37,779
(No way.)

1014
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,979
(Really?)

1015
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,849
It's our song that was the 1st to win 1st place on TV.

1016
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,650
It's "Love or Die."

1017
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:45,218
(It's a match.)

1018
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,259
- What? - It's "Love or Die?"

1019
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,788
It's a mirror match.

1020
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,229
It's "Love or Die" twice in a row.

1021
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,260
- Unbelievable. - "Love or Die" twice in a row.

1022
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,059
Was ONEUS hoping for this?

1023
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,999
(That's right.)

1024
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Unbelievable.

1025
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:00,499
What I said became real.

1026
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,299
They're even performing right after.

1027
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,369
Isn't this crazy?

1028
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,509
(In despair)

1029
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,879
What did he say?

1030
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,980
- Are they doing "Love or Die?" - Yes.

1031
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,750
They're really doing "Love or Die."

1032
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,908
This is a true match.

1033
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,119
CRAVITY is good.

1034
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,849
(What kind of charm will CRAVITY's "Love or Die" have?)

1035
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:18,590
You did well in Round One.

1036
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,819
(They applaud one another for getting through Round One.)

1037
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,388
That was nicely done.

1038
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:24,389
(We won 1st place.)

1039
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,230
Three.

1040
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,360
(Overcoming the sadness of ranking 7th in the Evaluation Match)

1041
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,070
(1st place, CRAVITY, 10,769 points)

1042
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:37,868
(They won 1st place in Round 1's Team Ranking.)

1043
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,510
Gosh. Seriously.

1044
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:42,808
We needed something to help us overcome the sadness.

1045
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,948
It was our first result.

1046
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:47,619
- You're right. - I was ecstatic at that moment.

1047
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,819
We have to get ready for Round Two.

1048
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,848
Round Two is more important.

1049
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,359
A team will get eliminated starting in Round Two.

1050
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,530
My gosh.

1051
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,229
- That means... - It's scary.

1052
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,459
it will be unbelievably competitive...

1053
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,299
compared to the other rounds.

1054
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,269
That's right. You never know what will happen.

1055
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,500
The teams that were 1st and 7th in the Evaluation Match changed places.

1056
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,610
- You're right. - We can't let our guard down.

1057
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,768
If you take a look at the scores,

1058
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,178
we aren't that much ahead of YOUNITE in second place.

1059
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,179
- Right. - You're right.

1060
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,649
There was a 500-point difference.

1061
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,010
- Yes, it was only a few hundred. - It was a small difference.

1062
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,380
I thought the Ace Score and Team Score would be similar.

1063
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,750
But I realized it could be quite different.

1064
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,488
So I thought it would be important...

1065
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,928
to put on a performance that helps the ace shine.

1066
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:32,558
The theme of Round Two is solid.

1067
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:33,860
- Identity. - Yes, identity.

1068
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,969
Who is the ace to fight for our pride?

1069
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:38,268
- Who is it? - MINHEE and TAEYOUNG.

1070
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:41,069
(CRAVITY's pride and aces for Round 2, MINHEE and TAEYOUNG)

1071
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,268
TAEYOUNG is good at using facial expressions,

1072
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:46,480
gestures, and his body.

1073
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:49,479
I believe his presence is big on stage.

1074
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,509
MINHEE is well-built...

1075
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,678
and has smooth dance moves.

1076
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,590
He has a unique character.

1077
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,488
We can't lose when the team's pride...

1078
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:00,718
- is on the line. - Of course not.

1079
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:01,888
How do you feel?

1080
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,460
I think it'll be fun.

1081
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,190
I really want to win.

1082
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,699
This is our pride. We can't lose.

1083
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
No, we can't.

1084
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,768
I wasn't able to win first place in the Ace Ranking.

1085
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:13,969
I was determined to aim for first place...

1086
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,269
in both the Ace and Team Rankings this time.

1087
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,538
When you talk about identity,

1088
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:20,808
you should choose...

1089
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:22,078
- the team's best song. - Right.

1090
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,578
We have songs that won first place.

1091
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:25,579
Right.

1092
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:26,579
(Precious songs that brought them the honor of winning 1st place)

1093
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,550
I think we should consider them.

1094
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,448
I think it's important...

1095
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,920
that we show how badly we want this.

1096
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:36,860
Why don't we go with "Love or Die" that expresses more of our emotions?

1097
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,559
I like "Love or Die."

1098
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,999
It's the song we came back with recently.

1099
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,730
And it's a good fit for our members.

1100
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:44,969
I think we should do "Love or Die."

1101
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,570
We chose "Love or Die..."

1102
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,809
hoping to win first place once again on Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1103
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,510
We either win first place or die.

1104
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:56,039
It's either first place or death?

1105
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,409
What if we win second place?

1106
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,610
Then we die.

1107
00:47:58,611 --> 00:47:59,949
(Then we die.)

1108
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,948
(The title track of CRAVITY's 7th mini album...)

1109
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,788
(that shows their strong will to die if they don't find love...)

1110
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,888
(through an addictive melody...)

1111
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,789
(and CRAVITY's unique and energetic performance)

1112
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,659
I wonder what the others will say.

1113
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,960
What if they complain and tell us to put it back?

1114
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:15,799
(Official BGM for their entrance)

1115
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,399
Everyone.

1116
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,198
What is it?

1117
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,739
See what we brought? It's our trophy.

1118
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,768
I haven't seen it for a long time.

1119
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:25,139
- It's been a while. - Right?

1120
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:27,178
We're performing "Love or Die."

1121
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,339
- Right. - I wanted some first-place energy.

1122
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,078
- Right. - Let's leave this trophy...

1123
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:32,479
in the middle for a change.

1124
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,578
It'll be in the middle?

1125
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:34,750
- Yes. - It'll keep us centered.

1126
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,619
Ta-da.

1127
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,948
It's so shiny.

1128
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,360
It's pretty.

1129
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,429
Since we have our trophy with us,

1130
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,260
let's win 1st place in Round 2.

1131
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,529
- Okay. - Let's go.

1132
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,999
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1133
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
(Let's go, CRAVITY!)

1134
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,670
(They start practicing for Round 2 with the energy of the trophy.)

1135
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,409
(They begin with the part they have to dance in sync.)

1136
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:06,619
(MINHEE seems to be having trouble concentrating on the practice.)

1137
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,159
At first,

1138
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:17,460
I knew I could do it.

1139
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,360
However, I felt stressed...

1140
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:22,929
after becoming the ace.

1141
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:26,230
The more I practiced,

1142
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:28,440
the more I got stressed instead of getting used to it.

1143
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,739
I felt a strong sense of responsibility.

1144
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,510
I felt intimidated without realizing it.

1145
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,788
(The sense of responsibility he felt since they were in 7th place)

1146
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:44,789
Three.

1147
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:50,589
(They won the VS Mission in Round 1...)

1148
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,000
(and ranked 1st in Team Ranking.)

1149
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,868
(The pressure of not wanting to lose something they achieved)

1150
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,570
I didn't want to let anyone take our place.

1151
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,070
(2 days before Round 2, Formation rehearsal day)

1152
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:08,280
(Rehearsing for the first time with the props)

1153
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:10,750
We just have to make sure it works.

1154
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,119
This is how it turned out.

1155
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:18,619
The part we changed last time.

1156
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,988
(MINHEE is flustered because the formation changed.)

1157
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:22,658
Here's the music. Three, two, one.

1158
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:24,530
Just do something similar.

1159
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:29,130
(MINHEE tries to remember what they practiced, but it isn't easy.)

1160
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:34,239
(The aces use a piano for the next part.)

1161
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,569
And we walk away.

1162
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,908
(They don't have this part perfectly down either.)

1163
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:40,909
Do we have to switch places when we walk away?

1164
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,809
- Let's wrap this up first. - It'll change.

1165
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,349
It wasn't completed by then.

1166
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:48,320
I was constantly nervous.

1167
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,860
I felt apologetic to the other members...

1168
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:55,459
for trusting myself too much.

1169
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,789
(MINHEE feels like it's his fault that nothing is going smoothly.)

1170
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:59,360
(Sighing)

1171
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,659
I feel anxious.

1172
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,130
The competition was in two days.

1173
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,099
I thought I was losing my mind.

1174
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,499
"I'm not ready yet. What should I do?"

1175
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,070
That thought kept going through my mind.

1176
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,078
Let's watch it together.

1177
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,138
(The two aces check their work as they wrap up their day.)

1178
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,550
We kept changing things even today.

1179
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,650
I know.

1180
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,349
(Concentrating)

1181
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,250
We can kill this, right?

1182
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:31,360
- We can do it. - We only get one chance.

1183
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,130
I'm so worried.

1184
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,529
We can do this. We can win.

1185
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,639
If we lose... I'm sure no one else will blame us,

1186
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:46,038
but I know we will.

1187
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,539
It'd be our fault.

1188
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:52,079
(Feeling obliged to protect the result they painstakingly achieved)

1189
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,349
At least we're in it together.

1190
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,420
If CRAVITY comes together as one,

1191
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,050
we'll be good.

1192
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,118
He wants to feel satisfied,

1193
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,360
but there isn't enough time.

1194
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:04,829
I think that's why he is scared.

1195
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,130
You're doing a great job.

1196
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,598
You're doing a great job.

1197
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:11,129
- Why am I so nervous? - You're doing great.

1198
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,038
And the fact that the members made you the ace means...

1199
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:16,000
- that they trusted you. - You're right.

1200
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,308
Go to bed.

1201
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:18,369
(Stop overthinking.)

1202
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,348
It's just one time.

1203
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,250
(It's almost time for the performance.)

1204
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,948
(Sighing)

1205
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:30,489
This is tormenting.

1206
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:32,619
I can't let my team lose because of me.

1207
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,690
We placed first for once, after all.

1208
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:41,230
They trusted me and made me the ace, so...

1209
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,339
I want to do better.

1210
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,610
(The reason he's anxious)

1211
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,038
That's why I'm nervous.

1212
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,210
(How will "Love or Die" by CRAVITY look with the ace under pressure?)

1213
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,250
Team CRAVITY.

1214
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,530
He looks like Prince Charming.

1215
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,038
"Love or Die" is a great song, by the way.

1216
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:21,698
There's a reason it placed first.

1217
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,699
I can't wait to see it.

1218
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,169
I'm nervous.

1219
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,408
I don't care about all the other teams.

1220
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:27,840
- Me neither. - I'm only interested in this one.

1221
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:29,447
Please.

1222
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,689
What's that back there?

1223
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,849
- Wait, something went up. - They're standing behind it!

1224
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:41,168
- They're standing there. - It's unbelievable.

1225
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,900
(To be continued shortly)

1226
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:01,939
("Love or Die" by CRAVITY)

1227
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,408
(A performance based on synchronized choreography that expresses...)

1228
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:04,808
(CRAVITY's obsession and desire to break free from the molds...)

1229
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,210
(and limitations set by society, in their pursuit of identity)

1230
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,449
There's light.

1231
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:35,010
That's literally insane.

1232
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,210
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1233
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,889
What's going on?

1234
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,928
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1235
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:32,000
The color changed.

1236
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,879
They went up!

1237
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,250
They went up.

1238
00:55:57,889 --> 00:55:58,929
Oh, my.

1239
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,230
Gosh.

1240
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:26,820
That's...

1241
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,900
Oh, my gosh.

1242
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,089
They're good.

1243
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,190
They rearranged it so well.

1244
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:19,939
- Don't do it. - Oh, no.

1245
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,010
The curtain fell.

1246
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,078
- There's more? - Why are you opening it?

1247
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,750
Don't open it!

1248
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,190
- It's a piano. - Piano?

1249
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,618
He's playing the piano.

1250
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:35,059
Gosh.

1251
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,650
It's beautiful.

1252
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:08,989
Wait, it turned into a flower.

1253
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,459
- What? - What is that?

1254
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,499
What's that?

1255
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,199
- That's incredible. - Gosh.

1256
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,389
One might call it the finale.

1257
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,198
Why do you do this to us? Just stop.

1258
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,969
I'm speechless.

1259
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:14,119
(CRAVITY'S ace, TAEYOUNG)

1260
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,960
(CRAVITY's ace, MINHEE)

1261
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,859
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1262
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,860
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

1263
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,629
(You can find "Love or Die" by CRAVITY...)

1264
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,369
(on music streaming services right now.)

1265
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:26,129
(Admiring)

1266
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:26,954
That was so cool.

1267
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,868
The theme, arrangement, and choreography.

1268
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:32,308
Those three came together perfectly.

1269
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:34,078
(The same reactions)

1270
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,413
They utilized every nook and cranny of the stage so well.

1271
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:40,579
They did such a good job of using that square stage.

1272
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,550
That's so well made.

1273
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,819
They're indeed good at using structure.

1274
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,788
A cube might seem insignificant,

1275
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:51,190
but they utilized it so well.

1276
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:52,689
I have a feeling they'll be in the top three again.

1277
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,429
(He has a bad feeling about this.)

1278
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,860
The stage production was insane.

1279
00:59:56,929 --> 01:00:00,739
They filled the performance with such various effects,

1280
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,268
so there were lots of spectacles to watch.

1281
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,300
(Various effects and choreography based on the story)

1282
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,209
It caught my attention when the two started together.

1283
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,909
And that's how they ended it, so they connected.

1284
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:10,349
I loved it.

1285
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,110
I'm going to cry.

1286
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,649
(CRAVITY comes back down...)

1287
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,789
(after finishing the performance without any mistakes.)

1288
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,219
Good job.

1289
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,929
You did so well.

1290
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,428
You think you showed them everything?

1291
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:30,199
- You did great. - Great job.

1292
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:32,570
I didn't want to be my team's obstacle.

1293
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,570
I was glad that I overcame it.

1294
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,138
The audience went wild.

1295
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,509
(They cheer each other up for trusting each other.)

1296
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,209
- They said we did well. - That was wild.

1297
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,379
I had eight great members,

1298
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,849
so I could rely on them.

1299
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,750
I was thankful that they gave me confidence.

1300
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,819
Awesome!

1301
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:51,919
(THE NEW SIX members get anxious as CRAVITY did so well.)

1302
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,219
That was fabulous.

1303
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,888
They're all going so hard.

1304
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:56,259
They certainly are good.

1305
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,360
- I know, right? - Yes.

1306
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,198
The previous teams went so hard.

1307
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,300
The next ones must be so nervous.

1308
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,630
And that team's stage production was so good, so...

1309
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:10,440
The 4th team to perform in Round 2.

1310
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,908
This is a team that delivers with each performance,

1311
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,880
as if every performance is a different genre of film.

1312
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:17,678
I bet it's YOUNITE.

1313
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:18,979
I agree.

1314
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,650
I think it's YOUNITE.

1315
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,448
(The 4th performance in Round 2)

1316
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:23,480
It's YOUNITE.

1317
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,619
(They predicted it correctly.)

1318
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:29,190
(It really is YOUNITE!)

1319
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,989
I have a feeling that their song will be refreshing.

1320
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:33,629
They're coming.

1321
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,328
But they're not dressed for a refreshing song.

1322
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,659
Isn't it a fresh theme, though?

1323
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,828
(What's YOUNITE's theme in Round 2?)

1324
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,039
(STEVE)

1325
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,809
A young noble?

1326
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,669
We'll say hello. In 2, 3.

1327
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,670
- Y-O-UNITE. - Y-O-UNITE.

1328
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:48,280
- Hello, we're YOUNITE! - Hello, we're YOUNITE!

1329
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,710
(We've been waiting for you!)

1330
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:55,348
In Round One,

1331
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:57,718
you showed us an intense performance.

1332
01:01:57,719 --> 01:01:59,288
It must have been difficult for you...

1333
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:00,889
to choose a song for Round Two.

1334
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:02,388
What kind of performance should we expect?

1335
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:05,229
In the Evaluation Match and Round One,

1336
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,099
we performed intense songs.

1337
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,829
The topic of Round Two is Identity,

1338
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,900
so we decided to use our strength strategically.

1339
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,269
(Strength?)

1340
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,239
It's a fresh and cool theme.

1341
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,739
I like a fresh and cool song.

1342
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,078
But it's not easy to win in a competition...

1343
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,579
with a fresh and cool song.

1344
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:28,348
(They're also amazed.)

1345
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,349
This is a huge challenge.

1346
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,949
(TEMPEST members are both worried and amazed.)

1347
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,219
- It really was a fresh theme. - Yes.

1348
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,388
I heard that you strategically chose the ace members...

1349
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:38,559
to suit the song's vibe.

1350
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,599
Please tell us the ace members of Round Two.

1351
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:43,929
YOUNITE's ace members in Round Two are...

1352
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,670
One of them is EUNSANG.

1353
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:47,170
Who do you think the other ace is?

1354
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:49,469
Followed by Round One,

1355
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:51,610
I'll be one of the ace members.

1356
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:52,869
(Exclaiming)

1357
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,879
As expected.

1358
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,109
The guaranteed ace.

1359
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,110
And?

1360
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,179
And the other one is WOONO.

1361
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,019
(EUNSANG and WOONO are YOUNITE's aces in Round 2.)

1362
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:02,819
(Surprised)

1363
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,119
So handsome!

1364
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:05,650
He really is.

1365
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:07,320
He opens our eyes.

1366
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,619
I keep seeing Cha Eun Woo in him.

1367
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,960
I feel like I'll be bewitched.

1368
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:14,829
We performed a dark-themed song in Round One.

1369
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,759
But we've got a fresh theme this time,

1370
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,530
so we'll make sure to show you the freshness.

1371
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:21,199
(We believe you'll deliver the freshness well, WOONO.)

1372
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,009
When EUNSANG was the only ace last time,

1373
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,239
he captivated all of us.

1374
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,840
I wonder how he'll perform with WOONO.

1375
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,139
They're in second place, right?

1376
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,209
What kind of show will it be?

1377
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,218
Will it be freshness added with luxury?

1378
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:35,250
Right.

1379
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,388
- Okay. - All right!

1380
01:03:37,389 --> 01:03:38,549
(The day of the strategy meeting for Round 2)

1381
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,819
We need to show it to the camera.

1382
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,618
Check out the bright red card.

1383
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:43,460
It makes me happy every time I see it.

1384
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:44,988
Should we put it on the "No Eating" sign?

1385
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:47,530
Yes, we could put it here.

1386
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,530
- Yes. - So that we can stay happy...

1387
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,329
throughout today's meeting.

1388
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,899
I'm sure our agency will allow us...

1389
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,670
to eat malatang now.

1390
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:55,769
(No Eating Food with Mala Sauce)

1391
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,269
"Only YOUNITE members are allowed."

1392
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,669
(Let's keep winning until we can eat food here.)

1393
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,769
Until that day.

1394
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,308
Round One has ended.

1395
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:03,379
- Yes. - Great work, everyone.

1396
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,879
- Great work. - Great work.

1397
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,249
(You guys did great.)

1398
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,679
From the intro,

1399
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,349
EUNSANG set the tone so well.

1400
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,989
They had to be immersed in the show.

1401
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:13,749
(Laughing)

1402
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,089
But our ranking went too high up.

1403
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,460
Our goal was to go one ranking up.

1404
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,559
Fourth place.

1405
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,960
Our original goal was fourth place.

1406
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,999
(YOUNITE placed 2nd in both Team and Ace Rankings.)

1407
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,400
(Startled)

1408
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:29,098
(Flabbergasted by the unexpectedly high ranking)

1409
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,170
We did it.

1410
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:32,840
Our expected ranking was seventh.

1411
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,480
We started from seventh place.

1412
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,809
Second place is more than enough.

1413
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,409
We just have to avoid going down now.

1414
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:39,649
We should work so hard for the next performance.

1415
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,649
We really should work hard for Round Two.

1416
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,179
Even harder than in Round One.

1417
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,988
We only have one ranking above us.

1418
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:46,089
- Just one. - Just one.

1419
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,259
- We're in trouble. - Originally,

1420
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,419
- I wasn't under any pressure. - Right.

1421
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,829
Now that we've placed second,

1422
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,529
I'm eager.

1423
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,059
- Right? - You're right.

1424
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,699
The mission is Identity.

1425
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,069
The theme must be crucial.

1426
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,340
I personally think that it should be a bright song.

1427
01:05:04,469 --> 01:05:07,639
YOUNITE's identity actually is a bright song.

1428
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:10,479
Most of our songs are cheerful.

1429
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,480
You're right.

1430
01:05:11,481 --> 01:05:13,250
(YOUNITE has been known as the fresh idol band.)

1431
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:16,948
Our main objective was to leave an impression on people.

1432
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:18,249
We came here with the goal...

1433
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,649
of letting people know about us.

1434
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,118
But I am worried that changing our course...

1435
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,288
might be too unimpressive...

1436
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:25,659
in a competition.

1437
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:28,860
But I have a feeling that this is our last chance.

1438
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:30,999
If we keep going with intense themes,

1439
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,099
we might regret it later on.

1440
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:34,768
People will remember us...

1441
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,969
if we can impress them with various themes.

1442
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,239
I don't think it's a bad idea to try a cheerful song now.

1443
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,880
We could surprise them.

1444
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:44,480
I'm sure our fans also want to see us performing a fresh song.

1445
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,550
All right.

1446
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:47,880
I think we have the team's theme.

1447
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:49,320
We need to choose a good song too.

1448
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:51,090
"1 of 9."

1449
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:54,090
- A cute song. - It's a little too cute.

1450
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,988
"Love It" might seem...

1451
01:05:56,989 --> 01:05:58,789
- too light. - Right.

1452
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,030
"WATERFALL?"

1453
01:06:00,031 --> 01:06:01,299
("WATERFALL" is a song with a cheerful melody...)

1454
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,800
(and freshness.)

1455
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,399
Other cheerful songs...

1456
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,039
consist too much of cute moves.

1457
01:06:08,139 --> 01:06:09,300
I like "WATERFALL."

1458
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,569
It'd be perfect.

1459
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,940
To be able to enjoy it...

1460
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:16,578
and have fun on the stage...

1461
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:18,280
We chose "WATERFALL."

1462
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:20,109
("WATERFALL" by YOUNITE is a title track...)

1463
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,419
(from its 4th mini-album that shines with refreshing sounds,)

1464
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,819
(likening the purity of youth to the ocean.)

1465
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,119
(It's a summer-themed song.)

1466
01:06:24,389 --> 01:06:26,348
In the last dance break of "WATERFALL,"

1467
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,788
we could run and use fireworks.

1468
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:31,558
I'd like to produce it to look like a fancy party.

1469
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,090
Like a festival.

1470
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:35,928
A song that can get them excited and jump.

1471
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:38,130
Our own Waterbomb Festival?

1472
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,299
I think we'll be at a disadvantage...

1473
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,669
if it's fresh from start to finish.

1474
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,269
We could start with a touching narrative...

1475
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,968
and make it cheerful in the end...

1476
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,610
to leave a good impression.

1477
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,109
We could divide it...

1478
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,880
into different parts for that plot twist.

1479
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:55,250
WOONO and EUNSANG will be at the center.

1480
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:57,150
Let's build a story just for YOUNITE.

1481
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,349
YOUNITE Kingdom.

1482
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:03,859
I'd like to come up with a new move for this part.

1483
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,658
It seems too common.

1484
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:07,558
- A new idea just for us? - Yes.

1485
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:08,729
(How about this?)

1486
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,759
Okay.

1487
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,268
(Or how about a kiss from the man behind you?)

1488
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:13,170
What do you think about making it funny?

1489
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,070
We could make funny faces and shake.

1490
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,010
We could make funny faces and shake.

1491
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:19,368
I genuinely think it's not so bad.

1492
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,439
- Right? - Really.

1493
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,010
We need to keep entertaining the audience.

1494
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,179
We'll think about it.

1495
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,349
So that the audience can feel the energy too.

1496
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,618
We kept communicating...

1497
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:32,019
to come up with new ideas.

1498
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,549
It doesn't have to be full power.

1499
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,159
Just keep the vibe in mind.

1500
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:37,488
No, it has to be full power. I'm going full power.

1501
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:38,789
(You always practice as if it's the actual performance.)

1502
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,900
It's not just cheerful, in fact.

1503
01:07:44,469 --> 01:07:46,670
There's a process of wandering to find each other.

1504
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,969
And we meet at the end and have a party.

1505
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,368
We want them to see...

1506
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,070
what hardships we overcame to gather again.

1507
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,279
We want them to be moved by that story...

1508
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,849
and be overwhelmed.

1509
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,750
This performance can be enjoyed by everyone...

1510
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:04,690
only if the fans can relate to it.

1511
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:08,320
I want to help them identify with it.

1512
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:11,090
Let's go!

1513
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:12,329
Splash!

1514
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,299
We'll bring you joy and inspiration...

1515
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,899
with our unique authenticity.

1516
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,640
- Welcome to the YOUNITE Kingdom! - Welcome to the YOUNITE Kingdom!

1517
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:23,269
Are you ready to fall for us?

1518
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,438
Yes!

1519
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:25,639
(Let's check out their "WATERFALL...")

1520
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,810
(with freshness mixed in their story.)

1521
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,850
Team YOUNITE.

1522
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,560
Let's go!

1523
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:45,760
A fresh song.

1524
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,189
I'm so curious.

1525
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,329
What will it be this time?

1526
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,130
It's starting.

1527
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:58,608
("WATERFALL" by YOUNITE)

1528
01:08:58,609 --> 01:08:59,639
(A performance that depicts the story of EUNSANG...)

1529
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,640
(rising again with WOONO's help after a period of despair,)

1530
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:01,679
(as they journey toward new dreams together...)

1531
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,680
(with YOUNITE like a musical)

1532
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,810
It does look like a musical.

1533
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,890
- What? They took it away. - What's happening?

1534
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:17,288
They took his microphone.

1535
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:18,689
They have such good stories.

1536
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:27,229
He fell into the water.

1537
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,079
He can't breathe right now.

1538
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,479
He's such a good actor.

1539
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,619
- What? - What?

1540
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,460
- He's gone. - He sank.

1541
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,369
It's actually like the story of YOUNITE.

1542
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,220
They're underwater.

1543
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:42,109
The moves are linear.

1544
01:10:50,003 --> 01:10:51,989
- They're drifting away. - This is saddening.

1545
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,800
- Welcome to the YOUNITE Kingdom. - Welcome to the YOUNITE Kingdom.

1546
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,039
YOUNITE Kingdom!

1547
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,569
Part Two is beginning.

1548
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:15,579
(HYUNGSEOK)

1549
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,920
That's so cute.

1550
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,229
I love that type of stuff.

1551
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:33,529
This is a musical!

1552
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:50,140
He changed into a white outfit too.

1553
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,880
It's like a fairy tale.

1554
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,960
Wait. There's more?

1555
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:17,839
Skipping rope!

1556
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,439
- Right. - That's cute.

1557
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:30,249
Yes, I like cheerful songs.

1558
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,350
It suits them so well.

1559
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,800
(STEVE, HYUNGSEOK)

1560
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:01,149
How high is he going?

1561
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:21,100
I didn't know you could do this type of performance in a competition.

1562
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,479
I wish I could join them.

1563
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,619
No. Don't even.

1564
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:45,989
Make some noise!

1565
01:13:51,729 --> 01:13:52,770
Thank you!

1566
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,439
He got his microphone back!

1567
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,539
(YOUNITE's ace, EUNSANG)

1568
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,079
(YOUNITE's ace, WOONO)

1569
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,938
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1570
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,510
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

1571
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,478
(You can find "WATERFALL" by YOUNITE...)

1572
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:09,449
(on music streaming services right now.)

1573
01:14:11,194 --> 01:14:12,464
(Admiring)

1574
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,519
I like a performance in which they're smiling.

1575
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,520
That was lovely.

1576
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:18,288
- It was like an air purifier. - Absolutely.

1577
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:20,828
It's the opposite theme from last time.

1578
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:23,028
- Right. It was so cheerful. - It was.

1579
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:24,029
It's completely different.

1580
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,130
I couldn't help but smile the whole time.

1581
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:27,899
I really enjoyed it.

1582
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,039
The mission was Identity,

1583
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:33,710
and a fresh song was YOUNITE's perfect theme.

1584
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:36,278
They made us realize that...

1585
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,479
by adding musical elements.

1586
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:41,919
- Well done, guys. - Great job.

1587
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,349
(The members finished the festival-like performance.)

1588
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,720
I have no regrets. I enjoyed it so much.

1589
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,189
Well done.

1590
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:48,658
You guys looked so happy too.

1591
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:50,319
(They're still proud of it.)

1592
01:14:50,859 --> 01:14:51,889
Was it WOONO?

1593
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,489
I keep picturing his face.

1594
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:56,329
- He was so handsome. - He really was.

1595
01:14:56,529 --> 01:14:59,069
- The face of an ace. - The face of an ace.

1596
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:01,399
I've become WOONO's fan now.

1597
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
- What's the reason? - His face.

1598
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:06,210
It was mostly jovial and relaxing,

1599
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:10,039
but it felt a bit loose for a competition.

1600
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:14,148
A fresh vibe does suit them,

1601
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:17,649
but they did such intense performances in Round One.

1602
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:21,288
It's like how you can't taste anything after eating salty food.

1603
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,289
Right.

1604
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:25,460
It looked pretty, but it didn't live up to my expectations.

1605
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:31,100
The 5th team of Round 2 is The CrewOne.

1606
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,100
(We've been waiting!)

1607
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:35,139
(The CrewOne)

1608
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,369
They're also in danger.

1609
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,339
They might be eliminated.

1610
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,470
They placed six in both.

1611
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,909
- Aren't they in the bottom four? - They keep placing low.

1612
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,340
They've been in sixth place the whole time.

1613
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:46,250
But I am surprised that they're in the bottom four...

1614
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:48,720
because they're so skilled.

1615
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:51,688
I'm sure they're deliberating whether they're doing...

1616
01:15:51,689 --> 01:15:53,318
- the right thing or not. - Right.

1617
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:56,889
Guys, let's empty our minds and focus on it.

1618
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,459
- Okay. - Let's do this.

1619
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,988
We make it happy, and boom! Okay?

1620
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,260
- Okay. - Okay.

1621
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:04,100
- Let's do this, guys. - The CrewOne!

1622
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:06,029
- Energy! - Energy!

1623
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:09,269
Go, The CrewOne!

1624
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,270
Go!

1625
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,569
Let's go!

1626
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:15,979
(What's their performance like on the brink of elimination?)

1627
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,380
Jimin!

1628
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,719
The ace duo that we've all feared...

1629
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,749
- is here. - I know.

1630
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,519
The two good dancers are...

1631
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,689
Junseok and Jimin?

1632
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,229
Team The CrewOne.

1633
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,550
- What? - That's real magic.

1634
01:17:05,048 --> 01:17:07,654
(To be continued shortly)

1635
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,059
(The official supporting race, R.ACE)

1636
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,898
(A race for your ace!)

1637
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:18,970
(Boost your aces.)

1638
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:20,539
(Round 2, Identity, continues.)

1639
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,139
(The CrewOne, TEMPEST,)

1640
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,140
(and ONEUS)

1641
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:24,380
(Their performances begin now.)

1642
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:26,250
Let's go!

1643
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,819
(Doubting his eyes)

1644
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,489
(You can't take your eyes off The CrewOne's magical show.)

1645
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,719
(It's a wizard school!)

1646
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,720
(Turning into a wizard)

1647
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,960
(A fantasy fairy tale portrayed by TEMPEST)

1648
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,229
(Drawn in)

1649
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:41,829
(Isn't this "Road to Musical" at this point?)

1650
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:44,060
(His fantastic looks are a bonus.)

1651
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,369
(Stop attacking us with your looks!)

1652
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,470
(You can't flirt with us here.)

1653
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:49,300
(Intensity on another level)

1654
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:51,710
(ONEUS's powerful performance)

1655
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,239
(They killed it!)

1656
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,478
(That was amazing.)

1657
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:57,209
(This mission is the toughest ever to guess the winner.)

1658
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,408
(The fact that there will be...)

1659
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:00,078
(the first elimination today is...)

1660
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:01,109
(It's because elimination is on the line.)

1661
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,720
(I don't want to go home.)

1662
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,389
(The inevitable...)

1663
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,020
(announcement)

1664
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,119
(Please.)

1665
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,589
(I want to avoid it.)

1666
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:15,129
(The 7th-place team in Team Ranking...)

1667
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,759
(and the 7th-place team in Ace Ranking will be...)

1668
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,869
(the two elimination candidates.)

1669
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:21,199
(Please don't be last.)

1670
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,698
(I don't want to be eliminated.)

1671
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:23,840
(I mean it.)

1672
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:27,569
(Which team will be the first one to be eliminated on the show?)

1673
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,210
(We desperately prepared for this performance.)
