(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,339
(Round 1, VS Mission with the on-site judges)

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,700
(Round 1, VS Mission)

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,909
(Competing with songs by the same boy band...)

13
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,210
(This is a matter of pride.)

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,779
(As always, we will win again this time.)

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,750
(They have an intense war of nerves from the start.)

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,450
(That really made me mad.)

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,479
(Smiling)

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,880
(They're fighting.)

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,549
(Bring some popcorn!)

20
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,789
(The battle to become an ace team begins in earnest.)

21
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,059
- They overlap a lot. - This is truly a VS match.

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,519
(A limitless performance battle with 20,000 points on the line.)

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,159
(We will now begin the VS voting.)

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,229
- Three, two, one. - It's revealed right away?

25
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,929
(Which team will win in the VS Mission after a fierce match?)

26

28
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,109
(What stronger rulers are there?)

29
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,179
(2 Track, Team Ranking and Ace Ranking)

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,408
It's not good enough for just your team to do well.

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,549
We have double the things we need to watch.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,348
(Evaluation Match Round 1, Ace Battle, begins!)

33
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,479
(An unforgiving battle between the 7 aces)

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,290
(Which team will get 1st place?)

35
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,488
(The 1st place team of the Ace Battle!)

36
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,919
(1st place, ONEUS, HWAN WOONG)

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,688
I was very happy that my talent was acknowledged.

38
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,029
The fact that CRAVITY wasn't one of the candidates...

39
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,230
It's so surprising.

40
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,829
(7th place, CRAVITY, HYEONGJUN)

41
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,828
(The 7th place team of the Ace Battle...)

42
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,139
(cannot join Round 2, the Team Battle)

43
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,369
I can't accept that we got seventh place.

44
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,840
It makes me so angry.

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,179
(In Round 2, Team Battle, 5th place, YOUNITE)

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,679

(2nd place, TEMPEST)

49
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,619
(Which team got the honor of winning the Team Battle?)

50
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,949
I think 8TURN will get first place.

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,449
I was surprised when I saw The CrewOne.

52
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,089
Their performances went beyond my expectations.

53
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,358
I really have no idea.

54
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,819
I really don't know.

55
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,090
(Which team won the Team Battle and surprised everyone?)

56
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,429
(The revolt of the youngest team!)

57
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,069
(8TURN won the Team Battle of the Evaluation Match.)

58
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,369
I got a bit teary.

59
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,399
Maybe it was because we never won first place since we debuted.

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,968
They really came prepared.

61
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,508
"YOUNITE has a lot of energy."

62
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,638
I think it gave us a chance to show people that.

63
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,539
They really motivated me.

64
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,710
Getting a high ranking from Round One.

65
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,079
(Who will win the intense performance battle...)

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,219

(The day Round 1 takes place)

70
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,400
(Door opening)

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,529
Let's go!

72
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,568
Okay. It's time.

73
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,668
(Today's stars head into their waiting rooms.)

74
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,668
- Bring up the energy. - Bring it up.

75
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,109
(Today's stars head into their waiting rooms.)

76
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,679
- The day is here. - The day.

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,780
Round One is when our scores...

78
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,149
actually start to count.

79
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,508
- Right. It's starting now. - Right.

80
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,049
We'll have an audience on set.

81
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,779
We have to do well. We can do it!

82
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,750
- Let's go. - Let's go.

83
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,989
Since there will be an audience to watch us live,

84
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,658
we need to get all of them on our side.

85
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,330
We need to get their votes.

86
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,399
(Their first performance as The CrewOne, )

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,060
(an alliance team between JUST B and ATBO)

88
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,500
(The CrewOne ranked 6th in the Evaluation Match Team Battle.)

89
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,568
I think getting such a low ranking...

90
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,769
made us prepare with even more desperation, right?

91
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,068
- Right. - I think this round...

92
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,408
will be a very important stage for us.

93
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,879
A chance to turn things around.

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,109
I really couldn't sleep yesterday.

95
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,019
- I couldn't sleep well either. - Me neither.

96
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,348
I'm curious what they're imagining our performance will be like.

97
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,849
It's our first performance in front of the artists as well.

98
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,188
(The results of the Evaluation Match Ace Battle...)

99
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,330
(left everyone in shock.)

100
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,628
(Because Ace HYEONGJUN experienced a bitter loss, )

101
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,099
(CRAVITY didn't get to perform for the Team Battle.)

102
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,568
We'll make everyone scared.

103
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,098
We just have to do what we normally do.

104
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,769
We just have to show them everything we prepared.

105
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,309
A competitive fire is burning up inside of me.

106
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,739
- That's good. - Nice.

107
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,878
Oh, no.

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,008
My body feels restless.

109
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,679
Let's really do this.

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,709
Let's do it.

111
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,250
(Let's go, CRAVITY!)

112
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,279
We won first place in the Evaluation Match,

113
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,990
but the scores don't count for anything.

114
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,490
(With the vigor and energy of newcomers, )

115
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,728
(8TURN got 1st place in the Evaluation Match...)

116
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,000
(and showed everyone their power as the youngest team.)

117
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,670
We won't be humble today.

118
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,898
It's coolest to win while being humble.

119
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,499
- Right. - Right. I like that.

120
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,040
Let's crush them politely.

121
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,169
(The youngsters are bursting with energy as usual.)

122
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,438
We need to show them today.

123
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,479
I'm not worried.

124
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,878
I think I'll feel so stressed if we lose.

125
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,309
(The leader blurts out his honest feeling.)

126
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,479
If we lose, I don't think I can go back home.

127
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,550
If we lose...

128
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,250
If we lose...

129
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,920
If we lose, you should ride the subway looking like this.

130
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,519
All the way back home.

131
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,060
Ride back on the subway exactly in this outfit.

132
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,160
I already feel dizzy.

133
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,029
I really came to win.

134
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,269
(He was full of anger because of the Evaluation Match.)

135
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,439
If we don't win, I'm really not going back home today.

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,698
Let's bite them by taking over the room.

137
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,638
- Rawr. - We need to say, "Rawr."

138
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,410
(Rawr! Like this!)

139
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,278
Let's do well. Let's have fun.

140
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,279
Let's go, ONEUS.

141
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,610
(ONEUS prepare their minds with a cheer.)

142
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,449
(All 7 teams are ready for Round 1.)

143
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,620
(Round 1 will be held in front of on-site judges.)

144
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,989
(Three hundred on-site judges...)

145
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,660
(fill up the studio.)

146
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,159
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

147
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,300
(They're ready to cheer for the 7 teams.)

148
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,599
(Very excited to meet the on-site judges)

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,469
They're here.

150
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,638
There are so many people.

151
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,698
- I'm nervous. - It's starting.

152
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,670
They'll hear our singing for the first time.

153
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,339
This will be fun.

154
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,679
(Among the passionate cheers...)

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,449
(of the on-site judges)

156
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,290
(The MC of Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace appears.)

157
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,528
(Exclaiming)

158
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,429
Our shining light is here.

159
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,199
He's so cool.

160
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,568
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

161
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,769
Hello. I'm MC TAEMIN.

162
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,708
(Excitedly cheering for MC TAEMIN)

163
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,609
Following the Evaluation Match, during which the teams got a look...

164
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,739
into each others' strategies,

165
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,639
it's finally time for Round One,

166
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,680
the real beginning of this competition.

167
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,648
The time has come.

168
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,149
I'm suddenly getting nervous.

169
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,648
Road to Kingdom's final winner will be determined as follows.

170
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,920
A pre-match score of 100,000 points.

171
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,290
A live broadcast score of 100,000 points.

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,329
These scores will be combined for a total of 200,000 points.

173
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,029
The team ranking, ace ranking,

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,028
and the cumulative view score will be totaled...

175
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,170
for a pre-match score of 100,000 points.

176
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,369
The new song score of 30,000 points...

177
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,069
for the new songs released prior to the final round...

178
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,438
and the live broadcast vote score of 70,000 points...

179
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,679
for the vote that will be held...

180
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,879
during the live broadcast will be totaled...

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,279
to determine the final winner.

182
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,720
Are you curious about what mission the teams have for Round One?

183
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,789
- Yes! - Yes!

184
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,949
Here is Round One's mission.

185
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,958
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

186
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,589
The Evaluation Match is over.

187
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,189
- Good work. - Good work.

188
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,660
- Good work. - Good work.

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,370
Now, the real battle to become the final winner will begin.

190
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,839
Round One, the start of the real competition.

191
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,639
This is what I'm most curious about!

192
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,910
The mission for Round One...

193
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,438
(What mission will they be given...)

194
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,439
Calm down.

195
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,779
(to start off the real competition?)

196
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,240
It's VS.

197
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:21,910
- What? - What?

198
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,019
- What? - What?

199
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,849
We're going to fight against each other.

200
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,050
It's 1-on-1.

201
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,619
But there are seven teams.

202
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,089
Maybe the first place gets to win by default.

203
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,388
But they have to calculate the cumulative score.

204
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,589
Right.

205
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,299
- What is that? - That scared me.

206
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,800
- What is that? - What is that?

207
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,028
Three teams are fighting each other.

208
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,699
Three teams are fighting each other?

209
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,970
Here, we have the top five...

210
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,469
K-pop boy groups that sold...

211
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,540
over 1 million albums in 2023.

212
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,709
Stray Kids Match.

213
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,750
ENHYPEN Match.

214
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:57,649
NCT.

215
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,279
THE BOYZ.

216
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,750
TOMORROW X TOGETHER Match.

217
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,920
The time has come.

218
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,660
Which team should we pick?

219
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,388
I was feeling very competitive.

220
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,930
We're sixth place? Come at us.

221
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,100
I was burning with a desire to win.

222
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,129
No matter who we battle, I think we can win.

223
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,969
For Round One's VS Mission,

224
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,839
the team ranking score of 10,000 points...

225
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,669
and the ace ranking score of 10,000 points...

226
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,439
will be combined for a total of 20,000 points.

227
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,009
The teams that win their VS Match...

228
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,509
will get 1,000 benefit points.

229
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,809
(A strong benefit)

230
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,649
- It's 1,000 points. - It's 1,000 points. That's big.

231
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,548
I think those 1,000 points could change the ranking.

232
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,319
The real game starts now.

233
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,389
We really need to win now.

234
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,220
Who you go against is very important.

235
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,990
I really don't know what to choose.

236
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,659
We need to be really smart about this.

237
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,999
I'm sure everyone will avoid the three-team match.

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,129
Because with the 3-team match, you need to compete with 2 teams.

239
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,298
Right. With 3 teams battling, only 1 team...

240
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,299
They'll get the benefit points.

241
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,409
Then there'll be one more team to compete against.

242
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,038
Our top three choices...

243
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,179
They're all in the bottom row.

244
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,808
I don't know what to do.

245
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,950
(The triple match will influence each team's decision.)

246
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,609
The team who got first place...

247
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,918
in the Evaluation Match Team Battle...

248
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,649
will make their selection for Round One's VS Match first.

249
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,250
It's so cruel.

250
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,889
What a mix of joy and despair.

251
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm glad we got third place.

252
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,859
This will be fun.

253
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,960
(The 1st place team)

254
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,898
(They'll choose in order...)

255
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,500
(of the Evaluation Match Team Battle ranking.)

256
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,028
(What will 8TURN choose?)

257
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,500
The ease of the first place.

258
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,609
Which group could we cover the best?

259
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,139
He's looking at the bottom.

260
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,639
I think he'll choose NCT.

261
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,080
- Really? - Really?

262
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,350
Oh, my!

263
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,289
I made my decision.

264
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,250
Really?

265
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,490
I didn't expect that.

266
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,459
(Satisfied)

267
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,928
I thought it would be helpful...

268
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,729
to use our energy once again, which was our most helpful weapon...

269
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,829
during the Evaluation Match.

270
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,399
That's why we chose ENHYPEN.

271
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,470
Next, please come up, LEW, the leader of TEMPEST.

272
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,309
I think NCT would be good too.

273
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,709
I like NCT.

274
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,450
- Or among ENHYPEN's songs... - I'm sure there are many options.

275
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,980
We made our decision.

276
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,178
So bold!

277
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,389
I think they'll choose ENHYPEN.

278
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,850
Come on.

279
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,419
- Really? - I think so.

280
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,789
- What? - Really?

281
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,559
This is exactly what I thought. "This will be fun."

282
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,628
(TEMPEST chose the Stray Kids Match.)

283
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,970
We thought we should showcase each of our charms.

284
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,500
Next, please come up, HWAN WOONG, the leader of ONEUS.

285
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,599
(Ace Battle 1st place, Team Battle 3rd place)

286
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,740
(ONEUS got high rankings in the Evaluation Match.)

287
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,710
I have no idea what they'll choose.

288
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,509
I'm scared.

289
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,409
(Laughing)

290
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,678
(Getting up)

291
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,278
(Surprised)

292
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,649
I don't think this is it, don't you agree?

293
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,918
(Playing with TEMPEST members' hearts)

294
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,950
Hold on.

295
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,989
(Gasping)

296
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,190
I think that's even worse.

297
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,889
I don't think this is it either.

298
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,189
You're correct.

299
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,000
He's so good at playing with us.

300
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,659
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

301
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:03,200
Yes. ONEUS has made a decision.

302
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,538
(Clapping)

303
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,908
(ONEUS is the first team to choose the feared triple match.)

304
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,439
NCT has many songs,

305
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,508
and they span many genres.

306
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,210
Giving a good performance was our first priority.

307
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,419
(Currently, each match has been chosen by one team.)

308
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,190
Next, please come up, TAEHUN, the leader of THE NEW SIX.

309
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,919
Will he choose Stray Kids?

310
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,859
They'll definitely choose ENHYPEN.

311
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,029
- Listen carefully. - Please choose TXT.

312
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm basically choosing our opponent.

313
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,769
This is very interesting.

314
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,269
Who do you want to battle?

315
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,740
Will you be bold and choose a 1-on-1 match?

316
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,909
We did consider a 1-on-1 match.

317
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,439
(8TURN is in the ENHYPEN Match.)

318
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Let's go.

319
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,079
(Who will be THE NEW SIX's Round 1 opponent?)

320
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,110
We...

321
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
- What? - What?

322
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,519
Let's go!

323
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,658
(Let's go!)

324
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,459
We choose the 1-on-1 match against the team...

325
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,690
who debuted around the same time as us.

326
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,028
(Stray Kids Match, THE NEW SIX versus TEMPEST)

327
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,129
Let's do this.

328
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,359
Why are we always so close to THE NEW SIX?

329
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,729
We've always been together.

330
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,870
We competed for the rookie award.

331
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,168
We debuted almost at the same time.

332
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:12,500
(TEMPEST debuted on March 2, 2022.)

333
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,268
(THE NEW SIX debuted on May 17, 2022.)

334
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,340
We competed a lot for awards.

335
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
(However!)

336
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,308
Until now,

337
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,779
I think we were always lower than TEMPEST.

338
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,049
We were lower than them.

339
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,619
I think it's time for us to show that we're better...

340
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,360
at strong performances.

341
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,429
We can win again this time too.

342
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,758
Yes, go ahead.

343
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,089
(Pure)

344
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,559
I welcome them with that mindset.

345
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,669
Well...

346
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,069
I've made a decision.

347
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,440
(YOUNITE will battle 8TURN)

348
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,869
Yes. We'll do our best.

349
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,909
(The CrewOne chose THE BOYZ of the triple match.)

350
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,808
(CRAVITY, who had no choice after getting 7th...)

351
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:53,110
(in the Evaluation Match, will be in the triple match.)

352
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,580
The Stray Kids Match. THE NEW SIX versus TEMPEST.

353
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,080
The ENHYPEN Match. 8TURN versus YOUNITE.

354
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,450
NCT, ONEUS. THE BOYZ, The CrewOne.

355
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,960
TOMORROW X TOGETHER, CRAVITY. The matches have been set.

356
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,859
Round One will take place...

357
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,200
in front of 300 on-site judges.

358
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,029
Both rankings for Round One will be calculated as follows.

359
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,200
Self-Evaluation, 30 percent.

360
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,569
On-site Judge Evaluation, 70 percent.

361
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,009
The two scores will be totaled.

362
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,939
At the end of each match,

363
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,210
you can vote to decide which team will earn the benefit points.

364
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,449
After watching all seven performances,

365
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,119
you can choose the three aces...

366
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,750
and the three teams who gave the best performances.

367
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,090
In the end, the best team will win everything.

368
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,460
- You're right. - We must get first place.

369
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,758
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace's.

370
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,600
Round One, VS Mission will begin now.

371
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,070
- It's starting. - Okay!

372
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,909
- Let's go! - Let's go.

373
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,009
Let's go!

374
00:13:58,779 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm going crazy!

375
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,148
Let's go!

376
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,110
- Let's go. - Let's go.

377
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,548
Instead of just winning,

378
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,419
we need to win by a landslide and get the most votes.

379
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,320
We need to get high scores in every category.

380
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,620
We didn't put in all that work for nothing, so let's show them.

381
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,360
There's only victory or death.

382
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,029
This is the real beginning of the competition.

383
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,360
Round One, VS Mission.

384
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,169
The Stray Kids Match.

385
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:24,500
(THE NEW SIX versus TEMPEST)

386
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,179
Let's go!

387
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,750
- Yes. Our debut buddies. - Six versus six.

388
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,979
Their outfits are kind of similar.

389
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,350
I think they have similar themes.

390
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,149
It's a close match.

391
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,319
Let us introduce ourselves. Two, three.

392
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,018
- Hello, we're THE NEW SIX. - Hello, we're THE NEW SIX.

393
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,019
Hello.

394
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,259
(HWI)

395
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,259
(THE NEW SIX)

396
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,558
- It's We! Hello. - It's We! Hello.

397
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,730
- We're TEMPEST. - We're TEMPEST.

398
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,029
(The audience is competing to cheer harder for their team.)

399
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,070
Each team has one member with bleached hair.

400
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,840
- How intense. - They must be the aces.

401
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,469
THE NEW SIX chose to battle...

402
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,408
the team that debuted in the same year as them.

403
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:05,939
- Yes. - Was it...

404
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,808
because you thought you could beat them...

405
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,548
Did you choose Stray Kids...

406
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,320
because you thought you could beat them?

407
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,979
First, from the Evaluation Match,

408
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,189
we saw that our theme was very different from TEMPEST's.

409
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,989
Also, since we debuted in the same year,

410
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,889
we thought it would be an interesting match.

411
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,388
(Smiling)

412
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,659
This is a matter of pride.

413
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,629
I'm also looking forward to this match a lot.

414
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,229
Since we debuted, we had to compete...

415
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,440
against THE NEW SIX a lot.

416
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,639
As always, we will win again this time.

417
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,778
(As always?)

418
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,609
(Okay...)

419
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,579
(Crowd stirring)

420
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,750
As always.

421
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,980
Again this time.

422
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,450
TEMPEST is better than THE NEW SIX.

423
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,759
I think THE NEW SIX got a bit angry there.

424
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,129
That really made me mad.

425
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,789
I mean,

426
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,100
he wasn't wrong.

427
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,000
That made me so sad, first of all.

428
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,870
We really can't lose this time.

429
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,769
I really just want to win.

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
No matter what happens.

431
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,638
(THE NEW SIX's strategy meeting day after the Evaluation Match)

432
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,609
We got fourth in the Self-Evaluation expected ranking.

433
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,450
- We got 4th as a team. - And 4th in the Ace Ranking.

434
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,649
We need to get out of this.

435
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,950
Why does it have to be four?

436
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,849
(Because CEO PSY's name sounds like 4...)

437
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,190
Because CEO PSY's name sounds like four...

438
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,888
(Not sure how to react that his sudden joke)

439
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,460
Then we need to get second once.

440
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,788
We need to get second once to complete...

441
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:29,889
- the 4, 2. - The 4, 2.

442
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,729
I want to take a look at our Evaluation Match ranking.

443
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,898
Our ranking?

444
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:34,899
Oh, my.

445
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,500
It has the Streaming Evaluation, Final Evaluation, and everything.

446
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,768
TEMPEST ranked higher in the Streaming Evaluation.

447
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:40,769
Right.

448
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,538
We ranked high in the Self-Evaluation.

449
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,908
But we were ranked last in the Streaming Evaluation.

450
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:45,980
- We were ranked last there. - Gosh, we were ranked last?

451
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,309
The fact that we were ranked last on the Streaming Evaluation...

452
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,378
- is quite shocking indeed. - Right?

453
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,879
But we were ranked again from the preliminary vote.

454
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,450
We hit rock bottom twice.

455
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,289
It means that we're the least popular group.

456
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,219
In my opinion, we should execute a performance...

457
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,658
that the viewers would like.

458
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,259
- We must win over the viewers. - Right.

459
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,500
The song selection will be quite important.

460
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,259
Let's listen to the song first.

461
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,999
Let's go with the most recent song. "Chk Chk Boom."

462
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,169
- "Chk Chk Boom?" - "Chk Chk Boom?"

463
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,970
Chang Bin's part is pretty tough.

464
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,240
(Chang Bin's skillful rapping stands out in the song.)

465
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,339
(The hardest rap ever)

466
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:17,509
(Rolling his tongue)

467
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,709
(The highlight of the song is difficult to pull off.)

468
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,739
I can't do it.

469
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,808
(Warming up his tongue for it is an absolute must.)

470
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,909
Or how about their debut song? "Hellevator?"

471
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,579
- Gosh, "Hellevator." - "Hellevator."

472
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,419
(It's the debut song of Stray Kids...)

473
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,950
(with intense high notes in the chorus.)

474
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,358
It's really high.

475
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,789
Can you hit the notes?

476
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,259
(Show us, main vocalist.)

477
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,298
(Gosh, he's pretty good.)

478
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,700
Then does JUNHYEOK have to sing everything by himself?

479
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,568
- Right? Almost the entire song. - Gosh. That's not cool then.

480
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,569
(As he may have to sing everything, they decide to forgo it.)

481
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:47,400
(THE NEW SIX is having a hard time picking a song.)

482
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,839
(Actually, I do have something in mind.)

483
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,949
This song is in the first album of Stray Kids.

484
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,950
- Really? - Their first album?

485
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,980
- "God's Menu?" - Right. That's the album.

486
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,818
- It's called "Phobia." - Oh, I see.

487
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,389
(Surprised)

488
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,420
"Phobia?"

489
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,859
- Let's listen to it. - It's my first time hearing it.

490
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,858
("Phobia" is included in the 1st album of Stray Kids.)

491
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,499
It's a masterpiece a lot of people don't know about.

492
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,099
But once they hear it, they love it.

493
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,929
(As it's just listed in the album, it's not as well-known.)

494
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,130
The song is quite touching in an interesting way.

495
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,439
- I like it. - Hey, this is a great song.

496
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,470
This is a masterpiece everyone ought to know about.

497
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,170
But...

498
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,380
We do have to make a wise decision.

499
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,309
Right. We were ranked last twice.

500
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,680
Seriously. It will be hit-or-miss.

501
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,318
It will be hit-or-miss.

502
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,489
In my opinion,

503
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,519
I see a higher possibility of it being a hit. That's all.

504
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,889
- There's no choreography for this. - Right. That's true.

505
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,990
- Yes. - There's no choreography.

506
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,160
- There's no music video either. - Right. It's just a B-side track.

507
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,598
The viewers and the audience might think...

508
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,298
we're owning this performance.

509
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,599
That's true. There's no original performance to compare ours with.

510
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,268
- So that will be better? - Right.

511
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,538
That's why this will be more unpredictable.

512
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,210
So that might give us an edge and make it more competitive.

513
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,609
That's cool.

514
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,079
- We just have to kill it. - I agree.

515
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,410
- Let's grow a spine. - Okay.

516
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,348
Let's grow a spine and go with "Phobia."

517
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,379
- Okay. It's settled. - Okay.

518
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,720
- Okay. - So we're going with "Phobia?"

519
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,149
(The desire to be together and the butterflies of romance...)

520
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,518
(are portrayed as a phobia in the lyrics.)

521
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,789
(This popular melody stands out in the song.)

522
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,460
- I have a suggestion. - What is it?

523
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,028
HWI is the one who recommended this song.

524
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,429
We should focus on HWI's rapping for this performance.

525
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,669
I thought about asking him to be our ace for this one.

526
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,940
- I see. Right. - Yes.

527
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,669
- Grow a spine and be an ace. - Yes, I'll grow a spine.

528
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,380
I can tell he already has something in mind for this.

529
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,710
- This will be fun. - Yes.

530
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,549
I'll start writing down the lyrics for the bridge.

531
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,789
I want to kick off my verse with some hard-hitting rapping.

532
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,819
(He's working on the rap for the entire song.)

533
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,229
(He records the rap smoothly all on his own.)

534
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,430
"Phobia" is about fear.

535
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,528
"Don't let your fear drown you."

536
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,200
I wrote the lyrics as if KYUNGJUN and I were battling each other.

537
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,808
- All right. Let's start recording. - Okay. Let's get it.

538
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,739
(Another rapper, KYUNGJUN, starts recording the rap part.)

539
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,939
- Let's start. - Okay.

540
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,980
(HWI will direct the recording as he wrote the lyrics.)

541
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,079
(It's intense from the get-go.)

542
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,079
(Today is the last day, and this is it)

543
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:12,479
- Gosh. Nice. This one is good. - Hey.

544
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,048
Let's make it sound a bit rougher here.

545
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,690
- Okay. - It wasn't bad, though.

546
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:17,890
Let's try again.

547
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,318
(He restarts recording again with a rougher vibe.)

548
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,890
Try to go with the vibe I had in my guide track.

549
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,990
- Okay. - Try to sound indifferent. Okay?

550
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,329
(He records for the third time.)

551
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,930
You just need to raise your pitch a bit.

552
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,729
(As the picky director passionately gives him feedback...)

553
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,768
Like this.

554
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,439
Okay. Go with a lower pitch and try to sound more serious.

555
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
- Okay. - Okay.

556
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,939
When HWI directs...

557
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,108
the recording sessions with his songs or lyrics,

558
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,109
he tends to be a perfectionist.

559
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,910
(KYUNGJUN tries his best to the end.)

560
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,650
- I think we got it. - Okay.

561
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,849
That's why when we listened to the song, it came out really well.

562
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,119
I'm very happy with the result too.

563
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,390
Let's start the rehearsal for THE NEW SIX.

564
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,359
Let's keep going. The butterfly has to come in.

565
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,129
(A huge butterfly shows up in the studio.)

566
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,529
JUNHYEOK. Should we check the bed?

567
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,359
I think we should check the bed.

568
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,930
A lot of people don't know the song, "Phobia."

569
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,098
I thought we should make our performance more competitive...

570
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,970
with the stage directions and the scale of the performance.

571
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,139
We thought of ways...

572
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,009
to constantly stimulate the audience with our stage directions.

573
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,339
He totally has our trust.

574
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,950
Losing is worse than dying. We must make sure we win.

575
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,389
All right. Two, three.

576
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,390
- Let's go! - Let's go!

577
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,348
We're going first,

578
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,990
but we'll make the audience forget about the next performance.

579
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,230
We'll leave a strong impression on them with our performance.

580
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,229
- Let's go, THE NEW SIX! - Let's go!

581
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,099
(How will THE NEW SIX's version of "Phobia" turn out?)

582
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:53,619
(Eun HWI)

583
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,089
- They're starting. - They must be starting.

584
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,190
Let's watch.

585
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,690
("Phobia" by THE NEW SIX)

586
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,389
(In the performance, THE NEW SIX will fight against the illusion...)

587
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,859
(created by their fear and overcome it in the end.)

588
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,900
- He's lying. - What's going on?

589
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,069
- Is it a nightmare? - Yes, it's a nightmare.

590
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,150
- They're going up. - There they go.

591
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,079
- Gosh. They'll go up there? - Goodness.

592
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,559
It's a butterfly!

593
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,440
Gosh, the stage directions...

594
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,009
It's so original.

595
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,159
Okay, Ace.

596
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,099
- He must've created that part. - That's the part they created.

597
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,069
That was some serious rapping.

599
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,430
He wiped the stage.

600
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,869
- What was that? - It's a pair performance.

601
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,319
- What's going on? - Let's go!

602
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,630
- The shadows. - Right.

603
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,250
- Gosh. - What's going on?

604
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,079
Goodness, they pulled out all the stops.

605
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,890
- What's this? - Is that his dream?

606
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:24,359
Oh, my. I got the chills.

607
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,579
- This is crazy. - It's amazing.

608
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,440
- It's like they're stuck in there. - Gosh, is that the wave?

609
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,170
The stage direction is just on another level.

610
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,250
When did they do that?

611
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,389
- Unchain it. - Unchain it.

612
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,390
Break free!

613
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
This is really fierce.

614
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,480
- What? - What?

615
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,749
He wasn't human.

616
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,490
- What? When did they change it? - What? That's a staircase.

617
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,159
- What? - Where did the butterfly go?

618
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,190
What is this?

619
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,259
Goodness. This was phenomenal.

620
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,130
(THE NEW SIX's ace, HWI)

621
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:08,199
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

622
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,629
(You can find "Phobia" by THE NEW SIX on music streaming services...)

623
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,029
(from noon on September 27.)

624
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,940
- That was really cool. - It was amazing.

625
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:15,970
That was just crazy.

626
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,669
It really was magnificent.

627
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,608
Is it because I've never heard of this song before?

628
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,639
- It sounded like their own song. - It did. Right.

629
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,410
They did a great job executing the performance.

630
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,720
They did a great job. There was no choreography to this.

631
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,419
They were the first ones to go. And they went with a B-side track.

632
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,348
- This was such a cool challenge. - Gosh.

633
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,759
I have so much respect for them.

634
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,889
(They recreated the performance in their own style.)

635
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,960
Well done.

636
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,289
Seriously. You were amazing.

637
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,258
- You got my approval. - I'll be honest. I fell for you.

638
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:40,499
(Shy)

639
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,028
I don't think any performance can beat ours.

640
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,199
(Brimming with confidence)

641
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,098
(KYUNGJUN's confidence startles the members.)

642
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,338
Check out his confidence.

643
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,039
(Feeling utterly confident after crushing his rap part)

644
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,838
They started us off with a great performance.

645
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,139
- Right. - But...

646
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,409
if the groups before us do really well,

647
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,548
- the standards will be really high. - Yes.

648
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,778
(TEMPEST is nervous after watching THE NEW SIX's performance.)

649
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,749
Their idea was great.

650
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,189
I could see their determination...

651
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,619
to defeat us.

652
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,619
They showed us a confident performance.

653
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,359
So we must show them that we're also confident...

654
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,190
and battle it out.

655
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,558
(THE NEW SIX is on standby before the performance.)

656
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,630
Let's huddle.

657
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,229
- We can do this. - My heart is thumping like crazy.

658
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,669
- Let's have fun. - Yes.

659
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,768
Let's have a blast and not leave any regret.

660
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:22,808
- Okay. - Okay.

661
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,339
- One, two, three. Go, TEMPEST. - Go, TEMPEST.

662
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:25,639
Nice.

663
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,980
(What will TEMPEST perform to go up against THE NEW SIX?)

664
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,249
We have to perform one of Stray Kids' songs.

665
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,319
Yes.

666
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,048
They have a lot of great songs, so picking one will be hard.

667
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,149
Among their songs, we should...

668
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,518
consider the rankings.

669
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,559
THE NEW SIX was ranked first on the Self-Evaluation.

670
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,459
But we were ranked higher on the Streaming Evaluation.

671
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,399
(2nd place, TEMPEST)

672
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,129
(Overall, TEMPEST was ranked 2nd...)

673
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,829
(after getting placed 3rd on the Streaming Evaluation.)

674
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,699
Starting with Round One, we'll have on-site judges.

675
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,368
Wouldn't it be wise to become their favorite?

676
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,139
If we want to be the popular pick,

677
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,578
wouldn't it better to go with a well-known song?

678
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:02,778
- A song everyone knows. - Yes.

679
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,250
I thought of "God's Menu."

680
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,118
("God's Menu" established Stray Kids' identity as musicians.)

681
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,149
- That or "Back Door." - "Back Door."

682
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,349
("Back Door" showed Stray Kids' free-spirited energy.)

683
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,558
With Round One, we need to establish a solid foundation.

684
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,559
You're right.

685
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,629
"MANIAC?"

686
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,930
- "MANIAC." - I see.

687
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,200
("MANIAC", a mega-hit song with a super catchy chorus)

688
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,528
Leaving a strong impression with a fierce performance...

689
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,568
would be great.

690
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,338
I had the same thought.

691
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,669
With that song, we'll be able...

692
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,278
to show people our energy and our style of performance.

693
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,739
"TEMPEST can pull this off too."

694
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,209
"They have a wide range of performances."

695
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,679
That's the comment we're going for.

696
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,579
So we chose "MANIAC."

697
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,548
(A unique and catchy chorus stands out in the song.)

698
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,849
(This mega-hit song from the 6th album is globally well-known.)

699
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,019
Oh, right.

700
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,358
THE NEW SIX also did a cover...

701
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,689
- of "MANIAC." - Right.

702
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,089
- What? Really? - Come on.

703
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,828
(Watching THE NEW SIX's version of "MANIAC")

704
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,269
They did "MANIAC" of all songs.

705
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,399
(As their performance may be compared to their opposing group's, )

706
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,038
(they're more careful than ever.)

707
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,798
Our performance has to be better than that.

708
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,539
We'll beat them. We must.

709
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,469
Let's say we go with "MANIAC."

710
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,808
Then the low-pitched voice must stand out.

711
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:06,909
- Right. Totally. - The chorus.

712
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,279
- It starts off the chorus. - Yes.

713
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,710
(FELIX's unique low-pitched voice takes the spotlight in the chorus.)

714
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,679
The one who can execute the chorus should be the ace?

715
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,420
- Yes. - Right.

716
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,419
The ace member has to match well with the theme of the song.

717
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,659
TAERAE is already trying to show off his low-pitched voice.

718
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,929
(Laughing)

719
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,358
He's got the ambitious gaze.

720
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,659
He's already in the "MANIAC" mode.

721
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,298
"The song requires a low-pitched voice."

722
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,429
Then the low-pitched voice must stand out.

723
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,130
"The song requires a low-pitched voice."

724
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,900
(The youngest member is eyeing the spot for the ace member.)

725
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,539
(The highlight challenge for "MANIAC" to select the ace)

726
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,970
(Candidate 1, Vocalist HYEONGSEOP)

727
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,038
(As he's the first to try out, their reaction is quite generous.)

728
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,539
- Okay. - Okay.

729
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,880
(Candidate 2, Former Ace HANBIN)

730
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,619
(Candidate 3, Main Vocalist HYUK)

731
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,118
(Candidate 4, Handsome Ace EUNCHAN)

732
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,319
- That was pretty good. - Nice.

733
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,489
(Boosting his confidence)

734
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,960
For some reason, your voice suits the song.

735
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,129
(Candidate 5, TAERAE, sounds pretty good even during the warmup.)

736
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,189
He sounds much better than us.

737
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,230
(Anticipating)

738
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,660
(I'm a MANIAC with a loose screw)

739
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,828
(The best reaction so far)

740
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,039
- Great. - That's nice.

741
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:09,640
(Candidate 6, Charismatic Main Rapper LEW)

742
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,079
(Truly impressed)

743
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,038
I like it. He sounded original.

744
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,250
Right. That was good.

745
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,920
Three, two, one.

746
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,049
LEW got 4 votes. TAERAE got 2 votes.

747
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,318
LEW will be the ace.

748
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,959
- LEW. - LEW.

749
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,889
- Good luck! - I'll do my best! Let's go!

750
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,929
- You're the ace. - Let's go.

751
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,930
LEW the Maniac.

752
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,028
Hello, I'm LEW.

753
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,629
It's pretty early in the morning.

754
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,199
(LEW came to the practice studio alone early in the morning.)

755
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,798
We need to have a brainstorming meeting.

756
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,500
So I want to prepare for it.

757
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
(LEW sorts out his ideas for a long time.)

758
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,410
(Fully immersed)

759
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,578
I came up with the short storyboard.

760
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:49,409
I drew it out to explain my idea.

761
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,710
(His idea will be reflected in the performance.)

762
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,778
The members believed in me and put me in charge.

763
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,690
I do feel a lot of pressure at the same time.

764
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,058
I'm the leader and the ace member this time.

765
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,788
I want to deliver a performance I can have fun with...

766
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,730
and have no regrets once it's over.

767
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,990
(9 days until Round 1)

768
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,089
(8 days until Round 1)

769
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,599
Five, six, seven, eight.

770
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,299
(TEMPEST is practicing again as usual.)

771
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:10,899
(They're practicing hard with LEW's guidance.)

772
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,038
- One more time. - Okay.

773
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,239
When you dance... Bam.

774
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,239
Make sure to show clear breaks in your movements.

775
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,239
- Yes. - Okay. Let's try it.

776
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,679
Five, six, seven, eight.

777
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,679
The members were very passionate,

778
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,450
so they kept up with me well to the end.

779
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
(It's fun to practice.)

780
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:28,250
- Let's take a look. - Okay.

781
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,419
And we'll make good use of some props here and there.

782
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,588
We prepared our performance with complete confidence.

783
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,189
Is it a chain? Should we call that a chain?

784
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,799
- Yes. - We're using that too.

785
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:39,999
- I can't wait... - "MANIAC."

786
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,098
to finish practicing...

787
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,470
and show you the performance.

788
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,999
We'll win over the audience...

789
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,838
with our unique stage presence.

790
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,910
(1 day until Round 1)

791
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,038
(They're ready for Round 1 as they feel utterly confident.)

792
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,109
I feel confident.

793
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,640
Let's start with THE NEW SIX's rehearsal.

794
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,279
(On the day of the competition, THE NEW SIX's rehearsal)

795
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,509
- There it is. - What?

796
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,278
(Their props are shown after their choreography with the sheet.)

797
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,279
What?

798
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,549
Hey, that's a chain.

799
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,490
What?

800
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:11,288
Our themes slightly overlap.

801
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,400
- Yes. - The chain too.

802
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,559
It's like a twist of fate.

803
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,230
How can we overlap like this?

804
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,999
Here's what concerns me. We're both using chains.

805
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,569
- Their outfits are white too. - Yes.

806
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,608
On top of that, we're going after them.

807
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:23,639
If we mess it up,

808
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,709
they can easily compare our performance to theirs.

809
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,909
- Right. - Yes.

810
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,240
After watching their rehearsal performance,

811
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,149
- I'm feeling the heat. - You're feeling it.

812
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,950
- The heat's coming up. - I'm getting passionate.

813
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,349
I was nervous.

814
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,650
But I thought this was for the better.

815
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:39,660
I thought that I'd much prefer facing them head-on...

816
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,259
because I was confident.

817
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,789
We'll beat you.

818
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:45,959
- M. - "MANIAC."

819
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,828
- N. - No, I'm going to show you.

820
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,769
- A. - An example of our determination.

821
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,399
(He killed it.)

822
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,500
He crushed it.

823
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,940
(How will TEMPEST's version of "MANIAC" turn out?)

824
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,980
(Cheering)

825
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,139
There it goes.

826
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,710
A B-side track versus a mega-hit song.

827
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,278
Popular songs definitely come with a certain sense of approval.

828
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,049
- The song has a clear identity. - It's such a famous song.

829
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,388
- Right. - I wonder how they rearranged it.

830
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,260
Will they be able to beat the original song?

831
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,690
(THE NEW SIX will be watching TEMPEST's performance.)

832
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,279
(This wild performance captures the transformation...)

833
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,079
(of the mad Frankenstein with a powerful electronic melody.)

834
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,289
They used the chain just like THE NEW SIX.

835
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,630
How is that possible?

836
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,469
He unchained it.

837
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:11,949
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

838
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,599
(TAERAE)

839
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,210
It's just like the bed THE NEW SIX had.

840
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,920
They overlap a lot.

841
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,339
This is what I'm talking about.

842
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,449
- This is the choreography. - "It's driving you crazy."

843
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,500
They just followed the original choreography.

844
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,619
Gosh, he's good.

845
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,119
- Here he comes. - The dance break.

846
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,989
You can definitely tell who the ace is.

847
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,170
LEW is insane.

848
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,590
The dance break is nicely put together.

849
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:45,869
He's good-looking.

850
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,500
- Gosh. - Listen to him hit that high note.

851
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,609
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

852
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,419
(TEMPEST's ace, LEW)

853
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,178
(You can find "MANIAC" by TEMPEST on music streaming services...)

854
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,820
(from noon on September 27.)

855
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,519
(In love with them)

856
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,889
They did well.

857
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,489
The beginning was powerful.

858
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,198
I was surprised at the beginning...

859
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,530
because it was so good.

860
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,070
Even their makeup was dark and flashy.

861
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,570
The performance made a lasting impression.

862
00:38:56,269 --> 00:39:00,010
Their live singing was impactful.

863
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,109
TEMPEST might be more energetic...

864
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,409
on the stage.

865
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,479
We did better.

866
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,880
- We don't have to feel intimidated. - Yes, I think we did better.

867
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,150
I think our performance was more dynamic.

868
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,559
We can easily beat them.

869
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,618
(TEMPEST walks off the stage after their performance.)

870
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,730
I hope we did well.

871
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:20,199
- Let's wait for the result. - Let's wait for it.

872
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,359
Nicely done.

873
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,429
- Good job. - Good job.

874
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,199
You all did a very good job.

875
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,139
It is time to determine the winner of the VS Mission.

876
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,738
Out of the two teams that competed with songs by Stray Kids,

877
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,050
you will have to vote for the team that did better.

878
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,518
The team that will receive a benefit of 1,000 points...

879
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,480
solely depends on the votes of the audience.

880
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:43,989
Please.

881
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,630
We will now begin the VS voting...

882
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:51,829
between THE NEW SIX and TEMPEST.

883
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,229
It's so close.

884
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,299
Their vibes were so similar.

885
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,239
But you can't ignore the energy of "MANIAC."

886
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I'm desperate.

887
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,178
THE NEW SIX used their props well...

888
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:09,550
in ways that were agreeable.

889
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,949
Please.

890
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,820
Five, four,

891
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,919
three, two, one.

892
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,389
(The two teams wait for the result with hopeful hearts.)

893
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,690
The voting is over.

894
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,730
Since we performed first,

895
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,959
some of the props used by TEMPEST were already used by us.

896
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,230
It could've been boring.

897
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,369
I am 100 percent sure we will win.

898
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,598
Since we went later,

899
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,969
I think we could linger on everyone's minds.

900
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,139
Will they reveal the result right away?

901
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,840
Let's take a look at the result.

902
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,339
- Wait. - Wait a second.

903
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,479
- Really? - No.

904
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,809
Hurry up.

905
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,578
(The card that has the result of the VS Mission)

906
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:48,118
If he screams...

907
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,119
(The result is delivered to both teams simultaneously.)

908
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,150
I'll open it.

909
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,690
Let's look together.

910
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,658
- One, two... - Three.

911
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:58,730
(One, two, three)

912
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,199
I'll open it.

913
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,058
One, two, three.

914
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,198
(The battle of pride between teams that debuted the same year)

915
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,500
(What is the result of the Stray Kids Match?)

916
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,678
(Screams from the other green room as soon as they check the result)

917
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,780
Two, three.

918
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,650
(Screaming)

919
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,320
(They scream in joy.)

920
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,550
(They immediately turn the green room upside down.)

921
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,988
(THE NEW SIX wins in the Stray Kids Match.)

922
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,519
- Nice! - Yes.

923
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,859
We won this time.

924
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,759
- Yes. - Yes.

925
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,329
- That's right. - Yes, sir.

926
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:33,260
(TEMPEST's green room after they checked the result)

927
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,429
(Silence hangs in the air.)

928
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,739
I wondered how it was possible.

929
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,369
I thought, "Were we that bad?"

930
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,940
- We don't know our ranking yet. - That's right.

931
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,480
We'll have to hope for a better result.

932
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,150
We won't let go of our hope.

933
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,320
(THE NEW SIX gets a benefit of 1,000 points.)

934
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,289
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

935
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,948
The next group of artists creates exceptional stages...

936
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,420
with their unique perspective.

937
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,030
It's the ENHYPEN Match.

938
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,428
I can't wait to see the ENHYPEN Match.

939
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,469
Come on

940
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,299
Bring it on

941
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,039
(Bring on the ENHYPEN Match.)

942
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,510
(The two teams of the ENHYPEN Match walk onto the stage.)

943
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,018
(8TURN is dressed in school uniforms.)

944
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,118
(On the other hand, YOUNITE's costumes give off a strong vibe.)

945
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,819
I can tell they're focusing on their ace.

946
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,388
They won't have to tell us who their ace is.

947
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,459
I can tell who YOUNITE's ace is.

948
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,729
But who is 8TURN's?

949
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,159
I can't tell.

950
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,630
They have totally different themes. This will be interesting.

951
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,599
- Whose turn? 8TURN. - 8TURN.

952
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:44,429
- Hi, we're 8TURN. - Hi, we're 8TURN.

953
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,070
(The audience goes wild at the energetic introduction.)

954
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,308
Let us introduce ourselves.

955
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,879
- Two, three. Y, O, UNITE. - Y, O, UNITE.

956
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,440
- Hi, we're YOUNITE. - Hi, we're YOUNITE.

957
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,010
(The audience is getting heated up even before the performances.)

958
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,618
SION of YOUNITE, who is performing second.

959
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,149
You chose this match...

960
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,690
after learning you will be competing against 8TURN.

961
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,690
Can I take it that you are that confident?

962
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,989
I chose this match because I thought we'd do better than 8TURN.

963
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,400
Because I thought we'd do better than 8TURN.

964
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,158
(Surprised at the provocative comment)

965
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,429
(Everyone stirs in their green rooms.)

966
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,130
This is a fight.

967
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,138
This is interesting.

968
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:23,738
8TURN chose first,

969
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,010
- and YOUNITE chose next, right? - Yes.

970
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:27,409
It couldn't have been an easy choice.

971
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,750
(Round One, VS Mission, Choosing matches)

972
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,719
(Bring it on.)

973
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,218
(We welcome you.)

974
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,250
(Come on.)

975
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,419
The choice has been made.

976
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,849
(YOUNITE chose the ENHYPEN Match.)

977
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,760
Bring it on.

978
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,190
This will be doable.

979
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,460
We'll rub it in their nose.

980
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,159
8TURN.

981
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,960
8TURN.

982
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,598
8TURN.

983
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,800
(They couldn't be louder.)

984
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,940
8TURN won 1st place in the Evaluation Match.

985
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,570
(The electric feeling of winning 1st place)

986
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:01,509
(With their powerful choreography and energy, )

987
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,078
(8TURN won 1st place in the Evaluation Match.)

988
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,879
(Team Ranking, 1st place, 8TURN)

989
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,820
(They all panicked at the unexpected outcome.)

990
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,218
(What?)

991
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:11,889
(We won 1st place?)

992
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:13,690
Let's keep this up.

993
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Of course.

994
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:17,559
We decided to perform ENHYPEN's song.

995
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,559
- Which song will they choose? - I don't know.

996
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,969
They chose a dark and powerful stage for the Evaluation Match.

997
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,928
(YOUNITE put on a dynamic performance...)

998
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,468
(for the Evaluation Match.)

999
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,070
So I think they might choose something dynamic again.

1000
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:34,079
I wonder what kind of ideas they will come up with.

1001
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,650
Discussing this makes me nervous.

1002
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,078
Don't get intimidated.

1003
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,448
- I think I might get intimidated. - Don't get intimidated.

1004
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:40,719
We can do a good job.

1005
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:42,379
We don't have much time.

1006
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,219
Why don't we choose a song right now?

1007
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:47,460
I like "Future Perfect" by ENHYPEN.

1008
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,900
(A song with powerful rapping and energy)

1009
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,499
I think...

1010
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,400
it fits our style.

1011
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,029
I thought of "Bite Me."

1012
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,739
- "Bite Me?" - Yes, "Bite Me."

1013
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,570
(A song with a dark and sexy charm)

1014
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,479
Why don't we all show off how sexy we are?

1015
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,539
Not yet.

1016
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,308
You're the only sexy one here.

1017
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,579
You haven't given up on that thought, have you?

1018
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,849
Oh, okay.

1019
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,619
I believe we won first place...

1020
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,920
in the Evaluation Match...

1021
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,219
because of our energy and young vibe.

1022
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,888
I don't think it's a good idea to suddenly change to sexy.

1023
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,900
- Would we be going off track? - Slightly.

1024
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:28,630
I don't think this discussion will end.

1025
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:30,130
What is he doing?

1026
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,598
Gosh.

1027
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,038
(What is with him?)

1028
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:34,400
Okay, let's vote.

1029
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:35,799
"Bite Me."

1030
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,309
("Bite Me" gets 2 votes.)

1031
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,809
Then "Future Perfect."

1032
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,138
Raise your hand for "Future Perfect."

1033
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,339
("Future Perfect" gets 6 votes.)

1034
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,408
We'll go with "Future Perfect."

1035
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,250
Our future is perfect.

1036
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,749
(The title track of ENHYPEN's 3rd mini album)

1037
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,689
(The song delivers the message, )

1038
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,690
("I'll lead you. Let's go together" through a powerful rap.)

1039
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,619
We have to choose an ace that can depict...

1040
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,919
- 8TURN's... - Are we selecting the ace?

1041
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,030
Characteristic the best.

1042
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,959
- I actually had YUN GYU in mind. - Why?

1043
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,868
Doesn't the song fit him well?

1044
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,529
He's always rebellious.

1045
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,629
(He's always rebellious.)

1046
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,800
- When was I rebellious? - That's right.

1047
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,169
I think the energy goes well with YUN GYU.

1048
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,510
YUN GYU has exceptional energy.

1049
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,409
He is a good rapper...

1050
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,880
- and a good dancer. - He even sang an OST.

1051
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:19,349
He's an all-rounder.

1052
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,050
Even when he's alone on stage,

1053
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,719
it feels like he fills it up.

1054
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,820
He's talented and sassy.

1055
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,760
I can tell what it means to be gifted when I look at him.

1056
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,659
(YUN GYU is chosen as 8TURN's ace for Round 1.)

1057
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,859
The subtitle is "Pass the MIC."

1058
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,869
I think it'll be fun to use a microphone as a prop.

1059
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,839
I think it'll be cool to go with a rebellious theme.

1060
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
What do you think of police riot shields?

1061
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,139
We can pretend the dancers are trying to suppress us.

1062
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,049
- I like that. - I like it.

1063
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,050
Me too.

1064
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,448
(They start practicing with ace YUN GYU in the middle.)

1065
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:57,920
We want to put the focus on the performance, our strength.

1066
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:00,359
We split the beats...

1067
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,619
to show the audience a diverse choreography.

1068
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,230
(They prepared for Round 1 with a high-level performance.)

1069
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,729
It's fast.

1070
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,730
(Exhausted)

1071
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:12,170
I thought we'd be less energetic if we slowed the song down.

1072
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,539
If we can look at ease while doing this,

1073
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,239
we'll win first place.

1074
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,138
Look at the ranking when you're tired.

1075
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:21,079
- This is your motivation. - Okay.

1076
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Come on.

1077
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,679
Will we stay in first place or lose it?

1078
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,480
It was more stressful because we did so well in the Evaluation Match.

1079
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,920
The stage in Round One with me as the ace...

1080
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,260
will be the first stage to be given a score and rank.

1081
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,829
I was determined to try hard and do well.

1082
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:47,469
The burden of being the ace is heavy and makes me nervous,

1083
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,139
but our team worked hard to prepare this stage.

1084
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,809
So I think I'll be an impressive ace and we'll put on a good performance.

1085
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,149
- We got this. - We got this.

1086
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,710
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1087
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:01,218
(8TURN hopes to win by pouring all their energy into the stage.)

1088
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:03,348
- Let's kill this performance. - Okay.

1089
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:04,849
- Have fun. - Here we go.

1090
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,389
- 8TURN, let's go. - 8TURN, let's go.

1091
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:11,158
(They are in high spirits before the performance.)

1092
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:12,428
Go, 8TURN.

1093
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:14,900
- Go, 8TURN. - Go, 8TURN.

1094
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,369
(What will 8TURN's stage filled with their determination be like?)

1095
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,369
I wonder how well the first-place winners will do.

1096
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,500
I'm really looking forward to this.

1097
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,739
I can't wait to see this.

1098
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:27,380
(YOUNITE, who will perform next, is watching 8TURN.)

1099
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,019
- Ace. That's cool. - Ace.

1100
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,058
- What's that? - What's that?

1101
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,159
What was that?

1102
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,500
I think 8TURN will win.

1103
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:57,210
("Future Perfect" by 8TURN)

1104
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,538
(A stage that depicts 8TURN's hope to change the world...)

1105
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,409
(without giving into the reality filled with oppression and control)

1106
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,349
I don't want to.

1107
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,820
He broke it.

1108
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:18,729
I think he's a rebellious delinquent.

1109
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,730
I think so too.

1110
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,920
They're well-synced.

1111
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:54,230
He's good at singing live.

1112
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,480
- He looks good. - He's good-looking.

1113
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,329
They're well-synced.

1114
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,320
This is satisfying.

1115
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:50,489
They're totally in sync.

1116
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,340
- What? - When did he change?

1117
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,639
- He changed. - His clothes changed.

1118
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:10,010
When did he put that on?

1119
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:32,030
He's good.

1120
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,730
It's the dance break.

1121
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:39,940
- What is that? - What is that?

1122
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,170
What is that?

1123
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:57,788
- That's right. - I see something coming.

1124
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:59,860
That's right. Here it comes.

1125
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:16,239
This is something men love.

1126
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,039
That's similar to our style.

1127
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,239
Doesn't JUNGMO love that stuff?

1128
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,380
They definitely have a young vibe.

1129
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,170
(8TURN's ace, YUN GYU)

1130
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,899
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1131
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,840
("Future Perfect" by 8TURN won't be released due to copyright issues.)

1132
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,010
They did a good job.

1133
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,009
- They have a young vibe. - Yes.

1134
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,719
- The amount of choreography is... - It's impressive.

1135
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,349
They focused on the choreography rather than the plot.

1136
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:39,319
Since they don't have a plot,

1137
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,260
- it's a bit boring. - That was disappointing.

1138
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,719
I...

1139
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,730
look forward to the next team.

1140
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,158
Let's just do what we always do.

1141
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,669
- Okay. - Don't get nervous.

1142
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,630
- We're cool. - Right, don't get nervous.

1143
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,510
8TURN was good. I was determined to do better.

1144
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:00,110
I can't do it half-heartedly.

1145
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,750
(Who is the ace of YOUNITE that always does his best?)

1146
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,079
I, leader EUNSANG, am the ace of Round One.

1147
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,150
My team members were a bit disheartened...

1148
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,420
after the Evaluation Match.

1149
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,718
(5th place, YOUNITE)

1150
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,030
(The team was in low spirits after getting a low ranking.)

1151
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,630
After seeing our ranking,

1152
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,070
I wanted to bring up everyone's spirits.

1153
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,139
I thought I should take the lead as the leader.

1154
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Let's go.

1155
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,769
(What kind of stage will YOUNITE with its confident ace put on?)

1156
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:36,179
We need something to beat the first-place winners.

1157
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,209
I think it's important to do something...

1158
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,019
- 8TURN won't. - That's right.

1159
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,519
8TURN chose a bright song for the Evaluation Match.

1160
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,149
(8TURN showed off a young energy through a refreshing rugby theme.)

1161
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,218
Will they continue with that...

1162
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,219
Or change it up?

1163
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,400
I think they'll stick to it if they think it's their style.

1164
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,400
Since they won first place, I think they could stick to it...

1165
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,299
instead of taking a risk.

1166
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,300
- That's right. - Of course.

1167
00:54:59,301 --> 00:55:02,569
- Then should we go with sexy? - Sexy?

1168
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,908
(We...)

1169
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,609
(We will be sexy?)

1170
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,280
None of us are sexy.

1171
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,210
You have me.

1172
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,779
I'll admit it if you wear a cropped top.

1173
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,348
- Like MYUNG HO. - Work out.

1174
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,919
He has defined abs.

1175
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,920
(3D abs)

1176
00:55:18,921 --> 00:55:19,949
We'll draw it on you.

1177
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:21,889
(Painstaking friendship as they aim to win the match)

1178
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,889
If we can't go for sexy, what about elegance?

1179
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,030
An elegant vibe.

1180
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,960
What about a person that's obsessed with something?

1181
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,569
- Why are you... - You need to elaborate.

1182
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,669
Obsessed with what?

1183
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,468
Like self-obsession?

1184
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:35,598
Obsessed how?

1185
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,670
I want everyone to be obsessed with something.

1186
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:42,639
I have an idea.

1187
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,849
(No wonder he's the ace.)

1188
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,218
- I want us to act something out. - Okay.

1189
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,250
For example, during the Evaluation Match,

1190
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,518
I laughed like a lunatic.

1191
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:55,158
No other team did anything similar.

1192
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:56,190
No, they didn't.

1193
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:59,960
I think we should use that as a wow factor.

1194
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,030
This time, we'll depict good and evil.

1195
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,699
- Good and evil? - Black and white.

1196
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:05,900
We can actually chant a spell on stage.

1197
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:08,170
(Murmuring)

1198
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,409
In Latin or French.

1199
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,809
Will the spell summon a devil?

1200
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,679
That's a good idea.

1201
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,849
What if we created something like a scene from a movie?

1202
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,678
Right. We always said...

1203
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:23,549
we should create a piece of art.

1204
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,190
- Okay. - I like it.

1205
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,959
I like the idea. I like evil.

1206
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,359
The villains are always the sexiest.

1207
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
(HYUNGSEOK, Plans to be a villain, Don't forget he claims to be sexy)

1208
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,058
You can connect it like that.

1209
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:35,198
Out of ENHYPEN's songs, we can do "Given-Taken..."

1210
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,328
- or "Bite Me." - "Bite Me."

1211
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:38,699
- "Fever." - Yes, "Fever."

1212
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:40,840
(They decide to listen to the songs before making a choice.)

1213
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:42,099
It's a harp.

1214
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:46,110
("Given-Taken" has a dreamy and dark atmosphere.)

1215
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:48,539
It's a bit like Greek and Roman mythology.

1216
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,380
There's a harp playing too.

1217
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,550
I like this song.

1218
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,619
("Fever" is a vampire-themed song with ENHYPEN's sexiness.)

1219
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,459
- It seems a bit too sexy. - It does.

1220
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,488
- And the lyrics. - Yes, the lyrics.

1221
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,328
We're not that sexy yet.

1222
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:05,929
- Let's listen to the last one. - Yes.

1223
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:10,000
("Bite Me" is a story of salvation with a touch of sexiness.)

1224
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,570
(Focused)

1225
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:15,440
- Salvation? - Salvation.

1226
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,638
What do you think?

1227
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,908
- "Salvation." - That word hits you, right?

1228
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,009
Yes. Salvation.

1229
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:24,709
It seems the closest to the theme we're thinking of.

1230
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,049
We could make it fun after some arrangements.

1231
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,848
Then, we'll go with "Bite Me."

1232
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:29,849
Sure.

1233
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,320
Evil!

1234
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,718
("Bite Me" is the title track of ENHYPEN's 4th mini-album, )

1235
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:35,089
(and it blends an intense and direct message...)

1236
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,460
(of "Bite Me" into the dark and sexy pop genre.)

1237
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,729
We need...

1238
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:40,428
our ace to carry this performance.

1239
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:42,058
I'll have a sense of responsibility.

1240
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,698
I won't just work hard. I'll do well.

1241
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:44,729
We believe in you.

1242
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,729
We'll do our best to follow your lead.

1243
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,840
Good.

1244
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:49,899
(EUNSANG's studio that afternoon)

1245
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,339
I'm currently in the studio.

1246
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,079
I need to come up with some ideas. Let's listen to the song.

1247
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,110
(He plays "Bite Me" until he can come up with an idea.)

1248
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,219
Occult.

1249
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:04,920
Horror.

1250
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,059
(Collecting occult references)

1251
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,960
(He looks like he's possessed when he gets an idea.)

1252
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,199
Possessed.

1253
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:17,669
Some praying at first.

1254
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,900
(A praying performance to begin the show)

1255
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,569
Some bell sounds.

1256
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,139
And an organ will start playing.

1257
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:23,869
Okay.

1258
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,079
It's occult and horror.

1259
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:29,110
- Okay. - I'm trying to add some scenes.

1260
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:32,380
(Studying how to be possessed by watching a horror film)

1261
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:33,980
- Like this. - Yes.

1262
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,719
(He demonstrates it too.)

1263
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:39,190
(You're scaring me, EUNSANG.)

1264
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:40,319
What do you think?

1265
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,419
The performance is certainly going to be like a movie.

1266
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,959
I doubt that any other team will go with an occult theme.

1267
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,428
Did you study it?

1268
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:47,360
(You bet. I even reviewed it.)

1269
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:49,630
I can't sleep when you do that at 3am.

1270
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,428
It'll be three times more intense.

1271
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:54,839
We have yet another provocative theme.

1272
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,909
We added a lot of movie-like parts.

1273
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,368
(Covering their mouths)

1274
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,639
(One of them even leaves the room.)

1275
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:02,308
Do you think they'll get chills?

1276
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:03,578
Definitely.

1277
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,178
What if I did it the other way?

1278
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,879
(Very stimulative)

1279
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,719
That's going to be terrifying.

1280
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,349
I don't think you should go any further.

1281
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,388
I believe that I'm...

1282
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:16,759
failing my team if I don't pull it off.

1283
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,489
So, I needed to perform well as the ace member.

1284
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:22,029
We'll give you a proper taste of YOUNITE...

1285
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:24,130
with a more intense and movie-like performance.

1286
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:27,138
You need to pay attention to the intro.

1287
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:28,669
The introduction of the song.

1288
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,610
Watch how we corrupt EUNSANG.

1289
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:33,739
Keep an eye on us.

1290
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,980
You're next.

1291
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:38,150
(Get ready to be corrupted by YOUNITE, everyone.)

1292
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,780
Let's go.

1293
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,119
Are you ready?

1294
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,118
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1295
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,019
(What will YOUNITE's version of "Bite Me" look like?)

1296
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,889
(Their props enter the stage.)

1297
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,659
(Startled)

1298
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,460
They've got so many props.

1299
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:56,360
I was shocked when I first saw it.

1300
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,170
I didn't know they'd go this big.

1301
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:02,440
- Go, YOUNITE! - Go, YOUNITE!

1302
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,039
You've got this!

1303
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,789
- What? - What's that?

1304
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:25,929
A cross?

1305
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,800
I think he's praying.

1306
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,428
That's their theme?

1307
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:33,569
I think he's portraying the absolute good.

1308
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,539
We'll see if his outfit stays white at the end of the performance.

1309
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:49,050
("Bite Me" by YOUNITE)

1310
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,889
(To be continued shortly)

1311
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,460
("Bite Me" by YOUNITE)

1312
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,698
(Their performance depicts the process...)

1313
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:07,899
(of the 7 deadly sins leading a virtuous soul to corruption, )

1314
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,999
(expressing the complex emotions of a human...)

1315
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,098
(wavering on the boundary between good and evil...)

1316
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,210
(through a narrative-driven production.)

1317
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,239
The intro goes hard.

1318
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,780
Is he barefoot?

1319
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:35,760
He's a great dancer.

1320
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,510
The expressions on his face...

1321
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,380
It hurts!

1322
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,750
- No! - Please live.

1323
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,299
- Don't take him away! - No!

1324
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,300
Don't go!

1325
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:54,869
What's that?

1326
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,249
They're fighting!

1327
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,309
Don't turn evil.

1328
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,828
What's going to happen?

1329
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:18,829
He's become evil now.

1330
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,829
(YOUNITE's ace, EUNSANG)

1331
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,029
- He changed! - No!

1332
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,230
- When did that come out? - It's an evil being!

1333
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,169
(They automatically stand up.)

1334
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,629
- What happened? - He turned evil.

1335
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,098
- No! - No!

1336
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:02,138
Oh, no.

1337
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:05,440
(They react strongly to the plot twist.)

1338
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:06,809
He's tempted.

1339
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,380
Why?

1340
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,609
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1341
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,018
("Bite Me" by YOUNITE will not be released due to copyright issues.)

1342
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:16,820
He's scaring me!

1343
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:20,050
He actually looks insane.

1344
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:24,960
(The members of 8TURN look down after YOUNITE's performance.)

1345
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,229
Goodness.

1346
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,359
- They already won. - They're number one.

1347
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,869
- The intro was so intense. - It was.

1348
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,429
Can I watch this again?

1349
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,468
He was contrasted by wearing white,

1350
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:37,138
but the other members did so well...

1351
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:38,439
- that they weren't overshadowed. - Exactly.

1352
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,709
Every one of them had a strong stage presence.

1353
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:42,308
YOUNITE's performance had...

1354
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:46,109
a plot twist after another plot twist.

1355
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,320
But 8TURN's performance was good too.

1356
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:51,488
They killed it with the choreography.

1357
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:55,359
But the audience must have felt the energy from the live show.

1358
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,730
So, I'm not sure how the voting will go.

1359
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:59,428
I think it all depends on their preference.

1360
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:00,429
- Right. - Right.

1361
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,059
Now, we will begin the VS voting...

1362
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,429
between 8TURN and YOUNITE that performed ENHYPEN's songs.

1363
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,939
(The votes by the on-site judges will determine the winner.)

1364
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,969
Five, four, three,

1365
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,710
two, one.

1366
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,138
(Voting closed)

1367
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,579
The voting has closed.

1368
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,880
(8TURN with boldness versus YOUNITE with a sensual allure)

1369
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,948
(Which team won in the ENHYPEN Match?)

1370
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:26,988
Let's find out.

1371
01:06:26,989 --> 01:06:28,618
(The result cards are delivered to both teams...)

1372
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,419
(after the voting is closed.)

1373
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,559
It's the result!

1374
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:34,299
(What did you say?)

1375
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,300
What?

1376
01:06:35,301 --> 01:06:36,760
This can't be happening.

1377
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:38,598
- This is unbelievable. - I can't breathe.

1378
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,170
Give me a moment. Please.

1379
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,038
(The two leaders can't seem to open the cards.)

1380
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,639
Please.

1381
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,638
- We worked so hard. - We did.

1382
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:48,039
I'll open it now.

1383
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,408
(Which team is the winner...)

1384
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:53,050
(to take 1,000 points as a benefit?)

1385
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,780
Seriously.

1386
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,320
YOUNITE has won.

1387
01:06:57,449 --> 01:07:00,589
(YOUNITE wins in the ENHYPEN Match.)

1388
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,118
(We did it!)

1389
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,119
Yes!

1390
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,489
(They celebrate with EUNSANG, their ace.)

1391
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,959
Our opponent was number one in the Evaluation Match.

1392
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,828
- Right. - And we defeated them.

1393
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:15,440
I had such a strong rush of dopamine.

1394
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,440
I had never imagined it. I was genuinely surprised.

1395
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:21,610
I'm sure all the members were desperately waiting for the win.

1396
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,010
It felt like I gave them a present.

1397
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,409
Like, "Here you go."

1398
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,719
(In 8TURN's green room where they checked the result)

1399
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:33,049
It says, "Lose."

1400
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,419
(They still can't accept their defeat.)

1401
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,889
- That's too bad. - There's no way.

1402
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:37,659
Please change it to "win."

1403
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,590
It's wrong.

1404
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:43,929
(YUN GYU is speechless as he feels terrible.)

1405
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,239
YUN GYU, don't tell me you're blaming yourself.

1406
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,210
It's a bummer.

1407
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:54,138
You've shown them all you could.

1408
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:55,239
You've done well enough.

1409
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,749
We focused on our choreography and performing...

1410
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:04,888
so that we could show our energy, which we were good at.

1411
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:07,119
We meant to kill it with the performing.

1412
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:09,888
But I get why the live audience could have thought...

1413
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:12,030
that our performance was too simple.

1414
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:15,230
Though we lost the VS Battle,

1415
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:18,270
the general voting might have a different result.

1416
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:20,000
- We don't know that yet. - Right.

1417
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,369
(YOUNITE gets a benefit of 1,000 points.)

1418
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,939
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace, Round One was VS Mission.

1419
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,909
This match-up will be fiercer than any other match-up.

1420
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,249
This is the most interesting match-up.

1421
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,318
They would have the most spectacles.

1422
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,489
They're all performing different songs.

1423
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:42,420
They will be competing with three different songs.

1424
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:44,430
It's a triple match-up.

1425
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,389
(We can't wait to see it!)

1426
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,300
CRAVITY's performance begins now.

1427
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,538
- We didn't see them last time. - On our first day.

1428
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:55,738
- Oh, right! - In the Evaluation Match.

1429
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:57,538
This is the only team that we haven't figured out.

1430
01:08:57,539 --> 01:08:58,608
That's true.

1431
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:00,639
We couldn't perform in the Evaluation Match.

1432
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,379
Our goal is number one, no matter what.

1433
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,108
The moment we placed seventh,

1434
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,850
we were either placing first or going home.

1435
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,840
Come a little closer.

1436
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,939
Swallow it.

1437
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,709
Touch it.

1438
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:38,949
(To be continued shortly)

1439
01:09:39,449 --> 01:09:41,618
The official supporting race...

1440
01:09:41,619 --> 01:09:43,850
for Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace has begun.

1441
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,819
Collect boosters from Mnet Plus...

1442
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,189
to support your aces right now.

1443
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,028
(Round 1, VS Mission)

1444
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:52,589
(A triple match)

1445
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,158
(The winner of Ace Battle, HWAN WOONG from ONEUS)

1446
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:55,898
(The runner-up of Ace Battle, Lim Jimin from The CrewOne)

1447
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:57,868
(This is the most interesting match-up!)

1448
01:09:57,869 --> 01:09:59,929
(This match-up is so competitive.)

1449
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:00,938
(I was convinced.)

1450
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:02,639
(We knew we were going to place 1st.)

1451
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,999
(The winner of the triple match-up...)

1452
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,340
(is The CrewOne.)

1453
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,809
(It's meaningful to go from 7th place to 1st place.)

1454
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:09,908
(Let's get our revenge.)

1455
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:11,978
(It's CRAVITY's first performance on this show.)

1456
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:17,318
(CRAVITY came thoroughly prepared.)

1457
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:19,549
(What's their first performance going to be like?)

1458
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,550
(I can't see anything.)

1459
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:21,889
(It felt a bit plain, though.)

1460
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:23,488
(I was a bit flustered.)

1461
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:26,890
(There will be no ranks or titles today.)

1462
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,299
(What is he talking about? There aren't any ranks.)

1463
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,929
(The fierce triple match-up...)

1464
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,970
(begins next week.)

1465
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:39,068
(There's a reason why he's the ace twice in a row.)

1466
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,738
(You can't take your eyes off...)

1467
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:42,408
(these 3 different performances by 3 teams.)

1468
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:43,739
(That's so sexy.)

1469
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,148
(It was such a bummer.)

1470
01:10:49,149 --> 01:10:50,750
(I felt so bad for the members.)

1471
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,648
(Announcing the winners of the VS Mission)

1472
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,459
(THE NEW SIX, YOUNITE, )

1473
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,159
(and the winner of the triple match-up)

1474
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,000
(They don't even give us a moment to feel nervous.)

1475
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,069
(In 7th place...)

1476
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,000
(I feel like I'm getting PTSD.)

1477
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:09,569
Are you serious?

1478
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,210
(I'm genuinely annoyed.)

1479
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:16,739
(What's the final result of Round 1?)
