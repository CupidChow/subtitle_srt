1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,639
(Ace of Ace)

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,949
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,719
(The 2nd round of Round 3 will determine the finalists.)

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,820
(Which performances will we see next?)

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,730
(YOUNITE dominates the stage with a blockbuster-scale performance.)

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,136
(He's so good with facial expressions.)

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,699
(YOUNITE always shocks us in a good way.)

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,739
(8TURN showed narcissism in 8 different colors.)

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,909
(He fell into the water!)

10
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,279
Oh, my gosh!

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,079
(This is bad. Our themes overlap.)

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,709
(ONEUS showed their strength...)

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,179
(with their representative song and the Korean theme.)

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,149
(This is the beauty of Korea.)

15
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,019
(They did that too?)

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,420
(They fall in the water too?)

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
(Wait.)

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,335
(What fate awaits the two teams with overlapping concepts?)

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,429
(It's so similar to ours.)

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,728
(How did it turn out like this?)

21
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,429
(CRAVITY reinterpreted the sensuous song into an energetic one.)

22
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,109
(They used various scenes for the stage.)

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,869
(Will they be able to secure their spot in 1st place...)

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,869
(while showing the power of a high-ranking team?)

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,809
(Performances beyond imagination were presented...)

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,608
(for Round 3's No Limit Mission.)

27
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,185
(The overall rankings that will decide the finalists are revealed.)

28
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,549
The team at the bottom will no longer...

29
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,719
(They won't be able to continue their journey on our show.)

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,689
(The bottom team gets eliminated right away?)

31
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,859
(One of the teams here will be gone.)

32
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,850
(The team in 6th place in the overall ranking...)

33
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,859
(They turned the tables like this?)

34
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,060
(Which 5 teams advanced to the finals?)

35
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,069
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,839
(Round 3, the last round before the finals)

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,510
(Round 3, No Limit)

38
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,286
(The best members of each team will participate in the Ace Battle.)

39
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,209
(We will select the Super Ace.)

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,999
(The fate of each team rests on the shoulders of these 12 aces.)

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,108
(CRAVITY's MINHEE and TAEYOUNG)

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,318
(TEMPEST's LEW and HYUK)

43
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,419
(ONEUS's HWAN WOONG and LEE DO)

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,979
(The CrewOne's Oh Junseok and Jeong Seunghwan)

45
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,249
(8TURN's JAE YUN and MYUNG HO)

46
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,450
(YOUNITE's SION and HYUNGSEOK)

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,266
(They battle over the parts to become the Super Ace.)

48
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,059
(Part 3 is the most popular for the Water Stage.)

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,980
(Part 2 is the most popular for the Fire Stage.)

50
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,760
(During the intense fight over parts, )

51
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,399
(CRAVITY and ONEUS pick their parts first...)

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,798
(because of the benefit of getting 1st place in Round 2.)

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,299
(The battle over parts begins.)

54
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,399
(I prepared the whole chorus.)

55
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,270
(I also prepared the dance.)

56
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,009
(The low ranking aces have an intense battle over parts.)

57
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,008
(Why did performance directors Koo Young and Young Jun come by?)

58
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,848
(A hidden part!)

59
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:22,849
A hidden part will be revealed.

60
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,250
(Which ace will become the Super Ace?)

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,120
(The Water Stage gave a sexy performance using water.)

62
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,620
(8TURN's JAE YUN got the Water Stage's hidden part.)

63
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,860
(The CrewOne's Oh Junseok got the Fire Stage's hidden part.)

64
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,059
(He's so cool.)

65
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,159
(The Fire Stage surprised everyone with their powerful choreography.)

66
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,406
(Who will be each unit's Super Ace to take their team to the finals?)

67
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,468
(8TURN's JAE YUN)

68
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,840
(Water Stage Super Ace, 8TURN's JAE YUN)

69
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,340
(Fire Stage Super Ace, CRAVITY's TAEYOUNG)

70
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,938
(The Ace Ranking is likely to see drastic changes.)

71
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,626
(We only have the 2nd round of Round 3 left.)

72
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,310
(The No Limit Mission that has no limits)

73
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,949
(Starting with an eye-catching introduction, )

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,120
(The CrewOne gave a blockbuster performance of "Sherlock.")

75
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,288
(TEMPEST recreated "Jopping" in a sci-fi movie theme...)

76
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,049
(with a futuristic arrangement of the song.)

77
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,688
(However, Hyuk made a mistake while on the wire.)

78
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,099
- Oh, no. - What happened?

79
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,500
(The competition continued on in a tense atmosphere.)

80
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,870
(Which team will perform next and break their limits?)

81
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,909
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

82
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,949
Next up is the 3rd team for the 2nd round of Round 3.

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,718
This team has been showcasing their limitless potential...

84
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,289
by giving impactful performances that feel fresh every time.

85
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,020
They do feel very fresh.

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,659
They are different every time.

87
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,728
It's YOUNITE.

88
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:44,128
(YOUNITE will perform 3rd for the 2nd round of Round 3.)

89
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,529
(YOUNITE)

90
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,729
They always surprise us.

91
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm curious what work of art they'll present to us this time.

92
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,639
Like the mission name, No Limit,

93
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,968
they prepared a highly stimulating performance...

94
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,409
that has never been seen before.

95
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,750
Also, they have an ace who will lead the team...

96
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,520
for the 3rd time after Round 1 and Round 2.

97
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,919
EUNSANG?

98
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,749
Their leader EUNSANG says...

99
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,120
he is more determined than ever.

100
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,629
- EUNSANG again? - Again?

101
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,049
He shouldn't be called EUNSANG. He should be called Always.

102
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,659
We're starting...

103
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,499
to get closer to YOUNITE.

104
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,600
- Right. - Looking at the ranking.

105
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,838
Because they gave such good team performances,

106
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,568
I thought...

107
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,910
- they were so far removed from us. - Me too.

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
But...

109
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,638
they didn't get many benefit points...

110
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,138
from the Fire Stage or the Water Stage.

111
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,526
(YOUNITE is in trouble after getting the lowest Ace Ranking.)

112
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,250
If we do really well, they could be our rivals.

113
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,449
We have to show everyone our teamwork.

114
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,860
Just get really excited.

115
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,920
- Don't hold back. - Use all of your energy.

116
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,129
Okay.

117
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,328
I prepared...

118
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,300
a presentation.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,268
- A presentation. - A presentation.

120
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,329
A presentation.

121
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,730
(We're going to have a meeting. Since it's called No Limit, )

122
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,898
(please think of some references. Anything is okay, )

123
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,175
(so please bring many ideas. Thank you!)

124
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,268
(- Can I draw something? - Yes! No limit on references.)

125
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:01,369
(I'll have to do a lot of research.)

126
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,216
(- I'll prepare very well! - Okay. No limit, right? Nice!)

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,938
We have Round Three left still.

128
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,939
You're right.

129
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,709
It's time to wake up once again.

130
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,519
(YOUNITE showed off their youthful charms with a musical-like stage.)

131
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,696
(But they got 6th in the Team and Ace Rankings...)

132
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,165
(and got an overall ranking of 3rd place, one down from before.)

133
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,759
Oh, that was dangerous.

134
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,790
I guess people didn't like it.

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,729
We're done having fun now, right?

136
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,999
- We are. - We are.

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,568
I think we'll have to prepare for Round Three well.

138
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,170
We'll have to do something cool and intense next time.

139
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,139
(Learning from the results of Round 2...)

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,338
We need something a bit more stimulating.

141
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,909
You're right. Let's do something strong.

142
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,539
You're right. Our lives depend on this performance.

143
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,009
We need to do something intense.

144
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,449
(On that note...)

145
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,579
How about EUNSANG do it one more time?

146
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,409
I like it. It's the standard of stimulation.

147
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,449
Standard of stimulation.

148
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,889
- Standard of stimulation. - What does that mean?

149
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,029
I think it should be a book.

150
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,930
The standard of stimulating things.

151
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,999
We were finding our color...

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,929
while on Road to Kingdom.

153
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,669
- Right. - We had to find our color...

154
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,398
while on Road to Kingdom.

155
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,838
And during that process,

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,638
our goal was to catch people's attention,

157
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,009
regardless of whether it was liked by most people or not.

158
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,009
I think we're doing well in terms of going in that direction.

159
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,480
In the end, I'm going to win people over.

160
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,579
Okay.

161
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,278
I'll show everyone what "standard of stimulation" is.

162
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,318
- Standard of stimulation. - Standard of stimulation.

163
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,959
- Standard of stimulation. - I trust you.

164
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:26,360
Okay. The real reason we got together today.

165
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,459
- Yes. - Yes.

166
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,429
We need to discuss the 2nd round of Round 3.

167
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,199
Let's not just wake up. Let's transcend.

168
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,698
- It's No Limit. - Right. No Limit.

169
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,870
There are no limits. We need to transcend.

170
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,040
Nice to see you, everyone.

171
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,800
- Nice to see you. - Nice to see you.

172
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,568
I'm DEY. I'll be giving a lecture on concepts today.

173
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,740
- A lecture? - Thank you.

174
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,310
The lecture I've prepared for you today...

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,980
is a post-apocalyptic dystopia.

176
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,448
(I see!)

177
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,550
Apocalypse. It's a total wasteland.

178
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,720
We can do a large-scale performance...

179
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,629
with some... Some dust...

180
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,429
- Dust? - We'll use dust as a prop?

181
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,559
(Dust is quite a simple prop for a No Limit performance.)

182
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,799
And wreckage.

183
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,100
- Wreckage. - Wreckage.

184
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,068
- And do you see this bridge here? - Yes.

185
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,699
There are zombies on bridges like this.

186
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,069
If we go to the next page...

187
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,410
Zombies walking on a bridge.

188
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,039
We could use this bridge as an objet.

189
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,086
(A plan to use the bridge as an objet on stage)

190
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,509
I would like to depict this falling action on stage.

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,049
- I see. - That's nice.

192
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,350
Are we the zombies?

193
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,389
I think if we're the zombies, that would be too cliche.

194
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,329
We'll be the light in an apocalyptic world.

195
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,359
We'll be the survivors.

196
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,458
(Star instructor DEY's concept, 1. Background, post apocalypse)

197
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,559
(2. Characters, YOUNITE and zombie dancers)

198
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,235
(3. Stage, a big-scale bridge, 4. Choreography, zombies falling)

199
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,138
My concept is a bit similar to DEY's.

200
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,370
What I'm trying to explain.

201
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,910
The concept is an apocalypse surviving story fighting zombies.

202
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,139
It's so similar to mine.

203
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,508
YOUNITE wants to go in this direction, right?

204
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,069
- The things nobody else does. - Right.

205
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,420
A choreography with zombie hands reaching in.

206
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,389
And we can make tormented expressions. That's the idea.

207
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,790
- It's highly stimulating. - It's nice, right?

208
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,659
What concept is suitable for Road to Kingdom?

209
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,359
I thought of "Kingdom."

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,805
(They're sharing a brain. This time, it's Korean zombies.)

211
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,599
I tried drawing the ending scene.

212
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
The person in the middle is the ace.

213
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,600
And this is a human tower. We have no limits, right?

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,970
We could get many dancers and make a tower.

215
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,579
And we'll survive in the end.

216
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,638
It means, "Let's survive this round."

217
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,980
So we survive. Like Round Three.

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
- I really like that tower idea. - Right. The tower is really...

219
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,350
We could do something stimulating.

220
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,219
- It seems our ideas... - They're similar.

221
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,719
- have some things in common. - Right.

222
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,788
The apocalyptic themes...

223
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,629
and zombies. We had many ideas like that.

224
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,159
If we really highlight the message,

225
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,799
"we'll survive Road to Kingdom,"

226
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,200
in this performance, I think that would be nice.

227
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,370
- We don't have a song yet. - Right.

228
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,169
I definitely think it needs to be a strong song.

229
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:58,509
"Walk."

230
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,579
("Walk" by NCT 127?)

231
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
"Walk."

232
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,508
(That's nice. Zombies walking around.)

233
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,820
- Or EXO. - "Growl."

234
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,450
- That's nice. - Zombies going "Growl."

235
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,359
Or we should do something extra surprising...

236
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,659
(Extra surprising?)

237
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,359
How about a girl group song?

238
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,158
"Armageddon" by aespa is about the battle...

239
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,059
between good and evil at the end of the world.

240
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,128
The end of the world fits our theme.

241
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,829
I think it would be really nice with a new arrangement.

242
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,515
(A song that develops dramatically, suitable for an apocalyptic theme)

243
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,069
I think it would be perfect for getting people's attention.

244
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,390
I don't think others would do it.

245
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,239
Right. I think that's important. Something others wouldn't do.

246
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,956
I don't think people could predict what we'd do.

247
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,809
The song YOUNITE picked...

248
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,679
is "Armageddon" by aespa.

249
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,190
After chasing more and more stimulation, we became zombies.

250
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,418
(EUNHO, that's not it.)

251
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,490
The new generation of humans who survived the end of the world.

252
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,830
Let's go.

253
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,798
("Armageddon" by aespa)

254
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,268
(A hip-hop dance song with a strong and heavy sound)

255
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,428
(It's the title song of their 1st full-length album.)

256
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,940
(It sends the message, "Only I can define myself.")

257
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,139
(A few days later, YOUNITE's practice studio)

258
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,440
(They became zombie-like after so much tough practice.)

259
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,649
(As soon as the practice starts, they get into their concept.)

260
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,950
Isn't this the first time YOUNITE is doing a serious dance break?

261
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,929
I think it's our first time on Road to Kingdom.

262
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,158
For Round Three, we thought we should give...

263
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,058
an impactful performance that suits the No Limit Mission...

264
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,029
on top of giving a strong performance.

265
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,500
(After the choreography practice, EUNSANG went up somewhere high?)

266
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,870
(Why does YOUNITE keep stepping up on high places?)

267
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,509
(YOUNITE, night practice)

268
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,408
(Oh, my.)

269
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:43,808
HYUNGSEOK. You can jump down now.

270
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,850
Show us, HYUNGSEOK.

271
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,820
Oh, my. This is no joke.

272
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,149
- What is this? - What is this?

273
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,419
- The scale is no joke. - There's so much.

274
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,059
- When we go down... - Oh, my!

275
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,288
(DEY is scared.)

276
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,798
Try singing there.

277
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,769
(The youngest is scared.)

278
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,605
(While people shriek from around the stage, )

279
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,439
(the ace climbs the set as if it's his own house.)

280
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,970
Let's go!

281
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,809
The main character of the movie!

282
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,139
This is a real apocalypse.

283
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,149
(Overcoming their fears and starting practice)

284
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:21,250
Like the theme, No Limit,

285
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,649
we made a limitless set.

286
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,259
I think this is the largest set we've had on the show.

287
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,659
A full charge of dopamine.

288
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,829
It broke.

289
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,100
All parts of practice were fun. It was so exciting.

290
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,859
More than feeling worried, I wanted to perform soon.

291
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,929
That's how I felt.

292
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,870
As soon as you see our performance, you'll forget the ones before,

293
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,290
and you'll forget the ones after.

294
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,878
Only YOUNITE's "Armageddon" will stay in your head.

295
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,379
(Round 3, D-1)

296
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,219
We'll quickly set up for YOUNITE.

297
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
(Round 3, D-Day)

298
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,460
(Shouting)

299
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,129
We really created an apocalypse.

300
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,658
This is so cool.

301
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,775
(The members are seeing the full set for the first time.)

302
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,570
Our imaginations became a reality.

303
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,299
It was so large in scale. It really made me excited.

304
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,870
"We get to perform on a stage like this?"

305
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,509
"I really want to give a good performance." That's what I thought.

306
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,615
Let's feel confident about our performance and dominate.

307
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,950
- Nice. Let's go. - Okay.

308
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,449
(Growling)

309
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,079
- Nice. - Let's go.

310
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Let's be careful.

311
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,830
- One, two, three! - One, two, three!

312
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:28,919
- Let's go. - Okay.

313
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,190
We'll show everyone.

314
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,559
I'll make sure to show everyone who I am.

315
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,359
We still have a chance to show everyone.

316
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,919
We're going to burn everything up.

317
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,929
I'll get a good ranking as the ace...

318
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,399
and avoid elimination.

319
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,009
Team YOUNITE.

320
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:01,518
(420 days after an apocalypse)

321
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,590
(Humanity has been infected.)

322
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,566
- What is this? - What is this? Is it a movie?

323
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,028
- What is this? - Apocalypse? You were right.

324
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,129
- What is this? - Everyone did something like this.

325
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,929
- Apocalypse? - What?

326
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,240
- Disaster? - Humanity has been infected.

327
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,869
(420 days after an apocalypse)

328
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,799
(Humanity has been infected.)

329
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,969
(But a new generation of mankind who overcame the disaster...)

330
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,740
(began to emerge.)

331
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,950
("Armageddon" by YOUNITE)

332
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,758
(After an apocalypse, YOUNITE survives as humanity's last hope...)

333
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,696
(and will rebuild the world order with their special abilities.)

334
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,889
Oh, it collapsed.

335
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Aespa!

336
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,929
"Armageddon!"

337
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,070
They're doing "Armageddon?"

338
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,949
- What was that? - What was that just now?

339
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,019
- It changed! - What's that in the back?

340
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,039
Oh, it's a dance break.

341
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,450
Oh, nice dance break!

342
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,966
They did a good job rearranging the song.

343
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,100
I've never seen YOUNITE do something so intense.

344
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,000
Hey, HYUNGSEOK.

345
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:46,179
Hey, DEY.

346
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:48,620
EUNCHAN's love.

347
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,518
Where is this place now?

348
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,190
How are they managing to create this many areas on the stage?

349
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,759
Yes, this is it.

350
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,699
I see. Did he get rid of the zombies with the lights?

351
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Yes.

352
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,650
This is the kind of camera angle you would see in movies.

353
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Let's go!

354
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,430
- What's this? - What is this?

355
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,259
This is scary. Stop it.

356
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,078
(YOUNITE's ace, EUNSANG)

357
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,889
(You can watch the full performance on YouTube after the broadcast.)

358
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,548
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

359
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,949
(You can find "Armageddon" on music streaming services now.)

360
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,629
(Amazed)

361
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,730
(Shocked)

362
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,029
(They're speechless by this highly stimulating performance.)

363
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,229
(What is this?)

364
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,269
This is insane.

365
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,999
(Impressed)

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,140
Hey, they got my respect.

367
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,829
It was like watching an apocalypse on stage.

368
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,469
They turned dark again!

369
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,308
- Oh, no. YOUNITE. - What are we going to do?

370
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:01,308
You know, they're really good with their facial expressions.

371
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,778
I think they're facial expressions are improving day by day.

372
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,420
And I think the composition of the performance was great...

373
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,778
in terms of the camerawork and so on.

374
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,250
Every time the scenes changed, they got our full attention.

375
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,419
Since their performance will be judged through a video,

376
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,259
the camerawork plays an important role.

377
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,900
So they were smart about how to use the square stage.

378
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,469
YOUNITE is a strong contender when it comes to group performances.

379
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,629
- Right. - They really are.

380
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,768
- They're more than strong players. - They killed it.

381
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,045
They gave us a blockbuster-level performance.

382
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,298
Their performance this time around was no joke.

383
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,008
Right. It was no joke.

384
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,709
I loved their group choreography in the middle.

385
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,839
It was something we couldn't see from YOUNITE before.

386
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,680
YOUNITE always shocks us in a good way.

387
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,749
We always have high expectations of their performances.

388
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,519
But they always surpass our expectations.

389
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,819
YOUNITE did their thing once again.

390
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,088
It was good.

391
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,358
(Their intense performance ends in a matter of seconds.)

392
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,419
Nice!

393
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,460
- Nice! - Nice!

394
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,659
Well done!

395
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,298
- Good job. - Good job.

396
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,959
- Good work. - Nice.

397
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,768
All right. I have no regrets. We did our best. Seriously.

398
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,899
(Will YOUNITE be able to come back from a disappointing last round...)

399
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,220
(and advance to the final round?)

400
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,699
Next up, we have a group...

401
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,340
whose journey itself is an amazing story.

402
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,308
They were ranked first in the Evaluation Match.

403
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:04,838
Then they were ranked 7th in Round 1.

404
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,409
Then in Round Two, they avoided getting eliminated...

405
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,879
- with their talent. - Seriously.

406
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,985
This group successfully bounced back from the bottom.

407
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,650
It's 8TURN.

408
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,919
(8TURN)

409
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Okay!

410
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,189
- 8TURN! - Yes!

411
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,288
(Let's go, Team Youngest!)

412
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,960
Let's go, Team Youngest!

413
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,258
Just like YOUNITE, 8TURN also chose...

414
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,166
a song from a famous fourth-generation girl group.

415
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,329
- What? - A girl group?

416
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,230
The fourth-generation?

417
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,528
- What? - A girl group?

418
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,069
- A girl group? - Seriously?

419
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,839
They chose a song from a famous fourth-generation girl group, IVE.

420
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,469
What?

421
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,240
They chose IVE's song?

422
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:38,508
(Shocked)

423
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:39,509
IVE?

424
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,009
- What? There's CRAVITY too. - This is going to be fun.

425
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,150
IVE?

426
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:45,518
(They're already excited about it.)

427
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,319
- IVE? - IVE?

428
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,249
Shouldn't they have gotten our permission first?

429
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,250
IVE?

430
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,088
Why would they need our permission?

431
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,690
Don't you think you're being too bossy?

432
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,059
(I was joking.)

433
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,088
(Let's go, guys.)

434
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,630
- All right. Let's go. - Guys.

435
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,868
MYUNG HO. You killed it in the Fire Stage.

436
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,309
It's time to shine in the water now.

437
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,298
I'm going to be in my element.

438
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,000
- Okay. - Nice.

439
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,308
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

440
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,368
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

441
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,940
8TURN!

442
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,740
- Nice! You got this! - Hey, let's go!

443
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,649
Well done.

444
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,709
- Right. - Yes.

445
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,750
Almost everyone cried. Only KYUNG MIN and YOON SUNG didn't cry.

446
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:22,788
(8TURN ranked high in both matches in Round 2...)

447
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,660
(and escaped the crisis of getting eliminated.)

448
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,359
(They shed happy tears after going through a tough time.)

449
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,099
But unfortunately,

450
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,268
we still have a long way to go.

451
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:38,299
- Right. - We have another challenge.

452
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,298
There's always a challenge after a challenge.

453
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,508
- Of course. - I think the ace for this round...

454
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,209
- will play a crucial role... - Right.

455
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,679
- Totally. - because...

456
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,640
Round Three could possibly be our last performance.

457
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,549
So we have to get ourselves together and kill it.

458
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,920
Well, I feel bad...

459
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,390
to MYUNG HO for saying this again.

460
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,818
We got a good result in Round Two.

461
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,818
(MYUNG HO brought them a good result as the ace of Round 2.)

462
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,129
- He's on the rise... - Right.

463
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,789
- these days. - I agree.

464
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,229
- You... - Do you guys believe in me?

465
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,028
- I do. - How could I not?

466
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,469
Of course. All of us believe in you.

467
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,028
Okay. I'll do my best.

468
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,298
We always have faith in you.

469
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,369
I'll give it a try.

470
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,508
Then let's talk about some songs.

471
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,769
- Okay. - Sounds good.

472
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,740
The theme is no limit.

473
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,508
- I want to do something original. - I agree.

474
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,880
That's just what I think.

475
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,220
Our goal is to reach a lot of people and show them who we are.

476
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,789
Picking a popular song,

477
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,519
so people recognize the song could be a good strategy too.

478
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,190
Then how about a song no group has covered before?

479
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,229
- Like a song from a girl group. - A girl group?

480
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,160
- The theme is No Limit, after all. - Totally.

481
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,599
That will be original for sure.

482
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,940
For a male group to cover a female group's song,

483
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,108
- there will be a risk for sure. - Right.

484
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:51,209
Some people might be just against it without a real reason.

485
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,139
- Right. - But if we go with this strategy...

486
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,048
and kill it,

487
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,149
we can win over those people who were against it...

488
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,348
- Right. - at first.

489
00:22:58,349 --> 00:22:59,879
When there's a high risk,

490
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,040
- Our return will be high. - our return could be high.

491
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,189
Right! Remember what you talked about before?

492
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,858
Wouldn't that be nice for this?

493
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,018
"LOVE DIVE" by IVE?

494
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,429
I briefly talked about "LOVE DIVE" by IVE to him.

495
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,659
- "LOVE DIVE?" - I know this for sure. If we do it,

496
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,199
we'll definitely grab some attention.

497
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,299
That sounds good.

498
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,669
The song we chose for Round Three is...

499
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,369
"LOVE DIVE" by IVE.

500
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,670
Love dive

501
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,808
(This mega hit song that was the number 1 song of the year...)

502
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,450
(brought the Grand Award to IVE.)

503
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,249
The identity within the song...

504
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,650
and the concept of the song were clear.

505
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,189
The theme was No Limit.

506
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,758
If we just go with a cheerful and energetic performance,

507
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,660
we would be just limited to what we're good at.

508
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,530
Challenging ourselves to something we haven't done before...

509
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,199
would be breaking the limit...

510
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
and bring us out of our comfort zone.

511
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:51,369
So we were more drawn to "LOVE DIVE."

512
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,538
(The catchy chorus and the sound of percussion instruments...)

513
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,409
(are the key features of the song. This title track embodies...)

514
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,250
(IVE's confidence, self-esteem, and identity.)

515
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,380
To help you become narcissistic,

516
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,278
I'll compliment you 100 times.

517
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,150
That will be our homework for our ace.

518
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,419
You're shining so much that the necklace looks dull on you.

519
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,449
I know.

520
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,480
(Wriggling his eyebrows)

521
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,019
My gosh. He said, "I know."

522
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,490
I can't do it.

523
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,589
Next, JAE YUN.

524
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,390
Go ahead. Show me what you got.

525
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,429
I think we'll spoil MYUNG HO.

526
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,299
(Laughing)

527
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,298
- Gosh. - He's younger than me, though.

528
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,859
(It's another peaceful day with 8TURN.)

529
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,739
It's from a Greek myth.

530
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,838
Narcissus sees his own reflection in the pond.

531
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,440
And he ends up drowning in the original Greek myth.

532
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,779
But our story won't follow the same ending.

533
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,279
He thought he fell into the pond.

534
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,679
But he didn't.

535
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,049
- We never die. - Yes.

536
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,749
We keep coming back from the dead.

537
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,849
(8TURN never dies.)

538
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,618
We need to work on our choreography.

539
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,019
Let's start with the chorus.

540
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,990
How should we do this?

541
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,459
Just film it however you want.

542
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,659
- Can I? - Yes.

543
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,798
(YOON SUNG, the cameraman for 8TURN)

544
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,799
- Dive - Dive.

545
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,939
For the team performance of Round Three,

546
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,639
there won't be an audience to judge our performance.

547
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,509
We were told that they would judge solely based on our video.

548
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:08,479
We had to think about how we wanted to capture our performance...

549
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,950
for specific segments.

550
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,518
(Utterly passionate)

551
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,579
Did you get that?

552
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,719
(Filmed by YOON SUNG)

553
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,849
Why is he so good?

554
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,789
(8TURN improved to the point that they're considering the camerawork.)

555
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,989
One, two, three, four.

556
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,058
Five, six, seven, eight.

557
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,598
We wanted to show people something different.

558
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,500
We added a segment with tutting.

559
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,169
There's one more wow point with our performance.

560
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,969
It's MYUNG HO's video clip.

561
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,268
The underwater video.

562
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,149
He really held his breath and dove in for love.

563
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,539
(Amazed)

564
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,309
(Chatty)

565
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,808
(8TURN arrives at the underwater filming studio.)

566
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,729
- This is amazing. - You know this feels like...

567
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,719
I'm Princess Jasmine.

568
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,588
(MYUNG HO puts on the stage costume to film the video.)

569
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,318
- You look beautiful. - You already look so pretty.

570
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,558
(Look at his blingy attire. This is Narcissus.)

571
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,619
You already look pretty.

572
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:58,399
When he falls into the water, he will turn into a daffodil.

573
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,699
We thought about how we could depict my falling into the water.

574
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,099
Then we decided to go with an underwater video.

575
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:07,269
(It was filmed safely with the guidance of an expert.)

576
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,038
(MYUNG HO goes into the water tank to film the video.)

577
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,910
- The water is cold. - It is?

578
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,579
(Flustered by the unexpectedly cold water)

579
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,380
It's colder than I thought.

580
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,619
- You got this! - Good luck.

581
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,549
Let's go in. One, two, three.

582
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,929
(Narcissus finally dives in.)

583
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,730
Don't cover your face. Okay.

584
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,328
(Struggling)

585
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,000
Five more seconds!

586
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,469
Are you all right?

587
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,240
(He looks flustered even from behind.)

588
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,008
It was completely different from swimming.

589
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,670
I had to stay in the water, but it was difficult.

590
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,939
(His arms are shaking because he's cold.)

591
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,279
Let's go. One, two, three. Go.

592
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,720
Okay.

593
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,879
That must be hard.

594
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,520
(He's standing up instead of lying down.)

595
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,539
(He kicked in the water, so it's not good.)

596
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,219
- Beautiful. - Gosh.

597
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,230
Don't laugh.

598
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,790
- You can't laugh. - You must hold back your laughter.

599
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,460
Okay. You can't breathe through your nose.

600
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,499
I think this is way too hot.

601
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,245
(The members prepare warm water for MYUNG HO.)

602
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,339
It's really hot.

603
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,646
- Gosh, it's colder than I thought. - It's really hot.

604
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,710
Be careful.

605
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,470
Are you okay?

606
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,710
- Is it good? - Are you okay?

607
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,380
(They're the best.)

608
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,280
You look beautiful. You're doing a great job.

609
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,778
- All right. - Go.

610
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,720
(He resumes filming with their support.)

611
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,789
- He got it. - My gosh.

612
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:32,519
You look great in that spot.

613
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,920
My gosh. What is this?

614
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:35,690
Nice.

615
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,089
Oh, my!

616
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,960
I knew it. Our ace is killing it.

617
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,159
Nice!

618
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,029
(He safely films the underwater video.)

619
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,799
That was legendary.

620
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,669
This performance...

621
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,338
will be a challenge even for us.

622
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,710
It's an adventure.

623
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,909
This time around, instead of emphasizing on our young energy,

624
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,910
we'll put on a gorgeous and beautiful performance.

625
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,519
We tried our best to fulfill that goal of ours.

626
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,719
We received a pretty good score...

627
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,250
with the Fire and Water Stages in Round Three.

628
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,530
So I want to make sure we get another good score...

629
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,289
with this team performance.

630
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,259
We're going to bounce back.

631
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,269
Team 8TURN.

632
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,209
For 8TURN, Round Three is a huge opportunity.

633
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,318
- They got good scores... - This can be their chance.

634
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,518
- from the Ace Battles. - They did well.

635
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,618
This is a great chance for them to bounce back.

636
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,490
If they rank well with this performance too...

637
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,788
This will be hit-or-miss.

638
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:41,058
I have no idea what to expect.

639
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,259
It's going to start.

640
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,730
(Focused)

641
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,659
- Let's go. - What's this?

642
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,500
(What kind of "LOVE DIVE" will 8TURN show us?)

643
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,039
- My gosh. - What's that?

644
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,710
- That's good. - Is that a bond?

645
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,410
He's fascinated by his own reflection.

646
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,150
He looks beautiful. This is crazy!

647
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,179
- That's the origin... - Gosh.

648
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,700
- of narcissism. - Gosh. Look at that.

649
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,289
("LOVE DIVE" by 8TURN)

650
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,959
(The story of Narcissus was adopted for the performance.)

651
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,459
(The ace, MYUNG HO, will play Narcissus.)

652
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,629
(It depicts his journey of transforming...)

653
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,350
(into a daffodil, the symbol of self-love.)

654
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,960
My gosh. They have my respect for this.

655
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,890
The staging was insane.

656
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,139
- What was that? - What?

657
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,420
- It broke it again. - It broke.

658
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,839
He shouldn't litter.

659
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,339
- That's a flower. - Really?

660
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,400
What is this? They look so sexy.

661
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,768
With this arrangement,

662
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,849
it doesn't remind me of the original version at all.

663
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,900
I love concepts like this.

664
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,005
I've never seen this kind of performance from 8TURN before.

665
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,430
It's dreamy but hip.

666
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,930
Gosh, they totally drew us in.

667
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,019
They do look beautiful.

668
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,230
(Surprised)

669
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,329
(This is what I'm talking about.)

670
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:41,799
- This is it. - MIN HO!

671
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,000
What a beautiful scene.

672
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,230
This group is well-balanced.

673
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,569
Hey.

674
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,750
They did a great job staging this part.

675
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,318
(King Tut is inspired by the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.)

676
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,329
King Tut.

677
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,828
(Amazed)

678
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,190
- What? - He's good.

679
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,539
This is insane.

680
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,740
Gosh, how beautiful.

681
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,420
(Surprised)

682
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,119
- Gosh. - Goodness!

683
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,866
- This planning was insane. - This is crazy.

684
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,789
Oh, my gosh!

685
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:53,000
He looks like a mermaid.

686
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,349
- He's wet. - He's wet!

687
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
- He's really wet for real. - When did he get wet?

688
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,449
(8TURN's ace, MYUNG HO)

689
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,118
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

690
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,756
(The number of views will be reflected in the finals.)

691
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,425
(You can find "LOVE DIVE" by 8TURN on music streaming services now.)

692
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,849
- My gosh, they also... - Goodness.

693
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,789
They also made a movie.

694
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,788
This is so fun.

695
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,666
(They're definitely going to watch this movie again.)

696
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,410
Personally, their performance was the best!

697
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,259
- It's right up your alley. - I love it!

698
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,469
Is it to your liking?

699
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,098
Gosh, that was amazing.

700
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,899
- It was a new side of 8TURN. - Yes.

701
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,340
My gosh. I really didn't see this one coming.

702
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,510
The composition of the performance made me think it was beautiful.

703
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,209
The theme, No Limit,

704
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,480
could mean that there was no limit on stage.

705
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,219
But they let go of their hip image...

706
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,150
and went after a new concept.

707
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,289
That was quite fitting for this theme, breaking the limit.

708
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:19,760
They definitely showed us a new side of them.

709
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,389
- MYUNG HO had the hardest job. - Well done, MYUNG HO.

710
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,288
- Great job. - Great work.

711
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,899
- Well done! - Great job!

712
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,198
(Will they be able to get another positive feedback...)

713
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,500
(with the team performance?)

714
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,739
The 5th team to perform for the 2nd round of Round 3 is...

715
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,368
ONEUS.

716
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:36,570
(The fifth performance by ONEUS)

717
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,468
Gosh. Let's go.

718
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,509
ONEUS!

719
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,538
(Laughing)

720
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,109
- Let's go! - Let's go.

721
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,210
Good luck.

722
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:45,099
This is the most important one for us.

723
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,456
It's the most important one, guys.

724
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,218
By the way, ONEUS was dressed in hanbok.

725
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,288
- Right. - Yes.

726
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,718
- I'm curious. Their hanbok... - Right.

727
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,718
Their concept is unparalleled.

728
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,459
- Only they can pull it off. - Right.

729
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,166
Honestly, they shouldn't be allowed to use that.

730
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,030
Let's go.

731
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,219
In order to advance to the final round,

732
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,745
by selecting a surefire concept they're the most confident about,

733
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:06,400
they are making their winning move.

734
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,139
Their ace is an all-rounder of ONEUS.

735
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,909
- HWAN WOONG? - SEO HO?

736
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:16,449
SEO HO stepped up as the ace and raised the quality of the stage.

737
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,980
SEO HO is the ace.

738
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,155
I think he'll crush it with his singing.

739
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,949
HWAN WOONG's winning streak is over.

740
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,149
I think he'll show us a powerful performance.

741
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:28,059
After getting the lowest score in the Ace Battle,

742
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,590
I expect them to be very angry.

743
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
It'll be a stage of fury.

744
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,630
It's upsetting.

745
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:40,698
(LEE DO was in 6th place in the Fire Stage.)

746
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,610
(ONEUS was always in 1st place in the Ace Ranking.)

747
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,539
(It's an emergency as they are no longer in 1st place.)

748
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,449
(CRAVITY will rise significantly.)

749
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,119
There was a 5,000-point difference with the team in 1st place.

750
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,190
We're in trouble.

751
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,519
If we aren't careful,

752
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:03,359
we could lose our place...

753
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,760
as first place in the Ace Ranking.

754
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,469
(SEO HO's shoulders are heavy as he tries to maintain their ranking.)

755
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,139
(What kind of victory stage did ONEUS prepare?)

756
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:16,469
(After the 2nd round, ONEUS' meeting day)

757
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,309
Who was going to be the ace for Round Three?

758
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Who was it?

759
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:22,909
- SEO HO. - All right.

760
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,280
(Feeling awkward)

761
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,549
Since you're representing us,

762
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,820
- don't feel burdened. - Okay.

763
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,919
- If you do well, it's our victory. - Right.

764
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,280
If you don't do well, it's on you.

765
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm just kidding.

766
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,428
- I did well in the past round. - That's right.

767
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,429
- He proved himself. - Right.

768
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,730
Just show it to everyone again.

769
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,829
(SEO HO put on a variety of performances.)

770
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,369
(SEO HO proved himself as the all-rounder of ONEUS.)

771
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,670
You got this.

772
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,239
Of course. I'll bring out my specialty.

773
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,340
(Looking confident)

774
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
I'll do my best.

775
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,380
- Okay. - I'll do my best.

776
00:37:57,381 --> 00:38:00,849
This is the No Limit Mission.

777
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,019
- There are no restrictions. - Right.

778
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,820
Although there are many options to choose from with no limits,

779
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,888
I think our songs are the best choice...

780
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,388
to put on a stage that shows our character.

781
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:11,389
- Yes. - That's right.

782
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,699
I think it's about time we did what I have in mind.

783
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,900
It's time for us to use our secret weapon.

784
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,199
Let's go with a Korean style.

785
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,440
(Gasping)

786
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,639
I think the other teams expected us to do it...

787
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,809
in Round Two.

788
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,348
When I think about ONEUS,

789
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,320
- period dramas come to my mind. - That's right.

790
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
Asian style?

791
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,718
- "LIT." - Yes, "LIT."

792
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,348
- The song called "LIT." - Right.

793
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,389
They might do it again.

794
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,360
Doing "LIT" would be a cheat key.

795
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
(Lit!)

796
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:47,658
On the last season of Road to Kingdom,

797
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,129
they got a good score with "LIT."

798
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,169
It also caused a sensation.

799
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,245
(The Korean style that helped ONEUS make a lasting impression)

800
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,409
Could we put on a better performance than that one?

801
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:59,238
- Right. - I asked myself that too.

802
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:02,309
We'd like to use this chance to overcome our limit as well.

803
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,309
Let's go with the Korean style.

804
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:07,449
But I want to sing our song "LUNA."

805
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,600
- It's a good song. - I see.

806
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:14,289
It was the first song loved by many people.

807
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,429
It gave us the valuable gift of winning first place.

808
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,159
The lyrics are pretty expressions in Korean without any English words.

809
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,999
It's also the performance with the highest quality.

810
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,800
It's one of our most precious songs.

811
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,669
SEO HO pushed for it when we were choosing the title track.

812
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,951
I don't know what could be the title track if that isn't.

813
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,086
"If the album doesn't do well, will you take responsibility?"

814
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,678
You said, "Yes, I will."

815
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,848
- Then you kept pushing for it. - Right.

816
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,449
If we go with "LUNA,"

817
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:40,479
I think we'd be confident, and I'm confident.

818
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,819
It's important for you to be confident.

819
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,820
- That's right. - Of course.

820
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,018
I listened to it the most and can perform it the best.

821
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,019
- That's right. - Seriously.

822
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,030
I want to go to the finals in first place.

823
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,800
I prepared "LUNA,"

824
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,020
which is a Korean style performance, our hidden card.

825
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,499
(Using Asian musical instruments and the form of Korean poetry, )

826
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,729
("LUNA" is the title track of the 6th mini album...)

827
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,940
(that has a traditional Korean style.)

828
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:05,210
There's something I wished we did better in the past stages.

829
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,808
- We chose distinct concepts. - Yes, we did.

830
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:10,449
But we weren't very good at storytelling.

831
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,718
I think it'd be a good idea to come up with a storyline.

832
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,919
When we came out with "LUNA,"

833
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,389
the intro "Window..."

834
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,759
(Five monsters that show up whenever there is a blood moon)

835
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,590
is about five monsters.

836
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,030
What if we adapt that story to it?

837
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:29,059
"LUNA" is sentimental...

838
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,368
- and a bit sad. - That's right.

839
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:35,000
Why don't we use the monster by...

840
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,679
creating the love story of someone that is half-human and half-monster?

841
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,079
The love story will have a sad ending.

842
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,380
It's a doomed love story.

843
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,679
- Gosh. - It's a doomed love story.

844
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,819
- A doomed love story. - It's what we're best at.

845
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,150
It has a sad ending.

846
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,989
Which part would be the best to express that emotion?

847
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,159
I think the bridge is the key.

848
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,175
The bridge that goes, "I search everywhere for you?"

849
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,428
(I search everywhere for you)

850
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,698
(The flower I thoughtlessly pass is beautiful, it's you)

851
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:04,599
It feels like he's regretful.

852
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,968
We'll express the sad emotions...

853
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:10,209
and bring this to the intro.

854
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,010
We can create that image in the intro...

855
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,609
before we start the first verse.

856
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,948
Then you'll show the audience the whole story.

857
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,179
(That's a good idea.)

858
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,519
We have to put on a stage...

859
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:25,320
that is better than the Korean style performances we put on so far.

860
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,760
If we want to show it visually,

861
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,730
what if we use a mask as I turn into a monster?

862
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,800
I break free from it for the woman I love.

863
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,099
(Nodding)

864
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,969
(They put their ideas into action right away.)

865
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,440
(With the various ideas of the members, )

866
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,669
(the performance slowly comes together.)

867
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,739
It's the No Limit Mission.

868
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,650
We'll be showing our limits in this competition,

869
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,449
so we won't just be singing and dancing.

870
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,049
(ONEUS tries to overcome their own limitations.)

871
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,119
How can we make the most of this angle?

872
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,590
We could be revolutionary.

873
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,959
(Mumbling)

874
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,690
What if we flip the camera over?

875
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,428
We had to think of ways...

876
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:10,900
to maximize our emotions.

877
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,799
- Hello. - Hello.

878
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,369
It's warm here.

879
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,638
Let's see.

880
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,039
(Where is SEO HO?)

881
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,909
(A few days ago)

882
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,109
(Focused)

883
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,179
I'm half-human and half-monster.

884
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,949
So I'm a monster.

885
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,389
Whenever there is a blood moon, I lose my mind.

886
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,920
In this story, I end up hurting the woman I love.

887
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,190
That would be the saddest moment for me.

888
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,230
I'm looking for a reference.

889
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,530
(Thinking)

890
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,369
Underwater shoots.

891
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,440
(Marveling)

892
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,570
I think it'd be something like this.

893
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:53,440
It would be nice to fall like this.

894
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:55,579
Go.

895
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,009
(SEO HO throws himself without hesitation.)

896
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,050
Go for it.

897
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,079
I became the character in the story...

898
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,449
and tried my best to make the story easy to understand.

899
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:10,428
This was my first time shooting underwater.

900
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:11,429
(Bumping)

901
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,800
(Shooting underwater was more difficult than expected.)

902
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:18,969
The toughest part of shooting underwater was...

903
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,210
that I had to think about everything from my facial expression...

904
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:27,880
to my fingers in the water.

905
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,949
I wasn't as good as expressing emotions as I thought.

906
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,320
- Try bending your body. - Like a shrimp.

907
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,589
I think it'd look better if my head were dropping.

908
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,390
I think it'd look better if I went in deeper.

909
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,760
To go in deeper,

910
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,530
I could put something in my clothes.

911
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,630
Keep it like that.

912
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:48,360
(They add weights for a better picture.)

913
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,900
Get ready and go.

914
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,739
(Going into the water)

915
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:55,368
(SEO HO's effort and hard work...)

916
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:57,909
(show in the shoot.)

917
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,980
Okay, cut. We got it.

918
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,750
As the ace of Round Three,

919
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,879
I will overcome my limitations and win first place.

920
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
All right.

921
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:11,441
(Will they be able to win 1st place with their victory concept?)

922
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,429
Team ONEUS.

923
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,469
("LUNA" by ONEUS)

924
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,308
(The song was arranged in a gukak style with powerful sounds...)

925
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:36,555
(to give the beautiful and tragic love story a dramatic touch.)

926
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:38,049
(ONEUS)

927
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,356
- I think it's one of their songs. - I think it's ONEUS' song.

928
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,250
This is "LUNA," right?

929
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,400
- No. - No.

930
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,276
- Did he fall in the water again? - What?

931
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,209
- They did that too? - They fall in the water too?

932
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,210
It's overlapped.

933
00:45:04,211 --> 00:45:05,409
Did he fall? No way.

934
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,939
(The screen is not paused.)

935
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,710
Wait. How could this be?

936
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,420
There are five monsters that cannot die.

937
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:24,328
How is this monster so handsome?

938
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:25,730
- A monster? - This is scary.

939
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:30,530
Whenever there is a blood moon, he turns into his true ugly self.

940
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,500
My heart is so sad.

941
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,679
He wanders around searching for his loved one again.

942
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:42,440
His loved one? He's in love?

943
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,510
This is practically a drama.

944
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,889
(He wanders around searching for his loved one again.)

945
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:09,609
(Marveling at his good looks)

946
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,710
He has long hair.

947
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,949
- It looks good on him. - He's really pretty.

948
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,868
- They're doing it. - Here it comes.

949
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,345
(They bring out their secret weapon.)

950
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,729
- They're totally in sync. - Gosh.

951
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,679
They used their ultimate move.

952
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,949
ONEUS shouldn't be allowed to use fans.

953
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,370
- Gosh. - That's so beautiful.

954
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,690
What's that?

955
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,670
- This is a plot twist. - The monster.

956
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,839
(Gasping automatically)

957
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,869
It's so pretty.

958
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,739
It's a blood moon.

959
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,540
She said he changes during a blood moon.

960
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,739
Is he going to change into a monster?

961
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:26,399
- The monster. - It's the monster.

962
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,239
- Gosh. - Gosh, what's that?

963
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:42,649
Is he transforming into a monster?

964
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:55,039
- Something is going up in the back. - What is it?

965
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,039
He must've died.

966
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,509
- I missed it. - Gosh.

967
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,009
(This screen isn't paused.)

968
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,610
That's the monster's mask.

969
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,820
What?

970
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,519
It's so beautiful.

971
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,360
This is the beauty of Korea.

972
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:19,449
It's so sad.

973
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,119
It's like a drama.

974
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,788
(ONEUS' ace, SEO HO)

975
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,459
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

976
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,459
(The number of views will be reflected in the finals.)

977
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,768
(You can find "LUNA" by ONEUS...)

978
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,369
(on music streaming services right now.)

979
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,000
What happened?

980
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,599
He was with someone at the start but is alone now.

981
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,710
- He couldn't save her. - Oh, no.

982
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
(Gasping)

983
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:43,039
She left leaving her clothes behind.

984
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:44,879
Didn't she die because of him?

985
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,249
- Gosh. - You're right.

986
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,449
- I got goosebumps. - Me too.

987
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,288
It feels like I watched a K-drama.

988
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:51,289
- I know. - Seriously.

989
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,849
This is real K-pop.

990
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,158
SEO HO's voice was more impressive than anything else.

991
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,260
- You're right. - Gosh.

992
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,599
SEO HO was the ace.

993
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,428
He sang and acted,

994
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:05,170
which was very moving.

995
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:07,699
The fact that I could feel beauty in someone's voice...

996
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:10,710
proved that he was the ace. I loved it.

997
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,840
They used their killer technique in the No Limit Mission.

998
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,750
Maybe we made a mistake by making them go before us.

999
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,679
The thought went through my head.

1000
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,279
- You did a great job. - Hey.

1001
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,590
- Good job. - Good job.

1002
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:26,459
I gave the stage my everything.

1003
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,018
I can't forget...

1004
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,760
how good and relieved I felt when it was over.

1005
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,730
When the performance was over,

1006
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:34,928
I felt like I wanted to show it...

1007
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:36,198
to more people.

1008
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,929
That's how satisfactory the stage was.

1009
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,340
You did a good job!

1010
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,239
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace,

1011
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,610
Round Three, No Limit Mission.

1012
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,579
This is the long-awaited final team.

1013
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:51,480
It's already the last team.

1014
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,509
I waited a long time for this.

1015
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,888
As the team that decided the order on the cue sheet,

1016
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:59,888
CRAVITY was confident enough to choose to go last.

1017
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,859
(CRAVITY will be performing the last stage.)

1018
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,159
Let's go, CRAVITY.

1019
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,690
Let's go head-to-head.

1020
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,729
I wonder which song they chose.

1021
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,730
I'm so excited.

1022
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,198
This team's strategy...

1023
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,030
is a new ace...

1024
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,238
for Round Three.

1025
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:15,969
- What? - A new ace?

1026
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,840
(Their expectations rise.)

1027
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,909
It's SERIM, CRAVITY's leader.

1028
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,980
- Now he steps up. - I see.

1029
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:28,469
- He's finally the ace. - I've been waiting for this.

1030
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,666
You've mentioned him since the Evaluation Match.

1031
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,690
(You're right.)

1032
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,460
- It's about time. - You're right.

1033
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,359
- He'll probably be mind-blowing. - I bet.

1034
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,388
I'm curious.

1035
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:37,905
(What kind of stage will push CRAVITY's limits with a new ace?)

1036
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,129
(Round 3, D-10)

1037
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,158
(Where is CRAVITY gathered?)

1038
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,269
One, two, three, four.

1039
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,139
(CRAVITY's fan concert)

1040
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,070
(A precious moment they prepared for their fans during the competition)

1041
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,178
(They are fully charged...)

1042
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:57,259
(as the concert ends with an enthusiastic audience.)

1043
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,018
- Good job. - Good job.

1044
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,448
- Good job. - Good job.

1045
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,718
- Good job. - Good job.

1046
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,419
The hard work isn't over but just beginning.

1047
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,759
- This is just the start. - It's just the start.

1048
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,319
- That's right. - Get ready for Round Three.

1049
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,029
- Let's try our best. - All right.

1050
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,359
(They officially begin preparing for Round 3.)

1051
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,199
We have to choose the ace for Round Three.

1052
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,529
I heard the other teams...

1053
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,138
often mentioned SERIM...

1054
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:23,510
during the Evaluation Match and other rounds.

1055
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,868
- Right. - Yes.

1056
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,368
(Out of the members of CRAVITY, )

1057
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,009
(I think it'll be SERIM.)

1058
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,249
(As the expected ace of CRAVITY, )

1059
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,049
(SERIM was constantly mentioned.)

1060
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,479
(He's the leader and the main rapper.)

1061
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,849
(He is also the center of their performances.)

1062
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,049
Our ace in Round Three...

1063
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,558
- is SERIM. - SERIM.

1064
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,359
- Yes. - Our leader.

1065
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,459
A new ace.

1066
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,859
I bet our leader was waiting for this moment.

1067
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,329
The leader will be in charge in Round Three.

1068
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:49,859
Our Ace Ranking...

1069
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,098
is constantly rising.

1070
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:54,098
I'll make sure to take our team to the top this time.

1071
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:55,199
- All right. - Yes.

1072
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,368
- We were 3rd in the 1st round, - Nice.

1073
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:59,009
- then 2nd in the 2nd round, - Second place.

1074
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,078
- and 1st place in the 3rd round. - First place.

1075
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,879
- Ace. - That's the perfect narrative.

1076
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,578
We aren't applying pressure on you, are we?

1077
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:05,749
No, I got this.

1078
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,448
(This is the spirit of a leader.)

1079
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:10,848
He is also perfect...

1080
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:12,949
- for "Overdose" by EXO. - That's right.

1081
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,229
We chose SERIM as our ace for this round.

1082
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,058
We wondered what would be a good match and make him shine.

1083
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,928
We wanted something dark and sexy,

1084
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,738
showing that CRAVITY has no limits.

1085
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:28,339
We decided to try something new.

1086
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,110
We wanted to prepare a stage...

1087
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,339
that had a bit of madness in it.

1088
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,110
That's why we chose "Overdose."

1089
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,649
(An urban dance song based on hip-hop and RnB, )

1090
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,419
("Overdose" is the title track of their 2nd mini album...)

1091
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,279
(that depicts someone obsessed with toxic love.)

1092
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,419
Let's begin our meeting.

1093
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,420
- Okay. - Okay.

1094
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:49,118
Starting from the beginning to Round Two,

1095
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,089
the ideas of the members...

1096
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,359
were reflected quite a lot in the stages.

1097
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,229
If you have ideas...

1098
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,569
as the performers that will be on the stage,

1099
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,368
it would be helpful to not only us, but also the production team.

1100
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:04,408
That's why I wanted to gather together.

1101
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:05,469
- Okay. - All right.

1102
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:06,980
- "Overdose." - "Overdose."

1103
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:09,078
We have the specific keyword...

1104
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:10,808
- "overdose." - That's right.

1105
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,349
It'll go smoothly once we choose a theme.

1106
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:16,018
In the lyrics of our song "Adrenaline,"

1107
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,090
there is a part that goes, "you're venom that spreads through me."

1108
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,619
- Venom? - If it's you,

1109
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,729
I'd gladly take an overdose.

1110
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,829
(That's good.)

1111
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,299
(He comes up with the idea to mix "Overdose...")

1112
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,598
(with venom from his part in "Adrenaline.")

1113
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,499
We will be addicted to the venom.

1114
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,999
- Venom is a good idea. - Venom.

1115
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,269
SERIM and venom. SENOM?

1116
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:40,279
- SENOM? - SENOM?

1117
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,379
That would be cool.

1118
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,308
- Venom is a really good idea. - I like it.

1119
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:45,448
- I have an idea. - Go ahead, nerd.

1120
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:46,678
We used a broken sword...

1121
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,348
- in the Evaluation Match, - Right.

1122
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:50,089
And a hand...

1123
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,949
- in Round One. - Yes.

1124
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,259
I need something that touches the hearts...

1125
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,530
- of nerds. - You need something?

1126
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:01,328
When he mentioned venom,

1127
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:03,828
an idea came to my mind. We could use a magnet.

1128
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:05,029
Black liquid.

1129
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,499
When it comes up.

1130
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,738
(We can use magnetic fluid to portray Venom.)

1131
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,238
SERIM is the ace,

1132
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,510
so we can use an effect of something...

1133
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:15,209
spreading in his body as if he's being poisoned.

1134
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,956
It'd be so cool if we could actually pull it off.

1135
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,078
I like that.

1136
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,709
We need venom itself...

1137
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,679
for the audience to understand.

1138
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,550
- Nerd. - Hey.

1139
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:25,819
- He's got a great idea. - Good idea.

1140
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,419
We need such an idea.

1141
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,860
Yes. It's essential.

1142
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,229
The title is "Overdose,"

1143
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,089
so it can be...

1144
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,698
about being addicted to a type of gas.

1145
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:37,368
Now that you mention that,

1146
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:39,098
the first line is,

1147
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:42,099
"I bet everything to gulp you down."

1148
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:45,409
We could get a respirator...

1149
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,779
We all have our rooms,

1150
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,440
and we're locked up by our anxiety.

1151
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,609
And the rooms are filled with smog.

1152
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,150
The smog is so full that the room breaks.

1153
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,119
One of the most crucial parts of a performance is...

1154
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,089
- the outfit. - Yes.

1155
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,888
We could start wearing pure-white clothes.

1156
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:05,488
Maybe we could add different colors in the ending.

1157
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:08,530
The choreography in the chorus...

1158
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,768
I'm able to picture the performance in my head.

1159
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:12,769
(That's good.)

1160
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,138
Let's keep discussing it...

1161
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,839
and complete this performance.

1162
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,209
- All right. Great. - Thank you.

1163
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,385
(How will their ideas with no limits look on stage?)

1164
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:21,239
(A few days later in CRAVITY's practice studio)

1165
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:27,550
(The impacts and details are as important as the ideas.)

1166
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,018
The keyword "overdose" was so certain...

1167
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,488
that we kept practicing...

1168
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:37,359
to be able to use that keyword while maintaining...

1169
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,589
our distinct characteristics.

1170
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,029
SERIM is...

1171
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,329
extremely eager.

1172
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:47,099
He practices every gesture with all his effort,

1173
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:48,999
so I have no doubt about him.

1174
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,869
(He practiced alone even during the break.)

1175
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,210
SERIM.

1176
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,179
Good luck, leader.

1177
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,809
I'm sure it's tough, but good luck.

1178
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:59,510
I believe that you'll do well.

1179
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,480
SERIM is the leader, and...

1180
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,749
(A lucky charm for SERIM)

1181
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,788
Lucky!

1182
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:05,250
I'll give it to you too.

1183
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:06,590
It's my precious item.

1184
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:09,789
(Here's love from JUNGMO!)

1185
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,789
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1186
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:14,900
(They rehearse for the first time in the studio.)

1187
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,800
(But his movement timing was off from the start.)

1188
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,670
(And the crew members keep getting in the way.)

1189
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:26,408
(ALLEN and WONJIN are not in position during the group dance?)

1190
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:31,309
(They weren't able to leave the set after the previous moves.)

1191
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,679
(And the magnetic fluid moves slower than expected.)

1192
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:42,489
(He also failed to take the gloves off at the right time.)

1193
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,190
(The messy rehearsal ends.)

1194
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,599
What do we do with this?

1195
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,368
We should stand here to...

1196
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:52,968
If the door was here,

1197
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:54,939
we could have entered...

1198
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,739
and exited through this door.

1199
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,308
But that would take too much work to do that now.

1200
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:01,610
Let's reorganize it.

1201
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,149
We weren't familiar...

1202
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,178
with the stage directions we wanted to try out,

1203
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:10,079
so that didn't go so smoothly.

1204
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:13,789
Also, they shouldn't be able to see us when we move.

1205
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,519
We were doomed.

1206
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,860
To be honest, I thought we were doomed.

1207
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,030
It was the No Limit Mission, after all,

1208
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:24,499
and it was a great opportunity...

1209
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,039
to perform with the largest scale ever.

1210
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,339
In the monitor,

1211
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,510
I didn't think we were that overwhelming.

1212
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,178
(After the rehearsal, )

1213
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:39,050
(they seem depressed in the waiting room.)

1214
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,119
(Concerned)

1215
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:44,518
There are many parts where we move to props around...

1216
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:46,789
and a lot of transitions.

1217
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,359
It may have looked disordered in the rehearsal,

1218
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,058
so we can keep monitoring it to practice the new way.

1219
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,619
(SERIM comforts the disturbed members.)

1220
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:57,869
I could tell that the members were strong-willed from their eyes.

1221
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,670
I believed that we could pull off this performance.

1222
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,009
(Will they be able to give a show...)

1223
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:08,440
(that's expected from a high-ranking team?)

1224
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:11,380
We'll show them...

1225
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,050
that CRAVITY is on a whole new level.

1226
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,519
Team CRAVITY.

1227
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,999
CRAVITY...

1228
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,029
always brings surprising performances.

1229
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,570
I can't predict anything.

1230
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,599
- A mask? - It's a mask.

1231
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,670
Isn't that the same as ours?

1232
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,619
(To be continued shortly)

1233
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,530
("Overdose" by CRAVITY)

1234
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,029
(A performance that expresses the desire for an unknown power, )

1235
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,468
(the process of being consumed by it, and ultimately...)

1236
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:06,776
(breaking free from the addiction through CRAVITY's unique energy)

1237
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,669
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1238
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:09,769
No way!

1239
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,939
He drank something.

1240
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,909
- What is it? - He's poisoned.

1241
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,280
I think he drank a type of gas.

1242
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:29,759
- Hey! - Hey!

1243
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,259
It's the original choreography.

1244
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,380
You must have tried this if you were in a dance club.

1245
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,220
- You have to do it. - You have to use that part.

1246
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,400
It's the same one.

1247
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:52,550
It's intense.

1248
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,360
- Hey! - No way.

1249
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:08,760
That's so sexy.

1250
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:21,809
Hey.

1251
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,110
The original choreography.

1252
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,150
It's the same as the original.

1253
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,800
I got chills.

1254
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,280
What's that?

1255
01:02:58,179 --> 01:02:59,280
- What? - Are those hands?

1256
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,000
- What? Where is that? - Where is that?

1257
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,369
What on earth...

1258
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,029
How did they do it?

1259
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,070
- Gosh. - Where is that now?

1260
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,300
Nice, TAEYOUNG.

1261
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,969
I like his energy.

1262
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,170
Let's go!

1263
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,679
(He's about to step on the stage.)

1264
01:04:18,329 --> 01:04:19,760
Wait. SERIM isn't there.

1265
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,120
I think he's up to something.

1266
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:34,579
- What happened to his hand? - Is that mercury?

1267
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,539
Leech? Venom?

1268
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:38,679
Venom?

1269
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:40,619
That's insane.

1270
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,960
It's on his neck!

1271
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,780
What's that?

1272
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,019
It keeps changing.

1273
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,300
- "Hey, doctor!" - They're so cool.

1274
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:21,019
- Addicted. - Addicted.

1275
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,428
- The door opened again. - The tree is burning.

1276
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:39,429
There's more back there.

1277
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:40,768
There's more?

1278
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:42,239
The tree is burning!

1279
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:05,130
(CRAVITY's ace, SERIM)

1280
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,630
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1281
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,976
("Overdose" by CRAVITY will not be released due to copyright issues.)

1282
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,169
(Now, that's overdose.)

1283
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,070
It was so neat.

1284
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,440
The props and sets that we've never seen before...

1285
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:24,980
It gave me an impression that they chose the perfect theme.

1286
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:27,820
I was immersed in it the moment it began.

1287
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,019
The rearrangement that was developed from the original song...

1288
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,389
brought joy to the people who knew the original.

1289
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:38,230
They made great use of the advantage of a well-known song.

1290
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,788
That was awesome.

1291
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:40,800
(Amazed)

1292
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:42,949
- They did so well. - There were literally no limits.

1293
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,030
The stage production was so varied.

1294
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,069
- Great work. - Good job.

1295
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,670
- Yes! - Yes!

1296
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,940
- Good job, guys. - That was gratifying.

1297
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,539
It's a load off my mind.

1298
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:56,280
I wanted to perform so well.

1299
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,779
I think we crushed it, though. Well done.

1300
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,808
We did it perfectly.

1301
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:00,820
Good job.

1302
01:08:01,019 --> 01:08:02,250
- Good job. - Good work.

1303
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,190
I felt like I performed with my members as one,

1304
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:08,690
so I'm relieved.

1305
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:12,729
It was fortunate that we were able to finish...

1306
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,300
the performance safely.

1307
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,299
We were convinced that we gave our all...

1308
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,329
in that performance.

1309
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:19,728
- We really did our best. - Indeed.

1310
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,569
(Can they go to the finals without surprises?)

1311
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,608
There are 10,000 points for Ace Ranking...

1312
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:26,869
and 10,000 points for Team Ranking in the 2nd round.

1313
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:30,140
The scoring method combines 70 percent from the video judges...

1314
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,010
and 30 percent of Self-Evaluation.

1315
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:36,979
For voting, please select three teams...

1316
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:38,818
whose performances you thought were outstanding...

1317
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:42,289
and vote for 3 memorable ace members from the 6 teams.

1318
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,430
(The video judges start voting.)

1319
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,800
(The Self-Evaluation begins at the same time.)

1320
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,528
(Who will the video judges choose and determine their fate?)

1321
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:51,899
How are we supposed to pick them?

1322
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,500
(The 6 teams are very careful in the last Self-Evaluation.)

1323
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,939
I picked them. Ta-da.

1324
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:01,840
The CrewOne will no longer be an elimination candidate...

1325
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,380
and will be in a high rank.

1326
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:08,550
Our team will make sure to succeed in the No Limit Mission.

1327
01:09:10,989 --> 01:09:11,989
We're in third place, right?

1328
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,659
We either maintain our place or take number one.

1329
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,960
Let's go to the finals.

1330
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,130
We'll get better results...

1331
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,659
and survive until the end.

1332
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,369
To prove that we've improved,

1333
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,920
I want us to advance to the finals as the number-one team.

1334
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,409
I believe I have a shot at ranking first in Ace Ranking.

1335
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:37,010
(Which 5 teams will advance to the finals?)

1336
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,850
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1337
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,779
CRAVITY's performance ended,

1338
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,520
and the 2nd round of Round 3 has ended.

1339
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:46,648
(An applause for everyone for performing beyond limits)

1340
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,089
Good work, everyone!

1341
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,618
- Great work. - Well done.

1342
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,489
- Good game. - They were all fantastic.

1343
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,760
It's the last one.

1344
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,160
- It's the last one. - I know.

1345
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,899
We only have the final rankings remaining before the finals.

1346
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,539
Of the six teams,

1347
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:05,710
only five teams will advance to the finals.

1348
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,709
(Sighing)

1349
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:09,279
And which team is getting eliminated?

1350
01:10:10,409 --> 01:10:12,010
I want to go to the finals.

1351
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,079
I badly want to compete in the finals.

1352
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:16,250
Please. Let us go to the finals.

1353
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:18,318
Please.

1354
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:19,319
(They all desperately want to go to the finals.)

1355
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,819
Based on the cumulative scores from Rounds 1, 2, and 3,

1356
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,760
the first placers in Team and Ace Rankings...

1357
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:26,689
will secure a spot in the finals.

1358
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,680
However, if the first placer of Team Ranking...

1359
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,869
and the first placer of Ace Ranking are the same,

1360
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:35,470
only one team will be confirmed for the finals.

1361
01:10:35,739 --> 01:10:38,170
Straight to the finals.

1362
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:40,169
I hope we placed first in either one of them.

1363
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,380
I know.

1364
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:45,250
So, CRAVITY and ONEUS are definitely going to the finals.

1365
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,350
Why?

1366
01:10:46,449 --> 01:10:47,579
Calm down.

1367
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:49,420
It could be us.

1368
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,319
Wait. Then,

1369
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,988
what if you placed first in Team Ranking...

1370
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:54,720
and placed last in Ace Ranking?

1371
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:55,819
You still survive.

1372
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,658
(Suddenly realizing)

1373
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:58,659
I can't predict anything.

1374
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,989
There are so many variables.

1375
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,570
That's why we can't predict anything.

1376
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:04,229
I hope we advance at ease as the first placer.

1377
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:07,810
According to the cumulative scores up to Round Two,

1378
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,970
the number one in Team Ranking was CRAVITY.

1379
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,908
Let's maintain our place in Team Ranking.

1380
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:14,539
I really want to.

1381
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:17,210
And the number one in Ace Ranking was ONEUS.

1382
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,949
It'd be so cool if we advanced as number one in both.

1383
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,279
Will the two teams secure their spots in the finals...

1384
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,550
as expected,

1385
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,720
or will there be a huge change due to Round Three?

1386
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,459
Let's check out who's number one in Team Ranking...

1387
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,069
and goes to the finals first.

1388
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,670
- Oh, my. - Let's go!

1389
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,039
(Nervous and anxious)

1390
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,210
Number one first?

1391
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:48,640
(Getting up)

1392
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,810
I'd like to place first at least once.

1393
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,750
I'm sure it's CRAVITY.

1394
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,578
They racked up the points so well.

1395
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,380
Yes. They've always ranked high.

1396
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,819
CRAVITY must be in a superior position.

1397
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,488
I hope we maintained our first place.

1398
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:02,858
- Yes, we have to. - Let's go to the finals.

1399
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:04,459
- I'm not sure. - It's the Team Ranking.

1400
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,280
- I'm sure we maintained it. - Please.

1401
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,929
(Team Ranking, CRAVITY)

1402
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,300
(They've placed 1st in Team Ranking until Round 2.)

1403
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:19,810
(Will they be able to secure their place?)

1404
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,908
If only we had ranked high today...

1405
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:24,039
Yes. Then, we could be at the top.

1406
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,649
But ONEUS also performed so well.

1407
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,250
- That's true. - If they turn it around today...

1408
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,050
(ONEUS played its trump card by using the Korean theme.)

1409
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,859
(Can they place first in Team Ranking?)

1410
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,060
We and CRAVITY were...

1411
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,159
competing in numbers 1 and 2.

1412
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,080
(ONEUS and CRAVITY have been numbers 1 and 2 in both rankings.)

1413
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,770
I thought we were one step away from first place.

1414
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:50,840
- I badly want this. - Please.

1415
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,770
Please.

1416
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,039
Please.

1417
01:12:58,109 --> 01:13:00,486
(Which team will be number 1 in Team Ranking and go to the finals?)

1418
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,949
(CRAVITY)

1419
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,288
- Seriously. - Gosh.

1420
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:06,289
That's a relief.

1421
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,595
(CRAVITY secures its spot in the finals first.)

1422
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:09,089
(Too bad)

1423
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,259
We maintained our place.

1424
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,488
- We did. - We did.

1425
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:12,889
We're going to the finals, at last.

1426
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:16,729
With a cumulative score of 20,769 in Team Ranking,

1427
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:19,769
they placed 1st in the 2nd round of Round 3...

1428
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,999
(Number 1 in the 2nd round of Round 3)

1429
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,899
and earned 9,321 points.

1430
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:26,869
They will advance to the finals as number one in Team Ranking.

1431
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,686
They placed first in all of them?

1432
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,149
(Admiring)

1433
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,349
CRAVITY keeps placing first...

1434
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,819
- in all the Team Rankings. - Right.

1435
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,549
(Even CRAVITY is surprised to hear the news.)

1436
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,358
(Overwhelmed)

1437
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:42,359
I'm so happy.

1438
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,788
(Excited)

1439
01:13:43,789 --> 01:13:44,789
I feel great.

1440
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:47,029
We didn't come here to advance to the finals.

1441
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:48,829
We're here to win the show.

1442
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,829
So, we'll show you a victory as expected.

1443
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:56,640
Next, I'll announce the first placer in Ace Ranking.

1444
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,710
(Total Ace Ranking, 1st place)

1445
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:01,380
Didn't CRAVITY place first in both rankings?

1446
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:03,140
- That might be true. - Right.

1447
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,550
They got so many points in the 1st round of Round 3.

1448
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:09,479
- It's the Ace Ranking now. - If we win this one too...

1449
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,550
MINHEE and TAEYOUNG got us such high points.

1450
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,420
- We might actually do it. - We might.

1451
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:19,089
(MINHEE, the ace member of the Water Stage, )

1452
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,500
(and TAEYOUNG, the ace member of the Fire Stage, )

1453
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,769
(earned a total of 9,000 points and placed first in Ace Ranking...)

1454
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,999
(in the 1st round of Round 3.)

1455
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,469
MINHEE and TAEYOUNG brought us...

1456
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,010
so many points in the first round,

1457
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:35,079
so I thought we had a shot at placing first in Ace Ranking.

1458
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,108
We might lose, though.

1459
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:39,029
But the scores from the Water and Fire Stages...

1460
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:40,810
The difference was 5,000 points.

1461
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:43,999
(The two teams' difference increased drastically in the 1st round.)

1462
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:46,549
We might win if SEO HO got 10,000 points.

1463
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,960
(It's up to the ace's points in the 2nd round.)

1464
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,389
I think it's ONEUS.

1465
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,789
In the Ace Ranking,

1466
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:55,500
HWAN WOONG racked up way too many points.

1467
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,398
Please.

1468
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:58,399
(CRAVITY wishes to turn the tables.)

1469
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,320
The Ace Ranking must have changed a lot as well.

1470
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:01,500
Oh, my gosh.

1471
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,170
My gosh.

1472
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,340
- No way. - Gosh.

1473
01:15:04,341 --> 01:15:05,469
(Total Ace Ranking, 1st place)

1474
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,010
(CRAVITY)

1475
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:10,339
(CRAVITY placed 1st...)

1476
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,509
(in the total Ace Ranking as well.)

1477
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:12,579
Well done, guys.

1478
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,349
- TAEYOUNG, great job. - We did it.

1479
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:18,189
- That's wild. - They're taking everything.

1480
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,519
(ONEUS lost their 1st place in Ace Ranking.)

1481
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,319
We ended up losing.

1482
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:23,595
- That's incredible. - They took everything.

1483
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,930
They're like hippos.

1484
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,989
It was all MINHEE and TAEYOUNG.

1485
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,500
We ended up placing first in Ace Ranking too.

1486
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:32,899
With a cumulative score...

1487
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,100
of 16,543 in Ace Ranking,

1488
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,839
they placed 1st in the 1st round of Round 3...

1489
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,939
and earned 9,000 points.

1490
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:43,210
And they placed 3rd in the 2nd round of Round 3...

1491
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:45,710
and earned 8,248 points.

1492
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:48,380
They're number one in Ace Ranking as well.

1493
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,890
They're going straight to the finals.

1494
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,996
The Water and Fire Stages played a huge part.

1495
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,159
Then,

1496
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:57,789
what will happen to us?

1497
01:15:58,189 --> 01:15:59,189
Right.

1498
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,560
We have one confirmed finalist now.

1499
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,869
- I'm over the moon. - The Fire Stage.

1500
01:16:05,369 --> 01:16:07,868
The remaining four spots will be determined...

1501
01:16:07,869 --> 01:16:10,640
by combining the points from Team Ranking and Ace Ranking,

1502
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:14,340
the overall ranking.

1503
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:17,310
(Overall Ranking)

1504
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,779
So, it was important to earn points in both rankings.

1505
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:23,049
Even if you got high points in one,

1506
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,396
and you got low points in the other...

1507
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,726
Then, our overall score will be low.

1508
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,788
We have total points in Team Ranking and Ace Ranking...

1509
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:30,519
- They're combining both. - Both of them?

1510
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,080
It's about the total points in the end.

1511
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,329
I have no idea how this will go.

1512
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,559
The last team in the overall ranking...

1513
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,198
will sadly be eliminated...

1514
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:43,300
from Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace right before the finals.

1515
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,170
We're being eliminated right away today?

1516
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,439
There's no battle after.

1517
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:49,409
One team will be eliminated here.

1518
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,079
I just hope we survive.

1519
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,619
I just don't want to be eliminated.

1520
01:16:57,949 --> 01:17:00,720
CRAVITY was number one in both rankings,

1521
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,659
and they placed first in the overall ranking...

1522
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:05,829
with a total score of 63,881.

1523
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:08,398
They got over 60,000 points?

1524
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:10,560
- How does that make sense? - That's insane.

1525
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:12,328
They got 63,000 points...

1526
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:13,670
out of 70,000 points.

1527
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,199
The 9,000 points you guys won were huge!

1528
01:17:16,569 --> 01:17:17,670
Well done, guys.

1529
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,539
- I'm so happy. - Great job.

1530
01:17:19,909 --> 01:17:23,180
I'll announce number four in the overall ranking.

1531
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,709
(It's beginning.)

1532
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:26,810
8TURN!

1533
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,680
Please let it be us.

1534
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,818
I hope...

1535
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:32,390
- we at least placed fourth. - I know.

1536
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:35,659
We might not make it if we're not even fourth.

1537
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,688
(Sighing)

1538
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:40,090
TEMPEST.

1539
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,259
(The number 4 overall ranking is...)

1540
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,129
(YOUNITE.)

1541
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,229
(Surprised)

1542
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:47,670
Good work, guys.

1543
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,970
Good work. My heart is pounding so hard.

1544
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:56,209
They placed 2nd in the Team Ranking in the 2nd round of Round 3...

1545
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,710
and earned 9,250 points.

1546
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,750
They placed 4th in Ace Ranking and earned 8,000 points.

1547
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:04,119
With a total score of 49,310,

1548
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:06,449
they're confirmed to be number four.

1549
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,559
But the score isn't that low.

1550
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,858
It's not that different.

1551
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,528
If YOUNITE scored that much...

1552
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:13,488
by getting 1,000 points in the Water and Fire Stages,

1553
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:15,609
that means the second round gave out far more points.

1554
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:18,970
According to the video judges in the second round,

1555
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,600
YOUNITE was number one in both Team and Ace Rankings...

1556
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,639
and secured its spot in the finals.

1557
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,868
- That's awesome. - Amazing.

1558
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:26,109
(A relieved smile)

1559
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:30,279
Is YOUNITE finally getting recognition from the public?

1560
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:33,108
The fans picked us as number one,

1561
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:36,119
so we could utilize these qualities in the finals.

1562
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,550
Wait.

1563
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:42,960
- This is bad. - It is.

1564
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:47,159
YOUNITE placed fourth.

1565
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,159
We thought we were in danger.

1566
01:18:51,029 --> 01:18:52,969
It's either fifth place or none, right?

1567
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:54,800
That's right.

1568
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:57,399
Oh, please.

1569
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:00,108
There are four teams left?

1570
01:19:00,109 --> 01:19:01,139
(There are 4 teams...)

1571
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,108
(and 3 spots in the finals remaining.)

1572
01:19:04,109 --> 01:19:06,380
Next, I will announce number two.

1573
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:08,279
Wouldn't it be ONEUS?

1574
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,989
But they didn't win that many ace points this time.

1575
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:15,019
But they've placed first so far. I'm sure they're fine.

1576
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,119
That's also true.

1577
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:18,528
This includes the ace points from the performance,

1578
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:19,658
- right? - Right.

1579
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:21,699
The result of our performance just now is included.

1580
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,198
- You did great, though. - You did.

1581
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:25,299
(The ace of the second round is suffocated.)

1582
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,529
Oh, gosh.

1583
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,100
I think it'll be 8TURN.

1584
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:31,399
- They won a lot of ace points. - They did.

1585
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,770
Please.

1586
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:36,578
Who is it?

1587
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:38,550
(Who's number 2 in the overall ranking?)

1588
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,409
(Overall Ranking: ONEUS in 2nd)

1589
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:41,649
(Exclaiming)

1590
01:19:41,649 --> 01:19:42,649
(That was a mistake.)

1591
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,680
We're in second place.

1592
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,119
It's all right.

1593
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,659
- You did great. - Great job.

1594
01:19:50,789 --> 01:19:52,228
They placed third in the Team Ranking...

1595
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:55,000
in the 2nd round of Round 3 and earned 8,590 points.

1596
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,799
And they placed 2nd in Ace Ranking and earned 8,336 points.

1597
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,439
With a total score of 56,373,

1598
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,300
they placed second.

1599
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,609
- Well done. - Well done.

1600
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:07,869
Great work.

1601
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:09,809
You did great.

1602
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,879
(Great job, ace.)

1603
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,079
You did an amazing job.

1604
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:13,680
Second in Ace Ranking.

1605
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,289
We still don't know who's first in Ace Ranking.

1606
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,889
(SERIM of CRAVITY is 3rd in Ace Ranking.)

1607
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,920
I won a lot of points in the 1st round of Round 3.

1608
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:23,960
- I have no clue. - This is a huge change.

1609
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,390
But 8TURN got 8,000 points.

1610
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:28,199
MYUNG HO did so well.

1611
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:30,319
- MYUNG HO performed amazingly. - You stood out.

1612
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,769
(8TURN's MYUNG HO caught everyone's attention...)

1613
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,199
(with the dreamlike theme.)

1614
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:39,510
Junseok can place first in Ace Ranking.

1615
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,579
- Can you? Let's do it. - The last team...

1616
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:43,010
No problem.

1617
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:50,019
(Junseok let himself known with the powerful solo dance.)

1618
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,740
But TEMPEST's performance was also amazing.

1619
01:20:51,949 --> 01:20:53,189
How will it go?

1620
01:20:54,489 --> 01:20:56,488
(HYUK successfully had a glow-up...)

1621
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:58,189
(and showed us different charms.)

1622
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:02,159
Today's number-one ace is going to decide the winner.

1623
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,529
Next, I will announce number three.

1624
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,499
(Extremely nervous)

1625
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,909
I don't have any idea how it's going to go now.

1626
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:13,569
The CrewOne.

1627
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,380
- Please. - The CrewOne.

1628
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,908
We can do this.

1629
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:17,939
(I can't watch this.)

1630
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,078
(Which of these 3 teams is going to the finals...)

1631
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:22,948
(as number 3?)

1632
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:24,279
(Exclaiming)

1633
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:27,689
(Startled)

1634
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:30,720
(Overall Ranking: 8TURN in 3rd)

1635
01:21:30,989 --> 01:21:33,129
(Grasping the situation)

1636
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,259
- You scared me. - It's us!

1637
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,698
- You surprised me even more. - It's us!

1638
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:37,829
It's because of you.

1639
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,328
We did it.

1640
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:41,769
(They finally share the joy.)

1641
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:42,840
It's us!

1642
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,809
They placed fourth in Team Ranking...

1643
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:48,810
in the 2nd round of Round 3 and earned 7,284 points.

1644
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:53,279
And they placed 1st in Ace Ranking and earned 9,173 points.

1645
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:56,979
With a total score of 50,508,

1646
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,090
they placed third in the overall ranking.

1647
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,449
They placed first in Ace Ranking.

1648
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,188
- Seriously? - MYUNG HO!

1649
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:04,889
- MYUNG HO! - You're number one, MYUNG HO.

1650
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,159
Nice!

1651
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:09,198
- The ace got all the points. - The ace did it perfectly.

1652
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,858
The ace points played a huge part.

1653
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,329
Yes, the Water and Fire Stages.

1654
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:15,000
You're our savior.

1655
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:16,770
We...

1656
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:18,568
Super Ace!

1657
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:20,239
(Our lifesaver!)

1658
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:23,479
Now, we have 5th and 6th remaining.

1659
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,209
(Only number 5...)

1660
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,510
(will advance to the finals.)

1661
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,020
What do we do?

1662
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:33,949
We want to go to the finals too.

1663
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:36,858
(Sighing)

1664
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,119
Was I really that bad?

1665
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,029
The CrewOne...

1666
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:44,930
came all the way here from the edge of a cliff.

1667
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,130
It breaks my heart.

1668
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:49,600
I can't predict who it is.

1669
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:52,409
The teams that haven't been called yet are...

1670
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,479
The CrewOne and TEMPEST.

1671
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:59,949
One of these two teams will leave Road to Kingdom...

1672
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,119
before the final round.

1673
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,919
Oh, no.

1674
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,948
(Please...)

1675
01:23:04,949 --> 01:23:06,850
Can we beat TEMPEST with our points?

1676
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,689
Was the ace points difference 1,000?

1677
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:12,759
- Yes. - So, it's about Team Ranking.

1678
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,760
That's right.

1679
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:17,600
(The two teams had a tiny difference in the 1st round of Round 3.)

1680
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,670
This is where the ace makes a difference.

1681
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,698
That's why I can't predict anything.

1682
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:25,409
Then, I will announce numbers 5 and 6.

1683
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:28,109
I can't watch it anymore.

1684
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,479
They both did so well, though.

1685
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:33,608
- Right. - It's not your fault.

1686
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:36,149
(Patting him)

1687
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,560
I feel like I lowered the quality of our performance...

1688
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,159
by making a mistake during wire action,

1689
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:50,159
so I felt bad for the team.

1690
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,340
Oh, man.

1691
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:03,379
If The CrewOne survives again,

1692
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:05,979
it's their second time returning from the brink of elimination.

1693
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,850
Let's desperately pray.

1694
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,589
No need to be intimidated.

1695
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,720
You did so well. Everyone will agree.

1696
01:24:16,989 --> 01:24:19,130
We were on the brink of elimination,

1697
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:20,889
so I felt bad...

1698
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:24,729
about not winning so many points in the Water Stage.

1699
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:29,770
The last team to compete in the finals,

1700
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,400
number five in the overall ranking.

1701
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,409
This is so nerve-racking.

1702
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,510
I don't think I can watch this.

1703
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,310
Give us one last chance.

1704
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,979
One last chance.

1705
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,720
I hope it's our team.

1706
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,719
(Overall Ranking)

1707
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,818
(The last finalist is revealed.)

1708
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,029
What's the point difference?

1709
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,898
Are you serious?

1710
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:57,999
- The difference is 60? - It's a 60-point difference.

1711
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,169
That's unbelievable.

1712
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:02,640
(To be continued shortly)

1713
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,640
Which last team will advance to the finals?

1714
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:08,140
Number five in the overall ranking.

1715
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:11,180
I'm a nervous wreck.

1716
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:14,279
I can't watch it. I can't.

1717
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,949
Just once.

1718
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:18,520
Just this once.

1719
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,590
I hope our name is called.

1720
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,488
(Revealing the last finalist)

1721
01:25:25,489 --> 01:25:26,528
(Overall Ranking)

1722
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:27,589
(A slight score difference between the 5th and 6th)

1723
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:28,659
What's the difference?

1724
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,699
(Shocked)

1725
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,420
- The difference is 60? - It's a 60-point difference.

1726
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:35,970
That's impossible.

1727
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:39,909
(Overall Ranking: The CrewOne in 5th, TEMPEST in 6th)

1728
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:50,250
(Ranking 6th overall, TEMPEST is eliminated.)

1729
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,059
For real?

1730
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:05,300
(The CrewOne has survived again and advanced to the finals.)

1731
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:06,670
Really.

1732
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,640
Seriously.

1733
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,839
- Thank you, Junseok. - I'm sorry.

1734
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,939
- Thank you so much, Junseok. - Great job.

1735
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,509
- Really. - Good job.

1736
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,109
(Crying from relief)

1737
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:21,750
Thank you.

1738
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,619
Thank you so much, Junseok.

1739
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:25,119
Thank you.

1740
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:30,020
Scoring 5th place with 5,993 points...

1741
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:31,930
in the 2nd round of Round 3 as a team...

1742
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:36,359
and 5th place with 6,815 points in the Ace Ranking,

1743
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:40,270
The CrewOne ranks overall fifth...

1744
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,569
with a sum of 39,812 points.

1745
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:44,839
They turned the tables like this?

1746
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,869
Goodness.

1747
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,210
The CrewOne...

1748
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:49,710
has made it until the last.

1749
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:54,180
What a relief.

1750
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:58,420
Don't cry.

1751
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,829
After our teams became one,

1752
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:08,629
we knew we'd become successful.

1753
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,960
But it wasn't really working out.

1754
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,470
It was tough during those days,

1755
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:14,970
and our spirits died as well.

1756
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,039
But we made it to the finals.

1757
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,438
It's like we've been given the chance...

1758
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:21,269
to show who we are once again on stage.

1759
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,640
We're very grateful.

1760
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:25,949
We want to receive approval that we aren't wrong.

1761
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,649
Automatically, TEMPEST is in sixth place.

1762
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,550
(The team to be eliminated, TEMPEST)

1763
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:36,989
Scoring 6th place with 4,720 points...

1764
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,690
in the 2nd round of Round 3 as a team...

1765
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:42,800
and 6th place with 5,685 points in the Ace Ranking,

1766
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:46,899
TEMPEST ranks overall sixth...

1767
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,800
with a sum of 39,754 points.

1768
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:52,169
There is just a 58-point difference...

1769
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,239
between The CrewOne in fifth place.

1770
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,539
Only 58 points?

1771
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:57,478
- It's 58 points. - Only 58 points.

1772
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:00,510
How much we voted must've affected the score.

1773
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,850
The CrewOne made a comeback.

1774
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,779
To think this could happen.

1775
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:08,550
You must feel sad with the finals just around the corner.

1776
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:11,590
It would be highly appreciated if you could say a word.

1777
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:15,229
Hi. I'm HYEONGSEOP of TEMPEST.

1778
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,028
Through this show, Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace,

1779
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:22,299
TEMPEST was able to take up a new challenge.

1780
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,339
It was such a great honor to compete against...

1781
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:27,439
amazing fellow artists.

1782
01:28:27,739 --> 01:28:30,478
Although our journey on this show ends here,

1783
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:32,478
it's not as if TEMPEST has ended.

1784
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,648
Please root for TEMPEST. We will keep rising.

1785
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:37,448
And if you don't mind,

1786
01:28:37,449 --> 01:28:39,788
can you give a round of applause to our ace HYUK,

1787
01:28:39,789 --> 01:28:42,689
who did his best despite feeling unwell, and to our members?

1788
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:45,188
(A warm round of applause and cheers...)

1789
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:47,630
(from the fellow artists who have watched them)

1790
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:49,000
Great work.

1791
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,369
Thank you.

1792
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:57,100
When we decided to appear on Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace,

1793
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,470
our goal and objective was...

1794
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:05,109
(They took the first step with hopes and excitement.)

1795
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,979
to promote TEMPEST...

1796
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:09,779
and show TEMPEST's charms to many people.

1797
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,619
While performing many stages,

1798
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,318
we wanted to prove and get acknowledged.

1799
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:17,799
(The desire to prove their potential)

1800
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:21,689
Through Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace, we showed various sides of us.

1801
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:24,429
We're very grateful.

1802
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:26,569
(Thank you very much.)

1803
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,699
Good luck!

1804
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,198
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1805
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:32,239
(TEMPEST's journey on this show is over.)

1806
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,079
Lastly, to our loving fans.

1807
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:40,079
Thanks to your love and cheers,

1808
01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:43,250
we were able to work much harder.

1809
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,350
TEMPEST will continue to do our best to repay you.

1810
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:48,420
We were TEMPEST. Thank you.

1811
01:29:49,989 --> 01:29:52,529
See you again!

1812
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:58,500
(Rooting for TEMPEST for their brighter future)

1813
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:00,228
(Total Team Ranking: 1. CRAVITY, 2. YOUNITE, )

1814
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:01,599
(3. ONEUS, 4. 8TURN, )

1815
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,639
(5. TEMPEST, 6. The CrewOne)

1816
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,639

1817

(3. 8TURN, 4. YOUNITE, 5. The CrewOne, 6. TEMPEST)

1818
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,139
(Overall Ranking: 1. CRAVITY, 2. ONEUS, )

1819
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,680
(3. 8TURN, 4. YOUNITE, 5. The CrewOne, 6. TEMPEST)

1820
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:14,779
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1821
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,750
The five teams advancing to the finals have been decided.

1822
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,189
CRAVITY.

1823
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,260
ONEUS.

1824
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:24,289
8TURN.

1825
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,430
YOUNITE.

1826
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:28,489
The CrewOne.

1827
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:32,199
The five teams will perform their last stage...

1828
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:34,529
at the live finals...

1829
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,470
on November 7 with new songs.

1830
01:30:37,569 --> 01:30:40,170
- The last. It's really the last. - The finals.

1831
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:42,979
A new song.

1832
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:45,079
It'll be our very first song.

1833
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,649
The time has come.

1834
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:50,579
A new song. A new song fight.

1835
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:54,649
The finals that will decide the winner.

1836
01:30:54,819 --> 01:30:57,619
Don't you want to know how many points you'll get?

1837
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:58,930
- We do! - We do!

1838
01:30:59,289 --> 01:31:00,658
If 30,000 points are given out,

1839
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:01,890
we'll be in first place.

1840
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,130
What if it's like 50,000 points?

1841
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:05,359
A last-minute turnaround?

1842
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:07,500
- Maybe? - Can it be 100,000 points?

1843
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:10,639
Just go all out with ten million points!

1844
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,698
Let's go for it.

1845
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:12,769
Double the points.

1846
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:14,210
(Let's get 1st place.)

1847
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:15,510
The finals...

1848
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,239
is a total of 100,000 points.

1849
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:21,050
(Doubting what he has heard)

1850
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:22,648
- What? - For real?

1851
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:24,289
(Laughing because of the generous points)

1852
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,149
(100,000 points?)

1853
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,220
But the most a team has gained from all the performances...

1854
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:30,789
is 63,000 points.

1855
01:31:30,989 --> 01:31:32,659
We can easily turn the tables around.

1856
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:35,259
How is this real?

1857
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,540
(The 1st place team is shocked.)

1858
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:39,170
With 30,000 points from the songs released simultaneously...

1859
01:31:39,229 --> 01:31:41,199
before the finals...

1860
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,039
and 70,000 points from the live broadcast,

1861
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:46,470
the total points offered is 100,000 points.

1862
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:50,879
The five live broadcast finalist teams' total views...

1863
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,379
from Rounds 1, 2, and 3 videos...

1864
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,050
will also be reflected in the final score.

1865
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:59,420
The final winner of next week...

1866
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:02,560
is up to the viewers.

1867
01:32:02,989 --> 01:32:05,460
(Please vote for us.)

1868
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,590
If we were to win with the overall score from all the performances?

1869
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:10,629
- It... - It doesn't feel right.

1870
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,658
Doesn't feel right.

1871
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:14,729
We'll start with a clean slate.

1872
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,299
We promise...

1873
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,170
to prepare...

1874
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,340
a very cool 8TURN-like performance.

1875
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:22,379
We've done the performances we've wanted to until now.

1876
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,310
It's now time to show you the first-place stage.

1877
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:26,379
This time, 100,000 points are offered.

1878
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,879
- That's right. - We will aim to turn...

1879
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,449
the tables around.

1880
01:32:30,649 --> 01:32:31,849
We're The UndyingOne.

1881
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:33,289
We won't miss the chance.

1882
01:32:35,659 --> 01:32:36,720
Everyone!

1883
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:37,889
(Anxious)

1884
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:39,129
We're in your care.

1885
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:40,590
Nice.

1886
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:43,029
Please...

1887
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:44,930
don't go the extra mile.

1888
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:50,599
("Hit The Floor" by The CrewOne, with a witty synth riff...)

1889
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:55,339
(and heavy 808 bass, is a hip-hop song containing...)

1890
01:32:55,340 --> 01:33:00,880
(The CrewOne's free energy of having fun on stage.)

1891
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:05,219
("SPEED RUN" by 8TURN, with a funky and addicting guitar riff...)

1892
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:11,089
(that stands out, is an alternative hip-hop song containing...)

1893
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:15,800
(8TURN's unique spirit and young energy.)

1894
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:21,698
("I KNOW YOU KNOW" by ONEUS has a boom-bap rhythm...)

1895
01:33:21,699 --> 01:33:26,608
(sampling "Masquerade Suite" by Khachaturian.)

1896
01:33:26,609 --> 01:33:29,108
(The elegant vibe, like a vampire dancing to charm, )

1897
01:33:29,109 --> 01:33:31,579
(is the distinct characteristic of the song.)

1898
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:37,478
("Conviction" by YOUNITE, produced by EUNSANG, is a harmony...)

1899
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:40,419
(of an 808 bass and drum sound.)

1900
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,358
(It conveys the group's conviction...)

1901
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:46,960
(not to give up and strive to win.)

1902
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:49,898
("HISTORIA" by CRAVITY contains lyrics about...)

1903
01:33:49,899 --> 01:33:52,799
(CRAVITY's journey on Road to Kingdom.)

1904
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:58,538
(CRAVITY's great ambition to end the journey with victory...)

1905
01:33:58,539 --> 01:34:02,779
(has been expressed dramatically.)

1906
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:04,979
The new songs of five teams...

1907
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,979
will be revealed on November 1 at 12pm on music streaming services.

1908
01:34:10,949 --> 01:34:12,619
All right. It's not over yet.

1909
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:16,118
The new song featuring 5 vocal aces will also be revealed.

1910
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:17,189
Please look forward to it.

1911
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:19,688
- To be continued! - Continued!

1912
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:21,188
- We got this! - Yes!

1913
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:22,329
Let's go.

1914
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:28,869
("CONTINUE" by MYUNG HO, Bain, SEO HO, WOOBIN, and EUNHO)

1915
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:23,959
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace concert)

1916
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,559
(You can watch the performances of the top 5 teams at the concert.)

1917
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,130
(Saturday, January 4 and Sunday, January 5 at KSPO DOME)

1918
01:35:45,909 --> 01:35:47,709
(The special performance of "CONTINUE" will be revealed...)

1919
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:50,150
