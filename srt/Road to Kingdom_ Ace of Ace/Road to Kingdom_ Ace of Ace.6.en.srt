00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,719

98
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,620
and prepare two ace unit performances.

99

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,698

103
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,100
(important.)

105
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,540
Shall we head in now?

106
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,938
Can we go in now?

107
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,240
We survived and came back.

108
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,509
(Ta-da)

109
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,379
Thank you for welcoming us.

110
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,819
(The aces celebrate by applauding themselves.)

111
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,119
We're the first ones here.

112
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,949
I think we could guess by these...

113
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,019
Could we?

114
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,290
Oh, it's just the names.

115
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,189
- We're the first ones here. - CRAVITY.

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,729
The fact that we're aces again...

117
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,930
means we did well.

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,829
That's why we're here again.

119
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,600
(MINHEE and TAEYOUNG did well as CRAVITY's aces for Round 2.)

120
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,610
(From getting 3rd place in Round 1's Ace Ranking, )

121
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,209
(they went up to 2nd place.)

122
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,749
I'll prove it on stage...

123
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,480
why I was selected.

124
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,620
Super ace.

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,149
That word was born for me.

126
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,188
Are you confident?

127
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,490
- I am. - Nice. That's it.

128
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,888
Will it be the same aces again?

129
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,588
Since this is for being the super ace...

130
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,129
There are two chairs each,

131
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,029
but one person to do most performances.

132
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,600
I think at least one team will do that.

133
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,310
Who do you think it will be?

134
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,508
I think...

135
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,339
HWAN WOONG will be one of them.

136
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,379
I think MYUNG HO will definitely be the ace for 8TURN for Water.

137
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,078
I think Junseok will be one of them.

138
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,648
I think Junseok will definitely be the ace for Fire.

139
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,420
- He has that manly style. - Right.

140
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,050
- A fiery man. - Yes.

141
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,720
They didn't even tell us who the aces were.

142
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,589
I wonder who will come.

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,990
Act natural.

144
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,399
- Oh, my. - Hello.

145
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,359
- Hello. - Hello.

146
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,069
(Who is the second team that came in naturally?)

147
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,999
(The CrewOne Jeong Seunghwan...)

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
(and Oh Junseok)

149
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,939
(The CrewOne was a Round 2 elimination candidate.)

150
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,540
(We'll survive no matter what.)

151
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,420
(They performed together in the Ace Battle to survive.)

152
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,179
(The CrewOne's Oh Junseok and Jeong Seunghwan win.)

153
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,318
(They save their team from being eliminated.)

154
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,550
Our teammates said they'd trust us one more time.

155
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,159
They cheered us on, saying we could definitely do it.

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,489
Through this ace performance,

157
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,230
I want everyone to see us getting to the top.

158
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,899
(Glancing over)

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,339
I was most worried about Junseok.

160
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,870
And he came,

161
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,438
so I thought it'd be fun.

162
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,008
Hello. I expected TAEYOUNG.

163
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,040
But I was surprised to see MINHEE.

164
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,680
So...

165
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,980
- I see. - Okay.

166
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,449
- Okay. - Okay.

167
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,889
I think you must be Fire, and you must be Water.

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,730
(Okay. That's what you think?)

169
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,790
I'm grass.

170
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,398
(Looking over, )

171
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,329
(then acting like they didn't see)

172
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,269
(Deleting their memories)

173
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,769
This is awkward.

174
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,409
Now that I think about it,

175
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,279
you were both aces in Round Two.

176
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,110
You're right. Twice in a row.

177
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,050
Is it your second time too, Seunghwan?

178
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,680
- Yes. - Technically, it's your third time.

179
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,049
You're right.

180
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,120
(Did you hear that?)

181
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,790
If you count that too.

182
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,088
Yes. How many times have you been the ace?

183
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,990
(Provoking them in a cute way)

184
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,388
(Oh, my.)

185
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,160
- It's this kind of meeting? - It's this kind of meeting.

186
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,329
(Joking)

187
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,028
Why aren't they coming?

188
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,569
(Who will be the third team that comes and breaks the ice?)

189
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,399
(Right then, someone appears.)

190
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
What?

191
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,310
What?

192
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,739
(TEMPEST's aces)

193
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,278
- Hello. - Hello.

194
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,879
(TEMPEST's aces, LEW and HYUK)

195
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,910
(LEW gave a strong performance as the ace in Round 1.)

196
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,349
I advocated for myself.

197
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,480
I said I wanted to do it.

198
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,219
(HYUK, a multi-talented member, was the ace for Round 2.)

199
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,849
I'm a vocalist,

200
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,958
but I'm also the center dancer.

201
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,458
Since I'll be representing the team...

202
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,688
I have to be the best.

203
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,959
I have to dominate the stage.

204
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,160
We're third.

205
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,800
We are?

206
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,139
I thought it would be HANBIN and LEW.

207
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,709
But it was HYUK and LEW.

208
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,009
They also chose their aces from Round 1 and Round 2.

209
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,179
We're all former aces.

210
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,208
(So far, there are no new aces.)

211
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,279
Oh, gosh.

212
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,480
We should've chosen new aces to avoid being obvious.

213
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,720
(Will a new ace be chosen over the experienced aces?)

214
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,389
Have you eaten?

215
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,720
We have.

216
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,959
I ate fire jjamppong.

217
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,859
Oh, fire jjamppong.

218
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,128
- Fire jjamppong... Oh, he's Fire. - Oh, fire jjamppong.

219
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,268
- Fire jjamppong. - Fire.

220
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,769
(Fire jjamppong... Fire...)

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,599
(Swallowing nervously)

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,339
I don't think you'll suit the song.

223
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,769
You ate the opposite thing.

224
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,408
So far, we all chose...

225
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,408
the same two aces as before.

226
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,679
(The 3 teams so far have chosen the 2 experienced aces each.)

227
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,518
(Who will be the fourth team to arrive?)

228
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,649
- Someone is here. - Yes.

229
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,320
What?

230
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,388
Oh, 8TURN.

231
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,518
- Hello. - Hello.

232
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,289
(7th place, 8TURN, 7th place, 8TURN, YUN GYU)

233
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,758
(After getting 7th place in Round 1's Team and Ace Rankings, )

234
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,159
(they did their best to prepare for Round 2...)

235
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,230
(and avoided elimination by getting 5th place overall.)

236
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,668
(We did well in Round 2.)

237
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,668
I volunteered to be the ace...

238
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:29,169
because I wanted to help my team rise up even more.

239
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,879
You chose the same aces as Round Two.

240
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,950
Oh, red hair.

241
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,210
(His red hair stands out especially a lot today.)

242
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,649
- You're Fire. - You're Fire.

243
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,789
Why does MYUNG HO look so much like Water even with red hair?

244
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,389
(The Water and Fire guessing time has resumed.)

245
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,690
(I'm so nervous.)

246
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,259
(Glancing over)

247
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,000
- You're Water, aren't you? - You're Fire, right?

248
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,898
(I see.)

249
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,570
(What an amusing situation.)

250
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,129
Me? No.

251
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,138
Your face says Fire on it.

252
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,139
- I have a very gentle personality. - I see.

253
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,340
I can't do strong concepts like that.

254
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,939
I'm the same.

255
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,009
Really?

256
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,149
(Failing to hold back their laughter)

257
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,820
We don't have any new faces yet?

258
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,480
I think YOUNITE will come next.

259
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,250
EUNSANG and...

260
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,548
- I hope EUNSANG comes. - EUNSANG.

261
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,720
EUNSANG and...

262
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,989
STEVE.

263
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,960
- STEVE. - Or SION.

264
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,928
You go first.

265
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,528
- You go first. - You're older.

266
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,230
- Does that matter right now? - Yes.

267
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,168
(Who is the fifth team that's already bickering?)

268
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,439
- It must be YOUNITE, right? - I think so.

269
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
(What?)

270
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,008
(Everyone was surprised by this person.)

271
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,039
It's a new face!

272
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,239
- Hello. - Hello.

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,349
(YOUNITE's aces, HYUNGSEOK and SION)

274
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,250
They're both new.

275
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,479
(Quickly scanning the new aces)

276
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,918
- I didn't even imagine. - Same.

277
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,990
Hello.

278
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,758
(The only new aces, YOUNITE's HYUNGSEOK and SION)

279
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,960
- Hello. - Hello.

280
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,428
(YOUNITE's dancers)

281
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,159
Our members said we should go.

282
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,700
I wanted to go...

283
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,629
and dominate the stage.

284
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,439
- Hello. - Hello.

285
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,168
(New aces among old faces)

286
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,610
YOUNITE keeps trying new things.

287
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,779
They keep choosing new aces.

288
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,609
But YOUNITE...

289
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,378
(Whispering)

290
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,189
I haven't really gotten to see what they could do.

291
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,190
Right?

292
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,089
I can't really tell...

293
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,459
what their dancing style is like or what level they are at.

294
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,090
(Unable to tell)

295
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,729
(The experienced aces are nervous from the arrival of the new aces...)

296
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,830
(who have absolutely no experience as aces.)

297
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,000
(What will happen to these new mysterious aces?)

298
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,768
(They're only waiting on ONEUS' aces now.)

299
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,099
Should we remove a chair for ONEUS?

300
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,109
Exactly.

301
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,110
(Laughing)

302
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,210
Ahead of time?

303
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,409
If he comes alone, I can really understand that.

304
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,779
(Right then, someone appears.)

305
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,709
(What?)

306
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,820
Really?

307
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,480
Come on. Really?

308
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,319
Come on. Really?

309
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,490
(Come on. really?)

310
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:01,528
(HWAN WOONG appeared alone as ONEUS' ace.)

311
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,990
Is that possible? That doesn't make sense.

312
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,298
For HWAN WOONG, I don't think it's impossible.

313
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,000
Maybe HWAN WOONG will do both Water and Fire.

314
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,299
Then I can really acknowledge that he's great.

315
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,309
Both Water and Fire?

316
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,480
I thought it'd be fun, so I asked to do it.

317
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,609
- Really? - Yes.

318
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,709
(Speechless at the boldness of sending one ace)

319
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,679
Isn't that a super super ace, not a super ace?

320
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,378
I got goosebumps.

321
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,679
They're really going for it.

322
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,288
(The most feared member...)

323
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,388
(doing 2 performances)

324
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,959
Should we have brought four members?

325
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,058
(Filling the empty spots?)

326
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,459
- Is that not allowed? - Since we have so many people?

327
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Yes.

328
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,388
Everyone here is so talented.

329
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,960
(The 6 teams' 11 aces are now all here.)

330
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,330
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

331
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,798
(Right then, the door opens again.)

332
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,799
Hello.

333
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,769
(They were totally fooled.)

334
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,308
(We tricked you.)

335
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,509
There was no way.

336
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,809
I knew it.

337
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,408
(ONEUS' second ace, LEE DO)

338
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,409
We fooled you.

339
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,090
(ONEUS' charismatic main rapper)

340
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,090
Our members said it would suit me the best...

341
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,158
and that I should do it.

342
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,230
I didn't feel very worried about the other teams.

343
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,759
I don't think I'll get below third place.

344
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,028
The competition begins.

345
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,330
(The 12 aces are finally here.)

346
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,399
- What? - What?

347
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,299
Water Stage.

348
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:18,940
We should pay attention.

349
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,839
(Water Stage, "Paradise")

350
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,138
(An alternative trap song with synthwave and hip-hop elements)

351
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,210
(A song that uses water to portray the desperation for love)

352
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:27,909
- It's very sexy. - Yes.

353
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,349
I think Part Three is the most noticeable.

354
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,350
You're right.

355
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:34,250
It's almost Part Three and Friends.

356
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,620
I like the song.

357
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,889
- And Part Two. - Part Two is pretty nice too.

358
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,789
I think I could do that very well.

359
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,159
(The members look out for which part will suit them best.)

360
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,959
(It seems)

361
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,028
It suits you.

362
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,569
(Looking over at his casual humming)

363
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,199
- It suits you. - It's too early.

364
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,439
(This is a Water inspection.)

365
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,668
You memorized the song.

366
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,440
(I see.)

367
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,580
(The key hand movement will be the ending.)

368
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,138
(It's cool.)

369
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,149
That looks cool.

370
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,908
Sexy.

371
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,109
(This part is mine.)

372
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,820
Honestly, there is a big difference between the different parts.

373
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,649
- Right. - Right.

374
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,019
Which part was the most memorable?

375
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,759
(Hesitating to speak)

376
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,528
(Intense silence)

377
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,929
It already feels so tense.

378
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,099
Part Three for me.

379
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,168
- Part Three? - Yes.

380
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:23,129
The Part Three dancer kind of looked like you, MYUNG HO.

381
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,839
Really?

382
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,940
Then I'll take Part Three...

383
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,308
(Well...)

384
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,639
Let's see about that.

385
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,179
How will we decide on the parts?

386
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,278
(Performance Director Back Koo Young)

387
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,480
(The Fire Stage Choreography Video follows.)

388
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,019
(Fire Stage, "Framework")

389
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,119
(A fast song that jumps...)

390
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,249
(between hip-hop and hybrid trap and depicts the passion...)

391
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,950
(to burn up even higher instead of doing what's expected)

392
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,019
I need to do Part Two.

393
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,758
- We need to get this one. - Right.

394
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,330
(They also want Part 2.)

395
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,459
(Yes!)

396
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,529
Thankfully, in this song, Part Two and Part Three...

397
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,769
- split the chorus. - Right.

398
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,429
I like both Part Two and Part Three.

399
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,638
Even though this is Fire,

400
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,370
- the vocals are very sweet. - Right.

401
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,169
- This part is so cool. - Right.

402
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,039
(The 3-person unit dance has Part 6 in the center.)

403
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,480
(TAEYOUNG is already copying the choreography.)

404
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,049
(You can already dance the choreography?)

405
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,850
So hot.

406
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,360
What a good choreography. I really like it.

407
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,089
- This is hard. - Right?

408
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,159
I really don't know.

409
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,459
(They finished watching the Water and Fire choreography videos.)

410
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,128
For Water, there were lots of inward movements.

411
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,229
Right.

412
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,398
Fire had many movements where you hit outward.

413
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,538
If I go to Fire and take Part One...

414
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,539
(The part with the high notes)

415
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,740
That'll be an issue.

416
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,139
Let's think of it this way.

417
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,479
- Let's only add to our team. - I like it.

418
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,009
We need to get the points.

419
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:42,809
This must be fun.

420
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,819
How will we choose?

421
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,449
(How will the members and parts...)

422
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,220
(for the Water and Fire stages be chosen?)

423
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,259
(Water Stage waiting room)

424
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,460
(Fire Stage waiting room)

425
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
(Who will be the first aces for each of the stages?)

426
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,199
(Who will be the first member to select the Water Stage?)

427
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,499
(Poking out)

428
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,638
(Water, YOUNITE's SION)

429
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,970
Hello.

430
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm alone. The first Fire member.

431
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
(Shaking)

432
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,308
(Sighing)

433
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,210
Who will come?

434
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,909
I just hope HWAN WOONG doesn't come.

435
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,679
HWAN WOONG...

436
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,720
can go to where SION is.

437
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,220
(Shaking)

438
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,620
(Like HYUNGSEOK, SION is shaking too.)

439
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Please.

440
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,830
Wait.

441
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,230
I hear footsteps.

442
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,599
(Knocking)

443
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,099
(The door opens.)

444
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,299
- Hello. - Hello.

445
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,139
- Hello. - Heart pounding.

446
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,609
Heart pounding.

447
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,240
- Hello. - Oh, Junseok.

448
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,080
Hello.

449
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:46,908
It was tough being alone.

450
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:47,949
- Really? - Sit with me.

451
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,509
- I'll stay with you. - Okay.

452
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,678
(Very awkward)

453
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,079
(Meanwhile, how are the Fire Stage members?)

454
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,749
I really enjoyed the taekwondo performance.

455
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,750
Thank you.

456
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,489
- I copied it in the dorm. - Really?

457
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,119
(Laughing)

458
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,019
Seunghwan and I made it ourselves.

459
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,428
- You made it yourselves? - Yes.

460
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,629
- The taekwondo part? - Yes.

461
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,359
- I really enjoyed it. - Thank you.

462
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,430
It's time for someone else to arrive.

463
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,200
Right around this time, I heard footsteps from over there.

464
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,869
- Oh, my. - What?

465
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,268
(Who is the Water member...)

466
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,409
(that arrived just on time?)

467
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,739
- Hello. - Hello.

468
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,909
(Water, TEMPEST's HYUK, Fire, TEMPEST's LEW)

469
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,848
We're both rappers.

470
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,079
This won't be easy.

471
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,119
I think many rappers will come.

472
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,450
But both of CRAVITY's aces are vocalists.

473
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,159
- Did you look it up? - Yes.

474
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I looked it up too because I was curious.

475
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,229
(Laughing)

476
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,490
I don't know which members from 8TURN will come.

477
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,758
I think MYUNG HO will do Water.

478
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,400
He likes sexy styles...

479
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,970
(What?)

480
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,939
(Someone is approaching.)

481
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,069
- Wait. - What?

482
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,298
(Water, 8TURN's JAE YUN, Fire, 8TURN's MYUNG HO)

483
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,769
- Hello. - Hello.

484
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,439
- Hello. - This is crazy.

485
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,980
We were just guessing that you went to Water.

486
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,278
You didn't choose Water?

487
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,480
I just switched.

488
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:58,950
My guess was totally wrong.

489
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,420
What? Why didn't you go to Water?

490
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,690
I wasn't Water, to begin with.

491
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,660
- What? Really? - Really.

492
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,259
Fire. I'm a fiery guy.

493
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,129
Is that why you dyed your hair?

494
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,460
(Is that the secret of his hair color?)

495
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,930
You have to dye your hair to be in Fire.

496
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,229
(What? Oh, no.)

497
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,268
Oh, no.

498
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,739
(What?)

499
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
(Who is the next member?)

500
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,140
- Hello. - My guess was correct.

501
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,809
- Hello. - Hello.

502
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,809
(Oh, my.)

503
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,009
The legendary ace.

504
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,379
(Shy)

505
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
- Super super ace. - Triple ace.

506
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,390
(And the last spot left)

507
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,890
(Door sliding open)

508
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,359
What?

509
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,758
I'm a bit late, right?

510
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,890
(Water, CRAVITY's MINHEE, Fire, CRAVITY's TAEYOUNG)

511
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,959
(TAEYOUNG quickly scans the members.)

512
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,999
(It's really starting now.)

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,399
- Hello. - Hello.

514
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,700
Many of my guesses were wrong.

515
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,329
Really?

516
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,940
Who gets the benefit?

517
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,069
(Who gets the benefit for Round 3?)

518
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,839
Hello, everyone.

519
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,508
(TAEMIN appeared on the monitor.)

520
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,650
I'm TAEMIN.

521
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,309
TAEMIN!

522
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,220
(Hello.)

523
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,349
I will now tell you about Round Three's benefit.

524
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,690
- The member who gets the benefit... - Here it comes.

525
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,259
- What is it? - What could it be?

526
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,990
What is it?

527
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,529
Team Ranking first place, CRAVITY,

528
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,859
and Ace Ranking first place, ONEUS,

529
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,799
get the benefit...

530
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,798
of choosing their parts first...

531
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,339
for the 1st round of Round 3, the Ace Battle.

532
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,739
(That's right.)

533
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,108
- I knew it. - We were right.

534
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,279
I knew it.

535
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,549
(Oh, no.)

536
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,549
This is insane.

537
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,549
They can't use it for both the Water and Fire stages.

538
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,288
The two teams will have to discuss...

539
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,890
which song they'll use the benefit on...

540
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,390
to choose their parts first.

541
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:49,529
What should we do?

542
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,500
Which song do you want to use the benefit on?

543
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,069
We...

544
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,828
(What will ONEUS choose?)

545
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,139
We want to use it on Water.

546
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
- Water? - Yes.

547
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:02,568
(ONEUS wants to use their benefit on the Water Stage.)

548
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,079
We also wanted to use our benefit on the Water Stage.

549
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,609
What should we do?

550
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,609
For the Fire Stage,

551
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,880
we're okay with getting the rap part.

552
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,519
So we don't need to use it for the Fire Stage.

553
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,849
Actually...

554
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,220
- Same? - Yes. It's the same for us.

555
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,190
(They can't seem to come to an agreement.)

556
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,259
(How will their benefits be utilized for the battles?)

557
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,569
(CJ ENM Studio in Ilsan)

558
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,339
(It's the day of Round 3.)

559
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,269
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

560
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,640
Hello. I'm your host, TAEMIN.

561
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,108
(Everyone gives him a big round of applause.)

562
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,348
We missed you!

563
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,410
He's handsome as always.

564
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,019
Today, the finalists will be decided...

565
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,579
after Round Three.

566
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:49,619
I'm suddenly nervous.

567
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,058
Let's see which of the five groups...

568
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,059
will have a chance to perform during the live broadcast.

569
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,430
So one of the groups will be eliminated.

570
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:56,759
After hearing that...

571
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,499
My heart just skipped a beat.

572
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,759
We'll have to say goodbye to one of the groups.

573
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,329
As this is the last round before the final performance,

574
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,769
a lot of points are at stake.

575
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,869
A total of 30,000 points is at stake on this important round.

576
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,979
With 30,000 points, any group can turn the table around.

577
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
If a group wins all 30,000 points,

578
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,179
- they will just win first place. - Right.

579
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,710
The group ranked last could win first place then.

580
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,579
It's more than just turning the table around.

581
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,549
It's higher than all of our points combined so far.

582
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,650
We can take the lead then.

583
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,118
The gap will be pretty big then.

584
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,259
Since 30,000 points are at stake, this could be a whole new ball game.

585
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,490
Our combined score is somewhere around 20,000 with Rounds 1 and 2.

586
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,499
You're right. If a group takes all 30,000 points,

587
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
it will be like a single-round match.

588
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,959
- My gosh. - We must win no matter what.

589
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,970
We have to kill it.

590
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,099
As you know, Round 3 has 2 rounds.

591
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,599
The first round is the Ace Battle.

592
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,368
It consists of two concept-forward performances...

593
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,369
with concepts being water and fire.

594
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,778
Each group has chosen an ace...

595
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,079
who fits the concept well...

596
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,650
to create two performances as units.

597
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,548
A group of video judges, equal in number,

598
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,420
will watch the concept-forward performances.

599
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,660
They will vote for three ace members whom they consider impressive.

600
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,930
The rankings will be decided solely based on...

601
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:05,099
the video judges' votes.

602
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,559
I'm curious about their reaction while watching the videos.

603
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,368
The ace members with the most votes...

604
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,240
will win 5,000 points as the Super Ace.

605
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,068
Afterward, the points will be distributed accordingly...

606
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,509
based on the rankings.

607
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,680
But the bottom ace member will not receive any points.

608
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,279
Oh, no.

609
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,380
Let's just not end up in sixth place.

610
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,180
Not receiving any points is a huge risk.

611
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,450
My gosh, not getting any points is so cruel.

612
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,949
So the difference between each ranking will be 1,000 points?

613
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,950
- Then 0 points. - Then 0 points.

614
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:30,549
We could be in 4th place with 1,000 points.

615
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,119
That will guarantee our spot at the final.

616
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,519
My gosh, we must win those points no matter what.

617
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,729
I want those points.

618
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,960
(They need the points to maintain their spot.)

619
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,429
I'm curious to find out...

620
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,430
whom the video judges voted as the Super Aces.

621
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,130
We will now watch the performance videos...

622
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,470
and announce the rankings for the Ace Battle.

623
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,568
(Anticipating)

624
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,339
- Right away? - At last.

625
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:54,950
We'll start with the performance for the water concept.

626
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

627
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:59,420
(The rookie ace's heart is pounding.)

628
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
(The experienced ace is nervous too.)

629
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,318
- Let's go. - Water!

630
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,319
- Yes. - Let's go, Water!

631
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,660
It's just a video. Why am I getting nervous for this?

632
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,329
This started to feel real now.

633
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,799
Don't be nervous.

634
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,029
As it's a team of ace members who represent their groups,

635
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,839
I heard the competition to win the parts was fierce.

636
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
That's right.

637
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,109
I heard the Water Stage's nickname HWAN WOONG and the Boys.

638
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,608
- Really? - The part HWAN WOONG got...

639
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,609
stood out.

640
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,609
Gosh. Really?

641
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,279
(How did they assign the parts for the Water Stage?)

642
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,420
(Back to the waiting room for the Water Stage)

643
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,029
(The members are scrutinizing the parts before dividing the song.)

644
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,859
I love the choreography.

645
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,298
I want this part too.

646
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,299
(Everyone agrees that the best part of the song is...)

647
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,969
It's not an overstatement to say that the Water Stage is...

648
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,269
all about Part Three.

649
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,670
It's clear that Part Three has the center position.

650
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:00,309
It was so cruel that Part Three got all the spotlight.

651
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,849
Part Three will stand out the most.

652
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,980
Which part do you want?

653
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,920
Well, naturally, I want Part Three.

654
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:09,019
Part Three?

655
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,789
Part Three.

656
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:14,190
I must take Part Three for our group to have a future on this show.

657
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,629
I'm sure it's the most sought-after part...

658
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,660
because I want it too.

659
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,630
I think taking Part Three will benefit my group.

660
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,769
Is there a part you want?

661
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,339
I...

662
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,799
(Swallowing hard)

663
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,538
(Let's go, Part 3.)

664
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,569
I want Part Three.

665
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,880
(It means everyone wants Part 3.)

666
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,710
- What if Part 3 wasn't an option? - Without Part 3?

667
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Part Seven.

668
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,618
- Part 7? - There's no Part 7. Wait.

669
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,849
So it means I won't have it any other way.

670
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,519
I see. It has to be Part Three for you.

671
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,389
- We all had the same thought. - Right. We did.

672
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,619
Then which one of you has the benefit to pick the part first?

673
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,390
I'm nervous.

674
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,660
(They make undecipherable facial expressions.)

675
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,500
Personally,

676
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,230
I thought it would be better if CRAVITY had the benefit.

677
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,470
I feel the most threatened by HWAN WOONG.

678
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,969
I thought he shouldn't take Part Three.

679
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,779
So I wanted CRAVITY to have the benefit to choose first.

680
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,479
It would be a bit helpful if HWAN WOONG couldn't use...

681
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,049
the benefit here.

682
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,778
(Which team used their benefit on the Water Stage?)

683
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,920
Which one of you has the benefit?

684
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,490
All right.

685
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:18,759
(30 minutes ago, time to choose their benefits)

686
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:22,089
We want to use our benefit on the Water Stage.

687
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,089
We feel the same way.

688
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:28,369
For the Fire Stage, the song is divided evenly.

689
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,568
Whichever part we take,

690
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,169
we'll have our chance to stand out as long as we do a good job.

691
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,700
But for the Water Stage, it's basically Part Three and the Boys.

692
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,068
That's why it's difficult to decide.

693
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,069
(We feel the same.)

694
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,839
HWAN WOONG. In my opinion,

695
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,609
you don't need to take Part Three to stand out in the Water Stage.

696
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,048
I'm sure you know that.

697
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,048
Thank you for saying that. I appreciate the compliment.

698
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,518
HWAN WOONG. What if you say...

699
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,719
you can win no matter what regardless of the parts...

700
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,960
and win first place?

701
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,589
- That would be an amazing story. - Seriously.

702
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,960
But I can't let that happen.

703
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:58,088
(There's no playing nice in this game of survival.)

704
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,630
- I think I'm convincing myself. - Really?

705
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,430
But we do think that we can do well...

706
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,599
no matter which part we take.

707
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,170
If you let us use our benefit on the Water Stage,

708
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:11,809
we'll promise to give you everything else you want.

709
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,710
I...

710
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,809
took the benefit.

711
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,680
(The benefit to pick the part first went to HWAN WOONG.)

712
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,990
If he takes Part Three too, he's just being greedy.

713
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,890
If he takes Part Three too,

714
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,160
this will be difficult. So I'm worried.

715
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,160
I will follow through on what I said and choose Part Three.

716
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,569
(Sighing)

717
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,269
This will be tough.

718
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,838
Of all people, HWAN WOONG took Part Three...

719
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,109
which gets the most attention during the performance.

720
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,509
I'm very worried.

721
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,609
I think he's very greedy.

722
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:48,108
His group is ranked high.

723
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,679
But he still took Part Three...

724
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,980
which was the most sought-after part.

725
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,618
Part Three had...

726
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,049
all the highlights. It was a brutally important part.

727
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,289
I'm going to take all the spotlight during the Water Stage.

728
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,660
- Who wants Part Two? - Yes.

729
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,329
- I'll take it. - Gosh.

730
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,299
I want to take Part Two.

731
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,430
- I'll join them. - My gosh.

732
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Who else?

733
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
(Pondering)

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll give it a try.

735
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,539
- Gosh. - Hold on.

736
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,039
I have to do something.

737
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,809
Four people competed against Part Two from the get-go.

738
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,609
Part 2 stands out the most after Part 3.

739
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,650
I might score well if I secure a part that helps me...

740
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,750
stand out to the video judges.

741
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,659
I think I'm more prepared than the others.

742
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,519
So I'll take Part Two no matter what.

743
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,430
Hold on. My heart is racing.

744
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,960
As my group is ranked low,

745
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,400
I must gain a lot of points from this round.

746
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,730
If I prepare thoroughly,

747
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,230
I might have a shot at this.

748
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,500
Considering everyone's talent,

749
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,869
I don't see a reason that prevents me from not getting the part I want.

750
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,539
I won't go along with them just because I'm the youngest.

751
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,980
Why don't we talk about why we want this part?

752
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,579
You all watched our performance of Round Two, right?

753
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,048
(He showcased what it took to be an ace with the perfect transition.)

754
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,920
I think my aura you saw from the performance...

755
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,990
matches this song, "Paradise."

756
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,359
Actually,

757
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:16,170
HWAN WOONG and I went to the same high school.

758
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:17,669
(Pointing out their ties to the high school)

759
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,670
That's going to come into play?

760
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,970
What was your major?

761
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,910
I was a practical dance major. I was with the tenth group.

762
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,839
- The tenth group. Goodness. - My gosh.

763
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,180
You know what? This kind of connection...

764
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,450
This is...

765
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,848
That means your movements will be sophisticated.

766
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:34,849
You bet.

767
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,789
So I prepared to perform the entire chorus part.

768
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,259
(Really?)

769
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,089
I also prepared to dance.

770
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,259
I did prepare to dance.

771
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,529
If that's not enough, we must sing to battle it out.

772
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,069
I...

773
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,400
(Getting up)

774
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,740
I can guarantee you...

775
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,940
- my passion and diligence. - Great.

776
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,309
And I will show you just how passionate I am.

777
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Could you fast-forward the song for 2 minutes and 5 seconds?

778
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,249
(Touched by the detailed request)

779
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,250
- This is... - Seriously? Right here?

780
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,288
- He got it down to the seconds. - He knew it down to the seconds.

781
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:14,890
He's so cool. He's prepared.

782
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,429
I didn't see that one coming.

783
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,299
Everyone was so passionate.

784
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,099
I had to take Part Two no matter what.

785
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,568
I was trying to show them...

786
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,700
how much I wanted it and how passionate I was.

787
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,500
I thought, "Okay. I can win them over."

788
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,269
"Let's keep this momentum going."

789
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,539
(It's the segment Seunghwan chose.)

790
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,709
(Showing off an advanced technique...)

791
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,250
(instead of dancing the original choreography)

792
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,650
That wasn't in the choreography.

793
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,419
(They can't stop clapping at his passion.)

794
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,749
Thank you. That's it. My name is Jeong Seunghwan.

795
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,359
(He gets them excited from the start.)

796
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,230
I thought that I ought to do everything I could.

797
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,058
It's a competition.

798
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,799
It made no sense to let them just have a better part.

799
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,230
(Surprised)

800
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,670
I have no intention of losing my spotlight. I'll crush them all.

801
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:01,640
Come at me.

802
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,470
I'll show them how prepared I am.

803
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,309
Can I sing the song now?

804
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,749
(The main vocalist of TEMPEST also prepared to sing.)

805
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,578
I thought that they would see how desperately...

806
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,349
I wanted this if I sang the song.

807
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,288
(HYUK sings the part he practiced.)

808
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,589
(A divine voice)

809
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,288
- Gosh. - Goodness.

810
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,098
I really didn't expect them to have prepared to sing.

811
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,559
After watching how prepared they were,

812
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,130
I thought...

813
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,469
My gosh, that's amazing.

814
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,140
I thought to myself that I was really lucky that I had the benefit.

815
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,308
My gosh. So everyone is serious...

816
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,909
- about Part Two. - Exactly.

817
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,739
I can feel how much they want it.

818
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,808
- Gosh, that's so cool. - He even prepared to sing.

819
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,250
Everyone, lower your head.

820
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:46,720
It's nerve-racking like the moment when they're closing the poll.

821
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,119
It's more nerve-racking than that.

822
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,220
I really want this part.

823
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,118
Who are you going to pick?

824
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,258
I'll pick him.

825
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,990
Really? Me too.

826
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,459
(HWAN WOONG and MINHEE come to an agreement right away.)

827
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,859
The ace member we chose is...

828
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,899
- HYUK! - Gosh.

829
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
(Touched)

830
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Thank you.

831
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,669
I thought my practice had paid off.

832
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,399
- Thank you. - That crossed my mind first.

833
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,568
I thought...

834
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,868
I would be able to place high if I did well with this.

835
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,509
That crossed my mind first.

836
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,410
I was more disappointed.

837
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,348
I can execute the part better.

838
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:19,150
But I believe that he will do a good job too.

839
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,119
Raise your hands if you want Part One.

840
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,749
(JAE YUN, XION...)

841
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,319
- Part 1. - Part 1.

842
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,730
I'll show you a sexy facial expression.

843
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,190
Seunghwan.

844
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,190
(Seunghwan gets Part 1.)

845
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,400
- Thank you. - Gosh.

846
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,059
- Please get up. - Thank you.

847
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Thank you.

848
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,930
I thought I wouldn't have much of a chance...

849
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,170
without Parts 1, 2, or 3.

850
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,809
Seunghwan took Part One which was the last part I wanted.

851
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,609
Gosh.

852
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,949
Is there anyone who wants to volunteer for Part Four?

853
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,210
(XION, JAE YUN, and MINHEE volunteer for the part.)

854
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,479
XION of YOUNITE will take Part Four.

855
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,549
Thank you.

856
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,690
- You were passionate. - I never imagined that...

857
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:01,319
I wouldn't be able to take the part I wanted even to the end.

858
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,390
We only have two parts left now.

859
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,029
Did you two choose...

860
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,670
the part you want between the remaining parts?

861
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:10,399
- Part 6. - Part 6.

862
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,429
(They both want Part 6.)

863
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,740
(Why do they want Part 6?)

864
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,240
The part I want to avoid is...

865
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,538
Part Five.

866
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,740
Part Five will be directly...

867
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,079
behind whoever is in the center for the entire first verse.

868
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,879
He won't be seen at all.

869
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,779
(It will be difficult to stand out. Part Five has a small role.)

870
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,390
And the votes from the fans will decide our rankings.

871
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,118
I wondered, "Would I have a shot at beating MINHEE..."

872
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,190
"if I had to go up against him?" That crossed my mind.

873
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,229
It felt like my effort wouldn't be enough.

874
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,460
To me, he felt like a big mountain I couldn't climb.

875
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:42,299
I was worried about that.

876
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,599
Between the two parts,

877
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,740
I'm really desperate to take Part Six.

878
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,140
And...

879
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,109
my team's ranking is pretty low.

880
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,108
(Sighing)

881
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,480
I need to save my team.

882
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,778
(Sighing deeply)

883
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,420
Gosh, he played the "I-have-to-save-my-team" card.

884
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,318
Isn't their ranking higher than ours?

885
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,549
(Ranked 5th, ranked 6th)

886
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,920
Without this part,

887
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,220
it would be very difficult for me.

888
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,660
I'll be honest.

889
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,828
The risk of getting eliminated has nothing to do with this.

890
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:13,930
(The tension is suffocating.)

891
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,499
We're not on this show to go easy on each other.

892
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,639
- Right. That's true. - Gosh, that's true.

893
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
(Gosh, sir.)

894
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,140
All right. Shall we vote?

895
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,910
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

896
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,409
(The result is 3 to 1.)

897
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,710
Part Six goes to...

898
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,048
MINHEE of CRAVITY.

899
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:32,319
(MINHEE of CRAVITY gets Part 6.)

900
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,089
(JAE YUN gets Part 5, the part everyone avoided.)

901
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,160
I had a lot on my mind afterward.

902
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,789
Gosh.

903
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,160
Honestly, I wanted to scream.

904
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,000
I thought, "Am I that bad?"

905
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,039
I wanted to hide.

906
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,910
But I'll do everything I can.

907
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,919
I'll make myself feel confident enough...

908
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,519
to become the Super Ace.

909
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,159
(Several days later, the day to practice for the Water Stage)

910
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,230
- Turn. - Turn. Okay.

911
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,999
Since this is a team of ace members from each group,

912
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,199
I was slightly nervous.

913
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,569
But we worked well like one team.

914
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,000
So I was excited.

915
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,069
I can adjust the speed of the song to 0.8 or 0.9.

916
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,238
Should we give it a try with the 0.8 speed?

917
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,239
- Yes, for now. - Gosh.

918
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,479
(It's been 1 hour since they practiced together.)

919
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,940
The song is in a low pitch now.

920
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,949
(The ace members are making quick progress with the song.)

921
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,280
(They slow down the song to check the details.)

922
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,820
(Focused)

923
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,159
(Playing it at the 0.9 speed)

924
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,960
(Regular speed)

925
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,098
It was our first day practicing together,

926
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,230
but we were pretty much done.

927
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,940
I could feel that everyone was serious about this performance.

928
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,269
(They're practicing passionately.)

929
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:06,279
(Surprise guests visit them.)

930
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
(Freezing)

931
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:10,709
(A familiar face)

932
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,420
- Hello. - Hello.

933
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,788
(He's a choreographer who mainly worked with SEVENTEEN.)

934
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:20,558
(Choi Young Jun, representative choreographer for idol groups...)

935
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,289
(such as THE BOYZ and ZEROBASEONE)

936
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,289
I'm happy to meet everyone here.

937
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,259
I didn't know there would be so many main dancers in this group.

938
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,069
I like the combination of this team.

939
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,569
Their performance is bound to be excellent.

940
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,570
(The most talented ace members are in this group.)

941
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:34,099
You don't know what we're doing today, right?

942
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,400
We don't.

943
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,280
That's why I'm here.

944
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,379
Today...

945
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,539
(Why did Young Jun come to their practice studio?)

946
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,209
a hidden part...

947
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,010
(There's a hidden part in the Water Stage!)

948
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,119
will be revealed.

949
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,119
(Everyone is shocked at this surprise news.)

950
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,118
(He didn't see it coming!)

951
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,619
I thought there was hope, after all.

952
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,159
The only ray of hope that can drag me out of this darkness.

953
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,859
I plan to give my all to this.

954
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,130
- I'll play it. - Okay.

955
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,730
Why am I so nervous?

956
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,900
Right.

957
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,639
(We will reveal the hidden part of the Water Stage now.)

958
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,210
(The performer of the hidden part)

959
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:13,739
(The hidden part starts off the dance break in the center.)

960
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,909
(The choreography is centered around the hidden part.)

961
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:18,649
(This choreography allows him to showcase an advanced technique.)

962
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,848
My gosh, this is...

963
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,448
(This choreography allows him to showcase an advanced technique.)

964
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:23,289
I thought this was my chance.

965
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,389
I saw some floorwork in the choreography.

966
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,089
The thought that I could showcase a clean movement with this...

967
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,760
gave me hope that I had a chance now.

968
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,399
"This is it. I can do this."

969
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,630
"I have a shot."

970
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,538
I just have to do well. Then I can steal everyone's thunder.

971
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,968
I thought I had to take it no matter what.

972
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:43,110
I knew I wouldn't have any other chance without this.

973
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,269
Here's how we'll decide who takes the hidden part.

974
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,739
(Nervous)

975
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,239
(Focused)

976
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,678
You only have 20 minutes...

977
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,709
(No way.)

978
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,819
to master these moves.

979
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,848
We have to learn them?

980
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:56,489
The eight of us will vote on who takes this part.

981
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,388
The hidden part will leave such a strong impression to the point...

982
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:02,529
that it wouldn't matter who has the center position.

983
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,260
So I was worried.

984
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,059
In a way, the hidden part will be a lot more important...

985
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,599
than the parts we assigned among ourselves.

986
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,239
I actually thought that this could be my chance.

987
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,908
I want to be remembered as the one who stood out the most...

988
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:18,070
during this performance.

989
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,538
I'm here to represent CRAVITY.

990
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,110
So I'll do my best no matter what.

991
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,679
I thought to myself that I had to take this part once again.

992
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,980
Without this part, I will not shine at all.

993
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,448
I was completely focused on winning this part.

994
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,789
I want to show people my talent through the performance.

995
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,059
(Who will get to take the hidden part?)

996
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,658
Everyone.

997
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,059
Time is up.

998
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,630
I'll always go first!

999
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,729
(Respecting his confidence)

1000
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,139
- That's so cool. - Go for it.

1001
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,138
I tried really hard to give them the best performance...

1002
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:51,439
I could possibly come up with.

1003
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Okay.

1004
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,848
(The members who are watching are also nervous.)

1005
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:59,980
(How will HWAN WOONG perform?)

1006
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,889
He delivered the performance with his own style.

1007
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,789
(Liking his vibe)

1008
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,198
(He also seems to be enjoying it from his laid-back expression.)

1009
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,130
(Genuine reaction)

1010
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,409
I think I did a good job executing it with my own style.

1011
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,209
Thank you.

1012
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,539
(HWAN WOONG added his style to the choreography.)

1013
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,639
(Worried)

1014
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,880
This was a great part to win points.

1015
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,820
So I want to get it no matter what.

1016
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:37,449
I think I'm the best member to bring out the best vibe...

1017
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,819
of the Water Stage.

1018
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,319
I think I tried to be as dramatic as possible with my dancing,

1019
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,788
so they would only remember me.

1020
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:45,329
They might be able to see how hard I worked...

1021
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,929
all this time.

1022
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,098
They're really good.

1023
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:49,170
Totally.

1024
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:50,900
Last one.

1025
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,900
- Gosh, okay. - The youngest.

1026
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,969
I tried to control my mind.

1027
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,940
(JAE YUN needs the hidden part more than anyone.)

1028
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,150
I want the result to speak for itself.

1029
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:07,879
I'll focus on making my group happy. With that in mind,

1030
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,489
I'll give it my all to this.

1031
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,119
(His gaze suddenly changes.)

1032
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:13,590
(Focused)

1033
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,399
(JAE YUN is showing powerful dance movements.)

1034
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,199
(His eyes open wide.)

1035
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,409
(He neatly pulls off the advanced technique.)

1036
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,940
(Impressed)

1037
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,380
I thought that he could be a threat.

1038
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,889
He pulled off the key movements of the choreography.

1039
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,550
I thought that I should keep my eyes on him.

1040
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,129
(Everyone is done trying out for the hidden part.)

1041
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,300
Thank you.

1042
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,828
I didn't want to overdo it.

1043
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,500
I focused on giving them a clean performance.

1044
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:59,570
I gave them the performance I had in mind.

1045
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,340
So I might be able to get a result I want.

1046
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,269
Let's...

1047
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,510
vote now.

1048
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,209
Who thinks HWAN WOONG did a good job?

1049
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,679
What about Seunghwan? JAE YUN?

1050
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,449
MINHEE? XION?

1051
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,979
Who thinks HYUK did well?

1052
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,119
(The voting for the hidden part is over.)

1053
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,788
I expected their performances to leave...

1054
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,289
a bigger impression than this.

1055
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,530
I thought I had a good chance at winning.

1056
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:27,400
I trust myself. I can stand out.

1057
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,630
I know I am good at performing on stage if not anything else.

1058
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,969
So I was confident.

1059
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:36,909
I will announce the voting result.

1060
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,809
Please.

1061
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,279
The person that will get the hidden part is...

1062
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,510
Please.

1063
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,380
Please.

1064
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,449
- JAE YUN. - Gosh.

1065
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,589
(Sitting up straight)

1066
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,558
(JAE YUN gets the hidden part that he was desperately hoping for.)

1067
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,759
(Congratulations.)

1068
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,399
JAE YUN got a total of six votes.

1069
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,698
(Votes from 2 directors, Seunghwan, HYUK, HWAN WOONG, and SION)

1070
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,999
He won the hidden part.

1071
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,468
(Moved)

1072
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,639
(Sad)

1073
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,268
I'm so happy.

1074
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:13,880
I actually felt apologetic toward my team members.

1075
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,010
I'm happy...

1076
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,250
I'll be able to share the good news with them.

1077
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,150
Gosh.

1078
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,150
(Emotional)

1079
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,519
He rarely cries.

1080
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,590
- I don't believe it. - Crybaby.

1081
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,419
(Tears come to his eyes at the result of hard work.)

1082
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,320
- Thank you so much. - Gosh.

1083
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:32,190
I will finally be able to shine.

1084
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,329
Okay, I'm fine.

1085
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,229
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1086
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,670
I thought, "I can finally show people who I am."

1087
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,110
It was quite relieved.

1088
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,209
Are you okay?

1089
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,510
Whoever got the hidden part...

1090
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,940
will stand out.

1091
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,150
I was sure the audience...

1092
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,980
would give the person a high score.

1093
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,250
If JAE YUN is able to pull this off,

1094
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,320
it'll play a huge part in the change of rankings.

1095
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,929
I'll have to stay alert.

1096
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,329
I'll prepare my part with everything I got.

1097
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,899
(Part 5, 8TURN JAE YUN, Hidden Part)

1098
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,840
(What effect will the hidden part have on the rankings?)

1099
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:17,710
Did JAE YUN, who got the hidden part, do a good job?

1100
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,339
(Nodding)

1101
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,409
What does that mean?

1102
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,710
I'm not sure how it will go because of the hidden part.

1103
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,819
I heard you have not even seen it yet.

1104
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,920
- That's right. - Yes.

1105
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,348
You must be so nervous.

1106
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:30,518
I really hope you look good.

1107
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,590
I hope it turns out nicely.

1108
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,988
(Nervous)

1109
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,359
Is this your first time seeing it?

1110
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,630
Yes, it's my first time seeing it too.

1111
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,089
This is interesting.

1112
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,460
(He is excited and nervous to watch the video for the first time.)

1113
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,030
This is the Water Stage performance video.

1114
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,069
(Nervous)

1115
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,199
(Anxious)

1116
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:49,809
Let's see it.

1117
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,669
(High expectations)

1118
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,610
(Praying)

1119
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,709
Watch closely since I don't show up often.

1120
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,780
My eyes will be on MINHEE.

1121
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,819
(The rookie ace is restless.)

1122
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,178
- I'm curious. - Me too.

1123
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,389
The Water Stage.

1124
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:06,690
Unbelievable.

1125
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:08,018
(Hurry up and show us the Water Stage!)

1126
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,158
(The video judges can't wait to see it either.)

1127
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:10,389
- Show us. - Come on.

1128
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,828
(Curious)

1129
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:14,599
(The Water Stage begins with high expectations.)

1130
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,900
("Paradise" by MINHEE, SION, HYUK, Seunghwan, JAE YUN, HWAN WOONG)

1131
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,289
The outfits are shocking.

1132
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,558
Isn't MINHEE showing too much skin?

1133
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,699
(Embarrassed)

1134
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,449
(Gasping)

1135
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,420
He did that on purpose.

1136
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,929
(Ecstatic)

1137
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:27,139
What was that?

1138
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,538
(He screams when the performers constantly show their abs.)

1139
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:29,969
(HWAN WOONG was hoping for this reaction.)

1140
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,400
That's beautiful.

1141
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,570
(There's another beautiful member here.)

1142
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,599
They're so sexy.

1143
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,539
(Nervous)

1144
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,289
Where are they going?

1145
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,829
Where are they going?

1146
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,129
They went down.

1147
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,130
No way.

1148
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,038
(Is it what we're hoping for?)

1149
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,098
(They don't believe their eyes.)

1150
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,268
- It's water. - It's water.

1151
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:45,369
- It's water. - Gosh, it's water.

1152
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:50,650
This must be the hidden part.

1153
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,500
I got goosebumps.

1154
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,130
I don't believe it.

1155
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,469
(They are speechless.)

1156
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,259
(Gasping)

1157
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,619
Can this be aired?

1158
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,788
- Don't watch this. - No, I have to see it.

1159
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:37,889
You can't watch this.

1160
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,929
The harmony is amazing.

1161
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:17,730
(The CrewOne's ace, Jeong Seunghwan)

1162
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,840
(TEMPEST's ace, HYUK)

1163
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,440
(ONEUS' ace, HWAN WOONG)

1164
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,539
(YOUNITE's ace, SION)

1165
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,179
(8TURN's ace, JAE YUN)

1166
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:33,179
(CRAVITY's ace, MINHEE)

1167
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,518
(You can find "Paradise," the new song of Water Stage...)

1168
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:36,988
(on music streaming services...)

1169
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,419
(from noon on Friday, October 25.)

1170
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,518
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1171
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,029
(The number of views will not be reflected in the finals.)

1172
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,428
(Marveling)

1173
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:45,429
- That was good. - Gosh.

1174
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,300
You're so handsome.

1175
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,299
(He finally relaxes after watching the video.)

1176
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,670
Everyone was so impressive.

1177
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,230
- Good job. - Awesome.

1178
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,500
That was amazing.

1179
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,170
- That was truly impressive. - They did such a good job.

1180
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:58,738
That was impressive.

1181
00:48:58,739 --> 00:48:59,940
- Good job. - You did a really good job.

1182
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:01,279
- Good job. - You stood out.

1183
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,839
I think we can look forward to a good result.

1184
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,949
- You did a really good job. - You were sexy.

1185
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,780
I was disappointed with the part, but you did a good job.

1186
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,348
That doesn't matter. All that matters is that he shined.

1187
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,420
He was the best.

1188
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,550
It is time to check the rankings...

1189
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,760
of the Water Stage.

1190
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,689
(Nervous at the surprisingly quick result announcement)

1191
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,630
- Right away? - Right away?

1192
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,899
(Help me!)

1193
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,158
They have the result right away?

1194
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:23,699
(I won't watch this.)

1195
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,170
- This is unbelievable. - Right away like this?

1196
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,238
The Ace Ranking is determined...

1197
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:30,538
by just the video judges' voting.

1198
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:31,839
(The 1st Round's Ace Battle is determined by the video judges.)

1199
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,009
Which member will become the Super Ace...

1200
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,480
and win 5,000 points?

1201
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,579
I have no idea who it will be.

1202
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,849
We didn't see it in person.

1203
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,780
- We just got to see the video. - I know.

1204
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,718
I will now...

1205
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,019
announce the Ace Ranking of the Water Stage.

1206
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,029
Here it comes.

1207
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,360
I think I showed everything I practiced.

1208
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,999
I'm trying not to feel nervous, but it isn't easy.

1209
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,030
No, it isn't.

1210
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,468
I think I delivered my part well,

1211
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:02,340
and I hope the audience felt it.

1212
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:04,739
I just want to be in the top three.

1213
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:07,480
- I practiced hard... - You'll be in the top three.

1214
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,679
And am confident.

1215
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,480
It's over now.

1216
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,780
Just like I've done so far,

1217
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,789
I will win 1st place for the 4th time.

1218
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,019
I did a good job at emphasizing my charming facial expressions.

1219
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,590
So I think I will get a high ranking.

1220
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,099
I never imagined getting a low ranking.

1221
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:31,130
So I will get a high ranking through this round.

1222
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,399
I'll aim for first place...

1223
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,070
like I always did.

1224
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:39,110
First, I will announce the high ranking aces...

1225
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:41,179
from 1st to 3rd place.

1226
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,880
- Starting with the high rankings? - This is how he's doing it.

1227
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,110
Please.

1228
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,280
My name has to be in it.

1229
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,789
It would be a mistake if it weren't.

1230
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,389
I'm sure it is.

1231
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,219
I'll keep my eyes at the top.

1232
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,460
I really hope my name is in it.

1233
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,929
It's okay if your name isn't in it.

1234
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,860
You've done really well so far.

1235
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,699
Is that why I want it more?

1236
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
I'm sure you're one of them.

1237
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,199
Show us the high ranking aces of the Water Stage.

1238
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,039
(ONEUS' ace, HWAN WOONG, CRAVITY's ace, MINHEE)

1239
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:17,210
(MINHEE got a high ranking.)

1240
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,009
- I believed in you. - Good job.

1241
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,419
- Oh, yes. - Yes.

1242
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,420
(He finally smiles after getting a high ranking.)

1243
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:23,589
- You did it. - Yes.

1244
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,889
- Good job. - I trusted you.

1245
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:26,049
- Okay. - Good job.

1246
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,388
It's okay as long as you aren't in last place.

1247
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,389
(Falling into his seat)

1248
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,889
- Good job. - It's such a good feeling...

1249
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:32,630
to be able to gain points.

1250
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,098
- Let's do this. - Yes.

1251
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:35,899
(MINHEE is relieved after checking the ranking.)

1252
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,570
- Good job. - You did well without a part.

1253
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,899
(ONEUS' HWAN WOONG got a high ranking.)

1254
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,308
You got a high ranking.

1255
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,669
- You'll get at least 3,000 points. - Okay.

1256
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,308
- You'll get at least 3,000 points. - Okay.

1257
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:48,480
(He smiles automatically.)

1258
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,779
- You did a good job. - Gosh.

1259
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,279
- You did a really good job. - Good job.

1260
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,379
- Seriously. - JAE YUN.

1261
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,448
- Thank you. - JAE YUN.

1262
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:56,619
- JAE YUN. - JAE YUN.

1263
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,750
(The other ace that got a high ranking is 8TURN's JAE YUN.)

1264
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:01,920
(JAE YUN did it!)

1265
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,760
- I told you. - Good job.

1266
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,098
- I told you, JAE YUN. - Hey.

1267
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,429
- Thank you. - Good job.

1268
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
I felt really good.

1269
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:16,940
I thought I had a high chance of becoming the Super Ace.

1270
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,610
You did a really good job.

1271
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,179
- Good job. - I told you, didn't I?

1272
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,538
- Good job. - Good job.

1273
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,779
- Good job, JAE YUN. - You really did well.

1274
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,279
8TURN's JAE YUN didn't have a good part,

1275
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,219
but he got a high ranking.

1276
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,489
I'm up there with the number ones of the Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.

1277
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,058
The fact that you're up there is amazing.

1278
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,059
I know.

1279
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,889
(TEMPEST didn't get a high ranking.)

1280
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,900
I was disappointed in myself.

1281
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:47,070
I thought I should've tried...

1282
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:48,469
a bit harder.

1283
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,940
This is such a bummer.

1284
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,510
It's a bitter feeling.

1285
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:53,480
I'm sad since I tried hard.

1286
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,940
You did a good job.

1287
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:56,179
(YOUNITE also got a low ranking.)

1288
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:57,380
It isn't over yet.

1289
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,948
- Good job. - It's okay.

1290
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:04,319
I could've brought a good opportunity to my team.

1291
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,250
I was disappointed that I wasn't able to.

1292
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,389
- You can win fourth place. - That's right.

1293
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:09,690
It's okay.

1294
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:12,389
The higher 8TURN's ranking is, the worse it is for us.

1295
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:13,559
That's right.

1296
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,269
Who is the Super Ace...

1297
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,369
of the Water Stage that will win 5,000 points?

1298
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,010
Super Ace?

1299
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,469
I think it's HWAN WOONG.

1300
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,308
He totally stood out.

1301
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:29,309
(HWAN WOONG of ONEUS got a good part with his benefit.)

1302
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,750
If HWAN WOONG wins again, is he the Super Ace?

1303
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:33,679
He's the Super Super Ace.

1304
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,689
I think it'll be HWAN WOONG.

1305
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,989
- Super Ace. - JAE YUN?

1306
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,320
He wasn't on camera often but had good facial expressions.

1307
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,328
JAE YUN did the hidden part.

1308
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,329
That's right.

1309
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,460
(Or could it be JAE YUN of 8TURN who did the hidden part?)

1310
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:48,559
I think JAE YUN stood out the most.

1311
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,800
JAE YUN deserves to win first place. He was the best.

1312
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,300
Yes, he objectively stood out.

1313
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,739
JAE YUN has a chance.

1314
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:00,309
MINHEE stood out.

1315
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,579
I felt like I was in paradise.

1316
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,618
He did well even though he was...

1317
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,480
between the hidden part and the main part.

1318
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:09,719
Yes, he shone between them.

1319
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:12,989
Of the three aces,

1320
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,719
one of them won first place in the Water Stage.

1321
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:18,559
Show us who it is.

1322
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:24,170
(Who is the Super Ace?)

1323
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,599
(8TURN's ace, JAE YUN)

1324
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:29,570
(Screaming in excitement)

1325
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,739
Super Ace.

1326
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,510
(The CrewOne is flustered as JAE YUN became the Super Ace.)

1327
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,479
(This is crazy.)

1328
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,819
- JAE YUN. - What?

1329
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,319
(JAE YUN is shocked at the unexpected result.)

1330
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,388
You won, JAE YUN.

1331
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,049
- JAE YUN. - JAE YUN.

1332
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,090
(8TURN basks in the joy of winning 1st place.)

1333
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,959
Well done.

1334
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,388
- Thank you. - Well done.

1335
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,230
- Well done. - You did a good job.

1336
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,300
(A Super Ace is born from the newest team.)

1337
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,699
- Super Ace. - Yes, super.

1338
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:00,800
- Can I give you a kiss? - No.

1339
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,340
This is me.

1340
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,738
I can't believe I beat HWAN WOONG.

1341
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:10,178
- I know. - It's an achievement...

1342
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,449
- that will go down in history. - Of course.

1343
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,919
JAE YUN of 8TURN won first place.

1344
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,118
(Water Stage Super Ace, JAE YUN of 8TURN)

1345
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,219
Impressive.

1346
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,759
He became the Super Ace out of the six aces...

1347
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,090
and won 5,000 points.

1348
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:27,630
- The hidden part played a big role. - Yes, that's right.

1349
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,570
He beat HWAN WOONG.

1350
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:33,869
Gosh, you're right.

1351
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:35,139
He lost to the youngest member.

1352
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:38,009
He got stripped of his rank.

1353
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,670
- Yes, he did. - JAE YUN did really well.

1354
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,779
Yes, he did.

1355
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,550
He's the first to beat HWAN WOONG.

1356
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,750
(Deep in thought)

1357
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,550
We have to make sure to beat TEMPEST.

1358
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,888
We have to beat TEMPEST and YOUNITE.

1359
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,949
(The teams that got a low ranking can't let their guard down.)

1360
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:56,460
Next are the aces from 4th to 6th places.

1361
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,960
HYUK of TEMPEST,

1362
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,328
(HYUK of TEMPEST)

1363
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:01,399
SION of YOUNITE,

1364
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,259
(SION of YOUNITE)

1365
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,828
and Jeong Seunghwan of The CrewOne.

1366
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:06,840
(Jeong Seunghwan of The CrewOne)

1367
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,170
(The 3 low ranking teams)

1368
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,539
My heart is breaking.

1369
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,218
Please let us be in fourth place.

1370
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:22,250
Please be in fourth place.

1371
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:26,889
Out of the 3 aces, 1 is in the lowest, 6th place.

1372
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,860
The ace that is in sixth place...

1373
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:33,929
will get zero points.

1374
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,530
Gosh.

1375
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:38,929
I can't be in sixth place.

1376
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,139
I want to win points even if it's only 1,000 points.

1377
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:45,269
I'll be in shock if I get zero points.

1378
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,209
Getting zero points is painful.

1379
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,780
Getting zero points is really painful.

1380
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,550
It's not about the points. It just breaks my heart.

1381
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,980
It isn't just 1,000 points. Zero points is too big a gap.

1382
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,119
I will announce the ace...

1383
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,590
in 6th place out of the 3 teams.

1384
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,619
- Just 6th place? - The person in 6th place?

1385
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,360
What about 4th and 5th?

1386
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,590
This is so cruel.

1387
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,960
I'm worried.

1388
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Gosh.

1389
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:12,769
Sixth place in the Water Stage.

1390
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,639
Show us who it is.

1391
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,710
(Who is in 6th place out of TEMPEST, YOUNITE, and The CrewOne?)

1392
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,879
(Surprised)

1393
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,039
(Shocked)

1394
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,750
No, you did well.

1395
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,380
(Gasping)

1396
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,179
You did well.

1397
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,090
(YOUNITE's ace, SION)

1398
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,288
- You did well. - In sixth place...

1399
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:34,860
is SION of YOUNITE.

1400
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,760
I felt bad for him.

1401
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:41,530
I felt bad because I knew how hard he practiced.

1402
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,729
- You did a good job. - You did well.

1403
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,400
I was just disappointed.

1404
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,739
Since I didn't get any points,

1405
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,039
I felt like I was burdening the team.

1406
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:53,070
HYUNGSEOK was the first person that came to my mind.

1407
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,579
The first round is not over yet.

1408
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,909
Please.

1409
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,480
We still have the Fire Stage.

1410
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,488
The scores of the Water and Fire Stages...

1411
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,420
will be added up to determine the result of the first round.

1412
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:09,989
(Gasping)

1413
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,059
He only announced the aces in 1st and 6th places.

1414
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,900
Before we watch the video of the Fire Stage,

1415
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,199
let's see who the aces of the Fire Stage are.

1416
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,768
(Oh Junseok, MYUNG HO, LEE DO)

1417
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:21,099
(HYUNGSEOK, TAEYOUNG, LEW)

1418
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,138
- Let's go, MYUNG HO. - Let's go.

1419
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:25,139
- It's MYUNG HO. - Fire.

1420
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,880
Anyone can see you're like fire.

1421
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,480
His personality is like fire.

1422
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,579
- That isn't a compliment. - Your passion.

1423
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,010
- Let's go, Junseok. - I'm sure you did well.

1424
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,848
- I can't wait, TAEYOUNG. - I look forward to it, TAEYOUNG.

1425
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,219
Okay, look forward to it.

1426
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,988
(Sighing)

1427
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:43,090
Don't be such a wimp when you're our fire.

1428
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,190
(Laughing)

1429
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:45,859
(His anxiety is at maximum level, and he can't hear a thing.)

1430
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,158
Let's see how LEW is in fire.

1431
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,529
I'm going to log out for a while.

1432
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,530
I'm sure he did well.

1433
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,328
(LEW has logged out.)

1434
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,170
That is a strong lineup.

1435
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,239
This is a strong lineup as well.

1436
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,340
I heard there was a fierce battle over the parts once again.

1437
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,650
If someone gets the part he wants,

1438
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,920
someone else has to take a part he doesn't want.

1439
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,579
(Feeling bitter)

1440
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:10,949
Did you fight?

1441
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,090
It was a fierce battle.

1442
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:15,059
It was intense.

1443
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,760
(What is the full story of the battle of parts in the Fire Stage?)

1444
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,629
Shall we get to practice since we're all here?

1445
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,630
Sounds good.

1446
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:22,329
(They jump right into practice for the Fire Stage.)

1447
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:25,369
(They practice enthusiastically.)

1448
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:26,969
(Swift)

1449
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,409
- Hi. - Hi.

1450
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,939
- Hi. - Hi.

1451
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,509
- Hi. - Hi.

1452
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,510
(The greetings don't stop.)

1453
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:36,948
- Hi. - Hi.

1454
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:38,349
- Hi. - You're having a lot of fun.

1455
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,618
(From EXO...)

1456
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,279
(and TAEMIN...)

1457
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,849
(to the choreography of the Fire Stage)

1458
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,960
(Back Koo Young, top choreographer for boy groups)

1459
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,989
When I study...

1460
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,488
the members that chose "fire,"

1461
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:54,460
you all look like you'd like this kind of stuff.

1462
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,129
(It means they all look right for the part.)

1463
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,828
(He agrees.)

1464
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,840
The choreography is so cool and powerful.

1465
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,969
It's awesome.

1466
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,739
We'd love to work hard and pull it off.

1467
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,379
Please do your best.

1468
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,380
(Let's go, Unit Fire.)

1469
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:11,749
There are Parts 1 to 6.

1470
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,480
- Yes. - How did you choose them?

1471
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,619
(This is how we chose them.)

1472
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:16,820
It was horrific.

1473
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,988
(Hanging his head)

1474
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:20,819
It's like watching "Street Man Fighter."

1475
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,090
(That makes me curious.)

1476
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:25,829
Should we check out the parts again?

1477
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,730
(They watch the video to distribute the parts.)

1478
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,900
(Part 3 is at the center in the beginning of the song.)

1479
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,900
Part Three was a very important part.

1480
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,138
And I wanted a part...

1481
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,679
that had the chorus.

1482
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:43,849
Considering that, Part 2 and Part 3.

1483
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,848
I believe the highlight is when the dance suddenly turns...

1484
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:50,150
dynamic in the chorus.

1485
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,090
I could only see the center member...

1486
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:55,190
during the chorus.

1487
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,420
(Part 2, the center, leads the chorus in general.)

1488
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:58,889
Part Two seemed like the centerpiece of the song.

1489
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,999
- I love the energy here. - Yes.

1490
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,159
(Focused)

1491
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,030
(Part 2 is the center even in the dance break.)

1492
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:09,170
Part Two was my priority.

1493
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,639
I was going to get Part Two, no matter what.

1494
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:14,610
(Everyone covets Part 2.)

1495
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:17,010
(The video ends.)

1496
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:18,409
(Impressed)

1497
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,049
(What's the first part that they want?)

1498
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,420
So, that was the video.

1499
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,219
I want...

1500
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:25,250
- Parts 2 and 3. - Parts 2 and 3.

1501
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:27,788
Parts 2 and 3.

1502
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:29,389
(Parts 2 and 3 are at the center during the chorus.)

1503
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,988
- If I had to pick one, - Yes.

1504
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:32,260
I'd choose Part Two.

1505
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:33,559
Part Two.

1506
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,928
The one at the center.

1507
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:36,030
The one at the center.

1508
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:38,369
(I can't believe we want the same part.)

1509
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:42,300
(They only read each other's countenances.)

1510
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:45,409
This is tough.

1511
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,039
(But...)

1512
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,110
What about you, TAEYOUNG?

1513
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,780
Is there a part you have in mind?

1514
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,219
(TAEYOUNG has the right to pick his part first.)

1515
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,050
(Grinning)

1516
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,420
That smile means...

1517
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,550
No.

1518
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:00,860
Okay.

1519
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,260
I sensed it too.

1520
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:03,889
You saw it, didn't you?

1521
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,530
Obviously, I want Part Two.

1522
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,860
Part Two that everyone wants.

1523
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,530
I called dibs on it.

1524
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:10,900
I'm sorry,

1525
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,299
but since I have the right to choose the part first,

1526
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,469
I'll take...

1527
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,769
Part Two.

1528
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:18,570
Goodness.

1529
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:21,179
I would have taken Part Two if it were me.

1530
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,739
It has truly begun.

1531
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,210
It's a battle for parts now.

1532
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,920
The Video Evaluation plays a huge part.

1533
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,050
I thought my priority should be to be seen on the monitor.

1534
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,690
That makes your part even more crucial.

1535
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:36,589
We should distribute the rest of the parts.

1536
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,388
I was thinking of Part Six.

1537
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:39,630
Part Six.

1538
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,058
Part Six has to rap and dance.

1539
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,269
If I'm getting a rapper's part, I want Part Six.

1540
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,440
I think you and I have similar thoughts.

1541
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,940
I also want either Part 6 or Part 3.

1542
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:52,968
I thought Parts 3 and 6 would be...

1543
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,840
the most visible after Part Two.

1544
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,678
I also think Part Three is...

1545
01:02:57,679 --> 01:02:59,009
the most often at the center...

1546
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,849
other than Part Two.

1547
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,519
Who wants Part Three?

1548
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,719
(LEE DO, MYUNG HO, and LEW)

1549
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,189
- Part Three. - Junseok too?

1550
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,260
Four people.

1551
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,589
(Exclaiming)

1552
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,630
What about you, HYUNGSEOK?

1553
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,129
(And the only pacifist, HYUNGSEOK)

1554
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:16,699
- I only have eyes for Part 5. - Part 5.

1555
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:19,030
Then, the 4 of you will compete for Part 3 first.

1556
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,239
In the end,

1557
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,538
most of Part Three is...

1558
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,138
- dancing, right? - Yes.

1559
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:27,510
That's practically a dancer's part.

1560
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,010
I was thinking...

1561
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:31,610
that we could dance these parts.

1562
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,949
Have you already memorized the choreography?

1563
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:37,050
You have?

1564
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,250
Yes. I kind of memorized it by eye.

1565
01:03:40,389 --> 01:03:41,518
(That's impressive.)

1566
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:43,489
That shows how desperately he wants it.

1567
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,059
I wanted that part, so the moment I saw it...

1568
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,899
(This is my chance!)

1569
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,900
Do you mind if I say something presumptuous?

1570
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:51,299
(What do you want to say?)

1571
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,768
I also memorized some of Part Six.

1572
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:55,299
(The ace members of lower ranks are the most desperate.)

1573
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,900
You guys are determined.

1574
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,868
(Another member from a lower rank, LEW)

1575
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,039
What about you, LEW?

1576
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,610
(Glancing)

1577
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:03,610
It's all about preparations, right?

1578
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:07,479
I've practiced both Parts 3 and 6.

1579
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,078
(This is getting intense.)

1580
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,550
It suddenly turned into "Street Man Fighter."

1581
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,189
It turned into "Street Man Fighter" out of nowhere.

1582
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,489
I should memorize the moves too.

1583
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,590
I was caught off-guard...

1584
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,229
because the CRAVITY member and I were the only ones who did nothing.

1585
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,000
The rest of them had already practiced the dance.

1586
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:25,399
It was an emergency in my head.

1587
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,500
I thought, "I'm in trouble."

1588
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,399
How could I secure this part?

1589
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,908
- I'll go and memorize it now. - Sure. Take your time.

1590
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,170
I decided to ask for some time to memorize it.

1591
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,909
My sole purpose was to memorize the moves.

1592
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,848
(HWAN WOONG had already used his right to choose the part first...)

1593
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:39,409
(in the Water Stage.)

1594
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:41,819
(Sighing)

1595
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,750
Everything is a game of survival here.

1596
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,518
The whole thing is a survival.

1597
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,889
But I badly wanted Part Three.

1598
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,760
I thought I'd be in danger...

1599
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,658
if I got a part that wasn't so visible.

1600
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:56,530
So, I desperately wanted Part Three.

1601
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:59,230
They were all working so hard.

1602
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:00,799
I thought, "I should go all out too."

1603
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,869
(The aces from lower ranks desperately want Part 3.)

1604
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,900
The aces of the Fire Stage are so cool.

1605
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:06,010
I could sense their enthusiasm.

1606
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,809
I had already taken a part,

1607
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,139
so it was fun to watch.

1608
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,179
If you're done, should we take a vote?

1609
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,178
- Sure. - Let's go.

1610
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:15,380
- Yes. - Yes.

1611
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:17,219
- Are you all ready? - Yes.

1612
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,090
May I go first?

1613
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,420
Confidence.

1614
01:05:20,659 --> 01:05:22,489
You get extra zero points.

1615
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,030
Extra zero points?

1616
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:25,860
I can't be biased, you know.

1617
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:27,328
(Judge TAEYOUNG is pretty fair.)

1618
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:28,399
Then,

1619
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,698
the battle for Part Three in the Fire Stage...

1620
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:31,800
begins now!

1621
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:32,869
Fight!

1622
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,769
My goal is first place.

1623
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,139
I need to save my team.

1624
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,709
Since Part Three was so essential,

1625
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,079
I was determined to take it.

1626
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:44,010
I'm watching out for Junseok the most.

1627
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,809
(The first candidate, Junseok)

1628
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:52,090
He was nice and powerful.

1629
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:54,618
Junseok is powerful when he dances.

1630
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:55,659
(Junseok with powerful dance moves)

1631
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,229
He was swift...

1632
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:00,760
and nimble.

1633
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,369
He perfectly pulled off the energy.

1634
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:08,170
He was nearly perfect in terms of the dance.

1635
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,169
(The second candidate, LEW)

1636
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,308
Let's go.

1637
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:13,440
I'd be lying if I hadn't felt any pressure at all.

1638
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:15,440
Our Ace Ranking...

1639
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,980
wasn't that high, after all.

1640
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,280
So, I meant to win Part Three.

1641
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,889
I was fascinated by his moves that were like contemporary dance.

1642
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:30,659
But it didn't really suit the fire theme.

1643
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,429
But I had just memorized it.

1644
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:37,599
Just a second.

1645
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,099
I was so anxious.

1646
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:41,669
Like, "What should I do to make this better?"

1647
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,070
"I should just go with my feelings."

1648
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,469
(The third candidate, LEE DO)

1649
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,710
I was so looking forward to it, but...

1650
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:54,349
It wasn't good enough.

1651
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:57,549
I thought he lacked practice.

1652
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,018
(Everyone thought his dance could be better.)

1653
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:00,519
That's all I have for now.

1654
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:01,989
(Good work.)

1655
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,558
I couldn't quite get the details of the choreography.

1656
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:07,190
I don't even remember how I did it.

1657
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,929
MYUNG HO.

1658
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,399
Our team was...

1659
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,139
still in a lower ranking,

1660
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:15,900
so I needed Part Three.

1661
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:18,639
I did keep him in check.

1662
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,340
(MYUNG HO finally shows them his dance.)

1663
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,579
(Cheering)

1664
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,419
MYUNG HO made use of his facial expressions,

1665
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,489
and he prepared a lot of gestures.

1666
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,089
He even altered the gestures...

1667
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,989
to suit his style better.

1668
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,389
Oh, nice.

1669
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:41,860
I thought that I might not get the part.

1670
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,730
I really need Part Three...

1671
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,269
to score a lot of ace points.

1672
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:48,869
I'm desperate.

1673
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:50,440
This is so fierce.

1674
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:51,739
(Part 3 will be decided by Self-Evaluation.)

1675
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,909
Who would like Junseok to take Part Three?

1676
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,010
In 1, 2, 3.

1677
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,150
Okay. Good.

1678
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,750
I was hoping that I'd win.

1679
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,920
Next, LEW and LEE DO. In 1, 2, 3.

1680
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,889
(LEW and LEE DO get 0 votes.)

1681
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,590
(Sighing)

1682
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:12,488
(He can only sigh at the sad situation.)

1683
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:13,630
MYUNG HO.

1684
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,500
In 1, 2, 3.

1685
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:17,799
(He gets all 5 votes from everyone but him.)

1686
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,470
MYUNG HO has been unanimously chosen...

1687
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:22,038
for Part Three.

1688
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:23,198
(That's a relief.)

1689
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,210
Nice.

1690
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,608
- I admit it. - Thank you.

1691
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:26,669
Nice.

1692
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,039
We all voted for you.

1693
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:30,209
(Thank you.)

1694
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,409
(Relieved)

1695
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,648
Part Three was hard-earned,

1696
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:35,849
so I'll make sure...

1697
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,319
that the audience only sees me in this performance.

1698
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,920
Next, Part Six. The ones who chose it were...

1699
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:43,760
- Who were they? First, me. - Who were they?

1700
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:45,658
- I think the same people can go. - The same ones?

1701
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:47,599
It's the same ones.

1702
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,260
- We have to decide. - Yes.

1703
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,658
What do we do?

1704
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,199
If I don't get Part Six, I actually have to go home.

1705
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,800
I quickly analyzed the cause of defeat from Part Three.

1706
01:08:58,409 --> 01:08:59,869
First of all, when I watched MYUNG HO's performance,

1707
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,578
he was relaxed,

1708
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:03,909
he had various facial expressions, and he altered the gestures.

1709
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,349
I thought, "Okay. I can do that."

1710
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,119
I bet everything on winning Part Six.

1711
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,420
Part Six was the only choice.

1712
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,850
When 5,000 points are on the line, you have to take it.

1713
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:16,720
(The battle for Part 6 begins.)

1714
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,359
(Part 6 is their last opportunity to sing the chorus at the center.)

1715
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:20,729
(The aces do their best...)

1716
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:24,368
(to get the part.)

1717
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,630
Hey! Nice.

1718
01:09:26,869 --> 01:09:28,670
Junseok stood out the most.

1719
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,938
I think...

1720
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:32,239
he best expressed the energy of the dance.

1721
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,779
Let's start with Junseok. Who thinks he deserves...

1722
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,609
Part 6? In 1, 2, 3.

1723
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:39,478
(He gets all 5 votes from everyone but him.)

1724
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,680
Junseok has been unanimously chosen...

1725
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,279
for Part Six.

1726
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,919
(Junseok gets Part 6.)

1727
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,920
Nice.

1728
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:48,189
Thank you.

1729
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:50,960
Thank you, everyone.

1730
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,930
I got Part Six!

1731
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,800
I don't have to go home!

1732
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:57,899
(This is bad.)

1733
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:00,630
It was an emergency.

1734
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:02,840
The siren was going off in my head,

1735
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:04,939
and all I had in mind was to make any part look better.

1736
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:08,180
We have Parts 1, 4, and 5 left.

1737
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,809
As you know, Part One has...

1738
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,379
- High notes. - some high notes.

1739
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,380
Right.

1740
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,148
But it's way too high.

1741
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:15,180
- You're right. - Yes.

1742
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,289
It has high notes, ad-libs, and chorus.

1743
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,488
I believe Part One is so essential...

1744
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:23,819
that it's almost the main part.

1745
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,328
I would give it a try if it was moderately high, but...

1746
01:10:26,329 --> 01:10:27,358
I know.

1747
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:29,430
But it's a note that I've never sung before.

1748
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:30,828
You've never sung it before.

1749
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:31,829
(It's insanely high.)

1750
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:35,868
But there was no one left to take Part One.

1751
01:10:35,869 --> 01:10:36,899
(There are only 3 rappers remaining.)

1752
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,640
I tried to look at it from an objective point of view.

1753
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,239
Strategically speaking, Part One might be better.

1754
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,350
I believe the main vocalist...

1755
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,579
gets one chance, at least.

1756
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:52,090
I was thinking of grasping that chance.

1757
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:55,520
Then, I'll take Part One.

1758
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,788
(That's bold.)

1759
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:00,959
(The members don't know how to react to his bold choice.)

1760
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,800
- That's cool. - You can sing these notes, right?

1761
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:05,629
He did sing...

1762
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,340
low notes in Round One,

1763
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,340
and I knew him as a rapper.

1764
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,369
He's mostly done rapping parts with a low voice.

1765
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,210
I meant to perfectly pull off the main vocalist's part...

1766
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,149
and impress the audience.

1767
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:21,180
That will be my battlefield this time.

1768
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,219
- HYUNGSEOK wanted... - I only had eyes...

1769
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,050
- for Part Five. - You did.

1770
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:30,590
I saw them practicing Parts 3 and 6 hard,

1771
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,689
and I practiced mine,

1772
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,159
just in case.

1773
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,670
I'm going to secure Part Five, no matter what happens.

1774
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,199
But if LEE DO wishes to take on this part...

1775
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,340
(Nervous)

1776
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,470
You can take it.

1777
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:47,409
Thank you, LEE DO.

1778
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,779
I was focused on pulling off any parts that were given to me.

1779
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,408
So, we've distributed all the parts.

1780
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,679
(The parts for the Fire Stage have been distributed...)

1781
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,050
(after a long and arduous discussion.)

1782
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,948
We have another mission for you.

1783
01:11:58,949 --> 01:12:00,489
- What? - What?

1784
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,090
Please stop.

1785
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:03,420
- There's always one more thing. - Please stop.

1786
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:04,890
(Fire Stage, choreography video)

1787
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,529
"Create your own solo performance?"

1788
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:10,060
Oh, there's an intro.

1789
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:12,368
There was a hidden part?

1790
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,770
Mnet really is something.

1791
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:16,499
This is ridiculous.

1792
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,769
(Making a straight face)

1793
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,239
(Focused)

1794
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,380
I thought this could be my opportunity.

1795
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,609
Because I didn't get the part that I wanted,

1796
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,310
I was going to get this one.

1797
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:28,250
You get the intro for 30 seconds all to yourself.

1798
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:31,720
My part is mostly in the second verse,

1799
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,590
so I definitely need the hidden part.

1800
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,819
Won't getting this part make you the Super Ace?

1801
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:40,760
The hidden part would completely turn things around.

1802
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:42,658
I'm going to get the intro,

1803
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:45,199
so I'll be the Super Ace.

1804
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,500
I need the hidden part...

1805
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,840
to become the Super Ace.

1806
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,868
Like in "Street Man Fighter," you'll compete for the hidden part.

1807
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,009
(The beginning of the battle for the hidden part)

1808
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,478
(In denial)

1809
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:57,539
Who wants to go first?

1810
01:12:57,779 --> 01:12:59,749
I'll go.

1811
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,119
- Okay. - Goodness.

1812
01:13:02,619 --> 01:13:04,149
I like your confidence.

1813
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:06,020
The intro is the beginning of the song, right?

1814
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,689
So, I'll go first with confidence.

1815
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:10,319
(Appreciating his spirit)

1816
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,430
That's cool.

1817
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:15,529
You could say that this is our final chance.

1818
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,930
We either go up the ranks or go home.

1819
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,930
It's either one for us.

1820
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,600
But we can't choose to go home.

1821
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:26,510
So, I'm going to win the hidden part.

1822
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,380
From the start...

1823
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:29,939
I like that pose.

1824
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,710
(Check out Junseok's performance of the hidden part.)

1825
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,818
(Admiring)

1826
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:39,920
He danced to all the beats.

1827
01:13:42,989 --> 01:13:45,460
(Junseok shows off some high-level techniques.)

1828
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,699
(And a relaxed face)

1829
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,039
What was that?

1830
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:56,840
He was flying around.

1831
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:01,710
I could see his determination to win the part.

1832
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,550
(A bullet of love for Koo Young)

1833
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:11,189
(He ended the performance without any mistakes.)

1834
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,188
(That was good.)

1835
01:14:17,189 --> 01:14:19,759
(Impressed)

1836
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,789
You've seriously...

1837
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:24,728
braced yourself for this.

1838
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:25,729
Thank you.

1839
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:28,739
(Amazed)

1840
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:29,969
That was so good.

1841
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,140
First off, I loved your energy.

1842
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,109
It's safe to say that it's the finest one for the intro.

1843
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:36,539
Thank you.

1844
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:41,619
I think Junseok is an amazing dancer,

1845
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:43,020
so I have to keep him in check.

1846
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:45,189
I already had a good part,

1847
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,789
but I braced myself to become the Super Ace.

1848
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,788
(Focused)

1849
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:53,090
(Check out the performance for the hidden part by TAEYOUNG.)

1850
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,199
(That's a good start.)

1851
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,640
I was dazed as I watched him.

1852
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:09,039
Contrary to Junseok, he added a bit of sexiness.

1853
01:15:10,779 --> 01:15:12,350
I thought, "I didn't know you could do it that way too."

1854
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,050
I did hold him in check.

1855
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:18,488
(The ending has a highlight.)

1856
01:15:18,489 --> 01:15:19,489
Okay.

1857
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,390
(Everyone applauds.)

1858
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,289
It was very...

1859
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,658
(Nervous)

1860
01:15:28,659 --> 01:15:29,699
sexy.

1861
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,469
- Yes. - Your moves...

1862
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,970
and everything tend to be quite sexy.

1863
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,899
He did it quite differently from mine,

1864
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,710
so I thought I might lose.

1865
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,479
And you're good. You're an excellent dancer.

1866
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,779
I did it without any regrets.

1867
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,710
I'll go back to my team as the Super Ace.

1868
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:49,819
Next...

1869
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,589
Where are you going?

1870
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,850
What do you have this time?

1871
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,590
(He's about to cry.)

1872
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,189
Oh, gosh.

1873
01:15:57,689 --> 01:15:58,859
- What is that? - It's the one.

1874
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:01,090
- Oh, my gosh. - What is it?

1875
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:04,059
(MYUNG HO came up with a fan performance.)

1876
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,439
The hidden part will play a huge part in the performance,

1877
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,640
so I really want it.

1878
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,340
Oh, my gosh.

1879
01:16:13,109 --> 01:16:14,880
I thought, "I bet he came prepared once again."

1880
01:16:15,539 --> 01:16:16,840
That's why I was more afraid.

1881
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:24,079
I'll give them a show that only I can do.

1882
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,890
I'm obviously aiming at first place.

1883
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,720
Now, I need to beat them and take the part.

1884
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,288
I thought it might be decided...

1885
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:36,600
by a tiny bit of difference.

1886
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,398
Now, the hidden part goes to...

1887
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:42,869
(The Fire Stage will be revealed now!)

1888
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,270
Now,

1889
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,939
let's check out the video of the Fire Stage,

1890
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:48,608
which will showcase a contrasting charm...

1891
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:49,739
to the Water Stage.

1892
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:51,409
Fire.

1893
01:16:51,949 --> 01:16:53,350
I can't watch this.

1894
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:55,318
It's my first time seeing it too.

1895
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,319
(Worried and excited)

1896
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,880
Is there a hidden part?

1897
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,849
It will be around 30 to 40 seconds.

1898
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,250
- Is the intro a solo performance? - Yes.

1899
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,489
The Fire Stage is even more intense.

1900
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,759
The hidden part is so long.

1901
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,760
- Right? - Seriously.

1902
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:07,959
- It's so long. - Almost 40 seconds.

1903
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,960
That's a huge benefit.

1904
01:17:08,961 --> 01:17:11,529
You're at the center with everyone in the Water Stage,

1905
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:13,529
but you're on the stage by yourself in this one.

1906
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,300
Here it comes.

1907
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:18,810
(There's a commotion just by revealing the Fire Stage.)

1908
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:20,239
Here it is.

1909
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:21,639
(Extremely nervous)

1910
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,680
It's all red.

1911
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:27,180
(Who got the hidden part in the Fire Stage?)

1912
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,680
(The Fire Stage, "Framework," will be revealed now.)

1913
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,130
Junseok!

1914
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:44,930
He's so cool.

1915
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,430
Let's go, Junseok!

1916
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,670
Let's go.

1917
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:49,500
(Junseok got the hidden part in the Fire Stage.)

1918
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,220
He's got insane control.

1919
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:13,729
(Startled)

1920
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,359
That's how they emerge?

1921
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,130
That's wild.

1922
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,739
(There you go!)

1923
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:23,739
(That's our boy, Junseok.)

1924
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:45,059
(He crushed the hidden part!)

1925
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,130
He killed it!

1926
01:18:47,829 --> 01:18:49,430
- He killed it! - He's seriously good.

1927
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,069
(He's way too good.)

1928
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,500
He's such a good dancer.

1929
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,300
What do I do?

1930
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,938
- HYUNGSEOK! - He's good.

1931
01:18:57,939 --> 01:18:59,368
The hidden part is so...

1932
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:00,369
What was that?

1933
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:02,179
He's the main character.

1934
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,909
- He already wins first place. - That was crazy.

1935
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,578
(Excited to see the oldest member's silhouette)

1936
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,390
- Let's go, MYUNG HO! - Let's go!

1937
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,789
("Framework")

1938
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:25,329
(That's what I'm talking about.)

1939
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:33,710
(That's fantastic!)

1940
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,710
That was cool.

1941
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,069
- That's amazing. - I like how it's going.

1942
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,948
(The air gets hot.)

1943
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:13,379
Let's go, TAEYOUNG.

1944
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,409
Let's go!

1945
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:42,608
(Check out those eyes.)

1946
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:43,710
You pulled it off.

1947
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:07,130
- Let's go, MYUNG HO. - Go, MYUNG HO!

1948
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,380
(That's what I'm talking about!)

1949
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,880
TAEYOUNG!

1950
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:34,489
Is it his part?

1951
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,198
(Amazed)

1952
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,199
(Surprised)

1953
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,270
He's a good singer!

1954
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,488
(TEMPEST's ace, LEW)

1955
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:41,459
(CRAVITY's ace, TAEYOUNG)

1956
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,430
(8TURN's ace, MYUNG HO)

1957
01:22:43,529 --> 01:22:45,499
(ONEUS' ace, LEE DO)

1958
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,469
(YOUNITE's ace, HYUNGSEOK)

1959
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:49,800
(The CrewOne's ace, Oh Junseok)

1960
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:51,438
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1961
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:53,009
(The number of views will not be reflected in the finals.)

1962
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,339
(You can find "Framework" on music streaming services...)

1963
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,640
(from noon on October 25.)

1964
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,948
- You did it! - Nice!

1965
01:22:58,949 --> 01:22:59,949
(Well done.)

1966
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,979
- You did so well, though. - You did great!

1967
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,749
- That's a good video. - You were great.

1968
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,988
You looked pretty good for someone with so few parts.

1969
01:23:06,989 --> 01:23:07,989
He did.

1970
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,189
(Good job, HYUNGSEOK.)

1971
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:11,789
Well done.

1972
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:13,188
- What was that? - That was fantastic.

1973
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:15,130
- You did great. - How are you so good?

1974
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,898
HYUNGSEOK, straighten your shoulders.

1975
01:23:16,899 --> 01:23:18,158
- Sit straight! - You deserve it.

1976
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,169
(Have some confidence.)

1977
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,799
- You did well. - Straight. Don't be intimidated.

1978
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,739
(He finds his confidence and sits up.)

1979
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,439
This is a fierce competition.

1980
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,669
- You sang the high notes so well. - You did great.

1981
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,310
You should sing some high notes next time.

1982
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,639
MYUNG HO.

1983
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,478
- Come on. - Gosh.

1984
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:34,679
You were awesome.

1985
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,779
- You overwhelmed the chorus. - The dance was yours.

1986
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,180
That's true.

1987
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
I'm joking.

1988
01:23:40,489 --> 01:23:42,389
- Junseok. - Junseok.

1989
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,090
- Yes. - You did pretty well.

1990
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,430
Did I?

1991
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:46,858
That was your first time talking.

1992
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:48,328
It's nice to hear a compliment from Sangwoo.

1993
01:23:48,329 --> 01:23:49,500
(He feels good.)

1994
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,100
First, I will announce the top three aces.

1995
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:55,170
- Gosh. - Right away?

1996
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,500
(Patting him)

1997
01:23:56,569 --> 01:23:58,539
- Please. - Oh, my gosh.

1998
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:01,010
- Please. - I have no doubt in my mind.

1999
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,979
Just relax.

2000
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,479
Relax?

2001
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:06,179
(Sighing)

2002
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,578
(Holding their hands tightly)

2003
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:09,220
I hope you're in it, at least.

2004
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:13,689
(Seunghwan got a low ranking in the Water Stage.)

2005
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,090
(They failed to win points on the brink of elimination.)

2006
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:20,560
Please. I hope I'm in it.

2007
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:26,199
The high-ranking aces from 1st to 3rd in the Fire Stage.

2008
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,029
If you're not in it, it's because of the short part.

2009
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:29,970
Please reveal them.

2010
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,069
Please be in the top three.

2011
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:39,050
He did so well, though.

2012
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:44,050
(Junseok, TAEYOUNG, and MYUNG HO)

2013
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,788
There you go.

2014
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:46,789
(That's what I'm talking about.)

2015
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,049
There you go.

2016
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,059
(The hidden part winner, Junseok is in the top 3.)

2017
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,089
- Seriously, Junseok. - You got it!

2018
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,090
That's great.

2019
01:24:51,091 --> 01:24:53,659
I was more relieved than happy.

2020
01:24:54,529 --> 01:24:55,800
I was just relieved.

2021
01:24:56,829 --> 01:24:58,129
(Another one in the top 3 is CRAVITY.)

2022
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,699
- Okay. - We got it.

2023
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,368
- I told you you'd be in it. - We got it.

2024
01:25:01,369 --> 01:25:02,399
We're good to go.

2025
01:25:02,939 --> 01:25:05,000
8TURN is in the top three in both of them.

2026
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,038
- We also won in both of them. - So did we.

2027
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:08,479
- Yes! - You're right.

2028
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,478
- You two! - I knew you'd do it.

2029
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:11,879
Come on, guys.

2030
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,978
MYUNG HO!

2031
01:25:12,979 --> 01:25:14,850
- MYUNG HO! - We did it.

2032
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,179
We did it!

2033
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,488
- We did it! - Yes!

2034
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:21,350
I had faith in him.

2035
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,319
(But TEMPEST got a low ranking in the Fire Stage as well.)

2036
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,760
It's fine. You did well.

2037
01:25:26,761 --> 01:25:28,289
- You did great. - Yes.

2038
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:31,000
You exceeded your limit.

2039
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:32,728
This is such a shame, though.

2040
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:34,629
If you had a longer part, you would have been in it.

2041
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,939
Absolutely.

2042
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,669
It's fine. We're building the story...

2043
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,340
for the team's performance.

2044
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,149
(But I'm not fine.)

2045
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,180
The top three aces in the Final Stage are...

2046
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,180
Oh Junseok from The CrewOne,

2047
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,289
TAEYOUNG from CRAVITY,

2048
01:25:52,989 --> 01:25:54,319
and MYUNG HO from 8TURN.

2049
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,289
Gosh, 8TURN is doing so well.

2050
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:00,159
8TURN's points are going way up high.

2051
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,659
- Oh, please. - Super Ace!

2052
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,430
CRAVITY and 8TURN will get such high points.

2053
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:10,069
Who will have placed first in the Fire Stage?

2054
01:26:11,909 --> 01:26:14,810
- The CrewOne? - I feel like it's The CrewOne.

2055
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:17,510
Or 8TURN again.

2056
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:19,350
But 8TURN stood out this time.

2057
01:26:20,449 --> 01:26:23,350
MYUNG HO had the second-most important part.

2058
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:26,090
I used to think that he was good with his body.

2059
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,390
It felt like he knew how to catch people's attention.

2060
01:26:32,029 --> 01:26:33,429
Is MYUNG HO the Super Ace?

2061
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,430
We'll look forward to it.

2062
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,430
(Did MYUNG HO become the Super Ace in the Fire Stage?)

2063
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,029
I have a feeling it's TAEYOUNG.

2064
01:26:38,729 --> 01:26:40,000
He did great too.

2065
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,938
- And he got a good part. - Yes.

2066
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:43,239
His part was the best.

2067
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,470
The member with the benefit certainly stood out.

2068
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,079
He was mostly at the center...

2069
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,010
and often danced as a unit.

2070
01:26:52,609 --> 01:26:53,879
Super TAEYOUNG!

2071
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,209
I feel like you'll win.

2072
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,478
Junseok is so good, by the way.

2073
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:58,479
He is good.

2074
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,390
Junseok was so...

2075
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,960
He won the hidden part, after all.

2076
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:07,859
He had 40 seconds in the front all to himself.

2077
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:10,130
I could only see Junseok.

2078
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,500
Unless I was overwhelmingly better,

2079
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,199
it'd be difficult to place first.

2080
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,868
No, you can do it, bro.

2081
01:27:18,869 --> 01:27:20,970
Don't be ridiculous.

2082
01:27:21,409 --> 01:27:24,779
The Super Ace to win 5,000 points in the Fire Stage.

2083
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,079
I hope we win.

2084
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:28,880
Please.

2085
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:31,219
Please. Let us have it just once.

2086
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,220
(CRAVITY aims to win 1st place in the Ace Ranking.)

2087
01:27:32,221 --> 01:27:33,520
Please let me be of help to my team.

2088
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:36,159
- Let's go, Junseok. - Let's go.

2089
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,858
Let's get the Super Ace, Junseok.

2090
01:27:37,859 --> 01:27:40,188
- If you win this time... - Super Ace Junseok.

2091
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:41,389
Super Ace Junseok.

2092
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:44,229
(Which one will be the Super Ace?)

2093
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:45,699
Please reveal it.

2094
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,170
(Surprised)

2095
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:51,970
Please reveal it.

2096
01:27:51,971 --> 01:27:53,609
(CRAVITY, TAEYOUNG)

2097
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:56,639
(Fainting out of happiness)

2098
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,108
Breathe.

2099
01:27:58,109 --> 01:27:59,608
- Great job. - Breathe.

2100
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:01,578
- Breathe. - I had a feeling you'd win.

2101
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:02,619
I saw it coming.

2102
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,779
You did great.

2103
01:28:04,949 --> 01:28:06,719
It's fine. Well done.

2104
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,089
- It's all right. - You did great.

2105
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:10,019
- It's fine. Well done. - Good work, MYUNG HO.

2106
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,090
Good work. You were amazing.

2107
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,390
You did well enough.

2108
01:28:12,489 --> 01:28:14,859
Junseok didn't win the Super Ace.

2109
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,100
I know, right? He even had the hidden part.

2110
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,829
After a 40-second solo performance.

2111
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:23,039
- Great job. - I mean it. You did so well.

2112
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,500
Well done.

2113
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:27,069
I participated while thinking that I wouldn't win...

2114
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,710
if I wasn't overwhelmingly better than all of them.

2115
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,149
I guess it didn't work.

2116
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,919
(He's desperate about placing high to avoid getting eliminated.)

2117
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,920
I hope I'm second, at least.

2118
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,449
I'm sure you're next.

2119
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:41,318
We need those 1,000 points, at least.

2120
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:42,488
(To avoid being eliminated)

2121
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:45,220
First place in the Final Stage...

2122
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:47,028
is TAEYOUNG from CRAVITY.

2123
01:28:47,029 --> 01:28:48,029
I knew it.

2124
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:49,500
(Congratulating the Super Ace)

2125
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:52,630
- TAEYOUNG played a part. - He did.

2126
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:56,198
- Super Ace! - Super good, bro.

2127
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:57,699
Great job.

2128
01:28:58,199 --> 01:28:59,210
This is great.

2129
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,409
It felt like I contributed to increasing...

2130
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,839
my team's Ace Ranking,

2131
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,880
so I was exhilarated.

2132
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:06,979
Thank you.

2133
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,350
Next, the members from 4th place to 6th place.

2134
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:13,590
(Revealing the low-ranking aces of the Fire Stage)

2135
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,289
This is the true beginning.

2136
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:18,788
To see the name of ONEUS in a low ranking...

2137
01:29:18,789 --> 01:29:20,460
feels awkward.

2138
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,159
It's all right.

2139
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,899
One of the three aces is sixth place, the lowest.

2140
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:32,239
The ace in last place will get zero points.

2141
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,938
(Sighing deeply)

2142
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:37,710
(Exclaiming)

2143
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,579
Getting zero points is too serious.

2144
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,649
No team has placed 1st and 6th at the same time until now.

2145
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,819
If it's YOUNITE's HYUNGSEOK...

2146
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,720
Please don't be sixth.

2147
01:29:51,289 --> 01:29:54,189
If I place sixth here, it will be the worst.

2148
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:58,129
(YOUNITE's SION placed last...)

2149
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:00,029
(in the Water Stage.)

2150
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,299
(Zero points. That hurts.)

2151
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,439
(It does hurt.)

2152
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,810
It's okay.

2153
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:11,210
I will announce the ace in sixth place, the lowest ranking.

2154
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,750
(Restless)

2155
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,109
Sixth place...

2156
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,680
(Relax, LEE DO.)

2157
01:30:19,149 --> 01:30:21,549
Really. This is nerve-racking.

2158
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,859
(His lips are dry.)

2159
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:26,329
(Please.)

2160
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,260
The last and sixth place of the Fire Stage.

2161
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:30,858
Please reveal it.

2162
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:34,100
(Revealing 6th place of the Fire Stage)

2163
01:30:37,369 --> 01:30:40,810
(Nobody can close their mouths at the result.)

2164
01:30:40,939 --> 01:30:42,309
(The 6th place of the Fire Stage)

2165
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:44,810
(LEE DO of ONEUS)

2166
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,180
What?

2167
01:30:46,449 --> 01:30:47,850
(Relieved)

2168
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:50,249
(Shocked)

2169
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,250
For real?

2170
01:30:53,149 --> 01:30:55,390
ONEUS is in the last place.

2171
01:30:56,619 --> 01:31:00,189
(The invincible ace's ranking has been broken.)

2172
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:01,728
- Great job. - It's okay.

2173
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:02,859
Forget it.

2174
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,500
You did well.

2175
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:07,300
It's okay. It's totally fine.

2176
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:10,569
The members told me that it was okay.

2177
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,309
But it wasn't.

2178
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:16,010
It's an important score.

2179
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,210
Don't worry.

2180
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,550
It was a great shame.

2181
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:23,949
I got furious at myself.

2182
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,948
This is bad.

2183
01:31:25,949 --> 01:31:27,349
Zero point is really bad.

2184
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:28,549
The ranking might change.

2185
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,789
The Ace Ranking will change.

2186
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:33,130
ONEUS was always in first place in Ace Ranking.

2187
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:35,728
This won't do them good.

2188
01:31:35,729 --> 01:31:38,060
(Will ONEUS maintain their 1st place in Ace Ranking?)

2189
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,269
We have checked...

2190
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,029
all the results of Ace Battle, the First Round.

2191
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,999
We've won 5,000 points, right?

2192
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,068
Yes.

2193
01:31:45,069 --> 01:31:47,010
We earned a minimum of 8,000 points.

2194
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:49,210
- Our aces are our treasures. - It's a big number.

2195
01:31:49,739 --> 01:31:51,479
We still won some points.

2196
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:54,250
We did. Great job.

2197
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:56,049
We got a minimum of 1,000 points.

2198
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:58,819
But is 1,000 points really a good thing?

2199
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:00,090
Nothing can be done now.

2200
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,260
It's okay. Be happy about it.

2201
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,858
It's okay. You did well.

2202
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:08,590
Why are you in despair, guys?

2203
01:32:08,859 --> 01:32:10,260
We still have a lot left.

2204
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,158
Won't we rank...

2205
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:13,799
(HWAN WOONG's Water: High ranking, LEE DO's Fire: 6th place)

2206
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
either 4th or 5th place?

2207
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,670
(Sighing)

2208
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:20,909
It does break my heart.

2209
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:23,909
But this is a great chance to make a huge point difference.

2210
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,979
I will now reveal the final ranking of the First Round, Ace Battle,

2211
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:31,149
with the scores of both performances summed up.

2212
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,250
(Groaning)

2213
01:32:32,251 --> 01:32:34,149
This will change the ranking.

2214
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:36,420
Gosh, what do we do?

2215
01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:38,819
This is critical.

2216
01:32:39,289 --> 01:32:41,229
The 1st round of Round 3.

2217
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,399
The final ranking of the Ace Battle.

2218
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,159
The third place will be revealed first.

2219
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:47,029
Is this how it's revealed?

2220
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:49,369
Who will it be? I can't guess the third place.

2221
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:51,939
ONEUS or The CrewOne?

2222
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:53,539
The CrewOne?

2223
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:55,340
This is important.

2224
01:32:55,409 --> 01:32:56,579
I hope it's us.

2225
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:58,239
- Let's go. - Please.

2226
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,880
I would beg to be in third place at the least.

2227
01:33:00,979 --> 01:33:03,649
But ONEUS could be third place.

2228
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:05,989
(Sighing)

2229
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:08,149
ONEUS got zero points for a performance.

2230
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,159
Right. And we don't know HWAN WOONG's rank.

2231
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:11,419
True.

2232
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:13,789
(The final ranking may change with each score.)

2233
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,760
It could be ONEUS or The CrewOne.

2234
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,229
The CrewOne.

2235
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,800
- Please. - I'm nervous.

2236
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:22,129
ONEUS?

2237
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,270
(Will ONEUS stay in the top ranks?)

2238
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:26,509
My heart hurts.

2239
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:27,810
(My heart hurts.)

2240
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,038
(The 1st Round of Round 3, Ace Ranking)

2241
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:33,250
The CrewOne is in third place.

2242
01:33:34,779 --> 01:33:36,578
- Yes! - Nice!

2243
01:33:36,579 --> 01:33:38,519
- Seriously. - Good job.

2244
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,789
- Great work. - What a relief.

2245
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:43,390
- Good job. - This is all thanks to you.

2246
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,559
- Great job. - This is a relief.

2247
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,858
You did an amazing job.

2248
01:33:46,859 --> 01:33:49,000
(The two aces feel at ease now.)

2249
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,130
- Good job. - Great work.

2250
01:33:51,729 --> 01:33:52,969
They were incredible.

2251
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,569
The CrewOne went through a lot.

2252
01:33:54,869 --> 01:33:57,238
Goodness. Junseok killed it.

2253
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,499
Good work.

2254
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,109
The hidden part was well performed.

2255
01:34:01,409 --> 01:34:03,880
Scoring 5th place with 1,000 points in the Water Stage...

2256
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:07,880
and 2nd place with 4,000 points in the Fire Stage,

2257
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:11,079
The CrewOne ranks 3rd with a sum of 5,000 points.

2258
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,890
- It's our first-ever 3rd place. - It's over 3,000.

2259
01:34:13,949 --> 01:34:15,988
- Being third makes me happy. - I'm relieved.

2260
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:18,358
- Good job. - You did well.

2261
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:19,760
I'm really proud of you two.

2262
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,359
Junseok of The CrewOne.

2263
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,229
Please tell us how you feel.

2264
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:26,829
Third is such a great rank,

2265
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:30,170
but we still think there's a hurdle to overcome.

2266
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:32,300
This is just the beginning for us.

2267
01:34:32,409 --> 01:34:34,810
We will gladly accept the great ranking of third place...

2268
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:38,038
and will do much better in our next team performance.

2269
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,778
- Thank you. - You're cool!

2270
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:40,880
How cool!

2271
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:42,649
Junseok is cool.

2272
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:44,779
He's a cool person.

2273
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,249
The score gap is huge.

2274
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,349
(Judging by the 3rd place, )

2275
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,389
(a large score gap is predicted.)

2276
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,289
The scores of 1st and 2nd place will be high.

2277
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:54,260
CRAVITY is in first place.

2278
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,399
I think it'll be 8TURN.

2279
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,328
8TURN and CRAVITY were both in the top ranks.

2280
01:34:59,329 --> 01:35:00,429
(CRAVITY versus 8TURN, the predicted 1st place)

2281
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:02,669
The 1st and 2nd place will be...

2282
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:03,970
8TURN and CRAVITY.

2283
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:06,909
Next, the first place will be announced.

2284
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:08,869
Isn't it us or 8TURN?

2285
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:10,409
Yes, it's us or 8TURN.

2286
01:35:10,779 --> 01:35:13,550
The only two top ranks are us and CRAVITY.

2287
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,510
We each got 5,000 points.

2288
01:35:15,579 --> 01:35:17,019
(Water Super Ace, JAE YUN of 8TURN)

2289
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,619
(Fire Super Ace, TAEYOUNG of CRAVITY)

2290
01:35:18,819 --> 01:35:21,488
It depends on MYUNG HO and MINHEE's points.

2291
01:35:21,489 --> 01:35:22,760
(Their ranks have not been revealed.)

2292
01:35:22,989 --> 01:35:26,289
(MYUNG HO and MINHEE are both in the top ranks.)

2293
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:29,899
It's up to which place MINHEE ranked in the Water Stage.

2294
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,699
Yes. How many points they earn will determine their ranks.

2295
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:37,169
The 1st round of Round 3 Ace Battle.

2296
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,500
The final first place.

2297
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:41,069
I think 8TURN will get first place this time.

2298
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:43,908
Our members did great.

2299
01:35:43,909 --> 01:35:45,880
Please let us win first place one more time.

2300
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:48,550
Please give it to us just this once, CRAVITY.

2301
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:50,750
You promised to get first place.

2302
01:35:51,149 --> 01:35:53,220
- Ace Ranking 1st place, please. - Will we get 1st place?

2303
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:55,020
Please.

2304
01:35:57,159 --> 01:35:58,260
Please reveal it.

2305
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,629
Who is it?

2306
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,059
(Which team will rank 1st in the Ace Ranking?)

2307
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,228
My lips are getting dry.

2308
01:36:03,229 --> 01:36:04,260
(Which team will rank 1st in the Ace Ranking?)

2309
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
(The 1st Round of Round 3, Ace Ranking)

2310
01:36:06,001 --> 01:36:08,399
(The 1st Round of Round 3, Ace Battle 1st place, CRAVITY)

2311
01:36:09,699 --> 01:36:11,770
(Shocked)

2312
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,239
MINHEE.

2313
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:14,769
- We trusted you, MINHEE. - Good job.

2314
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,408
- Great work. Both of you did well. - You did well.

2315
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:17,709
- Great job. - Good work.

2316
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:18,809
The Ace Battle...

2317
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:21,079
- I had faith in you. - Good job.

2318
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:23,850
Scoring 2nd place with 4,000 points in the Water Stage...

2319
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:27,789
and 1st place with 5,000 points in the Fire Stage,

2320
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,688
CRAVITY ranks first...

2321
01:36:29,689 --> 01:36:31,689
with a sum of 9,000 points.

2322
01:36:31,989 --> 01:36:33,329
It's 9,000 points?

2323
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:35,159
Nobody can beat that.

2324
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:37,329
They earned a lot of points.

2325
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:39,630
We can't catch up to CRAVITY.

2326
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:42,969
They have gone beyond the universe.

2327
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,739
CRAVITY has become a big hurdle.

2328
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:46,969
Nine thousand points is high.

2329
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:48,139
(CRAVITY widened the gap between them and 3rd place.)

2330
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,608
This is our very first time winning...

2331
01:36:49,609 --> 01:36:51,139
- first place in Ace Ranking. - Our first win.

2332
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,078
We earned about 20,000 points through the Ace Battles until now.

2333
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:55,648
But the two earned 9,000 points in one go.

2334
01:36:55,649 --> 01:36:56,818
We were in seventh place.

2335
01:36:56,819 --> 01:36:58,549
(Touched)

2336
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,890
We've climbed up a lot.

2337
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:01,948
It's almost 10,000 points.

2338
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:04,059
(ONEUS lost their Ace Ranking 1st place.)

2339
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:05,619
The point gap is massive now.

2340
01:37:05,689 --> 01:37:07,489
This is bad. It widened the gap by a lot.

2341
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,859
8TURN is in second place.

2342
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,959
(The 1st Round of Round 3, Ace Battle 2nd place, 8TURN)

2343
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,429
- What a bummer. - It sure is a bummer.

2344
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:14,499
- I feel the same. - Don't say that.

2345
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,069
We got a good result.

2346
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,499
- I'm disappointed. - Second place is amazing too.

2347
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,109
It's a miracle we're in second place.

2348
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:23,278
Scoring 1st place with 5,000 points in the Water Stage...

2349
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:24,539
(JAE YUN of 8TURN, 1st place in the Water Stage, 5,000 points)

2350
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:27,709
and 3rd place with 3,000 points in the Fire Stage,

2351
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:28,750
(MYUNG HO of 8TURN, 3rd place in the Fire Stage, 3,000 points)

2352
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:30,880
8TURN ranks second...

2353
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,319
with a sum of 8,000 points.

2354
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:34,020
8TURN is constantly going up.

2355
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:36,618
They took a lot of points.

2356
01:37:36,619 --> 01:37:37,760
That's too much.

2357
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:39,989
8TURN scares me.

2358
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,090
- They're catching up. - 8TURN is good.

2359
01:37:42,729 --> 01:37:45,158
Seeing our name in the top ranks after a long time...

2360
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:46,270
is nice.

2361
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:48,728
But the score gap between...

2362
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:50,868
the top 2 places and 3rd place is huge.

2363
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:51,899
Right.

2364
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:53,868
The third place score is small...

2365
01:37:53,869 --> 01:37:55,369
compared to the 1st and 2nd places.

2366
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:58,880
You're right. It's 9,000, 8,000, and 5,000 points.

2367
01:37:58,909 --> 01:38:00,250
At this rate,

2368
01:38:00,579 --> 01:38:03,278
ONEUS won't get many points.

2369
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:05,180
I know. Their rank might drop by a lot.

2370
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:07,189
This is our opportunity.

2371
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,850
We must widen the score here.

2372
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,289
We need to end it here.

2373
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,890
Only the lower-ranking three teams are left.

2374
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,359
ONEUS.

2375
01:38:17,229 --> 01:38:18,229
TEMPEST.

2376
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:20,569
And YOUNITE.

2377
01:38:21,569 --> 01:38:23,769
Isn't it awkward that ONEUS is...

2378
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:25,069
in the lower ranks?

2379
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:27,310
YOUNITE is in danger.

2380
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:29,779
The tables will turn.

2381
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:31,979
The ranks of the three teams...

2382
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:34,210
will be revealed all together.

2383
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:37,920
The 1st round of Round 3, Ace Battle.

2384
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,420
The ranks of the low-ranking three teams.

2385
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:42,659
Please reveal it.

2386
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,358
(Which team will rank last in the Ace Battle?)

2387
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:47,289
Let's end it nicely with fourth place.

2388
01:38:48,029 --> 01:38:50,560
(Nervous)

2389
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:53,270
No teams got zero points for both performances.

2390
01:38:53,529 --> 01:38:54,669
(The 1st Round of Round 3, Ace Ranking)

2391
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:56,198
(4th place: ONEUS and TEMPEST)

2392
01:38:56,199 --> 01:38:57,569
(6th place: YOUNITE)

2393
01:38:57,699 --> 01:38:58,770
- What? - What?

2394
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,670
We got 4,000 points.

2395
01:39:00,909 --> 01:39:02,908
- You did well. - Great job.

2396
01:39:02,909 --> 01:39:04,309
You two did a good job.

2397
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:06,479
We got 4,000 points. That's great.

2398
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:09,210
If the gap is 3,000 points,

2399
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,689
we can make it up with the team performance.

2400
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,449
Don't let it get to you.

2401
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:17,289
Any of our members would have lost.

2402
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,060
They both got second place.

2403
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,289
HWAN WOONG is tied for second place.

2404
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:23,430
- Is that possible? - I guess.

2405
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,429
Did I tie for second place...

2406
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:27,269
with MINHEE? If it's 5,000 and 4,000 points...

2407
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:28,899
Possibly.

2408
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:32,770
ONEUS and TEMPEST have tied for fourth place.

2409
01:39:33,909 --> 01:39:34,969
Scoring...

2410
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:37,810
a shared 2nd place with 4,000 points in the Water Stage...

2411
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:42,180
and 6th place with 0 points in the Fire Stage,

2412
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:45,079
ONEUS ranks a shared fourth...

2413
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:46,689
with a sum of 4,000 points.

2414
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,390
HWAN WOONG of ONEUS. Please tell us how you feel.

2415
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,419
The opportunity...

2416
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,890
to perform together with our seniors and juniors is very rare.

2417
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,630
I appreciate the fact that we were able to do that.

2418
01:39:58,859 --> 01:40:01,529
We may have ranked fourth in the Ace Ranking,

2419
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,538
but we will show...

2420
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,739
our real capacity in the actual performance.

2421
01:40:06,069 --> 01:40:07,970
You can feel his rage in his smile.

2422
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:09,810
He's quite scary.

2423
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,409
Scoring...

2424
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:16,050
4th place with 2,000 points in the Water Stage...

2425
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,989
and 4th place with 2,000 points in the Fire Stage,

2426
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:24,420
TEMPEST ranks 4th with a sum of 4,000 points.

2427
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:27,829
LEW of TEMPEST, how do you feel?

2428
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,600
Considering our ranking,

2429
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:37,170
TEMPEST isn't in a stable position yet,

2430
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:39,669
which is a very disappointing result.

2431
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:42,109
We'll do our best to turn things around...

2432
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:45,180
and climb up the ranks in the upcoming Team Mission.

2433
01:40:45,779 --> 01:40:47,709
(They want to go higher in Round 2 after the disappointing result.)

2434
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:48,779
It's so disappointing.

2435
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,948
Lastly, the last place is YOUNITE.

2436
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:56,890
(The 1st round of Round 3, Ace Battle 6th place, YOUNITE)

2437
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:59,389
Scoring 6th place with 0 points in the Water Stage...

2438
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:01,228
(SION of YOUNITE, 6th place in the Water Stage, 0 points)

2439
01:41:01,229 --> 01:41:04,399
and 5th place with 1,000 points in the Fire Stage,

2440
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,369
YOUNITE ranks 6th with a sum of 1,000 points.

2441
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,999
HYUNGSEOK of YOUNITE, it's rather a disappointing result.

2442
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,539
Can you tell us how you feel right now?

2443
01:41:15,609 --> 01:41:16,778
In Water Stage and Fire Stage,

2444
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,380
a total of 12 artists all worked hard.

2445
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,289
Oh, my.

2446
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:29,188
(He bursts into tears...)

2447
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:31,488
(as he's disappointed by the result.)

2448
01:41:31,489 --> 01:41:32,590
Don't cry.

2449
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,489
- You did well. - You did well.

2450
01:41:34,829 --> 01:41:35,829
You did a good job.

2451
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:39,000
I want to cry too.

2452
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:43,398
(The two aces had a somewhat disappointing first performance.)

2453
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:44,599
- Don't cry. You did well. - You did well.

2454
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,039
You all did a good job. Both of you did well.

2455
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,479
Hey, hold your head high and stand tall.

2456
01:41:51,579 --> 01:41:54,279
I think SION and I did our best...

2457
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,579
and showed a performance we don't regret.

2458
01:41:59,949 --> 01:42:01,850
We enjoyed it. Thank you.

2459
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,460
You can't say something like that at that moment.

2460
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,930
- Oh, my. - You worked hard.

2461
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,100
Oh, no.

2462
01:42:13,101 --> 01:42:14,169
(Their colleagues who are watching...)

2463
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,170
(also feel sorry.)

2464
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,170
Oh, my gosh.

2465
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,399
They must feel bad for the members.

2466
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:21,939
I can relate to them.

2467
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:25,809
It shows how important the aces are.

2468
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:27,509
(They can feel the pressure on them in the 1st round of Round 3.)

2469
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:29,250
It's a lot of pressure.

2470
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:30,779
You did well.

2471
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,818
You worked hard.

2472
01:42:33,819 --> 01:42:36,289
I'm so sad because I know how it feels like to be ranked the lowest.

2473
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:39,989
This darn ace system.

2474
01:42:41,329 --> 01:42:43,100
Let's do well. It's okay if we do well as a team.

2475
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,600
- We can kill it. - Yes.

2476
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,368
The final Ace Ranking of the Ace Battle,

2477
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:51,800
the 1st round of Round 3 is revealed.

2478
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:53,709
(1st place: CRAVITY, 2nd place: 8TURN)

2479
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,469
(3rd: The CrewOne, 4th: ONEUS, TEMPEST)

2480
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:57,139
(6th: YOUNITE)

2481
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,010
The 4th place is 1,000 points behind us.

2482
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,679
(There's not much difference between 3rd and 4th places.)

2483
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,380
It's not a big difference.

2484
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,850
CRAVITY will go very high.

2485
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:07,750
The main event is left.

2486
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,149
We should do well here.

2487
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:11,920
The result of the Ace Battle, the 1st round of Round 3,

2488
01:43:12,289 --> 01:43:14,689
will make huge changes in the total Ace Ranking.

2489
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:18,898
Now, the 2nd round of Round 3 is left only.

2490
01:43:18,899 --> 01:43:21,729
You worked hard. Let's give it our all one more time today.

2491
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,539
We can be 1st place in the 2nd round.

2492
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:24,939
Let me take care of it.

2493
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:28,039
(He gets nervous as soon as he says it.)

2494
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:30,979
The 2nd round of Round 3, No Limit Mission.

2495
01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:33,350
It's the last match before the final round.

2496
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,810
This is the final round for us.

2497
01:43:36,149 --> 01:43:39,149
Every moment has been the final for us since the last round.

2498
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,919
Like the title of the mission, the six teams...

2499
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:46,489
must've prepared their dream performances without any limits.

2500
01:43:47,029 --> 01:43:49,390
The 2nd round has 10,000 points up for grabs for the Ace Ranking...

2501
01:43:49,699 --> 01:43:52,060
and another 10,000 points for the Team Ranking.

2502
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,600
The scores will be combined...

2503
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:59,538
with a 70 to 30 ratio of Video Evaluation and Self-Evaluation.

2504
01:43:59,539 --> 01:44:00,739
(Video Evaluation 70 percent, Self-Evaluation 30 percent)

2505
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:02,238
It's 20,000 points.

2506
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,079
- It's 20,000 points. - I want to receive full points.

2507
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:05,840
It's a lot.

2508
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:07,479
In Round Two,

2509
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:10,619
the team with the higher score between the Ace Ranking...

2510
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,948
and Team Ranking...

2511
01:44:12,949 --> 01:44:15,350
will get to decide on the cue sheet.

2512
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:19,319
(Which team will decide on the cue sheet of the 2nd round?)

2513
01:44:19,789 --> 01:44:22,289
The team that can decide on the cue sheet this time...

2514
01:44:22,689 --> 01:44:24,560
is CRAVITY.

2515
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:27,828
(We did it.)

2516
01:44:27,829 --> 01:44:29,639
Oh, my gosh. It's good news.

2517
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,868
- We should decide right away. - Based on the total score.

2518
01:44:30,869 --> 01:44:33,069
We haven't decided on the cue sheet for a while.

2519
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,809
(CRAVITY wrote the cute sheet...)

2520
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,779
(in the Evaluation Match.)

2521
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:39,310
This is great.

2522
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:41,350
First of all, when should we perform?

2523
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:44,948
We've done Rounds 1, 2, and the Evaluation Match.

2524
01:44:44,949 --> 01:44:48,850
Honestly, going first or the last is the best.

2525
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,889
Going first would make people more excited.

2526
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:55,429
Going last means we can perform as a finale.

2527
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:59,000
I think we should consider going first or last.

2528
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:02,198
But you can go last...

2529
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:04,339
only when you're confident.

2530
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,898
They'll have the highest expectations.

2531
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:08,608
They'll have higher expectations, for the last performers.

2532
01:45:08,609 --> 01:45:10,879
I'm confident in our performance.

2533
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,909
I think we should go last.

2534
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:14,579
We're confident.

2535
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:17,818
It'll be okay for us to go last...

2536
01:45:17,819 --> 01:45:18,819
- as we're confident. - Okay.

2537
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:20,219
There's no problem indeed.

2538
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,590
Let's go with number six then.

2539
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:24,389
- Go with number six. - Okay.

2540
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:26,260
"Cool CRAVITY."

2541
01:45:26,489 --> 01:45:27,489
Next,

2542
01:45:27,789 --> 01:45:30,199
let's decide on number five who will go before us.

2543
01:45:30,529 --> 01:45:31,829
The group that will perform before us?

2544
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,600
We should make it interesting.

2545
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:35,868
I think it'll be better to make the team...

2546
01:45:35,869 --> 01:45:36,939
that will compete against us perform before us.

2547
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,770
Which group do you think it is?

2548
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:40,170
(All eyes are on him.)

2549
01:45:40,869 --> 01:45:43,679
The group that is not far behind us in terms of points.

2550
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,839
(Is it perhaps them?)

2551
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,180
ONEUS.

2552
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,180
"Let's have a showdown." It feels like this.

2553
01:45:49,949 --> 01:45:51,448
(CRAVITY and ONEUS have been fighting...)

2554
01:45:51,449 --> 01:45:52,979
(to rank the top.)

2555
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:56,819
(CRAVITY wants to top the Ace Ranking.)

2556
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:02,689
(ONEUS wants to stop CRAVITY from leading.)

2557
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:04,858
I think it's time to perform back-to-back...

2558
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:06,228
and show them.

2559
01:46:06,229 --> 01:46:07,329
It's a real match.

2560
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,739
What if it hurts their pride?

2561
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:12,270
"They made us perform right before them?"

2562
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,710
That's what we're going for.

2563
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,339
(Is that so?)

2564
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:17,009
- Okay. - It does sound fun.

2565
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:18,210
- It's going to be interesting. - Yes.

2566
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,909
Okay. The second most important one is...

2567
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:22,880
- The 1st performers. - The 1st performers.

2568
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,179
Going first is very important too.

2569
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,788
- Right. - So far,

2570
01:46:26,789 --> 01:46:29,118
the first performers have been doing well.

2571
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:31,188
Like THE NEW SIX in Round One.

2572
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:32,659
(THE NEW SIX won the VS Match, the opening of Round 1.)

2573
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,789
And 8TURN in Round 2.

2574
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:36,699
It's very important.

2575
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:38,698
(Thinking hard)

2576
01:46:38,699 --> 01:46:40,500
In my opinion, the first performer...

2577
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:42,170
should be The CrewOne.

2578
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:44,170
- The CrewOne sounds good. - It's a good idea.

2579
01:46:44,369 --> 01:46:45,769
In Round 2, 8TURN...

2580
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:48,639
opened the show with a great performance.

2581
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:49,939
(8TURN could go higher...)

2582
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:53,908
(after showing an unexpected charm as the 1st performers in Round 2.)

2583
01:46:53,909 --> 01:46:56,050
The CrewOne members are strong performers.

2584
01:46:56,149 --> 01:46:58,618
They're almost on the bottom based on their score.

2585
01:46:58,619 --> 01:46:59,679
- Yes. - So I think...

2586
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,148
they'll prepare with gritty determination,

2587
01:47:01,149 --> 01:47:02,989
which will make them a perfect team to open the show.

2588
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,919
- It sounds good. - I totally agree.

2589
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,960
- So it's The CrewOne. - Okay.

2590
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,159
I think it's good.

2591
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:12,399
I want TEMPEST to become the second performer.

2592
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,799
Their last performance was quite bright.

2593
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,739
If TEMPEST performs...

2594
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,840
after The CrewOne, it'll feel different.

2595
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:23,639
TEMPEST? Okay.

2596
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,738
(TEMPEST goes 2nd.)

2597
01:47:24,739 --> 01:47:26,109
I think it'll be fun...

2598
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,880
if the third performer has similar vibes.

2599
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,050
YOUNITE?

2600
01:47:30,051 --> 01:47:31,549
So that they can have a battle with bright songs?

2601
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:33,078
Because they're the only teams...

2602
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:35,390
that sang bright songs last time.

2603
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:38,890
But I really can't expect what YOUNITE will do.

2604
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,728
- What if they go dark again? - I know.

2605
01:47:40,729 --> 01:47:42,889
(That's correct!)

2606
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:44,329
It'll be a bloodbath this time.

2607
01:47:44,729 --> 01:47:45,828
I think it's a nice order.

2608
01:47:45,829 --> 01:47:46,930
- It's already fun. - Yes.

2609
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,969
(The final cue sheet made by CRAVITY is revealed.)

2610
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:51,038
What?

2611
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:52,239
What is this?

2612
01:47:52,369 --> 01:47:53,809
(CRAVITY, you guys...)

2613
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:55,509
The 1st place and the 2nd place are on each side.

2614
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,510
You're right.

2615
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,880
(Please)

2616
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:00,010
(1. The CrewOne, 2. TEMPEST, 3. YOUNITE, 4. 8TURN)

2617
01:48:00,011 --> 01:48:01,609
It's interesting how ONEUS and CRAVITY are going 5th and 6th.

2618
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:04,479
It's interesting.

2619
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,020
I agree it's interesting.

2620
01:48:07,090 --> 01:48:09,089
(The youngest ones are watching how the older ones argue.)

2621
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:10,920
Don't make eye contact with anyone.

2622
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,988
They'll all like it.

2623
01:48:12,989 --> 01:48:14,759
(The CRAVITY members are covering their eyes.)

2624
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,600
Junmin of The CrewOne that will open the 2nd round of Round 3.

2625
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,930
Did you think you'd become the first performer?

2626
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:21,929
Do you want to say something to CRAVITY?

2627
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:23,738
(Say something to CRAVITY?)

2628
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:25,000
(Excited)

2629
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:26,439
Oh, no.

2630
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:28,639
- What do we do? - This is awkward.

2631
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,669
It's this intense?

2632
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:30,879
(He sends a heart belatedly.)

2633
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:31,908
- I should stand up. - I'm scared.

2634
01:48:31,909 --> 01:48:33,179
- I think they'll say mean things. - I'm scared.

2635
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,209
(Please be gentle.)

2636
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:35,749
Help me.

2637
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,448
Stand up.

2638
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:38,618
- Stand up. - They're scared.

2639
01:48:38,619 --> 01:48:39,679
Help me.

2640
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,819
- I'm scared. - They're wearing military uniforms.

2641
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:43,920
- I'm scared. - They won't take out guns, right?

2642
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:47,130
TAEYOUNG kept giving me...

2643
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,658
- apologetic looks. - Oh, my.

2644
01:48:50,659 --> 01:48:52,229
- Why did you do that? - It's scary.

2645
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,069
I didn't imagine this is what that meant.

2646
01:48:55,369 --> 01:48:57,039
He's holding a gun.

2647
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,670
He's holding a gun.

2648
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,210
(A gun?)

2649
01:49:02,739 --> 01:49:03,739
What?

2650
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:05,608
(Sangwoo shoots a gun with resentment.)

2651
01:49:05,609 --> 01:49:06,710
Bang.

2652
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:09,948
(It's so funny.)

2653
01:49:09,949 --> 01:49:11,050
CRAVITY.

2654
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:14,689
I'm going to make you regret making us perform first.

2655
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:16,288
(It's no joke.)

2656
01:49:16,289 --> 01:49:18,590
That's how confident we are.

2657
01:49:18,789 --> 01:49:19,818
In 1, 2, 3.

2658
01:49:19,819 --> 01:49:21,159
- Energy! - Energy!

2659
01:49:21,489 --> 01:49:24,659
The CrewOne should perform first with that energy.

2660
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:26,159
Good.

2661
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:28,229
- I like performing 1st. - Going 1st is good.

2662
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,069
We're The CrewOne. We should go first.

2663
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,698
It's a nice order. They have energy.

2664
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:34,039
We should have the energy like that.

2665
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:38,539
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

2666
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:41,380
The 2nd round of Round 3, the No Limit Mission...

2667
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:44,420
that will decide on the finalists that will be on the live broadcast.

2668
01:49:44,949 --> 01:49:46,619
It starts now.

2669
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,118
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2670
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:51,019
Let's go. Let's do it.

2671
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:52,390
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

2672
01:49:52,659 --> 01:49:55,630
The ranking motivated me.

2673
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:58,328
I'm worried, but it's just my feeling.

2674
01:49:58,329 --> 01:49:59,659
I'll focus on our performance only.

2675
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,198
We should kill it in Round Two.

2676
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,930
We'll kill them all.

2677
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:05,600
If we can't prove it this time, we'll go home.

2678
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:08,469
We'll show you a perfect performance.

2679
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:09,470
Let's go!

2680
01:50:09,609 --> 01:50:11,738
Third place in the Ace Ranking in Round One.

2681
01:50:11,739 --> 01:50:13,009
Second place in the Ace Ranking...

2682
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:14,049
- in Round Two. - Second place.

2683
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:15,379
First place in the Ace Ranking...

2684
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,549
- in Round Three. - First place.

2685
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,750
We're going to take it.

2686
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:18,919
You can see the pattern, right?

2687
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,989
Brace yourself, ONEUS.

2688
01:50:22,649 --> 01:50:23,719
Look at these guys.

2689
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,019
It's "No Limit."

2690
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:27,760
We're going to show you our limits you can't even imagine.

2691
01:50:28,289 --> 01:50:29,589
We're going to be in first place.

2692
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:30,600
Yes.

2693
01:50:31,329 --> 01:50:35,369
(No Limit Mission in Round 2 has finally started.)

2694
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:38,470
(The head-to-head battle between 6 teams to make it to the final)

2695
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:43,409
(Limitless performances in overwhelming scales)

2696
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,550
(At the end of a big neck-and-neck match, )

2697
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:51,948
(which teams will advance to the final round?)

2698
01:50:51,949 --> 01:50:54,448
It means the video judges are watching too.

2699
01:50:54,449 --> 01:50:55,519
- They're watching? - Yes.

2700
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,158
- They're watching the same screen. - Yes.

2701
01:50:57,159 --> 01:50:58,159
They're watching with us real-time.

2702
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:01,060
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

2703
01:51:01,289 --> 01:51:04,159
They're the 1st team to perform in the 2nd round of Round 3.

2704
01:51:04,529 --> 01:51:05,799
(The No Limit Mission has finally started.)

2705
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:07,899
- Oh, my gosh. - The first stage.

2706
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,270
It's The CrewOne.

2707
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:11,938
(The CrewOne)

2708
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:13,908
They're absolutely determined this time.

2709
01:51:13,909 --> 01:51:15,109
- They just came to fight. - Yes.

2710
01:51:15,409 --> 01:51:17,239
I can feel their energy from their outfits.

2711
01:51:17,579 --> 01:51:19,278
What can they do in military uniforms?

2712
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:20,810
- That's what I wonder. - A perfectly synchronized dance.

2713
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:24,349
It's "No Limit." I'm curious to see how they interpreted it...

2714
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:26,079
- and utilized it. - Right.

2715
01:51:26,819 --> 01:51:30,159
I can't help but feel excited about the song they chose.

2716
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,159
They chose a song by singers in their 17th year since debut.

2717
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:34,328
(Is it perhaps?)

2718
01:51:34,329 --> 01:51:35,329
Oh, my.

2719
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,029
They chose SHINee's song.

2720
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:39,859
(Totally surprised)

2721
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,969
(Really?)

2722
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:42,770
They're performing SHINee's song in front of TAEMIN.

2723
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:44,239
- They're so bold. - Seriously.

2724
01:51:44,939 --> 01:51:48,039
This song marked the second beginning for the band.

2725
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:50,739
They've prepared a grand blockbuster-style performance...

2726
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:54,979
with SHINee's signature song.

2727
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:56,210
There are too many songs.

2728
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,948
- "Sherlock?" - "Dream Girl?"

2729
01:51:57,949 --> 01:51:59,449
- "LUCIFER?" - "Ring Ding Dong?"

2730
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,020
- Or is it "Replay?" - Come on.

2731
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:05,220
If it's their signature, it must be "Sherlock."

2732
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:07,460
It's a legendary song.

2733
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,460
"The CrewOne is back."

2734
01:52:09,859 --> 01:52:13,229
Will they be able to climb out of the bottom of the ranking...

2735
01:52:13,729 --> 01:52:15,800
and make it to the final round with this performance?

2736
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,409
We managed to avoid being eliminated once,

2737
01:52:21,739 --> 01:52:24,239
but this is like another Elimination Battle for us.

2738
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:28,409
So we have a mindset this time.

2739
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:32,149
(Being 7th place in the total ranking in Round 2,)

2740
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:34,949
(The CrewOne became an elimination candidate.)

2741
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:38,260
(They fought to survive in the Ace Battle.)

2742
01:52:40,729 --> 01:52:42,689
(They won as a result.)

2743
01:52:42,989 --> 01:52:45,028
(The CrewOne barely survived.)

2744
01:52:45,029 --> 01:52:47,369
We dramatically survived the Elimination Battle.

2745
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:50,270
Even if we survived, we were still at the bottom.

2746
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:52,840
- This is an opportunity for us. - It's an opportunity.

2747
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:54,409
We should do a really good job in Round Three.

2748
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:56,938
I really want to win.

2749
01:52:56,939 --> 01:52:58,238
(Desperate)

2750
01:52:58,239 --> 01:52:59,880
I really want to win.

2751
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:03,948
(The CrewOne is pushed to the brink.)

2752
01:53:03,949 --> 01:53:06,079
In a way, the next round...

2753
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:10,420
might be our last.

2754
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,760
It's more important than any round.

2755
01:53:17,699 --> 01:53:20,329
Jimin, do you think you can perform?

2756
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:26,600
I was injured in the middle of all that.

2757
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:29,909
Preparing for Round Two,

2758
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:33,039
I injured myself while jumping from high to low.

2759
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:36,649
I couldn't dance due to the injury.

2760
01:53:37,449 --> 01:53:40,419
I was so sorry...

2761
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:43,390
because I thought my presence would lower the quality...

2762
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,590
of the performance.

2763
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,328
- We're actually thankful. - We're thankful.

2764
01:53:48,329 --> 01:53:49,559
We are sorry.

2765
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,759
Don't feel guilty.

2766
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,259
Right. You don't have to be sorry at all.

2767
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:53,260
(The members are comforting Jimin who must be more upset.)

2768
01:53:53,261 --> 01:53:55,099
What's relieving...

2769
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,399
is that it's a No Limit mission.

2770
01:53:57,970 --> 01:54:00,170
It would be difficult if there's a certain format.

2771
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:02,909
But we can include Jimin to perform with us.

2772
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:04,979
Let's do well. We can do it.

2773
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,309
It's No Limit.

2774
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:08,310
There's no limit for us. The crisis is our chance.

2775
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:09,850
It's okay.

2776
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:14,020
The most important thing is choosing a song.

2777
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:15,989
- Okay. - We should discuss.

2778
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:17,659
How about a song with a story...

2779
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:21,259
so that we can include Jimin?

2780
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:22,889
- That'd be better. - It sounds good.

2781
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:25,658
So I was thinking of "Sherlock."

2782
01:54:25,659 --> 01:54:26,659
"Sherlock?"

2783
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:29,328
It's the combination of two songs, right?

2784
01:54:29,329 --> 01:54:30,939
- Yes. - "Clue" and "Note."

2785
01:54:31,069 --> 01:54:33,640
That's our current situation.

2786
01:54:33,739 --> 01:54:34,909
I like the story behind it.

2787
01:54:35,609 --> 01:54:37,278
As soon as I heard the title,

2788
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:38,539
- it resonated with me. - Right?

2789
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,978
(Why did Junseok think of "Sherlock?")

2790
01:54:40,979 --> 01:54:43,009
It has melodic lines...

2791
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:45,219
that have a story...

2792
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:47,550
and powerful parts.

2793
01:54:47,689 --> 01:54:51,319
We really wanted to choose a song by SHINee.

2794
01:54:52,359 --> 01:54:54,459
Considering what we've been talking about so far,

2795
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:58,129
I think we can show our story through "Sherlock" effectively.

2796
01:54:58,130 --> 01:54:59,528
Right. I think it's the best.

2797
01:54:59,529 --> 01:55:00,970
I also want to perform this song.

2798
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:02,698
- So it's "Sherlock" then? - Confirmed?

2799
01:55:02,699 --> 01:55:04,539
- I like it. - Okay.

2800
01:55:04,699 --> 01:55:06,269
("Sherlock," the title song of SHINee's 4th mini album, )

2801
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:09,868
(which was created through a hybrid remix, )

2802
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:13,579
(is impressive with its innovative music and stylish performance.)

2803
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:16,009
- We should decide on the ace. - We should.

2804
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:17,849
Objectively speaking, if we had been higher in the ranking,

2805
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:20,949
we could've taken on a challenge while choosing an ace.

2806
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:23,760
But since we're at the bottom,

2807
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,118
it'd be better...

2808
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:27,890
to choose members who have proved themselves so far.

2809
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:31,560
So I want Junseok who was the ace in the last round...

2810
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:33,229
to become our ace again.

2811
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,069
- Yes. I hope he becomes the ace. - Right.

2812
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:39,100
He brought us victory in the Elimination Battle.

2813
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:43,139
We received higher scores when he was our ace...

2814
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,779
compared to Round One.

2815
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:46,978
We wanted to have one more chance...

2816
01:55:46,979 --> 01:55:49,478
by choosing an ace who is stable.

2817
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:50,948
That's why we picked him.

2818
01:55:50,949 --> 01:55:51,949
(Junseok is the ace in the 2nd round of Round 3.)

2819
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:55,148
This mission itself is like an Elimination Battle for us.

2820
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:56,188
- Yes. - Right.

2821
01:55:56,189 --> 01:55:58,118
I'll make our team survive no matter what.

2822
01:55:58,119 --> 01:55:59,619
We should go to the final round.

2823
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,560
You have our full trust.

2824
01:56:01,659 --> 01:56:02,688
Let's go to the final round.

2825
01:56:02,689 --> 01:56:03,899
(Let's go.)

2826
01:56:04,859 --> 01:56:06,899
The next mission is so important.

2827
01:56:07,229 --> 01:56:09,198
- So I had many thoughts. - You did?

2828
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:11,839
I wanted to share them with you.

2829
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:12,840
It sounds good.

2830
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:14,510
Do you know "Saving Private Ryan?"

2831
01:56:15,069 --> 01:56:16,069
I know.

2832
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:18,709
It's about them rescuing an injured soldier.

2833
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:20,380
- Right. - There's an injured soldier.

2834
01:56:20,779 --> 01:56:23,278
One of them tried to save his comrade...

2835
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:24,750
with all his strength.

2836
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:26,318
They're indeed similar.

2837
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:28,619
I'm joking,

2838
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,689
but he was like me in the last round.

2839
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,720
(Laughing)

2840
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,590
Let me show you the set first.

2841
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:37,728
It feels like this.

2842
01:56:37,729 --> 01:56:38,729
(He sketched it himself.)

2843
01:56:38,829 --> 01:56:41,399
With a majestic setting,

2844
01:56:41,569 --> 01:56:43,500
I hope we can show our concept and atmosphere...

2845
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:47,509
through the set.

2846
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:48,510
It's nice.

2847
01:56:48,539 --> 01:56:51,180
And our dreams will come true here.

2848
01:56:51,779 --> 01:56:52,779
The tank will come out.

2849
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:55,380
The tank will appear...

2850
01:56:55,609 --> 01:56:57,520
as the screen opens.

2851
01:56:57,850 --> 01:56:59,449
- It's going to be so cool. - Right?

2852
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:01,390
We need the last blow.

2853
01:57:01,819 --> 01:57:03,050
I want to make it really intense.

2854
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,489
I want an airplane to come out from here.

2855
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:08,560
Is this possible, though? Can we do this?

2856
01:57:10,029 --> 01:57:11,029
This is No Limit.

2857
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:12,760
(I'll show you what having no limits is like!)

2858
01:57:13,829 --> 01:57:14,869
- What's this? - Oh, my.

2859
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,300
What's going on?

2860
01:57:17,569 --> 01:57:19,899
It's a real tank.

2861
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,270
- Wait. - The tank is huge.

2862
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:23,979
- Hold on. - The tank.

2863
01:57:24,539 --> 01:57:25,840
There's an airplane in the back.

2864
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:28,380
Everything we said came true.

2865
01:57:28,649 --> 01:57:30,920
I didn't imagine this would be possible.

2866
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:32,550
Can we go up?

2867
01:57:32,551 --> 01:57:33,749
Should we go up here?

2868
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,390
(They're super excited to see the tank for the first time.)

2869
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:39,189
- It's really high. - Is it high?

2870
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:40,858
They really made it.

2871
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:43,999
It looks like an airplane made by the Wright brothers.

2872
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,199
Will it fly for real?

2873
01:57:45,859 --> 01:57:49,099
Both the set and what we prepared.

2874
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,199
I was very confident in them.

2875
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:52,538
I thought the members were doing an amazing job.

2876
01:57:52,539 --> 01:57:55,909
Especially, Junseok, our ace, was awesome.

2877
01:57:56,409 --> 01:57:57,979
So I'm 100 percent sure...

2878
01:57:58,439 --> 01:58:02,249
we're going to do well this time.

2879
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:03,250
Look at your shoulders.

2880
01:58:03,251 --> 01:58:04,478
(He's 100 percent confident unlike how he was before.)

2881
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:05,578
Seven, eight.

2882
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:08,090
(They continue to practice until late at night.)

2883
01:58:11,159 --> 01:58:13,519
Everyone, wait for a moment.

2884
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,028
- What? - What's in your hand?

2885
01:58:15,029 --> 01:58:16,659
- Why did you bring cabbage? - What is it?

2886
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:20,699
Our ranking wasn't good in the last match.

2887
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:23,369
I feel like you're feeling too down.

2888
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:26,640
So I brought a gift to strengthen our resolve.

2889
01:58:27,869 --> 01:58:28,908
A gift?

2890
01:58:28,909 --> 01:58:31,079
It's what we thought the most important.

2891
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,850
(The most important?)

2892
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:36,309
(Energy)

2893
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:38,919
The energy? Okay.

2894
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:41,850
(The CrewOne always shouts this.)

2895
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:43,219
(What do you need on stage?)

2896
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:45,460
(Energy)

2897
01:58:45,659 --> 01:58:47,329
(He put their signature phrase on the caps.)

2898
01:58:47,529 --> 01:58:49,430
Let's go with this energy.

2899
01:58:49,689 --> 01:58:50,760
- Energy. - It's nice.

2900
01:58:50,859 --> 01:58:51,930
- This is wonderful. - Energy.

2901
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:53,760
Energy.

2902
01:58:53,761 --> 01:58:54,769
(They're putting on the item right away.)

2903
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:55,770
This is nice.

2904
01:58:56,199 --> 01:58:57,199
Performances are all about energy.

2905
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,100
It feels like there's an aura behind me now.

2906
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:01,970
It makes me confident.

2907
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:03,979
- Shall we chant together? - Okay.

2908
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:05,140
The CrewOne!

2909
01:59:05,141 --> 01:59:07,749
- Energy! - Energy!

2910
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:09,679
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2911
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:10,920
(Their energy boosts their confidence! How will they perform?)

2912
01:59:15,319 --> 01:59:17,359
Team The CrewOne.

2913
01:59:21,090 --> 01:59:23,060
- My gosh. He's the ace? - Oh, my.

2914
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,828
- This must've been tough on him. - Goodness.

2915
01:59:24,829 --> 01:59:26,028
Right. He performed for the Fire Stage too.

2916
01:59:26,029 --> 01:59:27,199
Preparing for both would've been really tough.

2917
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,699
Junseok said he wasn't the ace.

2918
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,069
He probably lied to you.

2919
01:59:40,479 --> 01:59:42,049
- What? - What's this?

2920
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:43,880
That's Jimin. What?

2921
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,449
He's abducted.

2922
01:59:45,579 --> 01:59:47,149
He's wearing a cast on his leg.

2923
01:59:49,789 --> 01:59:53,189
("Sherlock" by The CrewOne)

2924
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:56,589
(With this military concept, under the ace, Junseok's command, )

2925
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:57,698
(they will carry out a rescue operation...)

2926
01:59:57,699 --> 01:59:58,799
(and fish out spies in this movie-like plot.)

2927
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,970
- What? He kicked Jimin for real. - Why did he do that?

2928
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:10,579
- What was that? - A signal requesting rescue.

2929
02:00:12,579 --> 02:00:14,079
- What? - Oh, my.

2930
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:18,250
- What's this? - Oh, my.

2931
02:00:18,649 --> 02:00:20,020
- Oh, my. - This is nice.

2932
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:22,050
- What's this? - Oh, my.

2933
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:24,019
(His eyes open wide.)

2934
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:25,960
Seriously? Check out the wires.

2935
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,500
My gosh. They're coming down on the ropes?

2936
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:49,250
- "Sherlock." - "Sherlock."

2937
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:51,550
- It's "Sherlock." - It's "Sherlock."

2938
02:01:05,729 --> 02:01:07,398
- Hey! - Oh, my.

2939
02:01:07,399 --> 02:01:08,470
(Pop-eyed)

2940
02:01:37,329 --> 02:01:39,229
What is this?

2941
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:40,899
- Boom! - It's a tank.

2942
02:01:41,369 --> 02:01:42,630
- It's a tank. - What?

2943
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:44,398
- Gosh. - A tank?

2944
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:46,139
What's a tank doing there?

2945
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:47,810
- This is just crazy. - Oh, my.

2946
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:05,119
My gosh, Bain is so cool.

2947
02:02:14,029 --> 02:02:15,069
My gosh.

2948
02:02:32,819 --> 02:02:34,389
What? They're spies?

2949
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:35,989
What? I thought they were on the same side.

2950
02:02:48,369 --> 02:02:50,630
I see. I guess there are spies since it's "Sherlock."

2951
02:03:16,489 --> 02:03:18,659
(Shocked)

2952
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,829
- They betrayed their unit. - They were traitors.

2953
02:03:37,819 --> 02:03:38,850
Oh, my.

2954
02:03:58,270 --> 02:03:59,340
Goodness!

2955
02:03:59,369 --> 02:04:00,369
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

2956
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:14,549
- What's this? - This is too much. What is this?

2957
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:15,849
- How did they do that? - What on earth is that?

2958
02:04:15,850 --> 02:04:16,989
- What? - How did they do that?

2959
02:04:17,489 --> 02:04:18,590
Oh, my.

2960
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:34,408
I see. They went to save him.

2961
02:04:34,409 --> 02:04:36,170
Oh, they went to save him.

2962
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:07,938
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

2963
02:05:07,939 --> 02:05:09,539
(The number of views will be reflected in the finals.)

2964
02:05:09,569 --> 02:05:10,738
(You can find "Sherlock" by The CrewOne...)

2965
02:05:10,739 --> 02:05:11,909
(on music streaming services right now.)

2966
02:05:12,109 --> 02:05:15,880
(The CrewOne's ace, Oh Junseok)

2967
02:05:15,949 --> 02:05:19,319
(Everyone is impressed.)

2968
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,750
I didn't know time could fly by that fast.

2969
02:05:21,819 --> 02:05:23,249
- Hey! - My gosh.

2970
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,659
- They crushed it! - Goodness.

2971
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,020
Well...

2972
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:27,688
Hey, this is just crazy.

2973
02:05:27,689 --> 02:05:29,029
- Gosh, they were amazing. - It was like a movie.

2974
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:30,659
- The airplane... - What did I just see?

2975
02:05:30,859 --> 02:05:32,828
- Hey. This is... - They had an airplane.

2976
02:05:32,829 --> 02:05:35,100
The airplane broke down the wall.

2977
02:05:35,470 --> 02:05:36,868
It was like watching a movie, not a performance.

2978
02:05:36,869 --> 02:05:39,038
- Same here. - My gosh, that was really cool.

2979
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:40,368
- Then... - They were smart about making...

2980
02:05:40,369 --> 02:05:42,270
Jimin the abducted soldier.

2981
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:43,839
- Right. That was... - Yes. They did a good job.

2982
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,380
- really imaginative and smart. - They were so clever.

2983
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:48,908
One of their best dancers was injured.

2984
02:05:48,909 --> 02:05:49,909
Right.

2985
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:52,219
It must not have been easy to include him in the act.

2986
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:53,379
It was the perfect example of turning a crisis...

2987
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:54,850
into an opportunity.

2988
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:58,220
His injury didn't break the focus or give any negative effect.

2989
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:00,259
Having one wow factor would be impressive.

2990
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,260
But they included...

2991
02:06:01,261 --> 02:06:03,589
about 3 to 4 wow factors in their performance.

2992
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:05,300
The airplane broke down the wall.

2993
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,229
You were too cruel to us.

2994
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,500
My gosh. Nice.

2995
02:06:11,239 --> 02:06:12,500
I almost cried. Seriously.

2996
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,238
You were amazing.

2997
02:06:14,239 --> 02:06:15,510
Well done.

2998
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:17,310
Let's do a group hug.

2999
02:06:17,569 --> 02:06:19,880
- Come on. - Whatever happens after this...

3000
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,278
- Bain. - Well done.

3001
02:06:21,279 --> 02:06:22,609
- Great job. - Come here.

3002
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:23,880
The CrewOne!

3003
02:06:23,881 --> 02:06:25,749
- Energy! - Energy!

3004
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:27,019
Let's go to the finals!

3005
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:28,689
Let's survive!

3006
02:06:29,149 --> 02:06:30,390
Let's stay on the show!

3007
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:33,159
How come the first group always does so well?

3008
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:35,358
Now that there's no limit,

3009
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:36,788
there's so much they want to express.

3010
02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:38,560
Right. How will the next team perform?

3011
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:40,299
Next,

3012
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:42,868
we have a group that has been presenting performances...

3013
02:06:42,869 --> 02:06:45,670
of various concepts, each with a unique twist.

3014
02:06:45,970 --> 02:06:47,238
It's TEMPEST.

3015
02:06:47,239 --> 02:06:48,839
(The second group to perform is TEMPEST.)

3016
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,209
- Oh, my gosh. - It's our turn now.

3017
02:06:50,210 --> 02:06:51,478
- It's our turn. - It is?

3018
02:06:51,479 --> 02:06:52,509
Hey.

3019
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,778
Get a grip. We must perform next.

3020
02:06:53,779 --> 02:06:54,880
We can show them.

3021
02:06:55,210 --> 02:06:57,380
I'm the most curious about TEMPEST's song.

3022
02:06:57,409 --> 02:06:59,020
Will they go with another bubbly concept?

3023
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:00,720
Whose song will they perform?

3024
02:07:01,689 --> 02:07:04,149
The first group performed one of SHINee's songs.

3025
02:07:04,289 --> 02:07:05,659
TEMPEST also...

3026
02:07:05,859 --> 02:07:08,029
chose a group that I am a part of.

3027
02:07:08,229 --> 02:07:09,659
- What? - It's SHINee's song?

3028
02:07:09,689 --> 02:07:11,729
- What? Is it SuperM's? - What?

3029
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:14,329
When I performed this song on stage,

3030
02:07:14,369 --> 02:07:16,100
I also transcended my own limits...

3031
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:19,399
and created a new kind of synergy with my members.

3032
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:21,538
This song was recreated with TEMPEST's style.

3033
02:07:21,539 --> 02:07:23,409
I wonder how this new performance came out.

3034
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:25,609
TEMPEST's performance begins now.

3035
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:27,510
Guys.

3036
02:07:27,609 --> 02:07:29,479
This may be our last one.

3037
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:31,278
Let's give it our all just like we did in Round Two.

3038
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:32,578
Let's have fun.

3039
02:07:32,579 --> 02:07:34,049
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

3040
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:35,119
- Here we go! - Here we go!

3041
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:36,419
Let's go.

3042
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,489
(What is the performance TEMPEST prepared?)

3043
02:07:37,819 --> 02:07:39,920
(TEMPEST's practice studio)

3044
02:07:40,359 --> 02:07:43,529
(Practicing hard before the 2nd round of Round 3)

3045
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,629
(The only sounds that can be heard are his counting and the footsteps.)

3046
02:07:45,630 --> 02:07:46,630
Okay.

3047
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:47,869
Let me check.

3048
02:07:48,199 --> 02:07:50,228
(Checking the choreography as LEW leads the practice session)

3049
02:07:50,229 --> 02:07:51,868
One, two, three.

3050
02:07:51,869 --> 02:07:52,939
Let's try again.

3051
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:54,170
- You do this on one. - Two.

3052
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,809
One, two.

3053
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:57,408
Again. That's not it.

3054
02:07:57,409 --> 02:07:58,409
Let's do it again.

3055
02:07:58,710 --> 02:07:59,880
Again. Let's slow down.

3056
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:01,309
Let's try that again.

3057
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:03,209
One, two, three, four.

3058
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:05,649
(They practice more diligently than ever before.)

3059
02:08:06,279 --> 02:08:09,249
(They were having fun and full of energy before.)

3060
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:10,789
Let's smile!

3061
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:14,459
(This time, there's seriousness in their facial expressions.)

3062
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:16,488
Five, six, seven, eight.

3063
02:08:16,489 --> 02:08:19,199
(There's even tension in the air.)

3064
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:21,199
Seven, eight. Okay.

3065
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:24,028
Well, we chose a difficult song.

3066
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:25,868
We did make the choreography more difficult too.

3067
02:08:25,869 --> 02:08:27,500
But we don't have much time left until the shoot.

3068
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:30,270
We must make it work whatever it takes.

3069
02:08:31,539 --> 02:08:32,840
Let's practice. Get up.

3070
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:34,180
Let's practice.

3071
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:36,778
(There's no time to take a break for TEMPEST.)

3072
02:08:36,779 --> 02:08:38,449
(What's the song they chose for the 2nd round of Round 3?)

3073
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:39,680
(10 days ago)

3074
02:08:39,681 --> 02:08:40,979
All right.

3075
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:43,618
Our team was ranked sixth.

3076
02:08:43,619 --> 02:08:45,318
As for our Ace Ranking, we came in fourth.

3077
02:08:45,319 --> 02:08:46,359
Yes.

3078
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:48,889
Let's think about...

3079
02:08:48,890 --> 02:08:50,728
what we can do to make it to the finals.

3080
02:08:50,729 --> 02:08:53,398
Being more strategic might be better for us.

3081
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:54,500
I see.

3082
02:08:54,529 --> 02:08:57,429
The theme of this round is no limit.

3083
02:08:57,430 --> 02:08:59,398
Putting on a super fancy and grand performance...

3084
02:08:59,399 --> 02:09:01,738
that's befitting to this competition...

3085
02:09:01,739 --> 02:09:03,809
- is important. - Right.

3086
02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:06,608
So I thought of songs that would showcase the bright...

3087
02:09:06,609 --> 02:09:09,750
and bubbly charms we displayed in Round Two.

3088
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:13,349
I thought "Dream Girl" by SHINee would be nice.

3089
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:14,519
That's a great song.

3090
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,020
(It has a lively melody and requires a standing microphone.)

3091
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:18,859
Or how about a girl band's song?

3092
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:20,319
Because it's the No Limit Mission.

3093
02:09:20,619 --> 02:09:22,859
"Girls" might not be so bad for a competition.

3094
02:09:22,989 --> 02:09:24,089
(Stand up)

3095
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,259
And we go, "Bang!"

3096
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:26,699
(Bursting into laughter)

3097
02:09:27,029 --> 02:09:28,398
(Like this?)

3098
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:29,399
(Bang!)

3099
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,239
Or a futuristic theme?

3100
02:09:31,399 --> 02:09:34,170
I don't think we've ever seen that.

3101
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:36,038
- Like a cyber theme? - Yes.

3102
02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:37,640
Like SuperM.

3103
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:39,239
Wait.

3104
02:09:39,739 --> 02:09:43,880
(TAERAE thought of a futuristic and intense song by SuperM.)

3105
02:09:45,649 --> 02:09:47,819
I think it should be a song by SuperM.

3106
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:51,688
SuperM is a group of ace members from various bands.

3107
02:09:51,689 --> 02:09:53,589
- Right. - That itself...

3108
02:09:53,590 --> 02:09:55,328
captures the essence of this show.

3109
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:57,629
It could be a good reason to choose it.

3110
02:09:57,630 --> 02:09:58,729
I like that.

3111
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,729
SuperM becomes TEMPEST.

3112
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,229
- Super TEMPEST. - I like that.

3113
02:10:03,399 --> 02:10:05,238
There is a song that comes to mind.

3114
02:10:05,239 --> 02:10:06,239
Which one?

3115
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:08,108
Their debut song, "Jopping."

3116
02:10:08,109 --> 02:10:09,239
I love that.

3117
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:12,979
"Jopping" is a compound word...

3118
02:10:13,479 --> 02:10:15,850
of "jumping" and "popping."

3119
02:10:16,310 --> 02:10:18,249
Just like the title "Jopping,"

3120
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:20,349
we'll make our ranking jump.

3121
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:21,519
- "Jopping!" - "Jopping!"

3122
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,619
- "Jopping!" - "Jopping!"

3123
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:25,889
(SuperM is a project group composed of the ace members...)

3124
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:28,429
(from each team of SM Entertainment, and "Jopping" is the title track...)

3125
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:29,688
(of its first mini-album, )

3126
02:10:29,689 --> 02:10:30,960
(characterized by its energetic sound.)

3127
02:10:31,159 --> 02:10:33,358
I believe that any one of us...

3128
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:35,229
can play the role of an ace well.

3129
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:39,270
But when I think about the song "Jopping,"

3130
02:10:39,369 --> 02:10:42,109
it reminds me of HYUK. That's my opinion.

3131
02:10:42,409 --> 02:10:44,239
So, I'd like HYUK to do it this time.

3132
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:47,139
Right. I feel like HYUK can...

3133
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:51,479
express the sophisticated style of the song well.

3134
02:10:51,979 --> 02:10:54,549
If you'll let me do it, I'll give it my all...

3135
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:55,789
- You're trustworthy. - and pull it off.

3136
02:10:55,890 --> 02:10:57,188
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

3137
02:10:57,189 --> 02:10:59,019
- Let's go! - Ace, HYUK!

3138
02:10:59,020 --> 02:11:01,890
(HYUK is the ace of TEMPEST's 2nd round of Round 3.)

3139
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:05,929
Since I'm the ace of Round Three, No Limit Mission,

3140
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:07,358
I'm more determined than ever.

3141
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:08,800
I've practiced so hard.

3142
02:11:09,399 --> 02:11:12,699
We're here to try out 1 of the 30 million wow factors...

3143
02:11:12,899 --> 02:11:15,209
in "Jopping," the song for Round Three,

3144
02:11:15,210 --> 02:11:16,909
- wire action! - Yes!

3145
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:19,109
How do you feel being strapped to the wire for the first time?

3146
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,680
I'm nervous.

3147
02:11:20,681 --> 02:11:23,409
I tried falling from a higher place in Round Two,

3148
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:25,249
so I no longer fear heights.

3149
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:26,649
(Plot twist)

3150
02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:31,459
(HYUK perfectly pulled off the fall in Round 2.)

3151
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:32,859
In 1, 2, 3.

3152
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:36,488
(Now, he's even trying wire action.)

3153
02:11:36,489 --> 02:11:38,060
Ready. Go.

3154
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,659
- Come back down. - Good.

3155
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:42,799
I've always wanted to try a type of action,

3156
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,328
so I think it's going to be fun...

3157
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:46,139
- and interesting. - There you go.

3158
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:48,809
Please look forward to our amazing wire action.

3159
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,408
- We'll get back to practice. - Yes.

3160
02:11:50,409 --> 02:11:51,810
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3161
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:54,810
(TEMPEST's practice studio a few days later)

3162
02:11:55,149 --> 02:11:56,509
(TEMPEST is practicing hard...)

3163
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:57,779
(with the performance day just around the corner.)

3164
02:11:58,819 --> 02:12:01,549
(But the ace, HYUK, is nowhere to be seen.)

3165
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:03,219
HYUK's condition has worsened...

3166
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:05,358
while preparing for the No Limit Mission,

3167
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:06,859
which was a hardship for all of us.

3168
02:12:09,829 --> 02:12:13,800
I caught pneumonia.

3169
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:17,129
Round Three is so important, and it may be...

3170
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:19,539
the final round for TEMPEST.

3171
02:12:19,939 --> 02:12:22,369
Not being able to practice with the members...

3172
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:27,340
and staying at home when I'm the ace member...

3173
02:12:28,109 --> 02:12:30,180
makes me feel so bad for them.

3174
02:12:30,409 --> 02:12:34,449
And I can't help but find myself pathetic and sad.

3175
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:38,089
But as always,

3176
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:40,059
I'll have to power through it.

3177
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:42,629
TEMPEST will do its best to go to the finals.

3178
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:44,960
(He sincerely wishes to go to the finals.)

3179
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:47,630
(The day of the rehearsal, 3 days before 2nd round of Round 3)

3180
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,500
Let me tell you one thing.

3181
02:12:50,729 --> 02:12:51,999
Put your hand here, and...

3182
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,438
(He learns the new moves that changed while he was gone.)

3183
02:12:53,439 --> 02:12:54,938
- Put your hand behind the back. - Do I go with it?

3184
02:12:54,939 --> 02:12:55,939
After you go back.

3185
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:57,509
It's unbelievable...

3186
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:59,578
that I can't even attend team practice...

3187
02:12:59,579 --> 02:13:00,608
when I should be giving...

3188
02:13:00,609 --> 02:13:03,509
everything at 100-percent condition.

3189
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:04,979
That's always been on my mind.

3190
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:08,189
Still, I didn't want to get in the way of my team.

3191
02:13:08,319 --> 02:13:11,859
I didn't want to make even the tiniest mistakes,

3192
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:14,829
so I did my best to practice.

3193
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:20,300
(He finishes the rehearsal in his bad condition.)

3194
02:13:22,199 --> 02:13:24,599
(He tries to make up for the lost time...)

3195
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,299
I hope he stays strong until the end.

3196
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:28,039
(by practicing even harder.)

3197
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,510
(The rehearsal on the day of the 2nd round of Round 3)

3198
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:32,539
(He thoroughly practices the wire action.)

3199
02:13:33,109 --> 02:13:35,009
(He neatly pulls it off.)

3200
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:36,509
The wire...

3201
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:39,278
wasn't something that I could control,

3202
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:42,189
so I was worried that it might not look good as it did in practice.

3203
02:13:42,649 --> 02:13:44,219
But I practiced hard.

3204
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:45,818
(He confidently finished the rehearsal.)

3205
02:13:45,819 --> 02:13:46,819
And I'm confident.

3206
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:48,960
- In 1, 2, 3. - First letter.

3207
02:13:49,229 --> 02:13:50,328
Hey, Round Three.

3208
02:13:50,329 --> 02:13:51,329
- Second letter. - Second letter.

3209
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:52,659
We slowly made our way up here.

3210
02:13:54,329 --> 02:13:55,329
- Third letter. - Third letter.

3211
02:13:55,330 --> 02:13:56,529
We'll show you everything we've got.

3212
02:13:56,970 --> 02:13:57,970
(He crushed it once again.)

3213
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:58,970
That's a success.

3214
02:13:58,971 --> 02:14:01,038
Let's go, TEMPEST!

3215
02:14:01,039 --> 02:14:02,310
We'll show you everything we've got!

3216
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:09,079
Team TEMPEST.

3217
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:19,419
I'll give you a great show to live up to the title...

3218
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:20,789
as the ace member.

3219
02:14:22,729 --> 02:14:24,060
Let's go, HYUK.

3220
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,300
So, it was HYUK.

3221
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,199
I wish the members of SuperM were here to watch this.

3222
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:31,369
I wonder how they changed it.

3223
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:38,210
("Jopping" by TEMPEST)

3224
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:42,609
They have a video for the intro!

3225
02:14:43,079 --> 02:14:44,108
What is that?

3226
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:45,619
You can't film that beforehand!

3227
02:14:45,819 --> 02:14:47,250
It's the No Limit Mission, after all.

3228
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,118
(Inspired by the movie "The Matrix," this performance portrays...)

3229
02:14:50,119 --> 02:14:51,389
(TEMPEST that becomes the ultimate human vaccine...)

3230
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:52,520
(in an unknown virtual world.)

3231
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:54,859
VR goggles.

3232
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:02,869
- What's that? - What is that?

3233
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:05,739
- It's a first-person view. - I know.

3234
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:14,609
- It's "Jopping." - "Jopping!"

3235
02:15:15,010 --> 02:15:16,350
- Look how they arranged it. - It's like "The Matrix."

3236
02:15:40,199 --> 02:15:42,439
The arrangement is so future-oriented.

3237
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:57,249
The shadow dance.

3238
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:58,689
Shadows!

3239
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:23,509
(Amazed)

3240
02:16:23,510 --> 02:16:24,609
Did you just...

3241
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:32,120
- They're moving. - It's open.

3242
02:16:32,319 --> 02:16:33,360
Something's coming out.

3243
02:16:33,889 --> 02:16:34,989
What's happening?

3244
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:42,829
- Oh, goodness. - They're...

3245
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:44,299
That's incredible.

3246
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:46,840
It's a car!

3247
02:16:47,239 --> 02:16:49,509
- What? - Honk!

3248
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:50,540
- What is happening? - Is it a car?

3249
02:17:07,059 --> 02:17:08,190
I like their theme.

3250
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:15,969
The visuals!

3251
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:28,010
Wait. When did they go in that?

3252
02:17:28,409 --> 02:17:29,610
It actually looks like a video game.

3253
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:31,409
It's like a music video.

3254
02:17:39,719 --> 02:17:40,860
TAERAE is looking good.

3255
02:18:00,079 --> 02:18:01,079
The choreography is so neat.

3256
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:13,089
(Surprised)

3257
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:14,090
What?

3258
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:16,559
- No way! - What's going on?

3259
02:18:16,829 --> 02:18:18,500
- Why are you using our trick? - Isn't that ours?

3260
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:19,760
Don't use ours.

3261
02:18:40,719 --> 02:18:41,719
Hey, LEW!

3262
02:18:57,129 --> 02:18:59,369
It's the perfect time for something to pop out.

3263
02:18:59,370 --> 02:19:00,399
Come on out, ace!

3264
02:19:14,079 --> 02:19:15,120
- Oh, no. - Oh, boy.

3265
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:16,190
What happened?

3266
02:19:16,191 --> 02:19:17,250
- Oh, no. - What happened?

3267
02:19:17,549 --> 02:19:18,590
Oh, dear.

3268
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,600
He got back in focus right away, though.

3269
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:35,840
That's so professional.

3270
02:19:46,479 --> 02:19:48,019
I love the neon vibes.

3271
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:49,020
They look awesome.

3272
02:19:57,659 --> 02:19:58,700
They pulled it off so nicely.

3273
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,749
(TEMPEST's ace, HYUK)

3274
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:18,279
(You can find "Jopping" by TEMPEST...)

3275
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:19,849
(on music streaming services right now.)

3276
02:20:19,850 --> 02:20:21,378
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

3277
02:20:21,379 --> 02:20:22,850
(The number of views will be reflected in the finals.)

3278
02:20:24,049 --> 02:20:27,089
(Automatically clapping)

3279
02:20:27,090 --> 02:20:28,659
I love how they rearranged the song.

3280
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:30,430
- It's so unique. - Right.

3281
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:32,298
They took the right approach.

3282
02:20:32,299 --> 02:20:35,499
The video in the beginning was such a good way...

3283
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:37,029
- of using the rules... - Yes.

3284
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:38,500
Of the No Limit Mission.

3285
02:20:38,899 --> 02:20:41,370
They included the video in the performance.

3286
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:44,068
I loved the idea of utilizing...

3287
02:20:44,069 --> 02:20:45,309
the structure and the VR theme.

3288
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:47,280
But the wire...

3289
02:20:48,209 --> 02:20:49,450
- Oh, the mistake. - Yes.

3290
02:20:50,479 --> 02:20:52,949
(During his wire action, )

3291
02:20:52,950 --> 02:20:54,949
(he didn't land so smoothly.)

3292
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:57,048
- The mistake was such a shame. - It was.

3293
02:20:57,049 --> 02:20:59,159
That must have been their highlight.

3294
02:20:59,319 --> 02:21:02,728
No matter how hard you practice,

3295
02:21:02,729 --> 02:21:04,259
you can't prevent an accident...

3296
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:06,059
that happens that day.

3297
02:21:06,229 --> 02:21:09,069
That's why luck plays a part when you perform.

3298
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:11,840
But what they did was still commendable.

3299
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:14,239
- He handled it immediately too. - Right.

3300
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:16,170
He must be so upset.

3301
02:21:17,709 --> 02:21:18,808
(After the intense performance)

3302
02:21:18,809 --> 02:21:19,979
Good work, everyone.

3303
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:24,309
(They plop down while breathing heavily.)

3304
02:21:24,579 --> 02:21:26,079
Are you all right?

3305
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:28,148
Good work.

3306
02:21:28,149 --> 02:21:30,290
(Though the members cheer for him, )

3307
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:31,590
What's wrong?

3308
02:21:32,059 --> 02:21:33,619
(he can't help but cry as he's disappointed.)

3309
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,889
You did great. It's okay.

3310
02:21:35,829 --> 02:21:37,590
- Well done. - It's all right.

3311
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,430
- Let's give him a hug. - Well done.

3312
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,870
I felt bad about myself.

3313
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:47,370
I was the ace, and I made a mistake.

3314
02:21:48,239 --> 02:21:49,340
It's such a bummer.

3315
02:21:50,909 --> 02:21:52,010
And I feel terrible for the members.

3316
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:55,180
It was such an important day, you know.

3317
02:21:56,680 --> 02:22:00,120
I felt so bad for the team.

3318
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:02,920
Huddle up, guys.

3319
02:22:04,389 --> 02:22:06,159
Good work. We did great out there.

3320
02:22:06,389 --> 02:22:08,020
We went all the way.

3321
02:22:08,389 --> 02:22:09,760
That's all that matters.

3322
02:22:10,059 --> 02:22:11,459
- Good work. - You worked so hard.

3323
02:22:11,829 --> 02:22:13,199
Good work, guys.

3324
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,429
(Will they advance to the finals...)

3325
02:22:14,430 --> 02:22:15,770
(after a slightly disappointing performance?)

3326
02:22:16,229 --> 02:22:18,229
Next, it's the third team...

3327
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:19,699
of the 2nd round of Round 3.

3328
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,339
This team has been showing infinite potential...

3329
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:24,809
by putting on performances of various charms every time.

3330
02:22:25,010 --> 02:22:26,510
They're certainly various.

3331
02:22:26,780 --> 02:22:28,309
They really are different every time.

3332
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:30,180
It's YOUNITE.

3333
02:22:30,809 --> 02:22:32,449
(YOUNITE)

3334
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:34,420
How novel will their performance be this time?

3335
02:22:34,579 --> 02:22:36,750
There was always a plot twist with them.

3336
02:22:36,889 --> 02:22:39,860
I can't wait to watch their work of art.

3337
02:22:40,489 --> 02:22:42,489
To suit the theme, No Limit Mission,

3338
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:44,958
they have an unprecedented, highly stimulative performance...

3339
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:47,229
that will give you a dopamine rush.

3340
02:22:47,829 --> 02:22:50,729
Also, the three-time ace that carried the team...

3341
02:22:50,969 --> 02:22:53,469
followed by his performance in Rounds 1 and 2.

3342
02:22:53,739 --> 02:22:54,799
Is it EUNSANG?

3343
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:56,440
The leader, EUNSANG,

3344
02:22:56,809 --> 02:22:59,940
is more determined than ever.

3345
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:02,579
- It's EUNSANG again? - Again?

3346
02:23:02,750 --> 02:23:04,510
It's always EUNSANG.

3347
02:23:05,250 --> 02:23:06,520
We've practiced hard enough.

3348
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:08,478
- Let's just do as we practiced. - Okay.

3349
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:10,648
Have confidence in yourselves. Let's crush it out there.

3350
02:23:10,649 --> 02:23:11,920
- Good. Let's do this. - Okay.

3351
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:13,359
(The Chihuahua is back.)

3352
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:15,089
- Good. - Let's go.

3353
02:23:15,090 --> 02:23:16,090
Let's get out there with a smile.

3354
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:17,389
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

3355
02:23:17,829 --> 02:23:18,899
- Let's go. - Okay.

3356
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:21,559
I'll show them.

3357
02:23:21,969 --> 02:23:25,100
I'll show them what kind of performer I am.

3358
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,540
I will rank high as the ace...

3359
02:23:28,709 --> 02:23:30,069
and avoid the elimination.

3360
02:23:35,979 --> 02:23:37,409
Team YOUNITE.

3361
02:23:45,790 --> 02:23:47,089
(420 days after the catastrophe, )

3362
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:50,229
(humanity was infected.)

3363
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:53,228
(However, a new generation of mankind...)

3364
02:23:53,229 --> 02:23:56,329
(who overcame the disaster began to emerge.)

3365
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:17,019
(To be continued shortly)

3366
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:18,689
(Currently counting the views for the 6 teams in Round 3)

3367
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:20,359
(The full version videos of Round 3, No Limit Mission, )

3368
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:22,029
(which will be reflected in the finals' preliminary score, )

3369
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:23,760
(have been pre-released. Check them out now on Mnet K-POP!)

3370
02:24:24,329 --> 02:24:26,360
The official supporting race...

3371
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:28,700
for Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace has begun.

3372
02:24:28,930 --> 02:24:31,429
Collect boosters from Mnet Plus...

3373
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:33,500
to support your aces right now.

3374
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:36,369
The 2nd round of Round 3, No Limit Mission.

3375
02:24:36,370 --> 02:24:38,469
It's the last mission before the finals.

3376
02:24:39,709 --> 02:24:41,478
(The songs by girl bands that represent the 4th generation)

3377
02:24:41,479 --> 02:24:42,479
(Girl bands?)

3378
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:44,808
("Armageddon" by aespa.)

3379
02:24:44,809 --> 02:24:46,649
("LOVE DIVE" by IVE)

3380
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:49,148
(YOUNITE came with a powerful performance...)

3381
02:24:49,149 --> 02:24:50,719
(that tastes like steel.)

3382
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:53,259
(8TURN took a gamble with a new theme.)

3383
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:54,558
(Startled)

3384
02:24:54,559 --> 02:24:57,859
(I had no idea they'd choose this song.)

3385
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:00,200
(But ONEUS is wearing hanbok.)

3386
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:02,029
(The one and only theme...)

3387
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:03,430
(that's never been seen in Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

3388
02:25:03,899 --> 02:25:05,099
(ONEUS confidently chose a Korean theme, )

3389
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:06,370
(which they're confident in.)

3390
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:07,770
(I have a feeling it's going to be a hit.)

3391
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:10,269
(We'll go beyond our limits...)

3392
02:25:10,270 --> 02:25:11,539
(and win 1st place in Round 3.)

3393
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:12,879
(That's ONEUS that I know.)

3394
02:25:13,079 --> 02:25:16,479
(CRAVITY, the front-runner and current 1st place in Team Ranking)

3395
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:18,579
(How come I'm not nervous at all?)

3396
02:25:19,979 --> 02:25:22,989
(But they make continuous mistakes during the rehearsal.)

3397
02:25:23,549 --> 02:25:24,549
(This is a problem.)

3398
02:25:24,649 --> 02:25:25,659
I'm in the way.

3399
02:25:25,959 --> 02:25:27,058
(I'm doomed.)

3400
02:25:27,059 --> 02:25:29,389
(CRAVITY faces an unexpected difficulty.)

3401
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:32,859
(Can they keep their 1st place in Team Ranking?)

3402
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:36,328
(Time to announce the finalists)

3403
02:25:36,329 --> 02:25:37,828
(Extremely nervous)

3404
02:25:37,829 --> 02:25:40,099
(Please let us go to the finals.)

3405
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:41,100
(We need to advance to the finals.)

3406
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:42,909
The teams going to the finals...

3407
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:46,280
Come on.

3408
02:25:46,639 --> 02:25:47,908
(Which 5 teams will advance to the finals, )

3409
02:25:47,909 --> 02:25:49,079
(the final hurdle before the championship win?)

3410
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:51,779
(We'll advance to the finals as the number-1 team.)

3411
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:52,818
(Wait there.)

3412
02:25:52,819 --> 02:25:54,119
(YOUNITE is coming.)

3413
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:56,149
(We'll compete together in the finals.)

3414
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,190
(Let's just make it to the finals.)

3415
02:25:58,649 --> 02:25:59,659
(I need to go to the finals.)

3416
02:26:00,219 --> 02:26:02,090
(We'll show you a victory without any surprises.)
