1
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:05,710
(Ace of Ace)

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,980
(THE NEW SIX)

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:10,449
(The CrewOne)

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,580
(8TURN)

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,919
(ONEUS)

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,460
(YOUNITE)

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,960
(CRAVITY)

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,789
(TEMPEST)

9
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:27,899
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,599
They will battle with songs of three different groups...

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,369
(Round 1 VS Mission, triple match)

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,640
(A merciless battle between 3 teams)

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,070
(We'll forget about seniority and fight with them.)

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,109
(We have already forgotten about it before coming up to the stage.)

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,649
(CRAVITY seeks revenge through their first team performance.)

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,049
(The CrewOne prepared to strike back with gritted teeth.)

17
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,289
(Who is the special guest visiting The CrewOne?)

18
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,619
(Ju Yeon of THE BOYZ)

19
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,929
(Sharing great tips as the previous winner)

20
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,460
(He gave us the tip when we weren't sure with the direction.)

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,460
(We'll put on a great performance.)

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,798
(How will The CrewOne's performance that became richer...)

23
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,929
(with the previous winner's advice turn out?)

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,569
(Cheering)

25
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,140
I'll watch this 30 times once their performance airs on TV.

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,438
(ONEUS is back with impressive stage manners.)

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,439
(It's a "Kingsman" theme.)

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,578
(How will the birth of a new hero...)

29
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,010
(reinterpreted through an action performance be?)

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,019
That's insane.

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,450
(And the long-awaited CRAVITY's first team performance)

32
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,489
(They more than made up for the Evaluation Match.)

33
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,090
(How will CRAVITY's performance that drew admiration look?)

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,890
(It's beautiful.)

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,930
(Revealing the final rankings of Round 1, VS Mission)

36
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,000
(Team Ranking, Ace Ranking)

37
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,760
(It's purely shocking.)

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,430
(How can the results turn out like that?)

39
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,430
(It's not over until it's over.)

40
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,839
(Another benefit that the ace must win?)

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
(Is it a battle?)

42
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,980
(What's the result of Round 1 that left everyone in shock?)

43
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,009
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,119
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,679
(For Round One, they performed in front of on-site judges.)

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,949
(To win 1,000 benefit points,)

47
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,219
(they begin the real competition.)

48
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,259
(The scores from Round 1 and Round 2...)

49
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,158
(will be combined to determine the elimination candidates.)

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,430
(I'm suddenly getting nervous.)

51
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,688
(Their teams' pride...)

52
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,060
(hangs on the Round 1 VS Mission.)

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,729
(The opening act of the VS Mission, the Stray Kids Match)

54
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,328
(As always,)

55
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,369
(we will win.)

56
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,029
(As always! Oh, my.)

57
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,538
(That really made me mad.)

58
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,438
(I really want to win.)

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,309
(THE NEW SIX picked a B-side track that wasn't as well-known.)

60
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,008
(I think they made the rap part.)

61
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,348
("Phobia" was recreated with a unique charm by THE NEW SIX.)

62
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,249
(The production is amazing.)

63
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,280
(Impressed)

64
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,788
(TEMPEST selected a well-known mega hit.)

65
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,188
(Look at the scale.)

66
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,689
(TEMPEST created a strong performance with "MANIAC.")

67
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,258
(They produced a good dance break.)

68
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:36,960
(But it's too similar.)

69
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,099
(The two teams created similar stages...)

70
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,128
(for the Stray Kids Match.)

71
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,400
(Who will win the Stray Kids Match and take the benefit points?)

72
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,698
(The second match, the ENHYPEN Match, follows.)

73
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,699
(They don't need to announce who their ace is.)

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,038
(Who is 8TURN's ace?)

75
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,469
(8TURN and YOUNITE came on stage with opposite themes.)

76
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,210
(8TURN emphasized their clean, powerful choreography.)

77
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,579
(They're perfectly synchronized!)

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,709
(8TURN showed the drive and energy...)

79
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,809
(of the youngest team with "Future Perfect.")

80
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,218
(They focused on the choreography over the composition.)

81
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,619
(I'm kind of excited for the next team.)

82
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,119
(Unlike 8TURN, YOUNITE used many props.)

83
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,659
(It made me regret for a second.)

84
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,788
(EUNSANG started the performance with some amazing acting.)

85
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:06,889
(It's so intense.)

86
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,199
(YOUNITE shocked the audience with their flashy "Bite Me" stage.)

87
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,060
(I think they're really insane!)

88
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,999
(The on-site judges vote to decide which team wins.)

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,038
(Who will win the 1,000 benefit points?)

90
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,269
(Voting closed)

91
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,399
(The results of the VS Match was delivered to each team.)

92
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,769
(THE NEW SIX wins the Stray Kids Match.)

93
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,068
(YOUNITE wins the ENHYPEN Match.)

94
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,339
(This time,)

95
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,340
(we won.)

96
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,378
(Enjoying their victory)

97
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,348
(We lost the VS Match.)

98
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,580
(But the final results for Round 1 are not in yet.)

99
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,079
(How will the team and ace rankings for Round 1 turn out?)

100
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,918
(Stray Kids, THE NEW SIX wins, TEMPEST loses)

101
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,719
(ENHYPEN, 8TURN loses, YOUNITE wins)

102
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,729
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

103
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,370
Road to Kingdom.

104
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,300
Round One VS Mission.

105
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,569
We expect this match to be the most intense.

106
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,478
This is the most interesting match.

107
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,579
This must be so interesting.

108
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,009
- I'm curious. - I'm so curious.

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,780
They will battle with songs of three different groups...

110
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,680
for a triple match.

111
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,650
(Screaming)

112
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,050
(Hi!)

113
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,959
How many are there?

114
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,359
The stage is so full.

115
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,590
There are so many of them.

116
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,359
(Through their smiles,)

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,299
(everyone can feel their tension and nerves.)

118
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,059
Oh, triple.

119
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,198
I'm most excited for this match.

120
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,369
- Me too. I'm so excited. - Me too.

121
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,229
I'm glad our team isn't part of that.

122
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,539
I kind of feel that way.

123
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,469
I think there will be the most to see.

124
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,369
- They're all different songs. - Right.

125
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,338
They have to battle each other with songs...

126
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,709
of different artists.

127
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,649
I think that'll make it very exciting.

128
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,619
We don't know what the audience will prefer,

129
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,619
so that'll be the biggest match.

130
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,448
In the Evaluation Match, HWAN WOONG...

131
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,549
got first place in the Ace Battle.

132
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,458
The CrewOne's Lim Jimin got second place.

133
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,159
We didn't see CRAVITY's performance in the Evaluation Match.

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,099
I'm curious what performance they'll show us.

135
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,829
I think that's the main event.

136
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,969
Before the three teams perform,

137
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,970
please tell us your goals for Round One.

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,610
We'll show you what kind of team ONEUS is.

139
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,879
We're very determined.

140
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,749
We'll show you the force...

141
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,319
of a big team.

142
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,480
Let's go.

143
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,919
ONEUS debuted earlier than us.

144
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,419
The CrewOne is the youngest group.

145
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,859
Today, we'll forget about all of that...

146
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,160
and compete as equals.

147
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,929
(He's no joke.)

148
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,430
Sparks are already flying.

149
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,138
He's saying, "This is a competition."

150
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,398
This is going to be a bloody fight.

151
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,240
Forget about seniority? We're all equals now.

152
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,739
Not you.

153
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,479
You're not there.

154
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,878
I see. Okay.

155
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,350
(I will forget about seniority one day too!)

156
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,318
Please introduce your ace for Round One, ONEUS.

157
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,619
(Who is ONEUS's ace for the triple match?)

158
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,088
Who could it be?

159
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,589
- I'm so curious. - Who is it?

160
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,990
ONEUS's ace...

161
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,470
He did so well as our ace for the Evaluation Match.

162
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,398
The winning team of the Ace Battle is...

163
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,138
(ONEUS's HWAN WOONG got first place in the Ace Battle.)

164
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,339
(Exclaiming)

165
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,040
(An impressive feat for it being their first time on Road to Kingdom)

166
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,609
Because the Round One scores count,

167
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,480
we need to win the Ace Battle.

168
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,750
So maybe HWAN WOONG should be the ace one more time.

169
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,149
ONEUS's ace for Round One's VS Mission...

170
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,060
is HWAN WOONG.

171
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,919
(ONEUS's strategy meeting after the Evaluation Match)

172
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,088
We're only done with the Evaluation Match now.

173
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,229
But we did pretty well, right?

174
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,769
(They got 1st in the Ace Battle and 3rd in the Team Battle!)

175
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,670
But even though we did well, we got zero points.

176
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,669
- Because the points don't count. - Right.

177
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,469
And we have to battle the teams we wanted to avoid the most.

178
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,239
The two teams with lots of members.

179
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,410
I was surprised.

180
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,779
(ONEUS was third to choose their match.)

181
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,949
(The match selection continued.)

182
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,619
(The 1-versus-1 matches filled up first.)

183
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
What?

184
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,250
(Their happiness was short-lived as they suddenly became worried.)

185
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,250
(Only the triple match was open.)

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,489
(Only CRAVITY and The CrewOne, the two largest teams, remained.)

187
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,120
We don't have enough members.

188
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,259
We wanted to avoid that team the most.

189
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,528
Despite having many members,

190
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,800
they have strong energy as one.
I think that's a big advantage.

191
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,969
As for CRAVITY,
I didn't know what kind of strategy they had.

192
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,499
But they're famous for being good dancers.

193
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,109
They have many talented members.

194
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,069
We were worried about those two teams.

195
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,638
The next day, we stayed up all night picking a song.

196
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,708
- Right. - Right.

197
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,378
"Lemonade" came up.

198
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,078
- And "Baggy Jeans." - "Baggy Jeans."

199
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,180
"Fact Check" came up too.

200
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,518
NCT has many units.

201
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,188
So we had many options for which song to choose.

202
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,230
(They selected the song with many options in mind.)

203
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,958
I think our weapon...

204
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,398
- is stage presence. - Right.

205
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,729
I want people to feel the energy...

206
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,438
of our live performance in person.

207
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,969
It could be dangerous,

208
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,568
but we chose "Kick It."

209
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,939
"Kick It" performed by ONEUS.

210
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,470
- What? - What?

211
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,449
(NCT 127's mega hit with a memorable and intense theme)

212
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,948
"Kick It" is a very famous song...

213
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,479
covered by many idols.

214
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,449
That means it's a very risky choice.

215
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,620
Let's show them the power of a well-known song.

216
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,818
(NCT 127, "Kick It," a hip-hop dance song...)

217
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,289
(with energetic vocals, this title track of their 2nd album...)

218
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,990
(became popular for their dynamic martial arts performance.)

219
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,599
With "Kick It,"

220
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,068
the Asian costumes were so memorable for me.

221
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,369
Should we face it head on and enhance the song's colour?

222
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,610
Or should we change directions and show our own take on it?

223
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,679
I think going with our own take on it would be a bit better.

224
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,778
A new take is more fun for those watching.

225
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,878
- Right. - Right.

226
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,479
Since the title includes the meaning of hero...

227
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,479
Is there a cool hero?

228
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,788
Who will be Bruce Lee?

229
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,888
(Laughing)

230
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,889
The Hulk. Iron Man.

231
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,658
Heroes wear special suits.

232
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,529
Superman wears his underwear over his pants.

233
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:47,099
Do you remember what we did when we first debuted?

234
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,199
That...

235
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,099
(What are you talking about?)

236
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,299
"Kingsman?"

237
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,610
(ONEUS did a "Kingsman" theme when they first debuted.)

238
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,480
(How about this?)

239
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,678
They're heroes in a way.

240
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,279
Right. Wearing suits could be nice.

241
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,018
I can't really imagine it.

242
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,849
No team has performed "Kick It" wearing suits.

243
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,950
Right.

244
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,589
We made a bold choice and picked "Kingsman,"

245
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,789
which could be seen as the complete opposite theme.

246
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,489
Gentle but kind of fun.

247
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,559
This could fit this song well.

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,428
I think the umbrellas would be best for the dance break.

249
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,139
With two people, we can hook the handles.

250
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,268
Sliding out like this from below...

251
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,508
I think sliding would be cool.

252
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,969
Yes, something like this.

253
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,069
And then...

254
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,080
(It's looking good.)

255
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,109
We used as many props as possible...

256
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,950
to help the audience understand our theme.

257
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,548
This is the secret room...

258
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,490
of ONEUS's "Kick It" stage.

259
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,649
Into the secret door!

260
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,658
One, two, three.

261
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:45,759
Ta-da.

262
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,990
(KEON HEE was here, but now he's not?)

263
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,590
(Here I am.)

264
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,999
We tried to make a performance...

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,399
full of many visualizations.

266
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's start ONEUS's rehearsal.

267
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,409
This shouldn't be here.

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,139
Yes. That's perfect.

269
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,379
Is there something uncomfortable in the back?

270
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,638
I'll try it now.

271
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,678
(They thoroughly check their lines of movement.)

272
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,249
In the Evaluation Match,

273
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,720
we made a few mistakes with the props.

274
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,449
(ONEUS made some mistakes with the props...)

275
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,919
(during the Evaluation Match.)

276
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,119
Let's make sure we don't repeat the same mistakes.

277
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,058
That thought was really in our heads.

278
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,128
We couldn't help...

279
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,429
but be nervous and tense.

280
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,240
Team ONEUS.

281
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,479
I knew it.

282
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,080
- A second time. - He's doing it again.

283
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,490
- He needs to be better than before. - Right.

284
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,990
He must be very nervous.

285
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,619
("Kick It" by ONEUS)

286
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,229
(A new take on the original Asian theme with a new hero)

287
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,230
Manners.

288
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:57,288
(A performance with dynamic action)

289
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,360
Maketh.

290
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,159
Man.

291
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,429
Is it "Kingsman?"

292
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:03,999
It's a "Kingsman" theme.

293
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,240
That scene.

294
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,870
Man.

295
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,039
The cup will go flying!

296
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,190
- Oh, he changed! - What is this?

297
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,600
How did he change so fast?

298
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,409
This isn't right!

299
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,009
They prepared something like this?

300
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,768
- What? - He went up there.

301
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,509
- When did he get up there? - This is insane.

302
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,610
So cool.

303
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:31,909
Let's go!

304
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,669
(ONEUS's ace, HWAN WOONG)

305
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,609
(You can view the full version of this performance on YouTube.)

306
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,249
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

307
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,779
- ONEUS! - ONEUS!

308
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,620
- ONEUS! - ONEUS!

309
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,849
They did well.

310
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,359
They have a vibe that comes from their experience.

311
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,619
Yes. They definitely had a different energy.

312
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,629
Right.

313
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,429
I could feel they were more experienced than us.

314
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,730
- I'm burning up. - I should stretch my back too.

315
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,399
I'm getting nervous.

316
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,799
(ONEUS finished their performance with no mistakes.)

317
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,509
That was so nice, wasn't it?

318
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,279
I even had fun in the middle.

319
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,908
That was the first time I had fun...

320
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,179
performing on a competition show.

321
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,008
I think we performed...

322
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,080
as much as we prepared with no mistakes.

323
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,019
I felt a sense of accomplishment after this performance.

324
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,018
It's been a while since we had a successful performance...

325
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,220
- at a competition. - Right.

326
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,759
- That was fun. Good work, everyone. - Good work!

327
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,000
(They can only clap.)

328
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,558
Bruce Lee.

329
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,798
I never imagined...

330
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,369
- this version of "Kick It." - Exactly.

331
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,069
I think HWAN WOONG is so talented.

332
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,139
Totally.

333
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,639
I think he'll get first place in the Ace Ranking.

334
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,379
No. What am I saying?

335
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,439
- Hey. - YUN GYU is first.

336
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,849
- What am I saying? - But seriously.

337
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,850
(Suddenly feeling like he lost)

338
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:16,909
How dare you?

339
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,548
Do you want to go get some air, YOON SUNG?

340
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,980
What am I saying? Get it together.

341
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,119
What am I saying?

342
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,788
I get why they didn't change their ace.

343
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,288
- Right. - He's confident.

344
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,359
He's confident and talented.

345
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,158
To be honest, the other four members seemed...

346
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,689
a bit too timid.

347
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,929
I don't know how it felt watching it in person.

348
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,258
It felt...

349
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,099
like a performance centering around the ace.

350
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,870
Instead of the team supporting the ace,

351
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,669
it felt like the ace was carrying the team on his back.

352
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,240
HWAN WOONG was the most memorable.

353
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,409
- Next is the largest group. - Exactly.

354
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,709
You're right.

355
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,949
That's the order.

356
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,909
The CrewOne. Let's get it.

357
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,518
Next is the second team of the triple match.

358
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,350
The CrewOne's performance will begin now.

359
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,788
(Very excited)

360
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,058
Okay. This is the first time...

361
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,929
for us to perform live for the audience.

362
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,729
We will no longer get 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, or 2nd place.

363
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,399
- We have to get first now. Okay? - Okay.

364
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,429
Let's prove ourselves!

365
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,699
- Let's show them. - Let's go.

366
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,729
Go!

367
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,700
We will never experience the humiliation...

368
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,269
from the Evaluation Match ever again.

369
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,538
Automatically, The CrewOne gets sixth place in the Team Ranking.

370
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,608
(6th place, The CrewOne)

371
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,839
It's okay.

372
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,210
- It's not okay. - That's disappointing.

373
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,579
Did our performance deserve sixth place?

374
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,949
We got sixth place,

375
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,690
but that means we were last out of the teams that performed.

376
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,390
I thought our performance had better attention to detail.

377
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,900
Getting sixth place was very disappointing.

378
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,170
I felt dejected, angry, and irritated.

379
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,730
I'm so mad.

380
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,470
I'm irritated.

381
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,239
I thought the Streaming Evaluation had a big influence.

382
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,670
Because that was 70 percent of the final score.

383
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,639
I felt rushed.

384
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,278
- Like we didn't have time. - Right.

385
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,240
We need to win over the public soon.

386
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,950
Round One's mission is VS.

387
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,180
- What? - Three teams will battle?

388
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,720
I'm sure everyone will avoid the 1-on-1-on-1 match.

389
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,118
Let's avoid the triple match.

390
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,519
We must avoid that.

391
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,389
I made my selection.

392
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,690
(But YOUNITE took the last spot for a 1 versus 1 match.)

393
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,288
(The 6th and 7th place teams automatically got the triple match.)

394
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,630
We have to go against CRAVITY and ONEUS.

395
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,758
No.

396
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,258
(Their opponent teams are well-known and talented.)

397
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,170
This is pretty tough.

398
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,469
This is the group of death.

399
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,170
How did we end up in a group like this?

400
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,009
If only we were a bit higher...

401
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,640
Seriously.

402
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,709
We really wanted to avoid them.

403
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,210
Thinking of competing against them...

404
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:29,480
This won't be easy.

405
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,420
Both teams had very high scores in the public popularity evaluation.

406
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,649
They were the strong teams.

407
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,348
They were at the very top.

408
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,518
In the initial public popularity vote, CRAVITY got...

409
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,589
- first place. - First place.

410
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,359
CRAVITY really is popular.

411
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,259
ONEUS got first place in the Streaming Evaluation.

412
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,229
I thought their experience and teamwork made them strong.

413
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,430
And the fact that they were well-known.

414
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,868
We think they have a good balance of all three factors,

415
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:52,940
but...

416
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,670
we could still have a chance.

417
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,839
Okay.

418
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,538
- Then we get THE BOYZ. - Yes.

419
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,339
- It's okay. I like it. - I like it.

420
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,649
Things went according to plan.

421
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,809
Let's do THE BOYZ.

422
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,219
THE BOYZ also has 11 members, just like us.

423
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,150
And we thought their music fit our image well.

424
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,619
We want to add many conceptual elements.

425
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,629
(Very relieved)

426
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,089
I like THE BOYZ.

427
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,429
I went to show everyone...

428
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,500
how great of a performance we can deliver.

429
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,369
We'll receive the energy of Road to Kingdom's first kings...

430
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,799
and win the triple match.
That's what we were thinking.

431
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,379
Starting Round One, there'll be a live audience.

432
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,880
- Right. - In terms of energy,

433
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,650
I think we're quite strong.

434
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,910
What song we pick is important.

435
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,880
I personally like "Maverick."

436
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,150
- I see. - I see.

437
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,719
I also like "TATTOO."

438
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,089
Their debut song, "Boy."

439
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,528
We thought a lot about how to share the energy...

440
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:50,890
the 11 of us have.

441
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,259
Their most recent song, "WATCH IT."

442
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,170
"WATCH IT" is nice.

443
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,268
"WATCH IT..."

444
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:58,368
- has a dark charm to it. - Right.

445
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,369
There were many elements that could be cool on stage.

446
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,279
For the VS Mission,

447
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,210
we chose "WATCH IT" by THE BOYZ.

448
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,779
This is the first performance the public will see.

449
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,419
"Be careful not to fall for our charms!"

450
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
This is the message we want to send.

451
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,259
That's partially why we chose "WATCH IT."

452
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,430
(Ready to be sexy)

453
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,828
(The dark charisma of THE BOYZ's transformation into bad boys...)

454
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:23,858
(stands out in the song.)

455
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:24,929
(The bassline adds an irresistible charm...)

456
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,200
(to the title track of their 2nd full-length album.)

457
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,368
We settled on the song, "WATCH IT."

458
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,229
But for this performance,
the performance of the ace member...

459
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,098
will be considered for the evaluation.

460
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,598
- That's important. - Right.

461
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,368
- That's true. - In my opinion,

462
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,108
someone who suits the song perfectly...

463
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,109
ought to be the ace.

464
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,079
Then I'd like to recommend someone.

465
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,239
(Whom will he recommend?)

466
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,308
It's Seunghwan.

467
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,548
(Surprised)

468
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,179
When you think of this song,

469
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,848
this irresistible and sexy vibe comes to mind. You know?

470
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:47,879
- I see. - Okay.

471
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,288
They haven't seen Seunghwan's sexy side yet.

472
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,319
They will go wild then.

473
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,289
Here's the strength of Seunghwan.
It's his eyes.

474
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:56,758
He's good at making these facial expressions...

475
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,700
that draw you in instantly.

476
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,630
Should I say his killer smile?

477
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,930
He's got that smile that can win over the hearts of women.

478
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,599
Should I keep going?

479
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,599
(Should we keep showing off his charms?)

480
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,369
I can even...

481
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,410
put myself on fire if it means it will help our team win.

482
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
(Oh, my. He's an ambitious guy.)

483
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:13,479
I could feel that he had been ready all this time...

484
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,078
- when he was looking at me. - My gosh, what a passionate guy.

485
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,019
Actually, if I had a chance,

486
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,390
I wanted to be the ace member at least once.

487
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,660
(Jeong Seunghwan of The CrewOne will be the ace for Round 1.)

488
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,258
(They start practising with him as the ace.)

489
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,989
Now that we know that the score from the ace is...

490
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,000
as important as the score the team receives,

491
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,329
I gave a lot of thought to our theme.

492
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,899
While doing that,
I tried to think about what I could do...

493
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,308
to deliver a great performance to the audience as the ace.

494
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:43,309
(How can I execute a great job as the ace?)

495
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,880
(He practised non-stop to be ranked high in Round 1.)

496
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,410
This isn't it.

497
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,750
Focus.

498
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,420
Five, six, seven.

499
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,619
(The CrewOne is working hard to practice the choreography.)

500
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,889
(Working on the details of the choreography...)

501
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,659
(and synchronizing the movements)

502
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,758
Five, six, seven, eight.

503
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,759
(Everyone is focused on their practice.)

504
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,759
(Zooming by)

505
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,328
Is there an instructor inside?

506
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,900
(There's a visitor?)

507
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,598
On eight,
we have to grab our fist and then extend it with the step.

508
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,170
- Yes. - Okay.

509
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,669
Should we try that again on our count?

510
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,680
- Yes. - Yes.

511
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
- What? - What is it?

512
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,339
(Surprised)

513
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,249
(Peeking)

514
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,250
- What? - Gosh.

515
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:25,980
(Ju Yeon of THE BOYZ makes a surprise visit.)

516
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:29,690
(The atmosphere gets hot as the handsome idol star shows up.)

517
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,619
(He's the main dancer and the center of the performance.)

518
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,089
(He's the main force that led his group to victory.)

519
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,299
(Ju Yeon, the undisputed and proven ace among aces)

520
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:39,859
- My gosh. - There's a celebrity.

521
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,199
(Shy and flustered)

522
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,229
(Thank you for coming.)

523
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,239
I hope the preparation is going well.

524
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,970
- It is. We're working hard. - Yes.

525
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,470
But I heard.

526
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,039
- Heard what? - What?

527
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,880
Your ranking from the Evaluation Match.

528
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:57,579
(Unable to face him)

529
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:58,423
I'm sorry.

530
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,220
It was embarrassing and humiliating.
I felt bad too.

531
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,159
- Is this Round One? - Yes.

532
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,259
We're going to perform your song, "WATCH IT."

533
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,299
We thought that it'd be a great song for us to tell our story.

534
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,199
- That's great. - My gosh.

535
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,069
The bottom line is that this is a competition.

536
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,339
So you guys need an intense song.

537
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
- Yes. - Right.

538
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,539
Can you show me what you got?

539
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,839
(Nervous)

540
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,109
- All right. - Okay.

541
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,209
Performing it in front of the original singer...

542
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,680
was the most nerve-racking for me. It made me very anxious.

543
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,720
(Can they receive good feedback from the original singer?)

544
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,160
Let's go!

545
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,390
(They nervously demonstrate the progress run-through.)

546
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,700
(Focused)

547
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,630
(The CrewOne gets immersed into the performance more than ever.)

548
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,309
(Gosh, it's finally over.)

549
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Thank you.

550
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:00,578
(The progress run-through which was more nerve-racking...)

551
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:01,750
(than the actual performance is over.)

552
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
How long have you been preparing for this?

553
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:04,679
- Two days? - Two days.

554
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
- Two days? - Two days.

555
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,750
(How will Ju Yeon evaluate their performance?)

556
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,589
(Nervous)

557
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,690
It felt like it was your song.

558
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
(What a relief.)

559
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
But...

560
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,299
doing a good job is more important on this show.

561
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,710
To be completely frank,

562
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,279
I wasn't shocked or anything by your performance.

563
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,348
I should be getting goosebumps.

564
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,880
I just thought that you were cool and did a good job.
That was it.

565
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:44,750
I felt bad that we weren't able to show him a clear direction...

566
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,589
we wanted for this performance.
We had nothing to say.

567
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,289
The audience can't just go,
"They're great. That's cool."

568
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,960
It can't end there.

569
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,059
- Right. - Yes.

570
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,759
When we performed "Danger,"
we had a clear goal.

571
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:58,400
We wanted to surprise the audience every 15 seconds.

572
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:01,499
(The legendary performance, "Danger," is still talked about...)

573
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,509
(for its clear theme and fantastic stage setup.)

574
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,440
It's important to get the audience to feel this.

575
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,910
It was a huge turning point for us.

576
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,548
Afterward, when we were going over our performance,

577
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,180
his advice was very helpful.

578
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:15,190
We'll have to see what to improve upon while practising...

579
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,019
- our choreography. - Right.

580
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,659
I think it will all come down...

581
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,759
to how we express ourselves on the stage.

582
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,789
Initially, our performance didn't showcase our individual charms.

583
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,999
So we decided to come up with a performance...

584
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,559
that will demonstrate our distinct charms.

585
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,369
At the Evaluation Match,
we got a disappointing result.

586
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,008
So we'll use our rage and passion as fuel for this performance.

587
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,440
- Let's go. - Yes.

588
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,609
All right, everyone. Look sexy.

589
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,980
Let's seduce everyone.

590
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,578
(Their charms were incorporated into the performance.)

591
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:46,249
(How will their version of "WATCH IT" come out?)

592
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,549
My gosh, look at The CrewOne and the dancers.

593
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,589
The stage will look full.

594
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,358
They might not have used dancers.

595
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,818
But I'm certain they did.

596
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,029
They probably did it to make the stage full.

597
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,630
But if they fail to pull it off, it might look messy.

598
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,960
I wonder what kind of performance they'll show us.

599
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:06,400
Team The CrewOne.

600
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,549
They're starting.

601
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,549
This is making me nervous.

602
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,589
("WATCH IT" by The CrewOne)

603
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,689
- What's that? - What are they doing?

604
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,460
- What is that? - Are they hanging upside down?

605
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,699
They're dangling there.

606
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,730
Are they bats?

607
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,268
(With the vampire theme, they created a dynamic performance.)

608
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,298
(It shows their determination to get the audience...)

609
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,369
(to fall in love with their irresistible charms.)

610
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,289
My gosh, Jimin. Get in there.

611
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,130
He really bit Seunghwan!

612
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,599
They're vampires?

613
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,099
I get it. He's the ace, so he took the intro.

614
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:53,240
They're good. It's nice.

615
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,299
Gosh, their performance is really cool.

616
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,759
(Won Bin)

617
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:42,959
Their performance is choreography-driven, not props...

618
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,089
- like ONEUS's performance. - Yes.

619
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,910
(Won Bin)

620
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,019
That must be the clock.

621
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,710
My gosh, Bain.

622
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,980
They all look like ace members.

623
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,430
(Lee Geonu)

624
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,940
How far did he fly?

625
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,479
What is that?

626
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,710
I'll watch this 30 times once their performance airs on TV.

627
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,049
(Bae Hyunjun)

628
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,429
(The CrewOne's ace, Jeong Seunghwan)

629
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,788
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

630
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,098
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

631
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,900
(You can find "WATCH IT" on music streaming services.)

632
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,799
(Impressed)

633
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,339
Watch it.

634
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,500
- They did well. - That was good.

635
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,508
The stage looked full.

636
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,538
- They make the best case for it. - Right.

637
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,038
They just focused on the performance like ONEUS.

638
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,879
That was all about the performance.

639
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,449
But contrary to what I expected, the ace member...

640
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,079
- didn't stand out that much. - Right. He didn't.

641
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,118
- The ace member didn't stand out. - Right.

642
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,319
The only thing I remember is Geonu's vocal ad-lib.

643
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,818
Everyone is so good.

644
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,219
So the ace didn't stand out much.

645
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,288
- Right. - Exactly.

646
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,419
I thought everyone on the team was exceptional.

647
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,689
They tried to show a lot with their performance.

648
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,900
I think that actually backfired in the end.

649
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,729
But they must be more disappointed...

650
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,129
- than anyone. - I agree.

651
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,629
- They made a mistake. - After watching that...

652
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,739
He couldn't get up there, right?

653
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,768
- I think so. - Did he fall down?

654
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,170
- He couldn't make it up. - He couldn't climb up.

655
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,469
He tried, but he fell off.

656
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,967
What a bummer.

657
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,109
(Meanwhile, The CrewOne comes down after the performance.)

658
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,440
Darn it.

659
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,710
(This member seems especially miserable after the performance.)

660
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,480
Gosh, darn it.

661
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,619
It felt like it was unfinished.

662
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,089
I was really angry after the performance.

663
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,558
Actually, when we were performing on stage,

664
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,160
we made small mistakes here and there.

665
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,899
Despite all the effort we put into this performance,

666
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,828
we failed to show everything we had prepared.

667
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,640
It was really disappointing.

668
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,309
And we wanted to perform,

669
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,409
so our ranking could climb up.

670
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,639
But we're worried that the viewers...

671
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,078
might think negatively of our mistakes...

672
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,778
and we may end up with a low ranking.

673
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,379
That's worrying us indeed.

674
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,618
(What will be the result of Round 1 for The CrewOne?)

675
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:28,179
- It's already the last performance. - It is.

676
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,518
Already?

677
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,250
But I'm having so much fun.
Why is this so fun to watch?

678
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,818
They are the last team to perform for the triple match.

679
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,730
CRAVITY will perform now.

680
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:39,130
(Anticipating)

681
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,258
- Gosh. They'll finally perform. - Here they come.

682
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,298
CRAVITY!

683
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,630
They must be really nervous.

684
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,768
I'm looking forward to this team.

685
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:45,799
We've never seen them perform before.

686
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:49,139
"How did they end up in seventh place before?"

687
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,309
I wanted to rock this performance,
so that would cross their minds.

688
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,509
Our goal is coming in first, no matter what.

689
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,348
After being ranked seventh,

690
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,250
only getting ranked first will be acceptable.

691
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,680
(The day of the strategy meeting for CRAVITY)

692
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,450
(They gathered for a meeting, but they seem down.)

693
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,189
We prepared a lot for the Evaluation Match.

694
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,359
But we couldn't perform.

695
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,459
(HYEONGJUN from CRAVITY, 7th place)

696
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,959
(As they were ranked last, they couldn't perform.)

697
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,429
To be honest, I'm still angry about it.

698
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,338
To describe how I feel right now,
I just want to show them...

699
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:22,140
because we still haven't shown them anything yet.

700
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,279
We won't even get a chance to pick.

701
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,980
(As they were ranked last, they couldn't even pick the artist.)

702
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,219
But it doesn't matter which match we end up with.

703
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,490
We can pull off anything.

704
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,788
It doesn't matter whom we get.

705
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:37,989
- Aren't you confident? - I'm confident, period.

706
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,259
- I'm confident in everything. - Seriously.

707
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,919
To win the whole competition,
we'll have to beat everyone.

708
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,788
We're not here to make it to the final.

709
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,089
We're here to win the whole thing.

710
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,200
I think we can win...

711
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,900
no matter whom we go up against.

712
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:50,368
In a way,

713
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,939
no one knows what we can do.

714
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,969
- Right. - Yes.

715
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,609
It could actually work in our favour.

716
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,710
You're really optimistic. I like that.

717
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:59,440
I'm itching to perform now.

718
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:00,939
Your blood must be boiling.

719
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,308
This has a good influence on us then.

720
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,778
It's motivating all of us to work harder.
This is nice.

721
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,619
We'll have to go beyond ourselves and bring more than what we have.

722
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,448
We should let the result speak for itself.

723
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,489
Yes. Great.

724
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,518
After getting placed seventh,

725
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,018
I don't want us to be ranked bottom again.

726
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,030
It actually helped me focus.

727
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,329
It wasn't all bad that we ended up on the bottom.

728
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,070
Then we need to prepare for Round One.

729
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,799
- Yes. - The subtitle of the show is...

730
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,440
Ace of Ace.

731
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,269
(Triggered by the word, "ace")

732
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,339
My gosh, it's already torturing me.

733
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,009
I think I got traumatized by that.

734
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,848
So we have to pick another ace member for Round One.

735
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,179
- The ace for Round One. - Yes.

736
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,149
(Then silence settles over the room.)

737
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,949
(Glancing)

738
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,190
You know what?

739
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,590
It was a traumatic experience.

740
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,319
He can't just stay down.

741
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,859
Right. He ought to stand up and fight back.

742
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,559
- He must fight back. - Of course.

743
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,058
I'd like HYEONGJUN to try again.

744
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,069
Overcoming this trauma might be good too.

745
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,828
If we back down after getting punched like this...

746
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,138
and change our ace...

747
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,698
- It looks like we're running away. - Right. It does look like that.

748
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,709
Right.

749
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,038
If we do that, it'd hurt our pride.

750
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,578
- It has to be HYEONGJUN's call. - Are you okay with this?

751
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,479
- It must be up to him. - Well...

752
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,678
- Your opinion matters the most. - Yes.

753
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,448
Well, this is really iffy.

754
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:13,249
My gosh, I'm a bit scared.

755
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,619
- I see. - We get it

756
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,789
That's possible.

757
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,649
After experiencing how important the ace's role is,

758
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,820
it's giving me a lot of pressure.

759
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,529
(The members can understand that...)

760
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,058
(as they know the weight of being an ace.)

761
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:25,799
To be honest, no one is blaming you.

762
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,929
- Right. - Yes.

763
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,230
I hope you will come back from this...

764
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,629
and show them...

765
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,170
- it didn't affect your spirit. - That's right.

766
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,308
As for the format of Round One,

767
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:40,909
the ace will have to stand out in our group performance.

768
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,649
We'll support you in the back.

769
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,578
"In the back" doesn't sound right.

770
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,779
- By your side. - By your side.

771
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,480
We'll be your family right by your side.

772
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,749
- Right by your side. - A family by your side.

773
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,049
We'll be your family right by your side.

774
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,759
- A family by your side. - Yes.

775
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,018
We won't just stay in the back.

776
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,888
- My family on both sides. - Yes.

777
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:59,129
We have great synergy when we perform as a group.

778
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,229
What do you think about trying this out together?

779
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,800
(The members endlessly cheer for him. What will HYEONGJUN say?)

780
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,670
Let's have a revenge match of the Ace Battle.

781
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,139
(He works up the courage and will perform as the ace again.)

782
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,539
(That's what I'm talking about.)

783
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,739
It's settled then.

784
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,809
The members believed in me...

785
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,009
and said they would support me...

786
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,439
- by my side. - You got this.

787
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,721
Their encouraging words...

788
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,718
turned the pressure into confidence.

789
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,649
I became more motivated.

790
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,090
That made me determined to show people what I could do.

791
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,589
Let's take back first place this time around.

792
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,859
- Yes. - Sounds good.

793
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,029
HYEONGJUN is the perfect guy for the theme of the artist...

794
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,800
we ended up with.

795
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,828
(As they didn't get to choose the artist,)

796
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,800
(they ended up with TOMORROW X TOGETHER.)

797
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,598
(They represent the 4th-generation idol groups...)

798
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,000
(and are known for transcending the limitations of genres.)

799
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,538
(Which song by TOMORROW X TOGETHER...)

800
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,570
(did CRAVITY pick?)

801
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,239
The song selection will be very important.

802
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,149
It has to match the story we're trying to portray.

803
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,408
That will draw people in.

804
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,749
- It will draw people in. - Right.

805
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,779
How about "Sugar Rush Ride?"

806
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,888
YEONJUN also recommended this song.

807
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,119
- What? - What?

808
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,488
We can get help from your friend?

809
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:01,360
- We can get help from your friend. - We can.

810
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:02,389
(Hey, we'll be performing your song on Road to Kingdom.)

811
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,389
(- Really? Which one? - We haven't decided yet.)

812
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,428
(- Any recommendations? - "Deja Vu?" Or "Sugar Rush Ride?")

813
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,000
(YEONJUN: Or "Sugar Rush Ride?")

814
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,158
(They listen to the song intently as they seem to agree on it.)

815
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,599
- The devil said - The devil said

816
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,069
We can go with a strong theme for this.

817
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,440
We were ranked last.

818
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,268
We'll cut a deal with the devil.

819
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,569
- With the devil? - Yes.

820
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,669
We'll be the devil then?

821
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,670
- We'll have a deal with the devil? - So...

822
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,538
Will we be tempted by the devil's whisper?

823
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,979
We've gone dark and come back with the devil.

824
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,678
But you can't go into business with just anyone.

825
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,449
Right. It's not what you think.

826
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,379
- The song is youthful and sexy. - Right.

827
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,549
We rarely executed sexy performances.

828
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,649
I don't remember performing...

829
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,919
- with sexy themes. - Right.

830
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,089
- We can show people something new. - Yes.

831
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,760
Then we'll have a deal with the devil too.

832
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,689
- It's not a real deal. - With the devil.

833
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,800
How about the power of the devil?

834
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,799
- You like that. - This is resonating...

835
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,198
with my geeky heart.

836
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,699
- I got a vision for this. - You did?

837
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,868
We can go with a strong theme for this.

838
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,509
This will be the perfect song...

839
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,709
to perform on stage.

840
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,409
This song has the most fun elements.

841
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,908
(It's about a young boy, drawn in...)

842
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:56,209
(by the devil's irresistible temptation.)

843
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,678
(The title track of their 5th mini album exudes...)

844
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,320
(a dreamy and sensual vibe.)

845
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,079
Are you all ready to join the dark side?

846
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,988
- I'm already there. - I already did.

847
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,888
The main theme of the song is the whisper of the devil.

848
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,589
It will match our story of determination.

849
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,329
I think we can incorporate what we're feeling in the song.

850
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,799
There's a task I must fulfil...

851
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,399
as the ace.

852
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,799
I thought this was our chance to climb up the rankings...

853
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,199
and to show them what we could do.

854
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,799
Five, six, seven, eight.

855
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,010
Eight. Yes.

856
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,578
"We shouldn't have messed with them."

857
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,209
"They're determined to win after placing bottom."

858
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,480
That's what we wanted the other groups to think.

859
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,249
We were certain we could win first place...

860
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,449
the whole time we were practising.

861
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,788
I thought, "We can show them."

862
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:39,989
"I can feel it."

863
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,690
I practised even harder for this.

864
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:47,599
We included a new style of dance called tutting.

865
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,029
The lines and shapes of our hands and the aesthetics...

866
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,698
of our dance were so important for this choreography.

867
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,239
We had to work together to complete our performance.

868
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:59,139
That was really tough.

869
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,739
I really wanted to do a killer job.

870
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,178
We have to win, no matter what.

871
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,178
We don't want the bitter taste of defeat again.

872
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,179
(CRAVITY worked hard to perfect their performance.)

873
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,320
(How will their performance come out?)

874
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,749
Be on standby.

875
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,949
Play the music. Three, two, one. Start.

876
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,218
I know they're our opponents,

877
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,459
but I'm curious about their performance.

878
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,729
And I bet they are determined to win this battle.

879
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,488
- They must've been angry. - I bet they worked so hard on it.

880
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,558
(Focused)

881
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,658
I'm curious, though.

882
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,769
It's their first performance. I bet they prepared a good one.

883
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,170
What a surprise.

884
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:28,738
(This song is...)

885
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:29,909
It's "Sugar Rush Ride."

886
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,340
- It's "Sugar Rush Ride." - It's "Sugar Rush Ride."

887
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,179
The arrangement of the song is insane.

888
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,980
(Nervous)

889
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,218
(As three groups are competing in this match,)

890
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,789
(they focus on every little detail.)

891
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,690
That's nicely composed.

892
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,729
Their movements are in complete sync.

893
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,799
- That's what they're known for. - Right.

894
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,169
Their movements were perfectly synced up.

895
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,699
(As it's better than expected, he gets more nervous.)

896
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,638
- They did well. - They're great.

897
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,139
It's like a performance at an awards ceremony.

898
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:02,670
My gosh.

899
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,670
Why did they prepare such a great performance?

900
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,638
We're going to remind them...

901
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,109
once again that CRAVITY is...

902
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,518
a force to be reckoned with.

903
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,849
That's what we ought to do.

904
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,589
Let's go. Remember...

905
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,788
- Who we are! - Who we are!

906
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:20,819
Okay.

907
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,059
(How will their version of "Sugar Rush Ride" turn out?)

908
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,460
- Go, CRAVITY. - Go, CRAVITY.

909
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,230
- They chose him one more time? - Gosh.

910
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,669
- Again? - Again.

911
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,169
That's a huge challenge.

912
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,400
- To do it again. - It requires great courage.

913
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,768
He's back to make people pay...

914
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,110
- for the humiliation. - That's right.

915
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:38,639
- Go, CRAVITY. - Go, CRAVITY.

916
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,340
Team CRAVITY.

917
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,389
They were so good during the rehearsal.

918
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,719
I look forward to their stage the most.

919
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,360
I'm curious how they'll perform.

920
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,659
They must be so nervous.

921
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,429
I'm nervous myself.

922
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:16,209
("Sugar Rush Ride" by CRAVITY)

923
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,210
Come a little closer

924
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,920
Swallow it

925
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,618
The sugar rush

926
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:24,718
(A depiction of boys falling for the sweet temptation of evil...)

927
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,920
(using eye-catching performances and intuitive objects)

928
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,190
Is that what I think it is?

929
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,659
That's from "Talk to Me."

930
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,288
- You know that movie, right? - Yes, I do.

931
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,899
- You see ghosts if you do that. - That's right.

932
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,959
- It's from a movie. - What's that?

933
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,299
How did he stop like that?

934
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,570
- What's that? - How did he do that?

935
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:25,920
What's that?

936
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:05,349
- This blows my mind. - That was smooth.

937
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,300
Here it comes.

938
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,500
- This part. - This is the cool part.

939
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,340
I admit it.

940
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,510
That looks nice.

941
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,090
It's beautiful.

942
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,639
The hand.

943
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,529
- What was that? - Gosh, what was that?

944
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,800
Wait a second.

945
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,299
It's like we're at an awards ceremony.

946
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
It looks like Homigot.

947
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,138
Is there more?

948
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:38,238
- It isn't over yet. - What?

949
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,239
It isn't over.

950
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,299
(CRAVITY's ace, HYEONGJUN)

951
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,268
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

952
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:06,999
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

953
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,598
("Sugar Rush Ride" by CRAVITY will not be released...)

954
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,210
(due to copyright issues.)

955
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:11,739
The acting was insane.

956
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,139
It's like watching "MAMA Awards."

957
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,879
That was impressive. I got goosebumps.

958
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,949
It was perfect for them.

959
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,979
I really enjoyed the movie "Talk to Me."

960
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,018
I knew it was from the movie as soon as I saw it.

961
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:24,089
I got goosebumps at the end...

962
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,519
when they all gathered around.

963
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,919
- That was something. - It was insane.

964
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,929
They did so well.

965
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,130
I seriously got goosebumps.

966
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,959
The ending was smooth.

967
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,000
It was a great idea.

968
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,400
There is absolutely nothing I can find fault with.

969
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,999
They did a really good job.
The directing was amazing as well.

970
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,570
Yes, the directing was well done, and it's memorable.

971
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,239
The members of CRAVITY...

972
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,210
stand out the most.

973
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,340
Right.

974
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:47,710
- The directing was good too. - That's right.

975
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,238
They didn't have many props,
but they were imposing.

976
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,280
That's right.

977
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,710
I think...

978
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:54,650
this is the performance of a bigger group we worried about.

979
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,819
It's hard for each member to stand out.

980
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,889
But they did a good job.

981
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,219
- They're good. - They did well.

982
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,928
I have nothing to say.

983
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:07,630
I honestly want to make a negative comment as an opponent.

984
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:08,860
But I have nothing to say.

985
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,500
(CRAVITY successfully finishes their first stage as a team.)

986
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:17,309
I feel so relieved that it's over.

987
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,409
Good job, everyone.

988
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:21,739
- Nicely done. - Good job.

989
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,349
- Good job, everyone. - No mistakes, right?

990
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,550
Out of all the performances I did,
this gave me...

991
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,319
- I know. - the greatest sense of achievement.

992
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,848
- Yes, it did. - I've never felt this good...

993
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,119
- about a performance. - Right.

994
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,360
That was insane.

995
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,488
I felt sure of it...

996
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,230
when I stepped off the stage after performing.

997
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:38,988
- A weight was lifted off my chest. - That's right.

998
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,900
I felt relieved that we successfully pulled off the performance.

999
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:47,198
Out of all the stages I performed on ever since my debut,

1000
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,009
this was the most thrilling.

1001
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,440
It's been five years since our debut.

1002
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,178
I felt something novel...

1003
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:56,509
during our performance today.

1004
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,650
(The result of CRAVITY's stage everyone is satisfied with?)

1005
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,949
We will now begin the VS voting...

1006
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:06,119
for ONEUS, The CrewOne, and CRAVITY,

1007
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:07,789
the three teams that competed in the triple match.

1008
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,400
I personally got goosebumps during the stage...

1009
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,860
by CRAVITY.

1010
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,230
- Me too. - I personally...

1011
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,469
- liked CRAVITY's stage the best. - Me too.

1012
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,409
(Strikingly dark and sexy with a diverse performance)

1013
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,280
(Will "Sugar Rush Ride" by CRAVITY win?)

1014
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,848
I liked ONEUS' stage.

1015
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:33,179
Me too. I think it was the most unique and impressive.

1016
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,388
(The song with an Asian vibe...)

1017
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:38,019
(was reinterpreted into an action performance.)

1018
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,759
(Will "Kick It" by ONEUS win?)

1019
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,989
I'd vote for The CrewOne.

1020
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,129
(A powerful and dynamic performance by the team with the most members)

1021
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,199
(Will "WATCH IT" by The CrewOne win the triple match?)

1022
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,199
I don't know how the vote will end.

1023
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:54,639
I don't think we'll lose.

1024
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,198
We're here to compete.

1025
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,669
Who would want to be in second place?

1026
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,078
Since our goal is to win first place,

1027
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,440
we should win the triple match.

1028
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,948
(It's hard to predict the result of the close triple match.)

1029
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,420
Five, four,

1030
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,480
three, two, one.

1031
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,090
(Voting closed)

1032
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:12,489
The voting is closed.

1033
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:16,119
(The 3 teams receive the result cards.)

1034
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,589
- Good job. - What's this?

1035
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,698
(As soon as they return to the green room,)

1036
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,058
- Why? - Come on.

1037
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:22,259
(they see the result card.)

1038
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,400
They can't have the result already.

1039
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,569
(CRAVITY arrives at their green room at the same time.)

1040
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,570
It's over.

1041
00:49:29,571 --> 00:49:31,669
- You all did a good job. - What's this?

1042
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,968
- Good job. - What's this?

1043
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,110
- What is it? - What is it?

1044
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,238
Good job, everyone.

1045
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,449
- The result. - What?

1046
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,210
- What? - Come on.

1047
00:49:39,211 --> 00:49:41,179
Stop lying.

1048
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
What's this?

1049
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,019
- Gosh. - The result.

1050
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,920
- This is too much. - Why?

1051
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:50,429
- Unbelievable. - The result is out already?

1052
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,230
- I don't want to see this. - Let's go.

1053
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,059
- Who else doesn't want to check? - Come here.

1054
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,169
Let's sit first.

1055
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,698
I thought it was a gift.

1056
00:49:58,699 --> 00:49:59,968
(He is dazed already.)

1057
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,340
- Unbelievable. - Should we check it now?

1058
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,469
- Go ahead. - Really?

1059
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,469
We have to check it?

1060
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,738
(Everyone is nervous after seeing the result card.)

1061
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:06,880
- Announce it. - All right.

1062
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,179
In 1, 2, 3.

1063
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,050
Here we go.

1064
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,479
(The die is cast at the same time in ONEUS's green room.)

1065
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,549
This is insane.

1066
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,749
Wait, I'm nervous now.

1067
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,388
- I honestly bet we won. - We won.

1068
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:19,689
In 1, 2, 3.

1069
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,489
(Did ONEUS win or lose?)

1070
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,328
(HYEONGJUN of ONEUS is holding the result card.)

1071
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:27,699
I was expectant and scared.

1072
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,769
Losing here would really mean we weren't good enough.

1073
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,699
- Let's check it together. - Let's just go for it.

1074
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,939
(Taking a deep breath)

1075
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,169
(Failing)

1076
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,808
Like we said, we have no regrets...

1077
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:40,839
- regardless of the result. - That's right.

1078
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,379
- Seriously. - We have no regrets.

1079
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,380
- That's right. - Okay.

1080
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:46,920
(The triple match of Round 1's VS Mission was fierce to the end.)

1081
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,919
- One, two... - Don't be expectant.

1082
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,789
(Which team won in the triple match and earned the benefit?)

1083
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,190
Three.

1084
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,289
(CRAVITY wins the triple match.)

1085
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,090
Three.

1086
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,569
(The joy of winning...)

1087
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,170
(and tears of relief hit together.)

1088
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,879
- We won. - Gosh.

1089
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,880
Seriously.

1090
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,380
We won.

1091
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,219
Even JUNGMO is crying.

1092
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,489
Although we put on a performance we were so confident about,

1093
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,659
I was terrified to check the result.

1094
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,558
What a relief.

1095
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,800
(It's such a relief they were acknowledged with a win.)

1096
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,800
It felt like all the weight...

1097
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,539
was lifted off my chest.

1098
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,009
HYEONGJUN, whom we put our trust in once again,

1099
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,280
did such a good job.

1100
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,480
I was very grateful to him.

1101
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,349
I was so proud of the other members after checking the result.

1102
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,949
We were in last place.

1103
00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:00,360
And we had to compete with two other teams.

1104
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,619
When we won,

1105
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:05,090
I realized how desperate we were.

1106
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,300
I realized how determined we were as we practised for the stage.

1107
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,428
- Come here. - You all did great.

1108
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,928
- Group hug. - Come here.

1109
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:13,940
Come on.

1110
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:16,199
We all did a good job.

1111
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,368
- Right. - Good job.

1112
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:18,840
- Gather together. - Pat yourself.

1113
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,679
- We all did great. - Good job.

1114
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,780
One, two, three.

1115
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:25,879
(ONEUS and The CrewOne...)

1116
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,919
Three.

1117
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,348
(didn't get the result they were hoping for.)

1118
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:30,349
Is there something behind this?

1119
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:32,650
- Lose. - Lose?

1120
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,288
We were in sixth place in the Evaluation Match.

1121
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:38,459
We wanted to do better in Round One.

1122
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,489
We had to do better.

1123
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:42,000
The 1,000 benefit points means a lot to us.

1124
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,968
So I was quite angry.

1125
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:45,999
(Their high expectations led to a greater disappointment.)

1126
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,940
I could tell the other members were angry.

1127
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:51,769
I couldn't believe it.

1128
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,309
I wondered if we focused too much on the vividness.

1129
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,349
My blood was boiling.

1130
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,449
(CRAVITY gets a benefit of 1,000 points.)

1131
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,719
The 7 performances for Round 1 are over.

1132
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,789
Now it is time to determine their destiny.

1133
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,190
For Round 1, Self-Evaluation takes up 30 percent,

1134
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:16,000
and the evaluation of on-site judges takes up 70 percent of the score.

1135
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,230
Please vote for the three aces that were memorable...

1136
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,339
and three teams that put on the best stages...

1137
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,409
out of the seven performances.

1138
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,409
We will begin voting.

1139
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,209
(The voting was conducted in the presence of observers.)

1140
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,638
(Mr. Choi, 20s, Gyeonggi Province, Mr. Park, 20s, Gyeonggi Province)

1141
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,279
(Please)

1142
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,349
We desperately want this.

1143
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,219
Please.

1144
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,119
Five, four,

1145
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,050
three, two, one.

1146
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:41,259
(Voting closed)

1147
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,619
The voting is closed.

1148
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:45,489
We lost in the VS Mission.

1149
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,099
But we don't have our total team score yet.

1150
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:50,130
If I were to choose three teams that did the best,

1151
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,130
I'd choose ONEUS.

1152
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,369
I still had hope in a corner of my heart.

1153
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,469
We didn't have to feel discouraged yet.

1154
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,769
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1155
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,739
The performances of Round One you all prepared hard for are over.

1156
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,949
(They applaud one another for their hard work.)

1157
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,718
You all worked hard.

1158
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:08,579
- Yes. - I feel satisfied.

1159
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,590
(Round 1 is the beginning of the competition.)

1160
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:17,659
(Which team will get a chance to win?)

1161
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,860
The moment you cannot avoid has come.

1162
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:24,229
The result announcement is waiting for you.

1163
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,299
(Groaning)

1164
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,329
No.

1165
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,840
There is no way to know.

1166
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,139
I'm scared.

1167
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,969
Out of the Ace Ranking and Team Ranking,

1168
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,110
I will start with the Team Ranking.

1169
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:37,909
Just like that?

1170
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,719
- I hope we're in the top four. - Please.

1171
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:43,989
I really hope we're in the top four.

1172
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:48,319
- Fourth place... - I don't want to be fourth anymore.

1173
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,359
(THE NEW SIX doesn't want to be in 4th place anymore.)

1174
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,090
This reminds me of a nightmare.

1175
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,229
- I'm really nervous. - Me too.

1176
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,400
(Will CRAVITY succeed in getting a higher ranking?)

1177
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,400
The three teams that won in the VS Mission...

1178
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,400
gained 1,000 benefit points.

1179
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,169
(The winners of the VS Mission)

1180
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,538
(CRAVITY)

1181
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:04,638
(YOUNITE)

1182
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:06,940
(THE NEW SIX)

1183
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,750
(VS Mission result)

1184
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,948
Thank you.

1185
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:15,948
(The winners are 1,000 points ahead before the ranking is revealed.)

1186
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:17,550
Yes, 1,000 points.

1187
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,659
- I'm jealous. - I'm jealous.

1188
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,489
They are starting with 1,000 points.

1189
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:25,429
As the 1,000 benefit points were given out,

1190
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,829
I'm sure you're all curious about the final ranking.

1191
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,198
Let's check the ranking of THE NEW SIX, YOUNITE,

1192
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,199
and CRAVITY, the winners of the VS Mission.

1193
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,109
(Why are we first?)

1194
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,309
I'm so nervous.

1195
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:40,679
- What? We're going first? - We're going first?

1196
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,940
My heart rate that slowed down is going up again.

1197
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,050
(His heart is racing.)

1198
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,119
One of them must be in first place.

1199
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,320
What if they win 1st, 2nd, and 3rd?

1200
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:51,388
- Even if they won the match, - You never know.

1201
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,650
they might not have gotten votes for the team voting.

1202
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,489
Show us the ranking of the winning teams.

1203
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
Please.

1204
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,559
I don't have any expectations at all.

1205
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:01,860
(He is expectant with his whole body.)

1206
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,730
Are we allowed to get nervous now?

1207
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:06,300
I just don't want to see the number "seven."

1208
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,499
Seriously.

1209
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,598
(CRAVITY is more desperate because they were in 7th place.)

1210
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,039
Please.

1211
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,780
I feel weird. I don't think I can watch this.

1212
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,039
(Round 1: VS winner team ranking, 1st, 2nd, 3rd)

1213
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,250
- What? - What's this?

1214
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:19,049
(What?)

1215
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,679
- What's this? - What's this?

1216
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,619
- Are they 1st, 2nd, and 3rd? - What?

1217
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:23,788
Could they be in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places?

1218
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:24,789
What's this?

1219
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,860
The winning team ranking...

1220
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,559
is 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

1221
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,090
(Shocked)

1222
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,500
We're one of them.

1223
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,300
We're one of them.

1224
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,840
- We aren't in 4th place anymore. - We aren't in 4th anymore.

1225
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:42,598
(The winning teams bask in happiness.)

1226
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,840
My heart isn't beating.

1227
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,539
They're in the top three.

1228
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:48,308
(The other teams are automatically in the lower rankings.)

1229
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:49,440
I'm suddenly nervous.

1230
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,578
- I'm scared. - The fact that ONEUS...

1231
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:53,849
isn't in the top three is surprising.

1232
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,920
I guess 1,000 points makes a big difference.

1233
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:59,420
I was hoping for a plot twist.

1234
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,130
We will reveal the team rankings...

1235
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:08,260
from 1st to 7th place for Round 1 all at once.

1236
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,959
(Is it seriously moving this fast?)

1237
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,000
This is insane.

1238
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,999
Please.

1239
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,800
This is so cruel.

1240
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,670
Show us the final rankings.

1241
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,710
Let's win first place while we're at it.

1242
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,780
I want to win first place.

1243
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,579
Let's win first place while we're at it.

1244
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,480
(Meanwhile, the teams that lost...)

1245
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,578
(are very nervous.)

1246
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,150
I can't watch this.

1247
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,619
Please let us not be in last place.

1248
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,489
Let us be at least sixth place.

1249
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,989
(What will the result of the Team Ranking for Round 1 be?)

1250
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,729
(Round 1 Team Ranking)

1251
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,960
(1st place, CRAVITY, 10,769 points, CRAVITY wins 1st place.)

1252
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:47,099
(1st, CRAVITY, 10,769 points)

1253
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,139
(They all jump to their feet.)

1254
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,739
Seriously.

1255
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,610
(Moved)

1256
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,309
I'm sure they tried very hard.

1257
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,449
They went from last place to first.

1258
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,150
This is a total plot twist.

1259
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:02,349
(HYEONGJUN can't take his eyes off the results.)

1260
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,718
My legs feel weak.

1261
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,449
- Good job. - Good job.

1262
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,090
I was so happy.

1263
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:11,760
We were placed seventh for the Evaluation Match without performing.

1264
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,130
We performed for the 1st time and won 1st place in Round 1.

1265
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,269
That was so satisfying.

1266
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:22,199
We showed them how good we are, so we'll stay in first place.

1267
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,139
- We won't back down. - We won't let you take it.

1268
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,610
YOUNITE got a really high score.

1269
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,579
(2nd place, YOUNITE, 10,249 points, YOUNITE's score stands out.)

1270
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,849
We were in seventh place for the expected ranking.

1271
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,550
(During the Evaluation Match)

1272
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,119
(Not only was their expected ranking for the Evaluation Match 7th,)

1273
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:41,690
(but they also ended up in 5th place for the Team Ranking.)

1274
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,389
(Sad)

1275
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:46,730
We would've been in 2nd place even without the 1,000 points.

1276
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,599
We've gone up a lot.

1277
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:51,869
There isn't that big of a difference between us.

1278
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,170
We did it.

1279
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,340
I can't congratulate them whole-heartedly.

1280
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,669
Fourth place is a bit...

1281
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,840
(4th place, ONEUS, 6,997 points)

1282
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,010
My pride is hurt.

1283
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,980
What a bummer.

1284
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,109
- Bummer. - What a bummer.

1285
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,250
- It's a bummer. - It's a bummer.

1286
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:08,848
We'll have to try harder.

1287
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:11,149
(5th, TEMPEST, 4,756 points)

1288
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,618
We were almost in last place.

1289
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:13,988
(6th, The CrewOne, 4,585 points)

1290
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,089
We're standing still.

1291
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,190
(They're in the same ranking as the Evaluation Match.)

1292
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,360
Oh, no.

1293
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,799
How could we be in seventh place?

1294
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,130
(7th place, 8TURN, 4,423 points)

1295
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,500
(With their refreshing and powerful performance,)

1296
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,070
(8TURN had won 1st place in the Team Battle.)

1297
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,578
(They dropped to 7th in Round 1's Team Battle.)

1298
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:36,809
From 1st place to 7th?

1299
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,679
It's the total opposite.

1300
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,149
(It's hard to accept the change in ranking.)

1301
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,219
This is unbelievable.

1302
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,719
8TURN went from 1st place to 7th.

1303
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,229
8TURN was in 1st place last time.
They switched with us.

1304
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,230
You're right.

1305
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:55,900
The ace plays an important role.

1306
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,469
I feel responsible.

1307
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:02,570
We revealed the Team Ranking.

1308
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,969
But you know this isn't the end, right?

1309
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,110
- Yes. - Yes.

1310
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,010
We still have the Ace Ranking.

1311
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,079
Could it be very different from the Team Ranking?

1312
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,409
I think it could be totally different.

1313
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,849
I'll hope for this.

1314
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,980
Our ace did a really good job.

1315
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:18,420
(Nervous)

1316
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,618
Here is the Ace Ranking.

1317
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,259
I will now announce...

1318
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,629
the first three teams.

1319
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,030
- Goodness. - I didn't think I'd be nervous.

1320
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:28,329
Why am I so nervous?

1321
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,329
I can't breathe.

1322
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,369
I'll look forward to this one.

1323
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,800
(Nervous)

1324
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,868
(EUNSANG seems far more humble.)

1325
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:37,969
I think our team is in it.

1326
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,009
You did well.

1327
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,409
I believe that we're in it.

1328
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,409
YUN GYU might save us.

1329
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:49,050
Whatever the outcome is,

1330
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:50,789
you're our number one.

1331
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,559
Ace Ranking of Round One.

1332
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,489
Please reveal the top three teams.

1333
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,260
Please.

1334
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,428
(The members who are watching...)

1335
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:02,529
(are also nervous.)

1336
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:03,800
Please be there.

1337
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,730
(Startled)

1338
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,499
(Who are the top 3 members of the Ace Ranking?)

1339
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,070
(EUNSANG, HWAN WOONG, and HYEONGJUN)

1340
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,908
(CRAVITY is in a high rank followed by the Team Ranking.)

1341
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:17,579
- Well done. - My legs gave out just now.

1342
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,750
Top three!

1343
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:20,420
I'm in the top three!

1344
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,650
Thank goodness.

1345
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,650
Just the fact that I'm in the top three...

1346
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,719
makes me feel grateful.

1347
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:32,288
(YOUNITE is also in the top three in Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.)

1348
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,959
(We're proud of you, our ace.)

1349
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,300
I believed in you.

1350
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,900
He's in it.

1351
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:38,229
- Well done. - It's fine.

1352
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,598
I want to go home.

1353
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,598
- This is so tough. - There you go.

1354
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,639
(He's relaxed and now exhausted.)

1355
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:46,309
One of these three teams ranked first in the Ace Ranking.

1356
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,479
I think it's YOUNITE.

1357
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,880
Me too.

1358
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,849
Or it could be HWAN WOONG.

1359
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,579
HWAN WOONG had a bigger reaction on the site.

1360
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:55,919
If CRAVITY takes first place,

1361
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,849
- they take all the high points. - I know.

1362
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,289
Please reveal the final rankings of these three teams.

1363
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,789
All of them?

1364
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:05,090
Please.

1365
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,860
Please be first place.

1366
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,599
This is driving me insane.

1367
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,670
I'd like to place first.

1368
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,070
I want it.

1369
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:16,840
(Who's number 1 in Round 1's Ace Ranking?)

1370
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,610
(Ace Ranking 1st place, ONEUS, HWAN WOONG)

1371
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,479
(Too bad.)

1372
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
- Well done. - You did well, though.

1373
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,409
Third place?

1374
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,809
It's not bad.

1375
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,089
- Gosh. - I'm so proud of you, buddy.

1376
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,489
Great job.

1377
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,420
- He placed first last time too. - Yes.

1378
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,159
He's the number-one ace twice in a row.

1379
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:39,590
He's tough to beat.

1380
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,130
A lot of people...

1381
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:44,868
told me that I stood out as the ace member,

1382
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:46,099
so I'm glad.

1383
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,939
I hope to put our team...

1384
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,069
in first place next time.

1385
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,110
Thank you.

1386
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:52,409
Great.

1387
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,340
You're modest too.

1388
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,448
YOUNITE placed second in both Rankings.

1389
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:01,219
- That's a lot of points. - Right?

1390
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,189
I don't exactly feel bad. I'm just thankful.

1391
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,159
I'll do my part as the leader to the end.

1392
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,289
- Awesome! - That was great.

1393
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:13,059
It's a party for YOUNITE today.

1394
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,599
Now, here are the bottom four teams.

1395
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,829
HWI from THE NEW SIX,

1396
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,699
LEW from TEMPEST,

1397
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,099
YUN GYU from 8TURN,

1398
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:24,010
Seunghwan from The CrewOne.

1399
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,510
Now, please reveal the final rankings...

1400
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:29,809
of Round One's Ace Ranking.

1401
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,250
No pressure.

1402
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,809
You know that, right?

1403
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:36,349
I hope we placed higher than sixth.

1404
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:38,989
This is so nerve-racking.

1405
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,460
I was mad at myself,

1406
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,190
and I felt bad for my members.

1407
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,459
(Ace Ranking, bottom 4 teams)

1408
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,558
(HWI, LEW, YUN GYU, and Seunghwan)

1409
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:46,659
We were in trouble.

1410
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:49,059
Could I have placed last?

1411
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:52,900
But I doubt that we're last.

1412
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,739
I was hoping that we didn't place seventh,
even in the Ace Ranking.

1413
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,538
(Ace Ranking, bottom 4 teams)

1414
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:02,179
(HWI, LEW, Seunghwan, and YUN GYU)

1415
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,839
(HWI, 6,465 points)

1416
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,349
Gosh. That's a relief. Good job.

1417
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,118
(LEW, 6,025 points)

1418
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:09,819
- Still, you did well. - Well done.

1419
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,119
You're number one in my heart.

1420
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,919
(Jeong Seunghwan, 4,674 points)

1421
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,460
At least we're not last.

1422
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,190
- Did we place sixth in both? - Yes.

1423
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:18,889
We're always sixth.

1424
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:22,860
The point difference wasn't that big from seventh place.

1425
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,369
We really might be eliminated.

1426
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,699
But I am shocked...

1427
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:31,539
that 8TURN placed last in both of them.

1428
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:33,980
That's crazy.

1429
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,610
This is driving me crazy.

1430
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:39,079
(They placed 7th, which is last, in Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.)

1431
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,119
It hurts my pride so much.

1432
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,289
My heart aches today.

1433
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:50,590
(Staring)

1434
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,289
It's all right.

1435
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:53,829
I'm sorry.

1436
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,559
- No, don't say that. - No.

1437
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,730
- Hey, I told you not to say that. - No.

1438
01:04:58,469 --> 01:04:59,800
Never say that again.

1439
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:03,199
I was very frustrated.

1440
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,269
If other members...

1441
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,309
performed as the ace member,

1442
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,780
we might have different rankings. That was also on my mind.

1443
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,249
(Ace Ranking: ONEUS, YOUNITE, CRAVITY, THE NEW SIX, TEMPEST,)

1444
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,649
(The CrewOne, and 8TURN)

1445
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,150
(Team Ranking: CRAVITY, YOUNITE, THE NEW SIX, ONEUS, TEMPEST...)

1446
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:19,488
Here are the final rankings...

1447
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:20,718
of Round One's VS Mission.

1448
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:21,889
(Team Ranking, 1st, CRAVITY, Ace Ranking, 1st, ONEUS)

1449
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:24,130
First place in the Team Ranking is CRAVITY.

1450
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:27,800
First place in the Ace Ranking is ONEUS.

1451
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,329
I'm jealous. I hope they give us 500 points.

1452
01:05:31,329 --> 01:05:34,340
The number-1 team in Round 1 will obviously be given benefits.

1453
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,769
The number-one team gets benefits?

1454
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,469
- Okay. - There's more?

1455
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:39,069
The number-one team...

1456
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,379
(The number-1 team's benefit)

1457
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,750
gets to decide on the cue sheet for Round Two.

1458
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,420
The cue sheet!

1459
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,348
(Okay.)

1460
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:50,690
That's huge.

1461
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,719
The last team on the cue sheet placed first again.

1462
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,289
I'm jealous.

1463
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,058
I believe...

1464
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,030
it's a great power to decide on the cue sheet.

1465
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:01,198
You naturally forget...

1466
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:03,329
about the previous performances.

1467
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,329
But two teams placed first.

1468
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:09,239
(But there are 2 teams in 1st place, ONEUS and CRAVITY.)

1469
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,868
There's only one benefit,

1470
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:12,809
so we will have to determine the winner.

1471
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:15,409
- Are they having a battle? - No way.

1472
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:16,879
(Why? What is it?)

1473
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,179
Is it a battle?

1474
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,380
They're having the Ace Battle now?

1475
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,078
- Ace Battle? - Oh, the Ace Battle...

1476
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,518
No way!

1477
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,219
Please don't. Come on, Mnet!

1478
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,119
The ace members of the two teams,

1479
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,729
who brought victory,

1480
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:33,059
will have a single-round match...

1481
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,360
of the Ace Battle.

1482
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,598
(Is this really happening?)

1483
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,029
And the final winner...

1484
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,738
will decide on the cue sheet for Round Two.

1485
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:43,239
This is really happening.

1486
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:46,308
(Screaming)

1487
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:47,638
Mnet!

1488
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:48,879
(Furious)

1489
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,150
I feel like someone hit me in the back of my head.

1490
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,849
- First place and seventh place. - First place and seventh place.

1491
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,079
That's amazing.

1492
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,919
(After the Ace Battle in the Evaluation Match,)

1493
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,219
(the two aces had drastically different results.)

1494
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:03,658
- If HYEONGJUN wins this one, - Yes.

1495
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:05,659
- does he become the best? - It'll be a new history.

1496
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:08,230
HWAN WOONG has always placed first in Ace Battles.

1497
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:09,829
He's a tough one.

1498
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,229
Let's beat him once.

1499
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,729
It's about time.

1500
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,440
He's placed first enough.

1501
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,198
I'll win, while we're at it.

1502
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,509
- Please do. - Yes.

1503
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,739
You've got this.

1504
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,808
My team placed first,

1505
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:24,039
but I placed last as the ace member.

1506
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:28,280
I want to place 1st, not just be in the top 3.

1507
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:29,980
Good luck.

1508
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,989
- Go on. - Just have fun.

1509
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,549
We've decided on the cue sheet before.

1510
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,359
- Yes. It's not that important. - We got the benefit last time,

1511
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,718
so it's fine if I lose.

1512
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,158
- Get out there and win. - No?

1513
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,090
- Oh, come on. - Just have fun.

1514
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:41,899
If I'm being honest,

1515
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,698
I'm relieved that CRAVITY placed first.

1516
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,368
They chose us as rivals...

1517
01:07:47,369 --> 01:07:48,698
in the Evaluation Match...

1518
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:51,610
and placed last, so I was a bit upset.

1519
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,009
(In the Evaluation Match on the first day)

1520
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,339
(Which team would you like to defeat?)

1521
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,440
We choose...

1522
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,909
(CRAVITY chose ONEUS as the team they want to beat.)

1523
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,780
(I believe they're a high mountain that we'll once have to beat.)

1524
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,388
(We'll show you why we're...)

1525
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:06,449
(a high mountain.)

1526
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,420
(The two teams have had a war of nerves ever since.)

1527
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:12,029
(CRAVITY put ONEUS as the first team to perform...)

1528
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:13,988
(with its right to decide on the cue sheet.)

1529
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,029
(On pins and needles)

1530
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,099
(SERIM.)

1531
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,199
(Are you sure you can beat me in the Ace Battle?)

1532
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:23,170
(This is tough.)

1533
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,809
But they placed first,

1534
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:28,140
so it was clear to me which team to go for.

1535
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,039
I like that.

1536
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:33,979
(The ace members' single-match performance battle)

1537
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,750
(Their Ace Battle begins now.)

1538
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,889
- What? - What?

1539
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,118
They're both barefoot.

1540
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:41,988
- They're both barefoot? - Barefoot?

1541
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:43,390
Barefoot versus barefoot?

1542
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,889
They look similar.

1543
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:47,029
They're both wearing white too.

1544
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,560
How do they look so similar?

1545
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:51,999
It's crazy how they have similar themes.

1546
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,100
I got chills that we even have the same outfit.

1547
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:56,800
He looked similar, so I was nervous.

1548
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:00,140
What a quirk of fate.

1549
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:03,180
- This is interesting. - It's so interesting.

1550
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,250
This is so entertaining.

1551
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:06,909
It's always more fun to watch others fight.

1552
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,849
CRAVITY's ace member,

1553
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,519
HYEONGJUN, will perform first.

1554
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,118
- Okay! - Okay!

1555
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:14,659
Let's go!

1556
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,059
- HYEONGJUN! - No pressure.

1557
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,318
- Defeat him once. - Good luck.

1558
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,528
He's been in first place for too long.

1559
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,759
Do what you always do.

1560
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,929
He placed seventh last time,

1561
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,799
so he must have come thoroughly prepared this time.

1562
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,199
You shouldn't lose in this battle.

1563
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,930
- Why? - Because you'll lose your position.

1564
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,169
Going from 7th place to 1st place...

1565
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:29,640
is a great narrative, though.

1566
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:33,210
To redeem myself...

1567
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,079
as the ace member,

1568
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:38,948
I was determined to show everyone what I've got.

1569
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:40,680
I stepped in with spite.

1570
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,180
I meant to do my best.

1571
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:46,189
We're proud of you, HYEONGJUN.

1572
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,819
Thank you for always doing your best as the ace member.

1573
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,560
Let's go.

1574
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:56,260
Ace of CRAVITY.

1575
01:09:57,699 --> 01:09:58,799
Let's go!

1576
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,640
- Go, HYEONGJUN! - You can do this!

1577
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,340
But he doesn't have any props.

1578
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:05,539
I think he's only sticking to dancing.

1579
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,270
He's going head-to-head.

1580
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,609
I'm so nervous.

1581
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:11,108
Please.

1582
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:12,149
(Holding his hands tightly)

1583
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,119
("Dance With the Devil" by HYEONGJUN from CRAVITY)

1584
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:24,159
His body...

1585
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:18,279
So cool.

1586
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,590
- Nice! - Well done.

1587
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,419
- That was elegant. - So neat.

1588
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,420
Gosh.

1589
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:29,420
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1590
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:31,759
(Cheering)

1591
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,789
So cool!

1592
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,800
- He's very flexible. - He's a great dancer.

1593
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,460
His dancing lines are so neat.

1594
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:39,199
He turned into a totally different person.

1595
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:40,969
You killed it!

1596
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,500
Our little devil.

1597
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,068
He did so well.

1598
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:45,539
- Nice and neat. - Great job.

1599
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,478
I was worried about causing harm...

1600
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,149
to my team,

1601
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:53,909
but I was relieved...

1602
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:57,789
to know that I did my best and finished the performance well.

1603
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:01,159
I can't believe it's similar.

1604
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,060
He did contemporary dance, which was similar to ours.

1605
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:05,429
I thought, "That's too similar."

1606
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:08,600
"It might turn into a situation that we were worried about."

1607
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:12,470
The amount of pressure was certainly different.

1608
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:15,839
He's got props.

1609
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,938
(HWAN WOONG's props are brought on to the stage?)

1610
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:18,609
What's that? A sandcastle?

1611
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:19,635
What is that?

1612
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,710
What is it? A well?

1613
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:23,180
There's a flower inside.

1614
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,079
He came prepared.

1615
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:29,420
It literally cost him blood and sweat to prepare for this.

1616
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:31,390
I'm sure he'll do well.

1617
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,789
He's got confidence.

1618
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,159
He's obviously the ace.

1619
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,059
I can't wait to find out what he'll do.

1620
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,489
He was completely the Joker last time.

1621
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,760
But he's such a good dancer,

1622
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,359
so I'm excited.

1623
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,529
There was pressure,

1624
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,140
but I was confident.

1625
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,439
Ace of ONEUS.

1626
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,250
I am curious, though.

1627
01:12:58,779 --> 01:12:59,850
I wonder what it'll be.

1628
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,220
("Sovereign Shadows" by HWAN WOONG of ONEUS)

1629
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,789
It's the same. Contemporary dance.

1630
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,210
It's on his face.

1631
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,779
He's good.

1632
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:43,390
All right!

1633
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,409
- This is so shocking. - That's insane.

1634
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,210
It's not over yet.

1635
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:16,460
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1636
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,390
I got chills.

1637
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:24,529
(HWAN WOONG's performance ended with an intense ending.)

1638
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:27,130
(They can't help but get up.)

1639
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,640
That was legendary.

1640
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:30,699
My heart almost dropped.

1641
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,510
That was insane.

1642
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,470
How would anyone beat that?

1643
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,079
No way.

1644
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,479
What was that?

1645
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:39,680
Come on, HWAN WOONG!

1646
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,020
I'm proud of you!

1647
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:44,920
- He did so well. - He killed it.

1648
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,289
Well done.

1649
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,090
He actually gave his all.

1650
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:52,189
It was like he gave everything for this one performance.

1651
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:55,729
It wasn't a simple dance.
It was like a ceremony.

1652
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:00,329
HWAN WOONG.

1653
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:02,769
You would have been disappointed...

1654
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:03,939
if you hadn't gotten the chance to do this Ace Battle.

1655
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,538
He really would have been disappointed.

1656
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:10,039
Considering how much he prepared.

1657
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,079
How did he come up with that in such a short time?

1658
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:16,779
He had great ideas, and it was incredible.

1659
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:20,890
But I wonder where the gunpowder exploded.

1660
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,090
- Something exploded. What was that? - Right?

1661
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,028
How did he do that?

1662
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:27,489
He must have had a killer in front of him.

1663
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,129
(And one boy is attacked by the killer.)

1664
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:33,869
- Well done. - That was great.

1665
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:36,039
You also did well.

1666
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:37,840
The performance wasn't done only by myself, actually.

1667
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,669
KEON HEE pressed the button at the perfect time.

1668
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,409
(The hidden assistant)

1669
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:44,379
(KEON HEE got the gunpowder trigger right before the performance.)

1670
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,578
Cover it for now.

1671
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:46,579
Just hide it.

1672
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:47,810
Don't pay too much attention to it.

1673
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:49,118
I'm nervous.

1674
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,579
- Who? - Me.

1675
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,289
Don't be nervous. Get a grip.

1676
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,858
(That's how the hidden ace, KEON HEE, collaborated with him.)

1677
01:15:55,859 --> 01:15:56,890
There you go!

1678
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,889
(That was close.)

1679
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,759
- It was perfect timing. - It was perfect.

1680
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,100
(The hidden helper of the Ace Battle)

1681
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:05,800
The Ace Battle between CRAVITY and ONEUS has ended.

1682
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,969
The winner of the Ace Battle...

1683
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:11,438
will be determined by the Self-Evaluation...

1684
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:14,010
by the ones who watched these performances.

1685
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,408
I'm torn.

1686
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:17,340
I know, right? How should pick one?

1687
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:19,179
Only considering the dance,

1688
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,949
HYEONGJUN's performance was my type.

1689
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:22,880
I'm definitely choosing HWAN WOONG.

1690
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:26,889
(The 5 teams finished casting their votes.)

1691
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,390
(A total of 30 members voted.)

1692
01:16:28,659 --> 01:16:31,689
Now, I have the result of the vote.

1693
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,100
Which team will get the right to decide on the cue sheet?

1694
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,630
They were both so good, though.

1695
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,739
It was a nip-and-tuck match.

1696
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:43,399
Please announce the winner.

1697
01:16:43,569 --> 01:16:45,539
- I wonder who it is. - I'm scared.

1698
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,310
CRAVITY.

1699
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,809
ONEUS.

1700
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,408
(Who's the winner of the Ace Battle?)

1701
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:51,409
Gosh.

1702
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,249
What?

1703
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,250
(Startled)

1704
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,419
(Gasping)

1705
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,050
(To be continued shortly)

1706
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,789
Please announce the winner.

1707
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,829
- I wonder who it is. - I'm scared.

1708
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,659
CRAVITY.

1709
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:09,099
ONEUS.

1710
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,629
(Who's the winner of the Ace Battle?)

1711
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:11,670
Gosh.

1712
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:15,099
(Team Ranking, Ace Ranking)

1713
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,100
(Startled)

1714
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,709
(CRAVITY's HYEONGJUN, lose)

1715
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,239
(ONEUS's HWAN WOONG, win)

1716
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,478
(HWAN WOONG wins Round 1's Ace Battle.)

1717
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:28,318
- Hug me if you want. - No, thanks.

1718
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:29,550
(His teammates congratulate him who felt immense pressure.)

1719
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,220
That's fine.

1720
01:17:31,489 --> 01:17:32,890
He's still in first place.

1721
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,550
He'll forever be their ace.

1722
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,658
(CRAVITY's HYEONGJUN lost to HWAN WOONG.)

1723
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:40,229
- Well done. - You did so well, though.

1724
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:42,560
He won't step down from first place.

1725
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,328
Congratulations.

1726
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:45,728
By 6 to 24,

1727
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:47,499
(The result of the Self-Evaluation, 6 to 24)

1728
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,139
the right to decide on the cue sheet for Round Two...

1729
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,839
- It was 6 to 24. - goes to ONEUS.

1730
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,938
(ONEUS gets the right to draw the cue sheet in Round 2.)

1731
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:54,439
- By 6 to 24, - Wait.

1732
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,009
- the right to decide... - You're revealing the numbers too?

1733
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,249
on the cue sheet for Round Two...

1734
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,449
Even the number of votes.

1735
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:00,949
It was 6 to 24.

1736
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,219
Quadruple.

1737
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,578
(The math genius analyses the result with a cold heart.)

1738
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:04,579
Hey!

1739
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:06,890
Don't be so direct.

1740
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:09,020
My goal was to win first place,

1741
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:11,430
so you could call it a bummer.

1742
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:14,329
But I'm proud of myself...

1743
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,560
for performing only with my body...

1744
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,569
and going against HWAN WOONG.

1745
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,499
We're also proud of you.

1746
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,670
(Well done, our ace.)

1747
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:23,770
HWAN WOONG, you won. How do you feel?

1748
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,409
First, I'm exhilarated.

1749
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,938
It made me happy to win first place...

1750
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:30,109
in the name of ONEUS again.

1751
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:31,339
Thank you!

1752
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,680
(Powerful)

1753
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:35,318
(Cheering)

1754
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:36,319
That felt great.

1755
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,448
(He relieves all his tension.)

1756
01:18:38,449 --> 01:18:41,049
(Ace Ranking 1st place, ONEUS, HWAN WOONG)

1757
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,319
(ONEUS gets to decide on the cue sheet in Round 2.)

1758
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,390
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1759
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,728
Round Two.

1760
01:18:46,729 --> 01:18:48,829
- Already? - Just like that?

1761
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,728
Are you all wondering what the next mission is?

1762
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:52,329
- Yes! - Yes!

1763
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:53,869
It's our chance to climb up.

1764
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:55,139
We can turn it around...

1765
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,340
if we place first in the next mission.

1766
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:58,369
I will reveal it right away.

1767
01:18:58,510 --> 01:18:59,640
That's fast.

1768
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:01,579
What would the mission be?

1769
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,880
We're blessed by announcements today.

1770
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,478
The mission of Round Two is...

1771
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:07,349
(What's the mission in Round 2?)

1772
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,380
It is...

1773
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,019
Identity.

1774
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,318
- What? - Identity?

1775
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:14,350
Identity.

1776
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,589
Identity?

1777
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,819
What's Identity?

1778
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,228
- It's like who we are, right? - Yes.

1779
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:22,199
Well, we know what the word "identity" means.

1780
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,270
Identity in Round Two is a mission...

1781
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:29,139
in which you can show people your team's colour and identity...

1782
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,769
through your songs.

1783
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:33,739
Oh, we're using our songs.

1784
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:35,239
The story of the team.

1785
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:37,180
- A mission we're confident in. - Our colour.

1786
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:38,908
Aren't we at a disadvantage...

1787
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:42,679
if we have to portray our story?

1788
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,479
What should we show them?

1789
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:48,689
I believe it's going to be a fierce competition...

1790
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:51,630
because every team is performing with what they're most confident in.

1791
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:56,630
It'd be so embarrassing if you performed your own song poorly.

1792
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,699
We're participating with our own songs,

1793
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,500
so it's the main mission. We have to do better.

1794
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,038
There's a notification regarding the ace in Round Two.

1795
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:07,538
- What? - What is it?

1796
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:09,739
- Is there a new rule? - I guess there is.

1797
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,550
I don't feel so good about this.

1798
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:13,750
The ace in Round Two...

1799
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,720
The same person can't be the ace member?

1800
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,979
- Five aces? - None.

1801
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,618
- Two? - It's not just one.

1802
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:23,220
- Two aces? - You must pick two ace members.

1803
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,430
It never goes the way I expected.

1804
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,828
It's good for us, though.
We have a lot of members.

1805
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:31,000
- We have a lot to pick from. - Right.

1806
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,699
Then, half of us are ace members.

1807
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,100
(2 out of 5 members of ONEUS must perform as the ace members.)

1808
01:20:34,101 --> 01:20:35,869
- Half of us. - Half of us.

1809
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:38,969
It'll be difficult for both the aces to stand out.

1810
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,438
- Right. - Yes, that's the problem.

1811
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:41,779
Both of them need to stand out.

1812
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:45,800
Just like in Round 1, the points you'll get in Round 2...

1813
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,908
are 10,000 points from the Team Ranking...

1814
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,679
and 10,000 points from the Ace Ranking.

1815
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,020
There will be a total of 20,000 points.

1816
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,590
But there's a difference from Round One.

1817
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,590
What is it?

1818
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,760
I'm nervous.

1819
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,329
I hope it's advantageous for the bottom four teams.

1820
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,159
Please give us a chance to turn it around.

1821
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:06,300
After your performance in Round Two...

1822
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,630
No way.

1823
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,499
(Nervous)

1824
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,038
There will be a first elimination.

1825
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:14,069
Oh, my gosh.

1826
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:16,279
Already?

1827
01:21:16,609 --> 01:21:17,939
Oh, please.

1828
01:21:18,609 --> 01:21:20,449
- No! - Why does it feel so soon?

1829
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:22,750
It's suffocating.

1830
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:25,849
The elimination candidates will be determined...

1831
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,689
by the accumulated points from Rounds 1 and 2.

1832
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:31,090
The seventh-place team in the Team Ranking...

1833
01:21:31,789 --> 01:21:33,589
and the seventh-place team in the Ace Ranking...

1834
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:34,728
according to the final outcome...

1835
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:36,060
Oh, the final outcome.

1836
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:38,529
Those two teams will be elimination candidates.

1837
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:40,430
No way. Another Ace Battle?

1838
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,270
Those two teams will compete.

1839
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:46,810
The team to be eliminated will be determined by the Ace Battle.

1840
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,840
It's literally an elimination battle.

1841
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:53,380
Everything is determined by the ace members.

1842
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:56,079
It must be a huge pressure for the ace members.

1843
01:21:56,449 --> 01:21:58,520
Imagine the pressure.

1844
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,590
We should really grit our teeth. Elimination is on the line.

1845
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,260
That's insane.

1846
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,328
The Ace Battle in Round Two is...

1847
01:22:05,329 --> 01:22:06,858
- an elimination match. - Right.

1848
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:09,328
- So, it's so significant. - Right.

1849
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:11,099
You're responsible for the team's elimination.

1850
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,300
We should pick one carefully.

1851
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:15,469
If the same team placed seventh...

1852
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,699
in the Ace Ranking and Team Ranking,

1853
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,970
there will not be an Ace Battle.

1854
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,279
(Surprised)

1855
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:25,609
You will be eliminated immediately.

1856
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:28,979
They're so cruel.

1857
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:31,920
- They could be the same. - That was the case this time.

1858
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:34,319
8TURN must be so scared of Round Two.

1859
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,520
I bet they'll go all out.

1860
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:39,260
- I can't even talk to 8TURN. - Seriously.

1861
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:41,729
They might make it if they give it their all.

1862
01:22:42,199 --> 01:22:43,260
We need to cheer up!

1863
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,100
We've got nowhere to go but up.

1864
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:47,930
Let's take back our first place.

1865
01:22:48,739 --> 01:22:51,369
We placed seventh in not one but two rankings.

1866
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:55,108
So, I couldn't stop thinking that we might be eliminated...

1867
01:22:55,109 --> 01:22:57,979
if we don't get into the top three.

1868
01:22:58,109 --> 01:23:01,449
We're going to bet our life and death this time.

1869
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:04,520
The CrewOne's score isn't that different.

1870
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,350
We're the same, though.

1871
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,719
We're the most in danger.

1872
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,959
(The CrewOne in 6th place is in danger of elimination.)

1873
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,419
You're right. It's the accumulated point,

1874
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,729
so it could be us.

1875
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:14,689
If we don't belong in the top three next,
we'll be eliminated.

1876
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,460
- We need to win this time. - We could be eliminated too.

1877
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:20,899
Let's risk everything in Round Two.

1878
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,199
It might as well be our last one.

1879
01:23:24,683 --> 01:23:26,210
Our goal in Round Two is definitely the top three.

1880
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:29,010
I believe that we should go all out.

1881
01:23:29,109 --> 01:23:32,510
THE NEW SIX has a powerful identity.

1882
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:34,079
We're actually confident this time.

1883
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,519
We need to consider...

1884
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,078
the chemistry between the members and the ace members.

1885
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,750
We're going to need a good strategy.

1886
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:43,590
We'll stand our ground and climb up with tenacity.

1887
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,859
(A few days after Round 1)

1888
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,500
(The CrewOne's practice room)

1889
01:23:50,729 --> 01:23:53,029
(The members are warming up before practice.)

1890
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,600
- Pay attention, please. - Okay.

1891
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:01,439
There's an important announcement regarding Round Two.

1892
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,209
What's that?

1893
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:05,310
Is there a change?

1894
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,310
What is it about?

1895
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,310
(The members of ONEUS are also curious.)

1896
01:24:08,979 --> 01:24:10,649
- It's pretty thick. - Is it an allowance?

1897
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,250
We worked hard on the show,

1898
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,449
so they finally paid us.

1899
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:15,789
(Laughing)

1900
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,059
- I'm so thankful. - Count the envelopes.

1901
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,060
Six, right?

1902
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:20,889
- Let's go! - Oh, gosh.

1903
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:21,899
- What? - Let's see.

1904
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
What is this?

1905
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,430
- What is it? - It looks cool.

1906
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,800
That's amazing.

1907
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:30,769
We will reveal one of the two aces of other teams.

1908
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:31,810
(One of the two aces of all the other teams will be revealed.)

1909
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,840
(They were notified of the rules for Round 2's aces.)

1910
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:35,978
(You must pick...)

1911
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:37,539
(not one but two ace members.)

1912
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:38,810
(Unlike in the previous round,)

1913
01:24:38,811 --> 01:24:41,310
(there will be 2 ace members in Round 2.)

1914
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:43,778
(There are 2 ace members,)

1915
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,520
(so there's likely to be a new ace.)

1916
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:47,220
I did not see that coming.

1917
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:49,089
Our aces must have been...

1918
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,318
- revealed too. - No way.

1919
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:53,159
I'm sure our ace members are the least known.

1920
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,100
I can't figure out YOUNITE.

1921
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:59,228
- I can't predict who they chose. - I have no clue.

1922
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:01,369
It's a great opportunity to analyse their strategy.

1923
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,769
You're right. We might be able to predict...

1924
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,369
- which song they chose. - We might.

1925
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,010
- I see. - Right.

1926
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:08,939
Shouldn't we check out the number-one team, then?

1927
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,478
- ONEUS? - Should we take a look?

1928
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:11,479
- Let's see. - The number-one ace.

1929
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,250
Whose team are you the most curious about?

1930
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,549
- The number-one team. - Me too.

1931
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,579
- ONEUS. - ONEUS.

1932
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:18,148
The team we're most curious about.

1933
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:21,249
Let's check out ONEUS,
the recent number-one ace's team.

1934
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,288
- Yes. - All right.

1935
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:23,759
Should we check out ONEUS first?

1936
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,020
- Okay. - Yes, ONEUS.

1937
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:28,799
Why would you reveal our strength without our permission?

1938
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,828
(Who's one of the aces in ONEUS?)

1939
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:32,929
My guess is HWAN WOONG again.

1940
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:36,068
He's been winning Ace Battles.

1941
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:37,069
They need to maintain their place.

1942
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,669
(Will it be HWAN WOONG's 3rd time as the ace member?)

1943
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,538
It also makes me think, "I doubt he'll do it again."

1944
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:42,353
Right. Me too.

1945
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:44,038
I wonder who else will be the ace.

1946
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:46,509
I have a feeling it's SEO HO.

1947
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,510
SEO HO.

1948
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,380
My guess is SEO HO.

1949
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,148
He's known to be a good singer,

1950
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:55,188
- and he's very acrobatic. - Right.

1951
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:56,189
That's true.

1952
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,929
(Fancy acrobatics...)

1953
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:01,489
(and great singing skills, SEO HO)

1954
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:02,960
- Shall we take a look? - Okay.

1955
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:09,100
- We knew it was him. - As we expected.

1956
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:11,399
- Open it. - Okay.

1957
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,368
- I knew it. - I knew it.

1958
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,079
- I knew it. - I knew it.

1959
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:18,778
- Three times? That's tough. - Wouldn't he be tired by now?

1960
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:20,679
Is it like, "I'll protect my team?"

1961
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,579
- I bet. - He's too much, though.

1962
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:25,519
How could he be the ace three times in a row?

1963
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,749
(HWAN WOONG is constantly their ace...)

1964
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,789
(from the Evaluation Match to Round 2.)

1965
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,420
But he won first place every time he competed.

1966
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,688
- It's a monopoly. - This is too much.

1967
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:34,359
It shows how confident he is.

1968
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,328
That makes me wonder...

1969
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:37,729
- who the other one is. - Right.

1970
01:26:37,829 --> 01:26:40,228
The important thing is who will perform with him.

1971
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:41,229
Exactly.

1972
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:44,000
(ONEUS' aces in Round 2, HWAN WOONG...)

1973
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,339
Next team, 8TURN.

1974
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,438
- I'm so curious about this one too. - This is a tough one.

1975
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,810
8TURN's rankings have been fluctuating.

1976
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:51,380
They went from first place to last place.

1977
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:52,909
It plummeted.

1978
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:55,579
Should we check out The CrewOne,
who's right above us?

1979
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,179
(Team Ranking and Ace Ranking)

1980
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,688
(The CrewOne and 8TURN are the bottom 2 teams...)

1981
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:01,319
(in Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.)

1982
01:27:01,489 --> 01:27:04,459
They're really going to grit their teeth this time.

1983
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,159
They might be eliminated if they do poorly.

1984
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,228
Their aces have a huge responsibility.

1985
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,430
- It must be a lot of pressure. - More so than other aces.

1986
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:13,869
8TURN's ace.

1987
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:15,739
- I bet it's the leader. - JAE YUN.

1988
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:16,939
That's a good guess.

1989
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:20,709
When I look at 8TURN, I still remember...

1990
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:21,938
MYUNG HO's performance in the Ace Battle.

1991
01:27:21,939 --> 01:27:23,709
It was impressive.

1992
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:24,809
It certainly was.

1993
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:26,948
- The CrewOne's... - It has to be Junseok.

1994
01:27:26,949 --> 01:27:28,380
It should be Junseok.

1995
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:29,919
I bet it's him.

1996
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,319
I can already hear it.

1997
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,590
"Junseok!"

1998
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:36,219
Then, Jimin will have to...

1999
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,459
- compete again. - He'll compete once again.

2000
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,959
(Lim Jimin, 2nd place in the Evaluation Match Ace Battle)

2001
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,630
I think it actually is him.

2002
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,100
Should I open it?

2003
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:45,059
- Yes, open it. - Let's go.

2004
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,970
- Shall we take a look, then? - Go.

2005
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:48,470
If it's those two...

2006
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,039
The members of 8TURN will grit their teeth this time.

2007
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,310
I can't wait to find out.

2008
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:54,409
(Oh Junseok, MYUNG HO)

2009
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,880
- MYUNG HO is competing again. - The energy...

2010
01:27:58,079 --> 01:27:59,079
That's tough.

2011
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,278
Are you worried about 8TURN?

2012
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:01,680
(Are you worried about 8TURN's ace members?)

2013
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,520
Not really.

2014
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,520
(Great confidence)

2015
01:28:05,521 --> 01:28:06,889
We have to win this time.

2016
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:08,419
- You're right. - We have to.

2017
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,220
I believe that Round Two...

2018
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,229
is a 1-on-1 match against 8TURN.

2019
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:14,329
I agree.

2020
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,158
Our scores are similar, so it has to be that way.

2021
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,130
If we lose to 8TURN,

2022
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:20,600
we're more likely to be eliminated.

2023
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:23,369
(The CrewOne's aces in Round 2, Oh Junseok...)

2024
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:26,170
(8TURN's aces in Round 2, MYUNG HO...)

2025
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:28,509
The team that earned similar votes as us.

2026
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,078
- YOUNITE. - YOUNITE.

2027
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:31,978
They placed second in both.
It's a tough team to beat.

2028
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:33,779
- I think it's EUNSANG again. - EUNSANG.

2029
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,448
One of the bottom four in the Evaluation Match.

2030
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:38,618
(They went from one of the bottom 4 teams to the top 3 teams.)

2031
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,149
We went up in one mission.

2032
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,059
He experienced the thrill from designing it like a play.

2033
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,060
Right.

2034
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:45,158
(Addicted to the thrill)

2035
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:46,828
I think he'll do the same.

2036
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:47,829
I do too.

2037
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:49,800
- Should we check it out? - Let's go.

2038
01:28:50,229 --> 01:28:51,859
Come on out, EUNSANG!

2039
01:28:53,229 --> 01:28:55,269
As expected.

2040
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,868
As soon as they see EUNSANG's name,

2041
01:28:56,869 --> 01:28:58,839
they may think, "Will it be another intense one?"

2042
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,938
Right. Like, "They're at it again."

2043
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:01,068
"They're up to something again."

2044
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,109
"What is it this time?"

2045
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,680
But we have a surprise for them.

2046
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:07,079
(YOUNITE's aces in Round 2, EUNSANG...)

2047
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,119
- CRAVITY. - CRAVITY, it is.

2048
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:12,520
I wish that they would perform "Love or Die."

2049
01:29:12,649 --> 01:29:13,649
I'd like that.

2050
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:14,649
(I want to see that too.)

2051
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,289
TAEYOUNG's part in "Love or Die" by CRAVITY...

2052
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:17,920
looks so cool.

2053
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:19,828
(Is TAEYOUNG their ace if they're singing "Love or Die?")

2054
01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:20,988
THE NEW SIX.

2055
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:22,828
- I think they'll do "Love or Die." - "Love or Die?"

2056
01:29:22,829 --> 01:29:24,898
They couldn't perform as a whole team for "Love or Die."

2057
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:27,028
(They were a member short during "Love or Die.")

2058
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:28,328
Because JUNHYEOK couldn't perform,

2059
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:31,600
I assume they'll take this chance to do "Love or Die."

2060
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:33,738
I hope CRAVITY battles...

2061
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:35,510
- THE NEW SIX with "Love or Die." - Me too.

2062
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:37,439
- With the same song? - It's my wish.

2063
01:29:37,579 --> 01:29:39,749
Honestly, I want to see both groups perform "Love or Die."

2064
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,810
It'll be like do or die.

2065
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:44,249
(Next week, THE NEW SIX versus CRAVITY)

2066
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,949
(Who will win the "Love or Die" battle?)

2067
01:29:46,989 --> 01:29:48,619
Which group will know our ace first?

2068
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:50,719
- Let's see. - I bet it's HYEONGJUN.

2069
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,759
(CRAVITY's revealed ace, TAEYOUNG)

2070
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,288
- I knew it. - Right?

2071
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:56,199
His performance was amazing.

2072
01:29:56,729 --> 01:29:59,068
TAEYOUNG is predictable.

2073
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:00,769
Let's teach him a lesson this time.

2074
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,170
- Nice. - Yes.

2075
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:05,908
Do they know our team's ace?

2076
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:07,670
- Yes, they know it's JUNHYEOK. - Yes.

2077
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,709
They must tense up.

2078
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:10,810
- Right. - Totally.

2079
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:13,510
(CRAVITY's aces in Round 2, TAEYOUNG...)

2080
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:16,180
(THE NEW SIX's aces in Round 2, JUNHYEOK...)

2081
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,179
- We've got one left. - The last one.

2082
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,319
As for TEMPEST...

2083
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,788
I predict it'll be HYUK.

2084
01:30:21,789 --> 01:30:23,188
- Same here. - Right?

2085
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:24,259
(1st candidate, main vocalist HYUK)

2086
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:26,228
HYUK is a great dancer.

2087
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:27,959
- I think it'll be HANBIN again. - Me too.

2088
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,399
HANBIN will be one of the aces.

2089
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,930
The ace of TEMPEST is...

2090
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,828
(TEMPEST's revealed ace)

2091
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:36,339
- HYUK. - I knew it'd be him.

2092
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,969
He's a new ace.

2093
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:40,869
The main vocalist is the ace.

2094
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:43,079
HYUK might kill us all with his singing.

2095
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:44,978
TEMPEST needs to perform a refreshing stage.

2096
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:46,949
Their intense performance was beaten to a pulp by us.

2097
01:30:47,409 --> 01:30:49,380
(The VS Mission winning team's confidence)

2098
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:52,119
(TEMPEST performed a powerful stage for the Stray Kids Match.)

2099
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:54,590
(But THE NEW SIX won.)

2100
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,020
It'll be interesting.

2101
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,420
(Let's wait and see.)

2102
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,260
- You can do it, right? - Of course.

2103
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:02,199
(TEMPEST's aces in Round 2, HYUK...)

2104
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,528
(Round 2 Revealed Ace Lineup)

2105
01:31:03,529 --> 01:31:04,799
(HWAN WOONG, Junseok, MYUNG HO, EUNSANG)

2106
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,000
(TAEYOUNG, JUNHYEOK, HYUK)

2107
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,699
Everyone is a strong opponent.

2108
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,199
It's like the teams are using their killer moves.

2109
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,438
We'll do well.

2110
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:13,839
- I agree. - I'm confident.

2111
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,539
Having to battle against them will be scary.

2112
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:18,739
I'm happy they're in our team.

2113
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,510
Are they worthy as your opponent?

2114
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:23,220
(I'm not too sure about that.)

2115
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,419
What's important is who their partner will be.

2116
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:27,989
It'll be someone who has proved himself to be talented.

2117
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,359
They'll knock us all out.

2118
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:32,158
Get eliminated, and Round Three...

2119
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,460
Advancing to it is impossible.

2120
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,630
We must perform.

2121
01:31:34,631 --> 01:31:37,029
(Who are the other 6 aces to help avoid the 1st elimination?)

2122
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:40,329
(The bright morning of Round 2 has come.)

2123
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:42,369
(The winner of Round 1, CRAVITY is here!)

2124
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:43,840
(The air to work sure is nice.)

2125
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,669
(8TURN, who didn't get any sleep, has come, too.)

2126
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:46,810
(Sizzling)

2127
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:48,770
(Round 2: Identity)

2128
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:50,709
(Decided by ONEUS, the winner of the Ace Battle)

2129
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,710
(Revealing Round 2's cue sheet)

2130
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,380
(What?)

2131
01:31:54,381 --> 01:31:55,880
(For real?)

2132
01:31:56,949 --> 01:31:58,349
(Seriously?)

2133
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,049
(It was set by ONEUS.)

2134
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:01,288
(This is mean.)

2135
01:32:01,289 --> 01:32:02,919
(The cue sheet was up to the winner.)

2136
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,559
(This is a competition!)

2137
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,988
(8TURN in 7th place is going 1st?)

2138
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:08,528
(To finish them once and for all.)

2139
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:10,158
(It could be their last performance.)

2140
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,800
(A team will be eliminated in Round 2.)

2141
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,169
We never die.

2142
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,528
(We will not budge...)

2143
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:15,868
(from 1st place.)

2144
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:18,039
(Look. This is the spirit of the 1st place.)

2145
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,238
(We'll show you the one...)

2146
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:21,209
(taking first place is scarier...)

2147
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:22,380
(than the one protecting it!)

2148
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,938
(Like we'll let you take it!)

2149
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:25,948
(Stunned)

2150
01:32:25,949 --> 01:32:27,849
(8TURN who dropped from 1st to 7th place)

2151
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:29,618
(CRAVITY who rose from 7th to 1st place)

2152
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:32,219
(The prelude of Round 2 is unpredictable.)

2153
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,689
(He came out of the casket.)

2154
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:36,920
(From intense performance with their survival at stake...)

2155
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:41,430
(to a refreshing stage)

2156
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:48,869
(A more fierce performance battle)

2157
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,139
(And)

2158
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,169
(Battling with songs of the same title)

2159
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:52,170
(THE NEW SIX versus CRAVITY)

2160
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,739
(Shocked)

2161
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,209
(It's a mirror battle.)

2162
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:57,079
(Was ONEUS after this?)

2163
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:59,149
(What I said has become a reality.)

2164
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,909
(This match will also be entertaining.)

2165
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:02,149
(For this joy)

2166
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,818
I pat myself on the back for planning out this fun picture.

2167
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:06,149
(What is the big picture of Round 2 ONEUS intended?)
