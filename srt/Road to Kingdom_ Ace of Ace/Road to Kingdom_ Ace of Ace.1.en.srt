(Finally, Road to Kingdom begins.)

11

(Road to Kingdom has become intenser with the Ace Ranking.)

(Even if the team is in the lower ranking, )

15
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,879
(I see why they said, "Ace of Ace.")

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,548

(I thought he was the devil.)

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,600

(All I want is winning.)

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,980
(We'd like to prove ourselves by our performance.)

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,149

What do you love about idol stars?

35
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,769
The trust that they'll figure it out no matter what happens.

36
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,640
That trust makes boys strong.

37
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,708
- I want to make... - An unforgettable...

38
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,878
- A perfect performance... - That people want to rewatch.

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,548

Behind the most shining moments,

42
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,790
there are times of tears...

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,459
and sweat.

44
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,290
There must be stories we couldn't tell the world.

45
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,760
Our group's position is honestly a bit uncertain.

46
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,830
I honestly don't think I know where exactly we are.

47
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,068
I don't feel our performances so far have been very memorable.

48
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,370
I had some mixed feelings and was quite regretful.

49
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,709
"The team expected to be last, YOUNITE."

50
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,650
We still don't have a distinct color.

51
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,080
I hope we can leave an impression in people's minds.

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,250
I didn't think of any careers other than becoming an idol star.

53
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,049
What could I do?

54
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,889
I think this is our last chance.

55
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:34,159
Don't most idols peak in their seventh year?

56
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,089
I want to show people that that unspoken rule...

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,830
is wrong.

58
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,228
It's our chance to show people who we are.

59
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:41,598

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,429

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,878
I thought he was truly evil.

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,819
- No way! - Don't break down.

69
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,489

It's not a seat just anyone can sit in.

104

- We're near the top. - They evaluated us very nicely.

133
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,720
We're so lucky.

134
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,620

(The members leave their leader and head to the team seat.)

148
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,220
Sitting there alone felt so weird.

149
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,720
I was so nervous.

150
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,319
This is our seat.

151
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,360

Look serious.

157
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,730
Okay.

158
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,568
We have to get the upper hand.

159
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,670
Get the upper hand.

We think we're the lowest of all of the teams on the show.

We don't have anything to lose, so let's gain a lot from being here.

00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,059
(Looking around the studio after introducing themselves)

183
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,689
A camera is moving around here.

184
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,360
- The camera is moving on its own. - How fascinating.

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
(Gathering around)

186
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:06,999
It moves very well.

187
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,299
(With an average age of 21.1, even moving cameras fascinate them.)

188
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
YOUNITE.

189
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
(Meanwhile, they're in serious observation mode.)

190
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:11,499
They all have different hair colors.

191
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,539
- Look. - Hello.

192
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,969
- There are so many cameras. - Hello.

193
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,540
They have all of the colors we have.

194
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,540
Blue-black, red.

195
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,008
(Thinking carefully)

196
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,878
We can each take on one person.

197
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,079
What do you mean?

198
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,919
You're already in competition mode.

199
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
(Laughing)

200
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,318
We'll read your facial expression.

201
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,550
Take a look.

202
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,649
Should I look at it now?

203
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,790
- Now? - Now.

204
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,088
Tell us by your facial expression.

205
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,258
(What rank did the other teams...)

206
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,730
(predict YOUNITE will get in the Evaluation Match?)

207
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,229
(He checks the card...)

208
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,370
(and laughs?)

209
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,999
(Putting his brain in full gear)

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,170
- What? - What?

211
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,539
I don't know either.

212
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,769
- What was written there? - I don't know.

213
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,039
Oh, no.

214
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,879
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

215
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,708
- Was it too quick? - Oh, really?

216
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,219
(Not hearing anyone)

217
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,250
Really?

218
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,318
(YOUNITE’s expected ranking for the Evaluation Match, 7th)

219
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,620
The other teams ranked us at the very bottom.

220
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,829
Right. They're all competing against us.

221
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,528
I felt a fire rise in me.

222
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,359
Fine. I'll prove it to everyone.

223
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,500
(I'll provide it to everyone!)

224
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,529
(With EUNSANG's resolution, YOUNITE take their seats.)

225
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

226
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,139
(Feeling uneasy)

227
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,740
So... What rank did you get?

228
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,648
I'm a bit angry.

229
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,778
(Serious)

230
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,949
- Oh, really? - Yes.

231
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm very angry.

232
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,190
I really...

233
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I really...

234
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,759
will be serious from now on.

235
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,229
Okay.

236
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,489
I'm getting so angry all of a sudden.

237
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,690
Why?

238
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,500
- He's angry? - His hair is red.

239
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,469
I'm getting so angry all of a sudden.

240
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,499
Suddenly?

241
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,169
Oh, no. All of a sudden.

242
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,470
I'm so angry.

243
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,168
(Avoiding eye contact)

244
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,370
I think I know. That must be the expected ranking.

245
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,710
- Is it the expected ranking? - Yes.

246
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,639
The atmosphere...

247
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,649
suddenly changed.

248
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,779
- Seriously. - Isn't it too heavy?

249
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,289
(To lighten up the heavy atmosphere, )

250
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,048
(the third team appears!)

251
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,258
(THE NEW SIX who will challenge and grow together)

252
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,320
Hello.

253
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,759
- THE NEW SIX. - PSY's group.

254
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,700
I have to say... PSY.

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,758
- Our CEO is PSY. - CEO PSY.

256
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,769
Yes.

257
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,029
(Discovered and produced by the global star PSY, )

258
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,168
(THE NEW SIX became 2022's biggest rising stars.)

259
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:29,109
When people hear that PSY is producing an idol group,

260
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,840
they must have high expectations.

261
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,408
But honestly, I don't think...

262
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,950
we've had great results after we debuted.

263
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:39,819
We'll show you how great our performances are...

264
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,950
through Road to Kingdom.

265
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,120
Honestly, I'm not very confident.

266
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:45,460
That we'll lose.

267
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,789
We can't ask what it is, right?

268
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,500
How did you feel when you saw that?

269
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,999
- How did you feel? - We just...

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,028
- Just? - Yes.

271
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,668
(Playing it safe behind a smoke screen)

272
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:57,769
I kind of...

273
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,239
(Eyes sparkling)

274
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
I kind of got angry.

275
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,669
- Angry? - Angry?

276
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,610
He got angry.

277
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,779
Why?

278
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,850
It made me kind of angry with you guys too.

279
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,889
- No way. - What is it?

280
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,249
(Asking quietly)

281
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,659
You're very upset.

282
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,059
It's fury.

283
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,029
Keep your hands in a polite position.

284
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,898
(What number is written in THE NEW SIX's card?)

285
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,600
I think he's looking at it. Look at his facial expression.

286
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,099
(Curious)

287
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,840
What's written in there?

288
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,339
(What does his smile mean? Surprise? Relief?)

289
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,110
That's a very happy smile.

290
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,309
- I think he's pretty satisfied. - I think he's pretty satisfied.

291
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,220
- How do you feel? - Are you angry?

292
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
No. Just...

293
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,950
(Just?)

294
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,019
As I expected.

295
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,489
As you expected?

296
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,659
- Okay? - Okay.

297
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
- Expected? - What is it?

298
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,058
As he expected?

299
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,158
I'm curious about the other teams' expected rankings.

300
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,159
Seriously.

301
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,459
(Did THE NEW SIX get a high ranking...)

302
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,799
(as they confidently predicted?)

303
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,199
(The fourth team enters into the tense room.)

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Who's next?

305
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,570
TEMPEST.

306
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:06,669
Yes.

307
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,908
(A pure and fresh group that is always improving, TEMPEST)

308
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,579
- Hello. - Hello.

309
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,940
- He's so tall. - Hello.

310
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,809
I'm so jealous of his height.

311
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,649
They're like princes.

312
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,250
Royalty? Nobility?

313
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,720
They have that vibe.

314
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,450
(Making an impression with their radiating, prince-like looks)

315
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,320
(They showed up in the music scene in 2022 like a strong storm.)

316
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,159
(A powerful and fresh group with unlimited potential, TEMPEST)

317
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,158
When we first debuted, we won the rookie award,

318
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,000
and we got a lot of attention as well.

319
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,699
But currently, I don't think TEMPEST...

320
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,840
has accomplished very much.

321
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,610
I think it's correct to say that we're in an uncertain position.

322
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,378
I hope we can show people everything we have on Road to Kingdom,

323
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,538
make an impression,

324
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,178
and become legends.

325
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,450
- We can do it. - I like it!

326
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,779
(While they were going to their seats, )

327
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,450
(one member caught DEY's eyes.)

328
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,590
He's pretty. He had very pretty lines.

329
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,288
(I'm going to win.)

330
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,559
(Just before, he was so into the competition.)

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,289
(But he forgot about all of that and fell for EUNCHAN.)

332
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,899
He's outstanding. He is.

333
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,570
(His looks make people forget about the competition.)

334
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,699
He looks like he came from another world.

335
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
(Praising him endlessly)

336
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,440
It was as if there was a light behind him.

337
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,069
He moved my heart.

338
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,509
(DEY's heart moves to EUNCHAN.)

339
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:18,878
- Hello. - Hello.

340
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,278
(TEMPEST's LEW takes a seat at the leaders' table.)

341
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,049
You can check that card by yourself.

342
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,849
I see.

343
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,450
(LEW opens the card right away.)

344
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,289
(What is TEMPEST's expected ranking for the Evaluation Match?)

345
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,019
(Puzzled)

346
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,259
Could you tell us how you feel?

347
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,428
Just how you feel.

348
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,590
- How I feel? - Just how you feel.

349
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,700
I feel a bit weird.

350
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,059
Weird?

351
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,330
I'm jealous that you feel weird.

352
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
He's been quite upset since earlier.

353
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,570
I don't know, to be honest.

354
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,878
Something felt wrong.

355
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,879
(The expected ranking of TEMPEST is 6th out of 7 teams.)

356
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,950
It was horrible.

357
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:01,019
It hurt my pride.

358
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,990
His ears became a little red.

359
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,059
Yes. He doesn't look happy.

360
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,460
(Serious)

361
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,528
His expression is so cute. What do I do?

362
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,159
Look at that. His ears are becoming red.

363
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,529
LEW.

364
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,269
- What is it? - I don't know.

365
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,970
Menu? Is it a menu for dinner?

366
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,909
The members were very bright.

367
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,570
I thought it was nice they were bright,

368
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,639
but I felt like I was the only one who was serious.

369
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,149
Hey, how should we appear?

370
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,019
- With spirits. - Politely.

371
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,149
We should speak formally to our seniors.

372
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,450
We should be cute and polite.

373
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,289
(Who are these boys who are serious about how they enter the show?)

374
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,389
- 8TURN. - 8TURN.

375
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,929
- 8TURN! - 8TURN!

376
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:42,659
What's with their energy?

377
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,889
- 8TURN, we got this! - 8TURN, we got this!

378
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,629
(8TURN is an 8-member boy band that debuted in 2023.)

379
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,999
(With their flawless performances, )

380
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,970
(they came to take over Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace!)

381
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,139
The CEO was like, "Guys, it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance for us!"

382
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,710
"Guys, it's your chance to show them who you are!"

383
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,209
As a group, we're charming,

384
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,309
- good-looking, - Gosh.

385
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,350
- cute, and great performers. - Yes.

386
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,789
But not many people know us yet.

387
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,388
Then we can use this opportunity to let people know who we are.

388
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,620
Without any ranks.

389
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,519
(That's a statement.)

390
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,528
- Even if we barely make it. - Let's not get eliminated.

391
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:16,529
Let's do it.

392
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,960
Our seniors, you should be nervous. We, the youngest ones, are coming.

393
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
We'll show a performance with young spirits.

394
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,000
Whose turn?

395
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:25,769
8TURN.

396
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,969
(Special note: They listen to their leader only.)

397
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,710
It's effective only when the leader says it.

398
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,239
(8TURN made a confident statement.)

399
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,439
Thank you in advance.

400
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,980
The guy with bleached hair has great abs.

401
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,710
They look like a bar of chocolate.

402
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,720
(Impressed)

403
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,820
- They're so defined. - Oh, my gosh.

404
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,789
- Show them too. - What?

405
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,859
- I can't. I don't. - You don't have abs?

406
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
(Not anyone has it.)

407
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,590
- Shall we greet them together? - It sounds good.

408
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,158
- Oh, my. - Oh, gosh.

409
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,189
What's going on?

410
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,199
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, gosh.

411
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,528
- Please take good care of us! - Please take good care of us!

412
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,969
- Please take good care of us. - Please take good care of us.

413
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,600
I thought they would say, "Bring it on."

414
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,768
- Oh, my. - Oh, gosh.

415
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,070
- Please take good care of us! - Please take good care of us!

416
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,308
- Relax. - You got this.

417
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,339
Good luck.

418
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,538
- Please take good care of us! - Please take good care of us!

419
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,850
Is this the charm of rookies? Is this the charm of younger boys?

420
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,179
- Hello. - Hello.

421
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,019
Take a look and just tell me how you feel about it.

422
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,820
How do I feel? Is there anything written here that might upset me?

423
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,759
It could make you feel good or bad.

424
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,799
(JAE YUN carefully opens the card.)

425
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,830
(What is the ranking of 8TURN, the youngest group on the show?)

426
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,370
(Their expected ranking in the Evaluation Match is 5th.)

427
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,549
It felt like we were labeled as the 5th place.

428
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
How is it?

429
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:47,850
- I don't think it's good. - Really?

430
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:49,919
It's not good?

431
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,489
I thought we shouldn't let them think we're not good...

432
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,529
just because we're the youngest.

433
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:55,629
Okay.

434
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,700
(Glancing)

435
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,258
(Silent)

436
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,169
Shall we all shake hands together?

437
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
- Shall we shake hands? - Shall we shake hands?

438
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It's nice to meet you.

439
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,768
Are they shaking hands? Let's do it too.

440
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,168
(He hurriedly suggests EUNSANG shaking hands.)

441
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,710
Can we do that?

442
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,809
Sorry?

443
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,580
What? Was I refused?

444
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,450
- What? - He was refused.

445
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,449
(The members of YOUNITE are also flustered.)

446
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,990
We shouldn't do that now.

447
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,090
Okay.

448
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:31,459
They all must've picked us as the last place.

449
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,429
It's not time for us to be friends.

450
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,570
- Here they are. - Who is it?

451
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,299
The CrewOne.

452
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,340
- I'm curious about them the most. - I'm excited.

453
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,109
(The other teams were curious about and anticipated the united team.)

454
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,638
(The CrewOne)

455
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,779
They keep coming in.

456
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,779
There are so many members.

457
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,220
There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

458
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,519
There are 11 members?

459
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,788
Two, one!

460
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,350
- Hello, we're The CrewOne. - Hello, we're The CrewOne.

461
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,559
Let's get it.

462
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,189
With the desire to showcase a new performance to the public,

463
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,499
we formed the united team,

464
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,258
The CrewOne.

465
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,269
(They came together with an ambition of showing a new performance!)

466
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,839
(The combination of JUST B with vocalists who have various tones...)

467
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,808
(and ATBO that is a group of great dancers)

468
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,169
We came to a show as a united team,

469
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,808
which is unprecedented in the K-pop industry.

470
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,109
We'll show you how scary and amazing we are.

471
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,349
We're a team that debuted today,

472
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,189
but you won't think we're rookies when we're on stage.

473
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,190
Game over.

474
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,159
Let's do this.

475
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,288
- We got this. - Let's go.

476
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,489
They look a little scary.

477
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,630
Don't they look big as they're wearing the same color?

478
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,960
They look like gangsters.

479
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,130
They look intimidating because they're a big group.

480
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,769
We shouldn't mess with them.

481
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,140
- Take a look. - We won't look.

482
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,598
(The first mission as the leader of the united team...)

483
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,410
(is to check the Leader Card.)

484
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:50,838
(Curious)

485
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,309
(Nervous)

486
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,009
(Geonu, the leader of The CrewOne has checked the card.)

487
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,980
- What kind of reaction is that? - Why? What is it?

488
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,549
I'm so curious.

489
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,018
- That's not an ordinary look. - Except for us, everyone...

490
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,789
It seems he's hiding his emotions.

491
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,589
How do you feel?

492
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,990
(Observing)

493
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,200
Well, I'm not sure.

494
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,798
Okay.

495
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,229
(Awkward)

496
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,729
I think things get awkward after they check the card.

497
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,298
Of course, it would become awkward.

498
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,869
We ranked them.

499
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,910
(What's the expected ranking of The CrewOne?)

500
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,339
There's one team left now.

501
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,409
They were in the last season.

502
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,078
- They're coming again. - I know.

503
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,819
They have the upper hand because they've done this before.

504
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
The last team.

505
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,859
Hello!

506
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:40,660
- Hello. - Hello.

507
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,930
Their charisma.

508
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,229
(ONEUS was a rookie group in their 2nd year at that time.)

509
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,900
It's been four years, and we're back.

510
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,338
How many years of experience do we have?

511
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,400
- It's our sixth year. - That's crazy.

512
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,639
("ONEUS to be Back on Road to Kingdom")

513
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,339
Many people said we were greedy...

514
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,079
for appearing on the show again.

515
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,719
Since our first appearance on Road to Kingdom,

516
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,720
we've been working hard as if every year was a survival show.

517
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,990
But the numbers and the results were telling us...

518
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,959
that the reality might not let us keep going...

519
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,730
at some point.

520
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,230
We're on the show because we don't want...

521
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,700
to have our last moment yet.

522
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:28,740
I think we're ready to show people that we've changed.

523
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,140
We'll show you how experienced singers perform.

524
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,980
HWAN WOONG, you can take a look.

525
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,348
(Everyone is curious about their expected ranking.)

526
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,519
We should take a close look at his face.

527
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,119
I'm curious too.

528
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,848
(What is he hiding behind his smile?)

529
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,189
(Is it perplexity or joy?)

530
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,619
That looks like a positive reaction.

531
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,259
Yes. I got a feeling.

532
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,690
- They must be in first place. - I think so too.

533
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,329
This is so interesting.

534
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,900
I don't know.

535
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,930
(What is their ranking?)

536
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,000
- Everyone is here. - There's one seat left.

537
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,410
TAEMIN will come in.

538
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,680
Oh, my.

539
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,009
(Drawing attention)

540
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,749
- What is it? - What's going on?

541
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,419
- What? - Here he comes.

542
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
(He's finally here!)

543
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,130
Even his silhouette is cool.

544
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,529
(They're super excited just by looking at his silhouette.)

545
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,000
- It's crazy. - Oh, my gosh.

546
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,029
(He's my senior.)

547
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,568
(The classy host of Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace has appeared.)

548
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,170
- This is amazing. - This is awesome.

549
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,369
He has an aura.

550
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:40,179
- He's a true ace. - Oh, my gosh.

551
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
(TAEMIN who is every idol's role model)

552
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,210
(Since he debuted as SHINee in 2008,)

553
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,920
(he's been a member of 1 of the most successful boy bands for 16 years.)

554
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,890
(Through his unrivaled performances as a solo artist, )

555
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,190
(he proved no artist could replace him.)

556
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,129
(A true all-rounder who achieved the highest level of success...)

557
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,660
(in both his group and solo careers)

558
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,559
(TAEMIN, the ace of ace in the K-pop industry)

559
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,200
He's an idol among idols.

560
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,140
He's a superstar both as a solo artist and a member of a boy band.

561
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,470
I dreamed of becoming a singer because of TAEMIN.

562
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:16,480
(Host TAEMIN, the ace of ace)

563
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,318
It's nice to meet you through Road to Kingdom.

564
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,079
I'm TAEMIN, the host of the show.

565
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,089
Let's go!

566
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,759
You guys are here to prove yourselves.

567
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,529
The journey of Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace has finally begun.

568
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,400
How do you feel? Are you nervous?

569
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,670
- Yes. - I'm excited.

570
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,599
I'm excited to see you!

571
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:42,809
(Smiling)

572
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,970
Shall we cheer together?

573
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,578
- It sounds good. - Yes.

574
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,209
Let's cheer on the count of three.

575
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,979
- Okay! - In 1, 2, 3.

576
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,009
- We got this! - We got this!

577
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,950
It's finally begun.

578
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,389
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace has a new system.

579
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,390
Let me tell you how it goes.

580
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,730
(Oh, my gosh. My heart.)

581
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,900
It has started now.

582
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
We should focus.

583
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,769
The last season of Road to Kingdom was about the rankings of the teams.

584
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,470
In Road to King: Ace of Ace...

585
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,670
I'm sweating.

586
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,240
(Focused)

587
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,609
There are two rankings.

588
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,410
Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.

589
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,049
(2 Track: Team Ranking and Ace Ranking)

590
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,950
So it's not just about how good we are as a team.

591
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,349
- That's a variable. - Right.

592
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:35,329
In every round, you'll choose an ace who will lead your team.

593
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:40,230
Team Ranking and Ace Ranking, the two rankings will be announced.

594
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,429
Team Ranking is a ranking system that determines...

595
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,339
the order of teams based on their performances in each round.

596
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,368
Ace Ranking is a ranking system that determines the ace...

597
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,009
who stood out the most.

598
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,409
There are two rankings in total.

599
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,210
From now on, you will start with the first match...

600
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,250
and compete in a total of four rounds.

601
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,480
Only five teams will advance to the final round...

602
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,579
to determine the final winners.

603
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,750
After the third match,

604
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,619
the team with the highest accumulated Team Ranking...

605
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,789
and the ace with the highest accumulated Ace Ranking...

606
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,589
will advance directly to the final.

607
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,429
One more chance is given to the ace...

608
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,929
to save his team.

609
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,930
(Accumulated Team Ranking 1st place, accumulated Ace Ranking 1st place)

610
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,529
Even if the team didn't do well, if the ace did a phenomenal job...

611
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,899
- Right. - Yes.

612
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,538
So the ace should excel in everything.

613
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,909
The aces will be pressured...

614
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,269
- from responsibility. - I know.

615
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,008
All of us are talented.

616
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,379
I think we have the upper hand.

617
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,848
Rather than showing a group performance only,

618
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:30,548
we're lucky to have a chance...

619
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,380
to show individual talents in different ways.

620
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,720
There are cards in front of the leaders at the table.

621
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,160
These cards contain the expected rankings...

622
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:45,500
you evaluated yourselves during the pre-meeting.

623
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,759
No.

624
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,900
- TAEHUN, the leader of THE NEW SIX. - Yes.

625
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,170
Tell us your expected ranking in the Evaluation Match.

626
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,239
The expected ranking of THE NEW SIX...

627
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,210
in the Evaluation Match determined by the participants themselves.

628
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,509
It's the fourth place.

629
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,079
What? The fourth place?

630
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,710
Are you okay?

631
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,618
Not bad. But it could've been better.

632
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,548
- It's lower than I thought. - Yes.

633
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:09,618
It's the second place.

634
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:11,019
(The expected ranking of CRAVITY in the Evaluation Match is 2nd.)

635
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,119
It's the fifth place.

636
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,759
- It's not the worst. - I thought it'd be the seventh.

637
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,230
It's the sixth place.

638
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:17,529
(The expected ranking of TEMPEST in the Evaluation Match is 6th.)

639
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,329
The sixth place.

640
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,329
It motivates me.

641
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,099
The expected ranking of YOUNITE in the Evaluation Match is...

642
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,839
I'm angry.

643
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,909
(EUNSANG declared war against everyone after seeing the ranking.)

644
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,140
I'm so mad right now.

645
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:33,639
It's the seventh place.

646
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,109
- Why? - What?

647
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,179
(- What? - Really?)

648
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,680
It's the expected ranking.

649
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,549
The actual ranking will be different.

650
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,288
(YOUNITE ranked at the very bottom in the expected ranking...)

651
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,019
(for the Evaluation Match, which was determined by the participants.)

652
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,759
HWAN WOONG, the leader of ONEUS.

653
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,759
Geonu, the leader of The CrewOne.

654
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,430
Please tell us your expected ranking in the Evaluation Match.

655
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,230
- Please. - I don't have high expectations.

656
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,828
I want us to be in the first place.

657
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,528
- Who would be in the first place? - ONEUS?

658
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,769
ONEUS.

659
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,509
The expected ranking of The CrewOne...

660
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,670
is the first.

661
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,109
(The CrewOne is in the 1st place.)

662
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,779
(The expected ranking of The CrewOne in the Evaluation Match is 1st.)

663
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,980
- Thank you. - We'll work hard.

664
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,549
But you don't know.

665
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,319
The card that isn't revealed is the most powerful.

666
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,219
It's because they're a big group.

667
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,389
(The CrewOne, the united team, is expected to be a strong team.)

668
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,719
It went how I wanted it to go.

669
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,159
They must've thought we became stronger...

670
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,159
as we're a combination of two teams.

671
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,660
I think that's why they chose us.

672
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,130
It's the third place.

673
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,969
(Surprised)

674
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,599
What? ONEUS is in the third place?

675
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,268
It's bad if we aren't in the first place, guys.

676
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,500
It's not high.

677
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,739
"So this is what they think of us."

678
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,008
That's what I thought.

679
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,509
I was offended.

680
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:46,118
But what's actually important...

681
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,420
is the public opinion about you.

682
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:51,519
We conducted a public popularity evaluation in advance.

683
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,990
- Gosh, it's the most important. - It's the most important.

684
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,660
I think it'll hurt my feelings.

685
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,299
Please reveal the public popularity ranking.

686
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,459
Come on.

687
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,940
(Which team ranked 7th according to the public popularity?)

688
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,568
(Public popularity evaluation, 1. CRAVITY, 2. ONEUS, 3. TEMPEST)

689
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:08,000
(4. The CrewOne, 5. 8TURN, 6. YOUNITE, 7. THE NEW SIX)

690
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,739
(ONEUS, expected ranking: 3rd place, public popularity: 2nd place)

691
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,679
It's a relief. We're in the second place.

692
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,839
- Oh, my gosh. - The third place?

693
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,879
- It's not bad. - We're in the fourth place?

694
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,109
How are we in the fourth place?

695
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:20,819
- It's the same for us. - We're still in the fifth place.

696
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,319
- We're in the 6th place. - We're in the 6th place.

697
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,788
We're in the sixth place.

698
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,818
Don't be happy about it.

699
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,159
It's not something you should be happy about.

700
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,489
We're going up.

701
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,689
We've ranked one position higher already.

702
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,759
(We're so lucky to be ranked one position higher.)

703
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,528
(7. THE NEW SIX)

704
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:35,129
(THE NEW SIX is ranked the lowest in the public popularity evaluation.)

705
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,268
(THE NEW SIX, expected ranking: 4th, public popularity: 7th)

706
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:41,299
I didn't expect that we'd be in the seventh place.

707
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,769
- I didn't even imagine it. - That's unexpected.

708
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm so upset being at the bottom of the rank.

709
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,779
It's more shocking.

710
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,649
They publicly announced...

711
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,048
that we were ranked the lowest in the public popularity evaluation.

712
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,489
We'll show our charms from now on...

713
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,789
and climb up the ranks.

714
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,758
(1. CRAVITY)

715
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,189
(CRAVITY is in the top positions in both rankings, the 2nd place...)

716
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,028
(in the Self-Evaluation and the 1st place in the public popularity.)

717
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,059
We're in the first place.

718
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,859
We're really in the first place.

719
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:07,758
CRAVITY...

720
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,929
has a lot of experience on stage.

721
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,568
And they're all very talented.

722
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,568
They won a major music show.

723
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,409
Considering the album sales...

724
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,409
in the first week...

725
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,709
or the number of concert tickets sold,

726
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,278
they will have the best result.

727
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,348
They're our biggest rivals.

728
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:24,879
They're the most intimidating.

729
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,049
Right.

730
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:29,049
- We should do well. - We should do really well.

731
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,249
- We should do really well. - Yes.

732
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,219
Seeing that we're in the first place, I feel like crying.

733
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,920
I know. I feel like crying right now.

734
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,329
It's our first time on a survival show as a team.

735
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,558
I think people voted for us as they expected...

736
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,069
a great performance from us.

737
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,098
I was pressured, but I wanted to prove ourselves.

738
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,039
We'll show you who CRAVITY is.

739
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,210
The Evaluation Match will begin now.

740
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,739
I'm suddenly nervous.

741
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,939
Cold sweat is breaking out on my back.

742
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,150
I'm suddenly nervous.

743
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,849
Let's focus.

744
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,818
As our show...

745
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,819
has a new ranking system, which is the Ace Ranking,

746
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,950
The Evaluation Match consists of two rounds,

747
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,460
the Ace Battle and the Team Battle.

748
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,459
The first round of the Evaluation Match...

749
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,258
is the Ace Battle, which is an individual competition...

750
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,029
among the ace members representing each team.

751
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,829
The second round is the Team Battle,

752
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,828
where we can see what they have as a team.

753
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,099
(The Team Battle where we can see what they have as a team)

754
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,439
There's twice as much to watch.

755
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,339
So it's not just about how good we are as a team.

756
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,769
- Our team... - We need to do well in both.

757
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,710
The aces must be so nervous.

758
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,749
From now on, the first round of the Evaluation Match...

759
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,609
in Road to Kingdom: Ace to Ace,

760
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,578
the fierce battle among the aces...

761
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,189
who will determine the fate of each team will begin.

762
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,549
(The 1st round of the Evaluation Match, the Ace Battle will begin!)

763
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,829
- Let's go! - Let's go!

764
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:48,529
(The result of the Ace Battle will be revealed later.)

765
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,200
(What's the result that shocked everyone?)

766
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,768
The Ace Battle in the first round of the Evaluation Match will begin,

767
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,140
which will determine the fate of each team.

768
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,839
Let's go!

769
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,439
Finally.

770
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,480
Let's go.

771
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,680
(CRAVITY was ranked 1st in the public popularity evaluation.)

772
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:09,449
(What benefits will the 1st place team receive?)

773
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,049
The Ace Battle in the first round.

774
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,089
They'll be given the right to decide on the cue sheet.

775
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,328
(1. ONEUS, 2. CRAVITY)

776
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:18,500
(The cue sheet of the Ace Battle written by CRAVITY)

777
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,630
(ONEUS will perform first.)

778
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,529
HWAN WOONG, the leader of ONEUS that will perform first.

779
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,269
Please tell us who the ace of your team is.

780
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,269
Who would it be?

781
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,068
He'll say his name.

782
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,009
"That's me." He might say this.

783
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,379
The ace of our team...

784
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,509
is very talented...

785
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,949
and has an amazing presence. That's why we chose him as our ace.

786
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,049
(Exclaiming)

787
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,149
That confidence.

788
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,660
The ace of ONEUS is...

789
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,788
The ace of ONEUS is definitely HWAN WOONG.

790
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,930
I think HWAN WOONG is their ace.

791
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,599
SEO HO.

792
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,400
- SEO HO. - What?

793
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,000
(The unexpected ace?)

794
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,768
It's HWAN WOONG who is loved by SEO HO.

795
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:58,999
- Yes! - Yes!

796
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,499
(He successfully fooled them from the beginning.)

797
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,868
He got me!

798
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,068
(He's easily fooled.)

799
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,069
Receive our energy before you go.

800
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,910
- Okay. Let me receive your energy. - Let's go.

801
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:07,639
- Go. - Good luck.

802
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,680
(Our ace can do it.)

803
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,220
(ONEUS in the waiting room before the shoot)

804
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,049
(HWAN WOONG seems to be the only one who is worried.)

805
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,289
The Ace Battle put me under a lot of pressure.

806
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,989
I felt an obsession and burden...

807
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,589
to do well.

808
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,359
(ONEUS is back on Road to Kingdom after 4 years.)

809
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,429
(HWAN WOONG is standing at the starting line again...)

810
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,200
(as the ace of the team.)

811
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,309
I do feel the pressure.

812
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:41,380
But I think we must win this time.

813
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,008
If we can't do it,

814
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,749
there's no reason for us to be back on the show.

815
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,619
We're just as desperate now...

816
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,990
as we were back then.

817
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:54,559
I thought we had fully prepared everything in advance, but...

818
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,490
Let's go.

819
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,460
(Shaking)

820
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,598
HWAN WOONG's hands are shaking.

821
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,130
(He tries to calm down.)

822
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,369
Seriously...

823
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,470
I've never shaken like that in my life.

824
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,768
(How will he perform on stage...)

825
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,410
(while feeling both the burden and the desperation at the same time?)

826
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,680
The ace of ONEUS.

827
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,249
- That's cool. - He has the word "ace..."

828
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,250
on his chest.

829
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,618
- I'm excited. - Yes. I'm so excited.

830
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,119
They must be nervous as the first performers.

831
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,630
Even I'm nervous.

832
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,059
Show us.

833
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,469
As it's our second time on the show,

834
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,528
I think we'll be able to show...

835
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,599
the most impactful performance.

836
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,970
("Put on a Happy Face" by HWAN WOONG of ONEUS)

837
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,250
Gosh.

838
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,630
Oh, my gosh.

839
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,859
That facial expression is insane.

840
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,650
Gosh.

841
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,089
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

842
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,660
- Gosh. - Gosh.

843
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,009
The Joker.

844
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,309
- That was so cool. - Totally.

845
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,680
You killed it!

846
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,308
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

847
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,150
- He crushed it. - Oh, my.

848
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,288
(Giving him respect)

849
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,119
Even the first performance was impressive like crazy.

850
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,859
He was so expressive on stage. Oh, my.

851
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,359
I couldn't believe his acting. It was phenomenal.

852
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,990
I was really impressed while watching his performance.

853
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,960
I wondered, "Is he the Korean version of the Joker?"

854
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:17,268
You must have been very nervous since you were the first one to go.

855
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:19,200
Do you think you were able to show us everything you prepared?

856
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:20,869
Yes!

857
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:21,869
(Answering on his behalf)

858
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,868
- He crushed it. - You were amazing!

859
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,140
- You were so cool! - The best!

860
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,349
This had to be the most nerve-racking moment since my debut.

861
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,018
I was able to show what I practiced. So I'm relieved.

862
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,019
Thank you.

863
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,450
Nicely done.

864
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:39,189
This was the best performance you ever put on.

865
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,219
What a relief.

866
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,358
(Their compliments finally put him at ease.)

867
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,759
What a relief.

868
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,829
Next up, we have 8TURN. Please introduce your ace.

869
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,470
I wonder who it is.

870
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:53,098
I really can't tell which one of them is the ace.

871
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,200
I have no idea.

872
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,469
Based on our expected ranking from your votes,

873
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,639
you might have underestimated us...

874
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,608
because we're the youngest group here.

875
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,508
(You might have underestimated us because we're the youngest group.)

876
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,578
(The youngest group shows off their spirit.)

877
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:05,618
That's what I'm thinking.

878
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,619
(Surprised)

879
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,150
(But the members are taken aback as he provokes the others.)

880
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,389
(Distancing himself quickly)

881
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,589
Then what about us?

882
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,788
(Their expected ranking was 7th.)

883
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,789
Whatever you have in mind about us, he will crush your expectations.

884
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,158
We chose an ace member who could put on a performance...

885
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,428
with an element of surprise.

886
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,900
- Will it be their youngest member? - Will it be their youngest member?

887
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,170
- Will it be the youngest? - The youngest's strong spirit.

888
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:27,339
In my opinion, it might be the guy with the abs.

889
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,269
- That guy might be the ace member. - Yes.

890
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,010
The ace of 8TURN is...

891
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,239
"It's me."

892
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,948
MYUNG HO.

893
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,179
(The ace of 8TURN, MYUNG HO)

894
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,649
Let's go, MYUNG HO!

895
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,880
- This is what I'm talking about. - MYUNG HO!

896
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,419
(He grabbed everyone's attention the moment he showed up.)

897
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
(His abs look like a bar of chocolate.)

898
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:48,719
(The guy with the perfect abs)

899
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,059
(The first ace member to represent 8TURN, MYUNG HO)

900
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,828
You're the first ace to represent us.

901
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:57,030
- What's up with the pressure? - Don't give him pressure.

902
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,469
It's...

903
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,669
When I heard that one of us had to perform as the ace,

904
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,868
the first member I thought of was MYUNG HO.

905
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:04,968
He's just good.

906
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,440
He's the main vocalist and the main dancer for a reason.

907
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,579
You specialize in all-out wars.

908
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,479
You know?

909
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,249
- An all-out war. - You guys are scaring me.

910
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,649
(This guy with a fragile heart is scared of an all-out war.)

911
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,650
That's so scary.

912
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:17,920
I am under some pressure.

913
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,589
It's my 1st solo performance and my 1st competition on TV.

914
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,988
Everything is new to me.

915
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,090
(The competition rookie's first challenge)

916
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:26,900
I gave my all to this battle.

917
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,530
They better watch out.

918
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,500
Gosh, he's wearing a blindfold.

919
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:34,138
(Their eyes are on him.)

920
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,169
A sofa.

921
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,570
Gosh. I see a wine glass too. There's wine in it.

922
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,538
If he breaks the wine glass, he'll get my respect.

923
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,539
Yes.

924
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,210
Gosh, I'm looking forward to this.

925
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,779
- There it goes. - Oh, my.

926
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,050
- Okay. - He looks so cool.

927
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:51,119
The ace of 8TURN.

928
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:58,558
- My goodness. - What was that?

929
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,559
- Oh, my. - What?

930
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,500
- What was that? - What?

931
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,900
("In Vino Veritas: Truth" by MYUNG HO of 8TURN)

932
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:52,880
Let's go.

933
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,360
- Oh, gosh! - What?

934
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:21,940
Is he going to drink it?

935
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,480
- He drank it. - Gosh.

936
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,389
- Oh, my. - What?

937
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,618
- Oh, my. - What?

938
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,690
(Shocked)

939
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,119
- He broke it. - Gosh.

940
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,230
Hey, is your hand okay?

941
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,029
- Gosh. - Is your hand okay?

942
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,429
- That was amazing. - I didn't see this coming.

943
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,698
He won first place.

944
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,900
- Gosh, that was so cool. - He was...

945
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,738
They were the last ones to debut.

946
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,170
I wasn't expecting him to go with the sexy theme at all.

947
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,308
His facial expression and breaking the wine glass toward the end...

948
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:55,239
drew me into his performance.

949
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,480
I thought, "He's an amazing performer."

950
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,979
- Come here. - Come here!

951
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,118
- MYUNG HO! - Come here!

952
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,289
You did it!

953
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,888
- Gosh, that was the coolest. - It was the coolest.

954
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:05,889
You were the coolest.

955
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,118
- MYUNG HO, you were amazing. - You were so cool.

956
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,388
- MYUNG HO, well done. - Good job.

957
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,058
(MYUNG HO executed his first solo performance.)

958
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,888
Didn't someone say breaking the glass would earn his respect?

959
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,029
- Right. - That's what I said.

960
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,199
- And he really did it. - Yes.

961
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,029
Who's third?

962
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,599
- The CrewOne. - I see.

963
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
(Glancing)

964
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,369
(What?)

965
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,940
(I'm watching you, Lim Jimin.)

966
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,069
(I can cut you off with my forearm muscles.)

967
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,139
He's posing.

968
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,439
(His tactic of looking buff...)

969
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,610
(fails.)

970
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,710
Next up, we have The CrewOne. Please introduce your ace.

971
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,819
(At last)

972
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
- Gosh. - It's time.

973
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:37,549
Actually, we're a mysterious group for now.

974
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,558
Two groups formed a team together.

975
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,090
I don't know who's going to perform.

976
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,989
As for the ace of The CrewOne,

977
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,058
I dare say he can execute...

978
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,328
the most intense performance among everyone here.

979
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,840
So who's the ace?

980
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,899
The ace of The CrewOne is...

981
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,509
(The ace of The CrewOne)

982
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,809
Lim Jimin.

983
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,908
- Let's go. - Yes!

984
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,749
- Let's go. - Show them!

985
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,750
Show them!

986
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:05,779
- Let's go. - Show them.

987
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,019
It's really him. Gosh.

988
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,320
Here comes the monster.

989
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,749
Look at his body. He's so ripped.

990
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,618
His inner chest muscles look amazing.

991
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,489
Right. I bet he can easily lift 100kg on a bench press.

992
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,859
His chest is shining.

993
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,360
The muscular guy. Was his name Lim Jimin?

994
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:22,329
Jimin actually majored in dance.

995
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:23,969
With that body?

996
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,709
I'm performing as the first ace of The CrewOne.

997
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,009
I'll mix up my artistic movements as a dancer...

998
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,308
and some powerful dancing as a performer,

999
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,380
so I can put on a performance that just screams wild masculinity.

1000
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,349
Let's bring in the props.

1001
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:42,949
- What's that? - What is that?

1002
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,288
- What is it? - What?

1003
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,320
What is that?

1004
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,590
That's a dragon fruit.

1005
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,928
(All of a sudden, a tropical fruit appears.)

1006
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,860
- I think it's a flower. - A flower?

1007
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,459
(It's a flower? I see.)

1008
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,299
"Will we win the competition?"

1009
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,769
- "Or will we not?" - "Or will we not?"

1010
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,539
(People are showing a lot of interest in the props.)

1011
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,598
(The ace shows up.)

1012
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,609
Oh, my gosh.

1013
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,009
- You look cool! - You rock!

1014
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,678
- You look amazing! - Rock that outfit!

1015
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,479
- He's here. - Let's go.

1016
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,549
You look cool!

1017
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,749
He's coming!

1018
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,808
- You look cool! - You rock!

1019
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,218
(You've got my respect!)

1020
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:14,379
He's holding something.

1021
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,849
- That's a sandglass. - He's ready.

1022
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:19,960
On Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace,

1023
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:22,119
I will make my name...

1024
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,260
be synonymous with the title of the show with this performance.

1025
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,769
The ace of The CrewOne.

1026
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:35,369
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1027
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,839
- What's that? - Oh, my.

1028
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,969
(His performance starts with an intense look.)

1029
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,280
- Gosh. - From the get-go?

1030
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,150
- Please. - I can see his bare chest.

1031
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,579
That's cheating.

1032
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,550
- Let's go. - Please.

1033
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,949
Please.

1034
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,889
("Dark Times" by Lim Jimin of The CrewOne)

1035
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
What?

1036
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,388
Let's go!

1037
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,489
- Let's go! - Hey!

1038
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,829
He's so powerful.

1039
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,599
That was cool.

1040
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,578
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1041
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,238
- Lim Jimin! - You killed it!

1042
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,650
- He's good. - He's so powerful.

1043
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,019
It's not easy to dance that well with that kind of body.

1044
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,380
- That's crazy. - It was amazing.

1045
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,519
He was really good. I mean it.

1046
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,489
It was like watching an artwork.

1047
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,988
I knew he would be good.

1048
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,529
But I was still impressed by his dancing.

1049
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,030
To be honest, he didn't need the lotus.

1050
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,360
- Right. - He would've still rocked it.

1051
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,899
Gosh, well done.

1052
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,030
Nice!

1053
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,769
I'm so touched. He did so well.

1054
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:48,899
He was the best.

1055
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,869
(The ace of The CrewOne is the best.)

1056
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,579
I'll go home and work out too.

1057
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,239
(Notifying his plan to work out)

1058
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,050
I feel like I should work out starting today.

1059
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,650
But you won't.

1060
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
How did he know that?

1061
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:06,059
Next up, we have TEMPEST. Please introduce your ace.

1062
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,820
Yes. The ace of TEMPEST is...

1063
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,288
- HANBIN? - I think it will be HANBIN.

1064
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:14,130
The ace of TEMPEST is HANBIN.

1065
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,768
(Everyone expected HANBIN to be the ace of the group.)

1066
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,099
He's got great energy.

1067
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,340
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1068
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:23,339
HANBIN came to Korea...

1069
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,940
through a show called "I-Land" from Vietnam.

1070
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,339
(HANBIN came to a foreign land...)

1071
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,780
(to fulfill his dream of becoming an idol star.)

1072
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,550
(But he experienced hardships along the way.)

1073
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,049
(Unfortunately, he was let down right before the debut.)

1074
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,050
We had trained for a long time and were so close to making a debut.

1075
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,718
HANBIN joined our group and became our last member.

1076
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,329
Then we made our debut.

1077
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:47,098
HANBIN always exceeded...

1078
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,199
our expectations.

1079
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,630
So I always had faith in him. And I still do.

1080
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,599
(The rehearsal on the day)

1081
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:57,210
- HANBIN will win first place. - I believe in HANBIN.

1082
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,710
- Great. - Well done.

1083
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,679
It's so touching to hear that they believe in me.

1084
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,179
They show me a lot of support.

1085
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,579
You got this!

1086
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:09,348
- There's the Little Prince! - Let's go, HANBIN!

1087
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,849
- Little Prince! - The guys believe in me.

1088
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,420
So I wanted to do a good job.

1089
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,519
I'm confident.

1090
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:17,530
You can do this.

1091
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,399
Let's go.

1092
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,730
You got this.

1093
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:31,539
The ace of TEMPEST.

1094
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:36,650
("WHO AM I" by HANBIN of TEMPEST)

1095
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:45,519
That's an interesting concept.

1096
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,039
How many turns did he make?

1097
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,110
That was amazing.

1098
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,280
Gosh, that was intense.

1099
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,920
- What? It's not over. - It's not over yet?

1100
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,349
Will he hug it?

1101
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:53,820
No way.

1102
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,589
- What? Oh, my. - He got into it.

1103
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,599
Oh, my.

1104
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,659
That's too racy.

1105
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,468
(Adjusting the censorship on their own)

1106
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,170
- What? - That's so romantic.

1107
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:07,699
Nice!

1108
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,170
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1109
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:10,969
Well done.

1110
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,670
Great job.

1111
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,480
That was so original.

1112
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,210
How did he come up with this kind of idea?

1113
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,380
It must not have been easy to control that.

1114
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:20,848
He used the props.

1115
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:22,649
For the artistic side of the performance,

1116
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,250
I was a bit puzzled by the concept.

1117
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,719
It made me wonder a bit.

1118
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,289
- Well done. - Great job.

1119
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,829
(Will he be satisfied with the result?)

1120
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,170
Next up, we have THE NEW SIX.

1121
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,340
THE NEW SIX.

1122
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,670
I wonder who's going to perform.

1123
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:44,369
- JUNHYEOK? - JUNHYEOK?

1124
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,479
- Check out the look on his face. - Does he look...

1125
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,510
- nervous? - Yes, he does.

1126
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,149
(Is he the ace as he seems very nervous?)

1127
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,250
It must be JUNHYEOK.

1128
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,579
Who do you think will perform as the ace of THE NEW SIX?

1129
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:56,589
- JUNHYEOK! - Same here.

1130
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,050
- He's the vocalist, right? - Yes.

1131
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,518
He's an all-rounder.

1132
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,888
He's really good at expressing himself on stage.

1133
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,229
Should I say he dominates the stage?

1134
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,658
He can draw in people's attention right away.

1135
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:06,999
- It has to be JUNHYEOK. - Right.

1136
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,199
- Yes. - JUNHYEOK will perform.

1137
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,329
He's the perfect ace.

1138
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:15,800
(JUNHYEOK has been taking the center role in the group.)

1139
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,280
But there was a time JUNHYEOK couldn't perform with us.

1140
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,750
After making my debut, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.

1141
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,348
(JUNHYEOK stood out on the audition reality show...)

1142
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:26,848
(and was considered the ace.)

1143
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:28,619
The sense of pressure was too great on me.

1144
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,820
There wasn't a set date on his return.

1145
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,288
To be honest, it was okay at first.

1146
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:36,860
But when his absence was stretched on for a long time...

1147
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,730
To be honest, I was very anxious.

1148
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,099
On top of that, he had an important role in our group.

1149
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,038
He's the main vocalist too.

1150
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:51,238
So his absence was quite noticeable.

1151
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,239
(The 5 of them released 2 albums without him.)

1152
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,038
The members were working hard to fill in my absence.

1153
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,249
I felt bad.

1154
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,480
I had a greater sense of responsibility.

1155
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:03,050
(He's been utterly nervous ever since the Ace Battle began.)

1156
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,050
Relax.

1157
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,419
I had a feeling that...

1158
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,829
other artists prepared dance-forward performances.

1159
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:15,429
But I prepared a performance that mainly centered around singing.

1160
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:19,639
(The ace members who went before him put on fierce performances.)

1161
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,739
I felt more pressure and intimidated too.

1162
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,479
Your performance has an edge. I swear.

1163
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,039
Your performance is completely different.

1164
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,479
(The members root for JUNHYEOK who's nervous.)

1165
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,849
You can just perform confidently.

1166
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,078
What they told me was priceless for me.

1167
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,849
"Do a performance you're confident about."

1168
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,118
They believed in me and waited for me.

1169
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,489
Now, it's time for me to step up and do something for my group.

1170
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,090
I want to perform the Ace Battle...

1171
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,030
for my members.

1172
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,669
(The members are more nervous than JUNHYEOK.)

1173
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm more nervous for him now.

1174
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,610
(The leader is more nervous than anyone.)

1175
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,440
- It's a microphone stand. - A microphone stand.

1176
00:48:58,909 --> 00:48:59,909
- Hey. - I think he's going to sing.

1177
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,440
That's our first singing performance.

1178
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,150
A 100-second performance with singing... That won't be easy.

1179
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,519
The ace of THE NEW SIX.

1180
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,869
("Drowning" by JUNHYEOK of THE NEW SIX)

1181
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:49,349
I got goosebumps.

1182
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,860
Oh, my. It made me emotional.

1183
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:00,929
(Their leader, TAEHUN, ends up crying.)

1184
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,099
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1185
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,839
(An encouraging round of applause)

1186
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,639
- Well done. - That was amazing!

1187
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,309
I got goosebumps. I'm serious.

1188
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,940
That was really touching.

1189
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,679
His performance lingered for a long time.

1190
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,420
Trying to sing a song for a minute...

1191
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,159
I thought, "Gosh, you can still impress people."

1192
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,389
I felt his desperate desire to perform.

1193
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:35,829
I could sense his desperation.

1194
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,630
Personally, JUNHYEOK had the best performance.

1195
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
That was amazing.

1196
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,570
Well done.

1197
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,969
- Great job. - You were amazing.

1198
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,340
- You did well. - You were great.

1199
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,579
Everything we went through flashed before my eyes.

1200
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,249
"I don't care if I fall deeper and drown to death."

1201
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,348
"So give me one more chance."

1202
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:56,349
They were the lyrics to the song.

1203
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,389
The lyrics made me cry right away.

1204
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,920
I was proud of him and grateful that he didn't give up.

1205
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm really proud of JUNHYEOK's performance.

1206
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,030
- That was nice. - Well done.

1207
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
You were really good.

1208
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,368
(The lineup for the Ace Battle, Round 1)

1209
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:17,039
(YOUNITE, CRAVITY)

1210
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,670
You're watching Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1211
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:21,739
YOUNITE. Please introduce your ace.

1212
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,249
Actually, our group was ranked pretty low...

1213
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,679
based on the preliminary voting.

1214
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,349
And our ace can unleash exactly how we're feeling right now.

1215
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:31,949
(His eyes open wide.)

1216
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:32,949
"Unleash?"

1217
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,388
You're all here because you guys are desperate.

1218
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,828
He will perform on your behalf.

1219
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:38,989
(Anticipating)

1220
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,400
He's such a smooth talker.

1221
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,859
The ace of YOUNITE is DEY.

1222
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,999
(The ace of YOUNITE, DEY)

1223
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,800
- Let's go! - Okay.

1224
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,968
(Surprised)

1225
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:47,969
- Let's go. - He's going to rap.

1226
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,768
Let's go, DEY!

1227
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:50,769
Let's go!

1228
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,809
(Main rapper of YOUNITE with hip-hop in his blood)

1229
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:56,179
(A real hip-hop musician that was on "High School Rapper")

1230
00:52:56,909 --> 00:52:59,010
(DEY is the hidden card of YOUNITE.)

1231
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,679
I believe we have an advantage when it comes to rapping.

1232
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,649
I don't think DEY had many opportunities...

1233
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,988
to show his competence through our songs.

1234
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:09,319
So I don't expect people to know how good he is.

1235
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,828
He is very skilled at rapping.

1236
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:14,230
I believe DEY the tennis ball.

1237
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,900
The expected ranking of YOUNITE...

1238
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
is seventh.

1239
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:19,599
Okay.

1240
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:20,840
I'm burning with anger.

1241
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,940
I was shocked to learn we ranked seventh.

1242
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:25,369
We'll have to compete to find out.

1243
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:26,980
Rapping is all about confidence.

1244
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,110
(A mysterious voice in the studio?)

1245
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,179
I was getting ready for the Ace Battle the whole time.

1246
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:34,549
I told myself,

1247
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,250
"We'll really become seventh if I forget the lyrics."

1248
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,848
I'll do my best...

1249
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,420
and take my place at the top.

1250
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,090
(Slapping the back of his neck)

1251
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,230
Can you pat me on the back?

1252
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,098
(Patting)

1253
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,929
(Punching)

1254
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,099
(DEY is ready to compete after patting his arms.)

1255
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,639
This is how good we are.

1256
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:02,679
I'll prove with my skills that we don't belong in seventh.

1257
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:07,019
(MC DEY transformed into a hip-hop artist with a swag.)

1258
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,219
- Let's go. - Here he comes.

1259
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,050
(Go, tennis ball!)

1260
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,920
He even walks like a hip-hop artist.

1261
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,719
- Hey, hip-hop. - Okay.

1262
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,929
- That's Brand New Music. - He's totally a rapper.

1263
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,030
Speak for us.

1264
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,329
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1265
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,699
The ace of YOUNITE.

1266
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,110
What?

1267
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:39,309
The family behind you.

1268
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,009
- Gosh. - "The family behind me."

1269
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,178
Family.

1270
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,678
- Family. - Me too.

1271
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:45,710
So cool.

1272
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,980
- That was so cool. - It was cool.

1273
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,280
(Cheering)

1274
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,090
Protect your family.

1275
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,090
That was awesome!

1276
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,690
I want to be his family too.

1277
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,919
Me too.

1278
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,829
- We want to be your family. - Take us in.

1279
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,389
TAERAE sitting behind me.

1280
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,199
- Yes. - Behind me.

1281
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:04,169
- Come here. - You were amazing.

1282
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,098
- Well done. - You were great.

1283
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,238
Good job.

1284
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,638
(The family tells DEY he passed.)

1285
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:09,670
You did a good job.

1286
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,779
He's crying.

1287
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,010
- I know. - What's wrong?

1288
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,510
I was so touched.

1289
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,718
Yes, he's going to take care of the family behind him.

1290
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:22,719
(HYEONGJUN, officially the most sensitive member of CRAVITY)

1291
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,689
I heard you wrote the lyrics...

1292
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,888
of the rap yourself. Is that true?

1293
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,059
Yes, it is.

1294
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:30,928
We have nowhere to go but up from now on.

1295
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,359
I expressed my hopes for this in the rap.

1296
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,459
There is a path you took that brought you here.

1297
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,400
I respect that and used that in the rap.

1298
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,138
Thank you.

1299
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,238
Thank you.

1300
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,468
This is hip-hop.

1301
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:43,539
Thank you.

1302
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,539
(DEY expressed his feelings through his performance.)

1303
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,109
Lastly, please introduce the ace...

1304
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:51,678
of CRAVITY, who won first place in the public popularity vote.

1305
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,210
I can't wait to see this.

1306
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,678
It's the long-awaited performance.

1307
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,750
I'm curious.

1308
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,749
We ranked first in the public popularity vote...

1309
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,360
and second in the expected ranking.

1310
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,158
So I believe everyone has high expectations.

1311
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,229
(The confidence of number 1)

1312
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,729
(Marveling)

1313
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,698
Each member of CRAVITY...

1314
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,368
has a distinct characteristic.

1315
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:15,839
They're skilled performers.

1316
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,010
They are a group to be feared.

1317
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,409
I am wary of them.

1318
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:22,038
We chose this member as our ace...

1319
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,440
with confidence.

1320
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,280
The ace of CRAVITY...

1321
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,820
is HYEONGJUN.

1322
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,888
(HYEONGJUN is chosen as the ace to show off the color of CRAVITY.)

1323
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,789
Let's go.

1324
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,760
What will the performance of the number one team's ace be like?

1325
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,029
I think it will be on a big scale.

1326
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,900
He's such a good dancer.

1327
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,300
I wonder what kind of stage CRAVITY, who won first place, prepared.

1328
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,399
(What kind of performance will HYEONGJUN put on?)

1329
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,339
Many people think...

1330
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,239
I'm good at doing covers of female idol stars.

1331
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,439
HYEONGJUN?

1332
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,468
He's a master in K-pop.

1333
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,638
He is good at expressing himself...

1334
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,579
through reels and shorts.

1335
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:59,448
I became known to people...

1336
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:01,619
through cover dances and challenges.

1337
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,518
I think people will be surprised...

1338
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:06,090
that I can also dance like this.

1339
00:58:06,489 --> 00:58:09,059
(What unexpected charm will he show us in the Ace Battle?)

1340
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,089
I will depict a fallen soldier...

1341
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,900
holding onto a sword broken during war.

1342
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,229
I will show you the strong will to continue fighting...

1343
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,429
with the broken sword through this performance.

1344
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,239
Actually, my biggest concern is...

1345
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,710
(Expected ranking in the Evaluation Match, 2nd place)

1346
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,209
(Public popularity vote)

1347
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,038
(Public popularity vote, 1st place)

1348
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:30,650
People have high expectations for CRAVITY.

1349
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,609
I was very worried what would happen...

1350
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,019
if I didn't meet their expectations.

1351
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:39,719
There was also the burden that I had to fill up the stage by myself.

1352
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:44,260
I felt the pressure and stress the Ace Battle brought me.

1353
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,000
This isn't easy.

1354
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,429
I'm sure it's a heavy burden.

1355
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,199
But we aren't worried.

1356
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,439
I hope he doesn't feel like he has to shoulder the burden.

1357
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,768
We just believe in him.

1358
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:58,139
I want him to enjoy this.

1359
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,209
I'll do my best for the members...

1360
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,739
that will be watching me from the stage.

1361
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,549
Please.

1362
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:07,649
Sit down.

1363
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,749
Watch with a reverent heart.

1364
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,849
Keep an eye on him.

1365
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,860
- I can't wait to see this. - I can't wait.

1366
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:16,090
I think he'll do really well.

1367
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:20,599
The ace of CRAVITY.

1368
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,969
("Act 1: Odyssey into Gravity," HYEONGJUN of CRAVITY)

1369
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,300
Yes.

1370
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:02,239
What was that?

1371
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,049
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1372
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,280
The ending.

1373
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,320
(Thunderous applause for HYEONGJUN, who put on the last performance)

1374
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,690
The look in his eyes is piercing.

1375
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:55,590
(Nicely done, Ace.)

1376
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,820
He crushed it.

1377
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:58,029
I teared up just now.

1378
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,089
I teared up.

1379
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,629
I feel like crying too.

1380
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,630
Right?

1381
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:03,299
- You were so good. - You were the best.

1382
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,428
- It was insane. - It was so good.

1383
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:05,729
- Nicely done. - Good job.

1384
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:06,768
(Letting his guard down after the battle)

1385
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:07,840
Nicely done.

1386
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,400
(Good fight, young soldier.)

1387
01:01:09,401 --> 01:01:11,169
- Good job. - Breathe.

1388
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,038
(The members are proud of HYEONGJUN for pulling off the stressful task.)

1389
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:14,639
- Good job. - Good job.

1390
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,980
Were my expectations too high?

1391
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:20,349
I had high expectations,

1392
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:24,349
but he must've been overwhelmed. He seemed quite nervous.

1393
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:27,519
I was really looking forward to HYEONGJUN's performance.

1394
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,789
I kept expecting more while watching,

1395
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,630
but it never came.

1396
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:35,299
It was flashy,

1397
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,599
but I didn't see anything impressive. That was disappointing.

1398
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,698
I think the change in order worked against them.

1399
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,808
The performances prior to his were so good.

1400
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:46,109
The expectation continued growing.

1401
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,738
Although he did a good job,

1402
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:49,139
it was a bit disappointing.

1403
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,779
HYEONGJUN, ace of CRAVITY.

1404
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,919
You put on the final performance of the Ace Battle.

1405
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,519
How do you feel about your performance?

1406
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,419
I feel a weight lifted off my chest.

1407
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,289
The other members told me I did a good job,

1408
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,820
and I feel proud of myself.

1409
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,428
- Nicely done. - You were amazing.

1410
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,459
What matters is that you did your best.

1411
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,460
(Will he be able to stay in 1st with the mixed reviews?)

1412
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:07,499
You don't want to have any regrets.

1413
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,599
(Will he be able to stay in 1st with the mixed reviews?)

1414
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,069
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1415
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:14,169
Ace Battle, Round One of the Evaluation Match is over.

1416
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,198
Gosh.

1417
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,239
(A round of applause for everyone that participated)

1418
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,468
We all did a great job.

1419
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,609
Good job.

1420
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,110
- Good job. - Good job.

1421
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,780
Good job, HANBIN.

1422
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,949
- You're amazing. - You're amazing.

1423
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:27,920
Thank you so much.

1424
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,589
He was preparing a performance for us.

1425
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,750
I'm sure it was exhausting, but he didn't let it show.

1426
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,158
He did such a good job...

1427
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:37,460
despite all the pressure and expectations.

1428
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,099
He was responsible from beginning to end.

1429
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,469
I was so proud of him and want to tell him he did great.

1430
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,900
I was truly proud of him.

1431
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,009
It is now time to determine the ranking...

1432
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,610
of the Ace Battle.

1433
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,408
- What? - Right now?

1434
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:55,479
Right away? How?

1435
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,509
(Flustered)

1436
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,880
Everything is about ranking.

1437
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:00,210
The ranking will be decided...

1438
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,380
through Self-Evaluation.

1439
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,619
Really?

1440
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,288
You are not allowed to discuss it with your team members.

1441
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:09,919
Vote for the three aces that put on the best performances...

1442
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,090
outside of your team.

1443
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,299
There will be five voters from each team,

1444
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,928
a total of 35 people, participating in the vote.

1445
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:19,029
(The voting for Ace Battle is over.)

1446
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,768
I think I will win first place.

1447
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,800
I think I have a chance of winning.

1448
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:25,440
I think I'll rank somewhere in the middle.

1449
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:31,210
I am holding the result of the Ace Battle.

1450
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:34,249
I'm nervous.

1451
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,619
The team that won first place in the Ace Battle...

1452
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,018
gets to decide the cue sheet...

1453
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:40,960
for the Team Battle, Round Two of the Evaluation Match.

1454
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,359
- That's huge. - That's most important.

1455
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,190
We got to make the decision earlier.

1456
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,929
One more thing.

1457
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:51,198
I have a piece of very important information to share.

1458
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,199
- What? - What is it?

1459
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,369
What kind of information suddenly?

1460
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,499
The team that ranked the lowest at seventh...

1461
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,239
in the Ace Battle...

1462
01:03:58,739 --> 01:03:59,909
What about them?

1463
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,079
What is it?

1464
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,710
- will not be able... - Not be able?

1465
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,279
It isn't elimination, is it?

1466
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,280
(What?)

1467
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:07,320
No way.

1468
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,719
To participate in the Team Battle.

1469
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:12,320
In the Team Battle.

1470
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,119
No, that can't be true.

1471
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:17,089
- Really? - What is he talking about?

1472
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,658
They don't get to do the team performance?

1473
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:20,059
- Today? - Yes.

1474
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:21,698
What?

1475
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:23,698
The ace is really important.

1476
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:24,730
(The whole studio is in shock at the unexpected rule.)

1477
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,069
Road to Kingdom has returned crueler.

1478
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,038
I thought he was the devil.

1479
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:32,469
I get why the subtitle is "Ace of Ace."

1480
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:35,210
It felt like a stab in the back.

1481
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:38,808
The team in 7th place will automatically be placed 7th...

1482
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:42,150
in the Evaluation Match without participating in the Team Battle.

1483
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,488
TAEMIN.

1484
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:49,690
Does that mean one team will just be watching all day today?

1485
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,058
(Focusing)

1486
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:52,360
(Nervous)

1487
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,260
Yes, that is correct.

1488
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,598
(Confirmation)

1489
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:56,900
(This can't be true.)

1490
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:00,670
I won't be able to face my team members if we're in seventh place.

1491
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:02,639
Please let me be anything but seventh place.

1492
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,908
What if my team won't be able to perform the stage...

1493
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:09,309
they worked so hard to prepare because of me?

1494
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,750
I was very scared.

1495
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,019
Please don't let me be in seventh place for my team.

1496
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,489
That's all I was thinking.

1497
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:21,319
I will now announce the ranking of the Ace Battle...

1498
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,488
that holds the destiny of the teams.

1499
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:25,629
This is so important.

1500
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,300
This is more nerve-racking than a music chart ranking announcement.

1501
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,328
First are the top three teams...

1502
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:31,768
in 1st to 3rd places.

1503
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:33,869
Please let us be one of them.

1504
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,569
We just have to avoid being in seventh place.

1505
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,638
I'll be satisfied with sixth place.

1506
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:38,840
There's no way we were the worst.

1507
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,939
We just have to avoid being in seventh place.

1508
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,939
(Everyone wants to avoid being in seventh place.)

1509
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,980
Show us the top three teams.

1510
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,349
(Totally focused)

1511
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,719
(The top teams of the Ace Battle that will be safe?)

1512
01:05:50,449 --> 01:05:52,049
(Ace Battle, Top 3 teams: Lim Jimin of The CrewOne, )

1513
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,519
(HWAN WOONG of ONEUS, MYUNG HO of 8TURN)

1514
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,018
(The top teams...)

1515
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:57,788
(immediately scream with joy.)

1516
01:05:57,789 --> 01:05:58,860
(Covering his mouth)

1517
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,729
(We did it.)

1518
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,630
(On the other hand, the other teams freeze.)

1519
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:06,828
We get to perform.

1520
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:08,269
Thank you so much.

1521
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:09,499
Good job.

1522
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,538
(They are relieved by the fact...)

1523
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:12,110
(that they will be able to put on the team performance they prepared.)

1524
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:13,909
What a relief.

1525
01:06:14,139 --> 01:06:15,909
Tears instantly filled my eyes.

1526
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,909
That's how happy and good I felt.

1527
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:21,650
The CrewOne, ONEUS, 8TURN.

1528
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:25,190
One of these three teams won first place in the Ace Battle.

1529
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:27,659
I think it'll be The CrewOne.

1530
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,460
ONEUS.

1531
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,059
- I think 8TURN was amazing. - That's right.

1532
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,460
Show us the team that won first place in the Ace Battle.

1533
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:36,859
(Which ace will win 1st place...)

1534
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,000
(in the first ranking of the Evaluation Match?)

1535
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:41,300
(Tied for 1st place: HWAN WOONG of ONEUS, Lim Jimin of The CrewOne)

1536
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:43,369
Tied for first place?

1537
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,010
- Tied for first place? - Tied for first place?

1538
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:46,510
They're tied for first place.

1539
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:50,210
We have a tie for first place.

1540
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,349
This is interesting from the start.

1541
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,879
HWAN WOONG of ONEUS, you are tied for first place.

1542
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,480
How do you feel?

1543
01:06:57,219 --> 01:06:59,518
This is actually our second time here.

1544
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,889
We never won first place last season.

1545
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,889
I feel so relieved that I won first place today.

1546
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:06,129
Thank you.

1547
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,928
(Feeling touched for winning 1st place in the 1st battle)

1548
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:09,230
Congratulations.

1549
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,730
Jimin, you are tied for first place. How do you feel?

1550
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:16,638
I feel ecstatic thinking I created a good stepping stone for the team.

1551
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:17,669
- Lim Jimin. - Lim Jimin.

1552
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,339
- You did a great job. - You did a great job.

1553
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,368
(Feeling proud)

1554
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,380
I'm jealous.

1555
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,209
These are the four teams in the lower ranking.

1556
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,009
(Ace Battle, 4 teams in the lower ranking)

1557
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:27,250
THE NEW SIX, TEMPEST,

1558
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:29,820
CRAVITY, and YOUNITE.

1559
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,389
I can't watch this.

1560
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,789
I'll feel really sorry if we are in seventh place.

1561
01:07:33,989 --> 01:07:35,860
We won't be in seventh place.

1562
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,190
We believe in you, HYEONGJUN.

1563
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:40,289
Please just don't be in last place.

1564
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:44,969
I was worried my name wouldn't be called to the end.

1565
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,199
Please...

1566
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:48,599
Show us the team...

1567
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,280
that ranked seventh in the Ace Battle.

1568
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,440
- What? Right away? - Please.

1569
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:58,150
I'm nervous.

1570
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,949
I really can't watch this.

1571
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,980
I can't watch this.

1572
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,749
(7th place)

1573
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,488
(The result is shocking...)

1574
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:10,018
(and astonishing.)

1575
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,029
Unbelievable.

1576
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:16,029
(To be continued)

1577
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,130
Show us the team that ranked seventh in the Ace Battle.

1578
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:20,630
(7th place)

1579
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,499
(Shocked)

1580
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,840
(Astonished)

1581
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,170
Unbelievable.

1582
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,738
You can never tell.

1583
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:28,938
(Who ranked 7th in the Ace Battle?)

1584
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:29,979
Show us.

1585
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,209
(7th place, CRAVITY, HYEONGJUN)

1586
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,408
(Evaluation Match, Round 1, Ace Battle, 7th place)

1587
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,680
(CRAVITY, HYEONGJUN)

1588
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:39,189
(7th place, CRAVITY, HYEONGJUN. Self-Evaluation 7 votes)

1589
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:44,689
This is unbelievable.

1590
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:47,728
(Everyone is silent.)

1591
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:49,930
You did a good job, HYEONGJUN.

1592
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,398
- It's okay. - You did really well.

1593
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:54,399
Are you okay?

1594
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,439
- It's okay. - HYEONGJUN.

1595
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:57,439
HYEONGJUN is crying. I feel bad.

1596
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,840
(His team members have a hard time saying anything.)

1597
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:05,210
(The responsibility of the ace that represents the team)

1598
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:10,619
(The members' hearts ache as they know the effort he made.)

1599
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,890
I worked hard.

1600
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,489
But I'm so sorry...

1601
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:19,659
Don't feel sorry.

1602
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,198
I...

1603
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,198
(He feels so apologetic toward the members that he can't finish.)

1604
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,569
Seriously. It's okay.

1605
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:33,640
It felt like I ruined everything in that single moment...

1606
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:36,279
after my team members made such a great effort in preparing.

1607
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,109
I am upset.

1608
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:40,210
I'm sad...

1609
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,420
we didn't get to show people our team performance.

1610
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:48,519
(The air in the green room is somber...)

1611
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,890
(at the unexpected ranking after the announcement.)

1612
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,590
You did a good job.

1613
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:55,800
You truly did a good job, HYEONGJUN.

1614
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,260
It's okay.

1615
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:00,129
We'll put on a more amazing performance next time.

1616
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,000
Yes, we'll do even better.

1617
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,469
I keep thinking about it,

1618
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,509
(I keep thinking about it.)

1619
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:10,509
but I can't admit that we're in seventh place.

1620
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,749
I'm extremely mad right now.

1621
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,149
I want to throw things.

1622
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,020
The reactions...

1623
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,420
of that moment,

1624
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,289
the situation,

1625
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,689
the ambience,

1626
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:31,000
and the emotions I felt...

1627
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:33,670
I don't want to forget any of it.

1628
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,209
I think this is also a valuable experience.

1629
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,269
When else would we get to experience something like this?

1630
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,108
What we have to do is accept the result...

1631
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:43,979
- and show them what we have. - We'll show them.

1632
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,279
I think we can grow even more due to this experience.

1633
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,879
Let's try harder with determination.

1634
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,550
- We just have to try harder. - Let's show them.

1635
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:53,890
We were determined not to break down...

1636
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,920
but show them who CRAVITY is.

1637
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:58,828
We had prepared with earnestness.

1638
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:00,789
But now will add strong determination to that.

1639
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:02,359
Don't mess with us.

1640
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,799
Since we weren't able to perform this time,

1641
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,270
we will give our next performance our very best...

1642
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,140
to show everyone what CRAVITY is made of.

1643
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:15,538
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1644
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,479
With the exception of CRAVITY, who ranked seventh place...

1645
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,679
in Ace Battle, Round One of the Evaluation Match,

1646
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,649
the 6 other teams are facing the Team Battle in Round 2.

1647
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,448
We asked the teams...

1648
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:26,589
for a 100-second performance using their own songs...

1649
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,819
that will best depict the team's identity.

1650
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,219
Are you all well-prepared?

1651
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,288
- Yes. - Yes.

1652
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:32,289
(Ready to attack)

1653
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:34,399
- Yes. - Yes.

1654
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,630
- Yes. - Yes.

1655
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,170
(We are ready to watch closely.)

1656
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:39,799
This is how the Team Battle, Round Two of the Evaluation Match...

1657
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,670
will be evaluated.

1658
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:44,608
The Self-Evaluation vote, which counts for 30 percent,

1659
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:47,709
will be added to the Streaming Evaluation, which counts for 70,

1660
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,279
to determine the final ranking.

1661
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,250
Just like the Self-Evaluation, the Streaming Judges...

1662
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,119
will also watch the performances by all six teams...

1663
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,750
and vote for the top three teams.

1664
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,590
We also have votes, so we need to watch closely.

1665
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,520
The Streaming Evaluation takes up a lot.

1666
01:12:03,789 --> 01:12:05,528
When they watch the stream,

1667
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:09,560
I don't think they'll be able to feel the overwhelming sensation.

1668
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,129
I thought it was bad for us.

1669
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:15,100
I thought that our performance looked better on camera,

1670
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,608
so I was expecting high points...

1671
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:19,810
from the Streaming Evaluation.

1672
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,209
And the winning team of the Team Battle...

1673
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:25,749
will have the upper hand in Round One.

1674
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,778
This is huge.

1675
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:28,449
- We need to win. - Definitely.

1676
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,550
We have to win.

1677
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,919
Before we begin the Team Battle,

1678
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,189
there's a very important issue we must address.

1679
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,089
It's time.

1680
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,959
(Lim Jimin of The CrewOne and HWAN WOONG of ONEUS)

1681
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,828
We have the final winner after revoting.

1682
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:42,999
Who thinks ONEUS was better?

1683
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,630
(The other 5 teams revoted.)

1684
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,738
Who will write the cue sheet for Team Battle?

1685
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:53,970
I will announce the final winner of Ace Battle.

1686
01:12:54,739 --> 01:12:56,879
- Let's go. - It's fine even if we lose.

1687
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,279
- It's fine. - But I think we'll win.

1688
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,949
It's the smallest team versus the largest team.

1689
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,079
(Amazed)

1690
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:07,219
- Let's find out. - I'm curious.

1691
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,489
- The winning team. - Whoever wins, they were both cool.

1692
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:12,159
The final winner of Ace Battle is...

1693
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,399
(The senior team or a joint team. Which team will win?)

1694
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:16,759
(1st place, ONEUS, HWAN WOONG)

1695
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,529
It's HWAN WOONG of ONEUS.

1696
01:13:19,029 --> 01:13:21,300
(HWAN WOONG is the final winner of the Ace Battle.)

1697
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:22,369
(Jimin is second runner-up.)

1698
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,299
- Congratulations. - All my sorrow...

1699
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,139
- I'm so proud of you. - disappears.

1700
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,140
Great job.

1701
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:30,438
I felt like I was acknowledged by my skills after such a long time,

1702
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,449
so I was over the moon.

1703
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,649
Also, it was right after I reappeared,

1704
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,550
so I feel even prouder and delighted.

1705
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,789
You're number one in our hearts.

1706
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,560
- That's still impressive. - Well done.

1707
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,920
You were so cool.

1708
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,059
(Evaluation Match, Ace Ranking)

1709
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,528
(HWAN WOONG, Lim Jimin, )

1710
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:48,658
(MYUNG HO, JUNHYEOK, DEY, )

1711
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:49,829
(HANBIN, and HYEONGJUN)

1712
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:53,069
(Their pride is on the line for Team Battle.)

1713
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:56,970
(Their distinctive performances)

1714
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:02,339
(And a performance that's like a movie)

1715
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,609
How do they dance like that?

1716
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,108
You killed it!

1717
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:08,380
(What's the result of the unpredictable Team Battle?)

1718
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:11,649
The winner of Ace Battle and the ace of ONEUS, HWAN WOONG.

1719
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,250
Please tell us the first team of Team Battle.

1720
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,760
- Right away? - Oh, no. Right away?

1721
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,329
Oh, my gosh.

1722
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:20,129
Please don't make us go first.

1723
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:21,760
Not the first performance.

1724
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,430
The first team to perform...

1725
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,529
(Turning)

1726
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:28,000
(Telling through his eyes)

1727
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,639
Don't look at us.

1728
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,640
- Don't look at us! - Please don't.

1729
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:33,669
It's THE NEW SIX.

1730
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,978
(The first team to perform is THE NEW SIX.)

1731
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:38,909
I knew this would happen.

1732
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:41,618
We've been watching the performance by THE NEW SIX...

1733
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:44,219
while we were active.

1734
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,019
And we believe...

1735
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,118
they're the most formidable team.

1736
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,259
(The senior singer shows respect and wins their hearts.)

1737
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,260
Thank you.

1738
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,260
(Thank you, senior.)

1739
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,260
I envy them.

1740
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:55,460
We were secretly hoping it'd be us.

1741
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,430
You won first place after you performed first.

1742
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,770
(What is he trying to say?)

1743
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:05,069
Thank you for this gift.

1744
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,108
Let's keep this energy going.

1745
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:08,109
Good luck!

1746
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,310
- I can't wait to watch it. - They must be nervous.

1747
01:15:10,579 --> 01:15:11,649
Let's go!

1748
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:13,149
Let's do this.

1749
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,219
(When the rankings of the public popularity vote...)

1750
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,619
(were announced)

1751
01:15:17,149 --> 01:15:20,948
(THE NEW SIX placed 7th and wasn't so happy with it.)

1752
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:23,260
I don't think we were able to present all six of us...

1753
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,689
in front of the public because I had been inactive for so long.

1754
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:31,000
All I want to do is show people our team's performance.

1755
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,568
While we were preparing for Road to Kingdom,

1756
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:36,239
the six of us became one.

1757
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,970
I want to perform exactly how we practiced, so we don't regret it.

1758
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:42,239
The six of us will become one...

1759
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,439
and give you a great performance.

1760
01:15:45,109 --> 01:15:46,778
- What is that? - What's that?

1761
01:15:46,779 --> 01:15:47,849
They have something wrapped around them.

1762
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:51,420
- It must be connected to the rope. - You're right. There's a story.

1763
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,729
("Move" and "Fuego" by THE NEW SIX)

1764
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,670
What?

1765
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:03,948
Fantastic!

1766
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:04,989
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1767
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:12,359
They killed it.

1768
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,260
That was insane.

1769
01:18:14,829 --> 01:18:17,229
The details were insane.

1770
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,000
Great job.

1771
01:18:19,869 --> 01:18:21,369
- Good job, guys. - Good job.

1772
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,340
- Good job. - That was great.

1773
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,839
I hadn't felt that in so long.

1774
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,109
The feeling when all six of us finished a performance.

1775
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,439
Like, "We've done it. We showed them everything."

1776
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:34,379
It was a little technical,

1777
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,919
so we couldn't have done it if all six of us...

1778
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,850
hadn't been united.

1779
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:42,460
But there's this energy you feel just by having them by your side.

1780
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:45,288
(They filled the stage with their unique drive.)

1781
01:18:45,289 --> 01:18:47,029
- They're so good. - They're strong.

1782
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,329
It felt so short.

1783
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:51,670
- That means they were good. - They were.

1784
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,970
How do all six of them give off such a strong energy?

1785
01:18:54,069 --> 01:18:56,269
No wonder the ONEUS members think they're formidable.

1786
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,539
They proved it.

1787
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:00,909
Now, we get to sit back and watch.

1788
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:02,879
- Well done, guys. - Well done.

1789
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,810
It's nerve-racking because we don't know the cue sheet.

1790
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:06,979
- Could it be us? - Don't be afraid.

1791
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:10,019
We might have to go last,

1792
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,289
- so we should stay warmed up. - Right.

1793
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:15,118
I thought they might have the team to watch out for...

1794
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:16,920
perform last.

1795
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,288
I couldn't help but get nervous.

1796
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:19,828
- Is it in the order of skill? - No.

1797
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:21,858
They might have put us before ONEUS...

1798
01:19:21,859 --> 01:19:24,329
because they think we're weak.

1799
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,599
- Should I go and ask them? - No, they scare me.

1800
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,799
We don't know when we're going, and we just have to wait?

1801
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,800
I know.

1802
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,270
They must be constantly nervous.

1803
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,270
(Even jealous of that)

1804
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:34,309
- Who do you think is next? - Who's next?

1805
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,310
(Who's performing second?)

1806
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,109
The second performer of the Team Battle is...

1807
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,109
We need to stay on our toes now.

1808
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:41,520
Who is it?

1809
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:45,749
It's The CrewOne.

1810
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,849
Okay! Let's go!

1811
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,760
- Let's do this. - All right, guys.

1812
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:51,890
Let's get out there!

1813
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,390
Please prepare for your performance.

1814
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,859
That's a lot of people.

1815
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,169
It's Mega CrewOne.

1816
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,929
- "Mega CrewOne?" - Yes.

1817
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:00,930
Let's see.

1818
01:20:00,931 --> 01:20:03,599
Having two groups together and being compatible...

1819
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,340
might work against them.

1820
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:07,640
I wonder what their performance will be like.

1821
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:12,880
We're making our debut on Road to Kingdom as The CrewOne.

1822
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:15,149
We were determined to show them who we were.

1823
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,520
Though it was a short period, we practiced really hard...

1824
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,858
for better chemistry and to look like one team.

1825
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:26,060
We'll show you our unity and energy through this performance.

1826
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,430
I'm ready.

1827
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:29,329
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1828
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,899
It's our debut performance. Let's go and get it, guys.

1829
01:20:32,729 --> 01:20:34,000
Three, two, one.

1830
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:35,470
Let's go.

1831
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,279
("One Light Becomes One Time" by The CrewOne)

1832
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,818
There's the sandglass.

1833
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:55,989
The story continues.

1834
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:19,279
They're so in sync!

1835
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,430
(Cheering)

1836
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:57,420
Isn't this a mega crew?

1837
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:12,970
That's insane.

1838
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:30,250
Amazing.

1839
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:36,889
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1840
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:37,960
Seriously.

1841
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,728
(Cheering excitedly for the powerful performance)

1842
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:43,228
Did they portray a blooming flower to show that the two groups...

1843
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:44,959
- united? - I guess so.

1844
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,269
They have such good teamwork,

1845
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:47,528
even though they united not so long ago.

1846
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:48,639
I was so surprised.

1847
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,969
They're really in sync.

1848
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,809
It's not easy to look in sync from the side.

1849
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,340
They kind of look like THE BOYZ back in the day.

1850
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:59,408
We finished the first performance that we worked so hard for,

1851
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:00,448
so we thought, "It's begun."

1852
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,448
We will win in today's evaluation...

1853
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:05,288
and finish as the winner in the last episode.

1854
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:06,420
Please look forward to it.

1855
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,889
I bet it looks way different on stage and on camera.

1856
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:12,689
They focused on the live atmosphere.

1857
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,028
Their performance was way better than expected,

1858
01:23:15,029 --> 01:23:17,229
but it was like watching dancerse perform.

1859
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:19,399
They did seem like a dance crew.

1860
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,528
They could have done better.

1861
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,769
I feel like they could have expressed more things,

1862
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,038
but they only showed us their dance skills.

1863
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:28,510
- Their dancing was really good. - Very good.

1864
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,679
I can't wait to watch the rest.

1865
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,709
(Which team will go third?)

1866
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,549
We should actually get ready now. I feel like it's going to be us.

1867
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,578
Right.

1868
01:23:34,579 --> 01:23:36,318
(Extremely nervous)

1869
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:37,550
I'm scared.

1870
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:39,689
I'm scared.

1871
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,420
It's 8TURN.

1872
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,560
(8TURN)

1873
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,859
It's 8TURN.

1874
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,529
(The moment of truth is here early.)

1875
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:51,129
- Good luck! - Good luck.

1876
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,829
All right, 8TURN.

1877
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,630
- Let's go! - We've got this.

1878
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,069
Let's go, guys.

1879
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,339
It's the Evaluation Match,

1880
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,108
and we're showcasing our performance for the first time.

1881
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:01,239
I hope it's got 8TURN's vibe.

1882
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:05,010
Even the lyrics mean, "We're going to show you."

1883
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:08,478
The song is pretty young, vigorous,

1884
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,850
and has the sensation of a spark.

1885
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,090
I think we chose a pretty good song.

1886
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:16,158
I think so too.

1887
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,420
We've got such a good plan.

1888
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:21,528
Our theme is the young and vigorous energy.

1889
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:24,158
You'll be able to understand it better...

1890
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,800
if you think of it as a sports match.

1891
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
- We'll show you. - This is 8TURN!

1892
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,068
Sexy guy.

1893
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:32,939
It's pretty sexy.

1894
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,810
(Why are they cheering?)

1895
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:40,180
(His abs are back)

1896
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,479
(Half jealous...)

1897
01:24:41,649 --> 01:24:42,778
(and half pleased)

1898
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:44,520
Six-pack abs. Respect!

1899
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,949
(8TURN's performance begins by catching everyone's attention.)

1900
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,890
Team 8TURN.

1901
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,829
Oh, yes.

1902
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,630
Awesome.

1903
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,939
Champions.

1904
01:25:04,569 --> 01:25:06,039
"Championship?"

1905
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,479
His face...

1906
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:25,529
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1907
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,720
No way.

1908
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,670
- Yes! - What was that?

1909
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:08,369
Yes!

1910
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,270
Hey!

1911
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,920
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1912
01:26:57,819 --> 01:27:00,949
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1913
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,020
(The newest team's performance gets a standing ovation.)

1914
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:10,100
- It was so well-structured. - Awesome.

1915
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,130
They're very characteristic.

1916
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,399
They were practically flying.

1917
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,729
Well done.

1918
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:19,608
I started keeping an eye on 8TURN today.

1919
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,569
I'm not exactly a fan of refreshing songs.

1920
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,408
But it was my first time...

1921
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:25,409
thinking a refreshing song was cool.

1922
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,978
I will now remember...

1923
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:30,250
the group called 8TURN.

1924
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,719
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

1925
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,449
- You were great. - You were so cool.

1926
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,519
It was like I watched a game of football.

1927
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,260
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1928
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,260
Abs never betray you.

1929
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:42,729
They never do.

1930
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:46,198
They really came prepared...

1931
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:48,068
- for the Team Battle. - I know, right?

1932
01:27:48,069 --> 01:27:49,770
Maybe we should have gone first.

1933
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,439
I suddenly want to go home.

1934
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,710
They're all so good.

1935
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:56,609
- I feel like we're next. - I'm sure.

1936
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:58,078
The underdog revolts.

1937
01:27:58,079 --> 01:27:59,309
(Arf)

1938
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:02,078
We think we're barking,

1939
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:04,020
and we look like we're going, "Arf!"

1940
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,590
Like a Chihuahua.

1941
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:08,020
(A Chihuahua, you say?)

1942
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,560
(A Chihuahua with grills on doesn't hold back.)

1943
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:14,460
The fourth performer of the Team Battle.

1944
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:16,699
- It's about time. - It's going to be TEMPEST.

1945
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:17,959
YOUNITE.

1946
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,898
(He's ready to go all out.)

1947
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:21,568
It's YOUNITE.

1948
01:28:21,569 --> 01:28:22,970
(The fourth performer is YOUNITE.)

1949
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,568
(It's time.)

1950
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:25,569
I knew it.

1951
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,739
It's YOUNITE.

1952
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,509
(It's still not our turn?)

1953
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:31,209
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1954
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,310
You've got this.

1955
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,250
- He's got grills. - Good luck.

1956
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:37,318
They were wearing red clothes.

1957
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:38,579
I had no idea what it was.

1958
01:28:38,789 --> 01:28:40,719
They usually sang cute and pure songs,

1959
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,119
so that was my expectation.

1960
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:47,089
We decided to change our innocent image.

1961
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:50,198
We're going to show how dark and powerful we can be.

1962
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,198
I want to surprise them.

1963
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:54,669
We want them to think that we can pull off...

1964
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:55,839
various genres.

1965
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,238
Our goal is to make them...

1966
01:28:57,239 --> 01:28:59,538
keep an eye on us through this performance.

1967
01:28:59,539 --> 01:29:01,569
We'll give you a great show.

1968
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:03,310
(YOUNITE is on the stage.)

1969
01:29:03,409 --> 01:29:04,710
They have masks.

1970
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,350
And rifles.

1971
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,209
What are those?

1972
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:10,180
- That's really unexpected. - It looks awkward.

1973
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:11,349
I wonder what it is.

1974
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,949
I can't wait to watch it.

1975
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,220
- What was that? - That startled me.

1976
01:29:15,221 --> 01:29:16,459
(EUNSANG warms up his voice pretty violently.)

1977
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:17,460
What?

1978
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:19,429
What is that? I'm scared.

1979
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,259
He's trying to intimidate us.

1980
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,299
Was that EUNSANG?

1981
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,060
I didn't know he could make that voice.

1982
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,368
I've never seen EUNSANG cry out before.

1983
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:27,568
This should be fun.

1984
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:28,869
(How will their surprising performance be?)

1985
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,909
Team YOUNITE.

1986
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,310
What's that?

1987
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:39,949
What is that?

1988
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:54,590
That scared me.

1989
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,549
- Oh, no. - Wait.

1990
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:21,119
- Sorry! - No.

1991
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,819
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1992
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,318
(They cheer for the charismatic performance.)

1993
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,430
(Clapping automatically)

1994
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,028
(They're so shocked that they can't move.)

1995
01:31:34,029 --> 01:31:35,158
I'll take one, please!

1996
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:36,659
It was like a movie.

1997
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:38,060
You guys killed it!

1998
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,898
- Did you get shot? - I dodged all of them.

1999
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:41,199
I took all the bullets.

2000
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:43,300
I didn't know they could do that.

2001
01:31:43,369 --> 01:31:44,898
It's more surprising...

2002
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,709
- because we weren't expecting it. - Right?

2003
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:51,538
YOUNITE in my head used to sing refreshing songs.

2004
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:55,148
But watching them perform so powerfully today made me...

2005
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:57,619
realize that they were capable of pulling off all genres.

2006
01:31:57,949 --> 01:31:59,419
(YOUNITE successfully finished the performance.)

2007
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,420
That was so cool.

2008
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:02,020
They stole my heart.

2009
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:03,420
Thieves!

2010
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:05,788
I'm glad...

2011
01:32:05,789 --> 01:32:10,099
that everyone thinks,

2012
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,100
"They're not such easy opponents."

2013
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,899
The fifth performer of the Team Battle is...

2014
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:17,198
Which team will it be?

2015
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,140
- I think it'll be ONEUS. - I think it's TEMPEST.

2016
01:32:19,369 --> 01:32:21,369
- TEMPEST? - Get ready, guys.

2017
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:24,680
It's TEMPEST.

2018
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:28,550
- Good luck! - Let's go!

2019
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,979
Let's go!

2020
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,649
I wonder what theme they chose.

2021
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:35,020
- We've waited long enough. - Too long.

2022
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,219
Every time a group finished a performance,

2023
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,890
we got up and warmed up.

2024
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:41,459
I feel like it's us.

2025
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,260
Let's get warmed up.

2026
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:44,658
We said, "We're going to be next."

2027
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:46,229
"Let's warm up."

2028
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:48,029
THE NEW SIX.

2029
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,869
(TEMPEST's name wasn't called.)

2030
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:53,238
All right.

2031
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:54,939
And our group's name wasn't called.

2032
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:57,880
I don't know how many times I warmed up here.

2033
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:59,710
What if we're last?

2034
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,350
There's no way.

2035
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,619
If we're fifth, it means we're the weakest.

2036
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:07,420
He said that he'd impress us next.

2037
01:33:07,789 --> 01:33:08,818
(We chose the order...)

2038
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:13,260
(so that we can stand out as much as possible.)

2039
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:14,989
This is crazy.

2040
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,898
Our expected ranking was sixth.

2041
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:21,599
And HANBIN's performance in the Ace Battle was sixth.

2042
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,239
So, I realized that other teams thought we were weak.

2043
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:29,639
- You know we can do this. - We can do this.

2044
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,778
Let's put all our effort into it.

2045
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:31,840
Yes.

2046
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,680
Put your all into it.

2047
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:39,520
I wasn't going to place sixth this time again.

2048
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:41,889
We practiced dozens of times a day.

2049
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:42,890
We did.

2050
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:44,658
We literally gave our all.

2051
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:47,559
We've practiced for almost 11 hours today.

2052
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,029
Do you see the traces of our practice on the floor?

2053
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:52,669
We practiced...

2054
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,429
to the final version of the final version.

2055
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,499
We'll show you who TEMPEST really is.

2056
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,569
Four!

2057
01:33:57,739 --> 01:33:59,309
- "Road." - Road to Kingdom.

2058
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,710
- "To." - Today.

2059
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,310
- "King." - Let's all be kings.

2060
01:34:02,979 --> 01:34:04,438
(That was great.)

2061
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:06,680
- Oh, my gosh. - That was amazing.

2062
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:08,608
You hit a home run for once.

2063
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:10,449
(EUNCHAN hit a proper home run.)

2064
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:16,720
Team TEMPEST.

2065
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:03,439
Let's go, guys.

2066
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,779
No way.

2067
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,069
- Nice. - That was insane.

2068
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:07,430
They dance so hard.

2069
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:09,670
It wasn't exactly cute.

2070
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,939
They almost flew.

2071
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,409
Nice.

2072
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:19,449
It must have been so tough to keep the balance.

2073
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:20,810
That was purely practice.

2074
01:36:21,149 --> 01:36:23,380
They were on the pole and everything,

2075
01:36:23,579 --> 01:36:25,549
and I was impressed, going,

2076
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:27,550
"What is that? How do they dance like that?"

2077
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,059
Brilliant ideas...

2078
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,859
and harmony that comes from their group dance. I loved it.

2079
01:36:32,989 --> 01:36:35,029
It was a neat performance with no flaws.

2080
01:36:36,229 --> 01:36:38,959
Their teamwork really stood out in this one.

2081
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,868
I enjoyed your performance, TEMPEST.

2082
01:36:40,869 --> 01:36:42,029
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2083
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:45,269
- Thank you. - But I heard...

2084
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:48,670
that HYUK slightly injured his shoulder.

2085
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:50,880
(Backstage after the performance)

2086
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,880
Can I...

2087
01:36:51,881 --> 01:36:55,009
go to my manager for a minute?

2088
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:56,148
My shoulder is dislocated.

2089
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:57,319
It's dislocated?

2090
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,488
As I was flipping the pole,

2091
01:36:59,489 --> 01:37:01,619
I dislocated my shoulder and lost balance.

2092
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:05,219
I didn't care about the pain.

2093
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:08,430
I just wanted to finish our performance.

2094
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:11,329
I felt really sorry...

2095
01:37:11,529 --> 01:37:13,869
that I might ruin the performance.

2096
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:15,470
Did you put on a pain relief patch?

2097
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:17,639
Don't do that.

2098
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,699
Don't raise your arm.

2099
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,539
It's going up, so I think it's fine.

2100
01:37:23,539 --> 01:37:25,139
He kept saying that he was fine,

2101
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,479
but that could not be true.

2102
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:28,250
Of course, he's not fine.

2103
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:32,119
As the leader, I felt thankful and apologetic.

2104
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,489
What's that?

2105
01:37:36,119 --> 01:37:38,390
(He spotted the moving camera.)

2106
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:41,260
(Hi, camera!)

2107
01:37:41,261 --> 01:37:42,930
Look at the camera down there.

2108
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:44,029
Hi.

2109
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,569
(I know.)

2110
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,129
(The newest team finds a moving camera fun.)

2111
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,130
It moved.

2112
01:37:49,699 --> 01:37:51,399
Do you want to say hi to the camera together?

2113
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,810
Hi.

2114
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:54,068
I'm Oh Junseok.

2115
01:37:54,069 --> 01:37:55,840
Does it do the nod?

2116
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:57,210
Can't it?

2117
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:58,680
He's pretty tired too.

2118
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,148
It's the last performance. Hang in there.

2119
01:38:01,149 --> 01:38:02,449
- Hang in there. - It's the last one?

2120
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,380
It's ONEUS's turn now.

2121
01:38:04,819 --> 01:38:06,118
(They're already prepared.)

2122
01:38:06,119 --> 01:38:08,618
Choosing themselves to perform last is...

2123
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:10,219
- It's not easy. - I bet it wasn't.

2124
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,920
It shows how confident they are.

2125
01:38:12,859 --> 01:38:15,328
It's their second time on Road to Kingdom.

2126
01:38:15,329 --> 01:38:19,130
I believe they know how to prepare for the competition better than us.

2127
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:22,029
They gave off such a relaxed vibe.

2128
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,039
Bring it on.

2129
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:26,709
This is our second time here,

2130
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:29,609
so our goal isn't the final round. It's the championship.

2131
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:31,939
We came here with determination and grit.

2132
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:33,849
I believe it's different from the first season.

2133
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:35,309
It's our sixth year,

2134
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:37,778
so we have more experience and know what to do.

2135
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:38,949
I think we'll do well.

2136
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:42,519
We mean to be the game changer.

2137
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,619
Right.

2138
01:38:43,789 --> 01:38:45,219
An invasive species.

2139
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,828
- Bring it on, all of you! - An invasive species.

2140
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:48,089
Why is ONEUS here?

2141
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,599
We're going to turn it upside down.

2142
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,630
Our only job is to nail the performance.

2143
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,228
- ONEUS, let's go! - Yes!

2144
01:38:53,229 --> 01:38:54,229
We've got this.

2145
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,000
This time, we'll win...

2146
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:01,439
the Team Battle and the Ace Battle.

2147
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,250
Team ONEUS.

2148
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,619
("Intro: Who Got the Joker?" by ONEUS)

2149
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,829
It's like a concert.

2150
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:42,449
- What's going on? - Awesome.

2151
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,390
It's the Joker!

2152
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,060
What's happening?

2153
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,960
What is it?

2154
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:33,899
Oh, no.

2155
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:37,270
Did he actually shoot him?

2156
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:42,109
Let's go!

2157
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,180
All right!

2158
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:55,420
- Hey! - Hey!

2159
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:14,439
Joker.

2160
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,279
They put on the lipstick.

2161
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:19,648
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

2162
01:41:19,649 --> 01:41:20,979
Joker.

2163
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:23,050
ONEUS!

2164
01:41:24,149 --> 01:41:25,249
Joker!

2165
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,890
- Joker. - Joker.

2166
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:28,550
- They actually did the mouth. - Yes.

2167
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,759
LEE DO couldn't do the Joker makeup.

2168
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,760
(LEE DO couldn't do the Joker makeup.)

2169
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:38,329
(He failed to put on Joker's makeup, which was the last highlight.)

2170
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:39,999
Gosh.

2171
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,029
It wasn't ready.

2172
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:43,898
I missed the highlight.

2173
01:41:43,899 --> 01:41:45,770
It fell as I turned.

2174
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,670
(The paint fell.)

2175
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:50,680
I have so many regrets.

2176
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:53,380
I dropped the prop at the start.

2177
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:57,819
It was my first time dropping a prop.

2178
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:01,250
I was off to a bad start.

2179
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,659
I feel like I didn't perform as well as I did during practice.

2180
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:07,130
I have a lot of regrets.

2181
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,130
I'm so furious.

2182
01:42:09,859 --> 01:42:11,930
This is hard.

2183
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,039
You have all finished both evaluation matches.

2184
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:19,869
Thank you for your hard work.

2185
01:42:20,609 --> 01:42:21,970
- All right! - Good job!

2186
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:23,479
You were amazing.

2187
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:25,680
- Good job, guys. - Good job.

2188
01:42:25,979 --> 01:42:28,609
I could tell everyone was so determined to win.

2189
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,979
I think this will be a matter of personal preference.

2190
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:34,989
This was a chance for us to show how much energy we had.

2191
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:37,020
I got a lot of motivation.

2192
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:39,489
We needed to know our opponent to know how to win them,

2193
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:41,930
so we thought of them as our competitors.

2194
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:46,499
Here are the results for the Team Battle ranking...

2195
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,470
with 30 percent from Self-Evaluation and 70 percent from Streaming.

2196
01:42:48,899 --> 01:42:51,569
The results could turn out different based on the Streaming Evaluation.

2197
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:54,739
Let me announce the Team Battle results.

2198
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:58,579
- I'm so scared. - Me too.

2199
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:00,510
My heart is beating so fast.

2200
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:02,779
Please...

2201
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,189
(Ace Ranking, Team Ranking)

2202
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,489
- What is it? - That startled me.

2203
01:43:11,659 --> 01:43:12,659
That scared me!

2204
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:16,028
Look, CRAVITY is in the seventh place.

2205
01:43:16,029 --> 01:43:17,259
They could've erased that part.

2206
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,930
I don't think I can watch this.

2207
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:25,270
Let me announce the third place for the Team Battle.

2208
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,869
- Oh, my. - The third place would be great.

2209
01:43:29,109 --> 01:43:30,738
At least MYUNG HO is already in the third place.

2210
01:43:30,739 --> 01:43:32,739
It's incredible that he got there.

2211
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:35,779
I'd be so happy to see our team in third place now.

2212
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:37,279
I hope we win third place.

2213
01:43:37,619 --> 01:43:38,619
The third place.

2214
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,619
I'm expecting to get a low ranking because I made quite a few mistakes.

2215
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:45,960
(Will ONEUS win third place after their powerful performance?)

2216
01:43:46,489 --> 01:43:48,560
Please show us the third place for the Team Ranking.

2217
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:51,228
(Team Ranking with CRAVITY in the seventh place)

2218
01:43:51,229 --> 01:43:53,500
(3. ONEUS)

2219
01:43:55,029 --> 01:43:56,029
- Really? - No way.

2220
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:00,010
(The faces of ONEUS light up while the others are surprised.)

2221
01:44:00,869 --> 01:44:03,339
I thought they'd win first place.

2222
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,679
- Then who won first place? - I didn't expect this.

2223
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,609
It wasn't satisfactory, but I felt relieved.

2224
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:11,049
We didn't expect to win first place...

2225
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:13,319
when we ourselves weren't satisfied with our own performances.

2226
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:16,050
But we can't settle for this.

2227
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,260
This is becoming unpredictable.

2228
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:19,890
Then, who won the 1st and 2nd place?

2229
01:44:20,189 --> 01:44:22,260
- Groups that start with "The." - Those groups?

2230
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,858
Their performances made quite an impact.

2231
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:25,960
(TNX and The CrewOne are candidates for first place.)

2232
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:27,929
Next is the fourth place for the Team Ranking.

2233
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:29,170
(Announcing 4th place for the Team Ranking)

2234
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,899
- Could it be YOUNITE? - Is it YOUNITE?

2235
01:44:32,539 --> 01:44:34,810
(Could it be YOUNITE that showed a shocking performance?)

2236
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:36,438
They were all so good.

2237
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:38,140
- I agree. - I'd love to win fourth place.

2238
01:44:38,779 --> 01:44:40,408
Winning fourth place doesn't sound too bad.

2239
01:44:40,409 --> 01:44:42,478
I hope our team gets called.

2240
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:44,819
Please let it be 8TURN.

2241
01:44:45,449 --> 01:44:48,020
(Which team won 4th place in the Evaluation Match?)

2242
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:51,520
(Everyone seems surprised at the result.)

2243
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,689
(4. THE NEW SIX)

2244
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:56,929
The fourth place in the Team Ranking goes to THE NEW SIX.

2245
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,099
(THE NEW SIX)

2246
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,299
I thought they were going to win first place.

2247
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,829
But they did an amazing job.

2248
01:45:02,569 --> 01:45:06,909
(TNX left a strong impression despite being the first to perform.)

2249
01:45:07,109 --> 01:45:08,408
- THE NEW SIX. - THE NEW SIX.

2250
01:45:08,409 --> 01:45:10,310
I voted for THE NEW SIX.

2251
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,078
(With 1st in Self-Evaluation and 6th in Streaming, they won 4th place.)

2252
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:14,809
We believe we did a good job,

2253
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:18,220
so we thought we'd make it within the top three, at least.

2254
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:19,789
We're quite sad about it.

2255
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:22,520
We'll make sure to capture the public's attention.

2256
01:45:23,289 --> 01:45:26,118
Next is the fifth place for the Team Ranking.

2257
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,560
I hope we don't get called now.

2258
01:45:27,829 --> 01:45:30,630
We're safe as long as we're not in the 5th or 6th place.

2259
01:45:30,899 --> 01:45:32,859
I just hope it's not us in the sixth place.

2260
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,930
(Not the 6th place!)

2261
01:45:35,369 --> 01:45:37,970
Let's just accept our fate whatever ranking we fall into.

2262
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:40,369
- Will it be us in the 5th or 6th? - I think so.

2263
01:45:41,609 --> 01:45:43,710
(Which team won the 5th place in the Team Battle?)

2264
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:50,479
(5. YOUNITE)

2265
01:45:50,619 --> 01:45:52,148
What?

2266
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:53,220
But they were good.

2267
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:54,989
We won fifth place in the Evaluation Match.

2268
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:58,020
I was really expecting to get into the top rankings.

2269
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:01,060
But I guess we're still at the bottom.

2270
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,529
At least we showed them we're not in the seventh place.

2271
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:05,930
We went up...

2272
01:46:06,869 --> 01:46:07,930
from the 7th place to the 5th.

2273
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:11,899
(3. ONEUS, 4. THE NEW SIX, 5. YOUNITE, 7. CRAVITY)

2274
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:14,409
Now, we have three teams left.

2275
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:17,579
These are The CrewOne, 8TURN, and TEMPEST.

2276
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:20,579
Let me announce the second place first.

2277
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,810
Please pray for us.

2278
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:24,919
I'd be so thrilled if it was us in the second place.

2279
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,319
Don't get your hopes up.

2280
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,649
- You guys aren't expecting it? - No.

2281
01:46:29,289 --> 01:46:30,720
(ONEUS, THE NEW SIX, YOUNITE)

2282
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:34,358
I thought we'd be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th place, but we weren't.

2283
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:37,100
Now, I'm hoping it's us in the second place.

2284
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,100
Here's the second place for the Team Ranking.

2285
01:46:42,829 --> 01:46:44,800
(TEMPEST)

2286
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:46,770
(TEMPEST won second place for the Team Battle.)

2287
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:48,839
(Really?)

2288
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,038
My gosh.

2289
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:52,438
- Is this for real? - What did I tell you?

2290
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:54,180
I told you we had a chance.

2291
01:46:54,579 --> 01:46:56,050
HYEONGSEOP is finally smiling.

2292
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,520
He did his best despite the injury.

2293
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:00,090
I voted for TEMPEST.

2294
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:03,459
They were jumping and flying all over the place.

2295
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,390
I could tell they practiced really hard.

2296
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:09,930
They managed to avoid the last rank through one vote in the Ace Ranking.

2297
01:47:10,029 --> 01:47:12,000
I guess they were only one vote apart from CRAVITY.

2298
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:13,829
It was only one vote apart.

2299
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,430
They almost didn't get to show a performance that won second place.

2300
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:20,309
Winning the second place felt like receiving a surprise present.

2301
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:22,339
We're so thankful for it.

2302
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:23,340
(Thankful for winning second place)

2303
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:26,909
We only have two rankings left.

2304
01:47:27,079 --> 01:47:28,579
They're the 1st and the 6th place.

2305
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,750
It's the youngest team and the one that made their debut today.

2306
01:47:31,979 --> 01:47:33,250
I think The CrewOne won first place.

2307
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:35,989
I was so shocked after watching The CrewOne.

2308
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:39,659
They reminded me of "Street Man Fighter."

2309
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:42,329
If they win first place for this, then it means they won both battles.

2310
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:44,858
- We can win this, guys. - Yes, we can.

2311
01:47:44,859 --> 01:47:46,100
(The CrewOne is aiming to win after winning the Ace Battle.)

2312
01:47:46,699 --> 01:47:49,100
I suppose we're in the sixth place.

2313
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:50,539
It's okay. We did a good job.

2314
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,810
- I feel like 8TURN is going to win. - I think so too.

2315
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:58,340
8TURN's performance exceeded our expectations.

2316
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:01,680
- This is unpredictable. - I can't make up my mind either.

2317
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:04,680
To SEUNG HEON of 8TURN and Junmin of The CrewOne,

2318
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:06,750
what do you think will be your team's ranking?

2319
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,319
Even if we win the sixth place,

2320
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:11,720
we believe we have poured out our passion into our performance,

2321
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,560
so we don't have any regrets regardless of the ranking.

2322
01:48:16,359 --> 01:48:19,528
We agree with 8TURN.

2323
01:48:19,529 --> 01:48:22,328
We'd like to focus on the idea that we have no regrets...

2324
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:23,640
in our performance,

2325
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:25,999
so whatever the result is,

2326
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,210
we are determined to work harder for our next performance, but...

2327
01:48:28,569 --> 01:48:29,670
(But?)

2328
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:33,550
I'd like to proudly say that we have a chance...

2329
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,149
of winning the first place.

2330
01:48:35,449 --> 01:48:36,449
Please.

2331
01:48:36,449 --> 01:48:37,449
(Please give us the first place.)

2332
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:39,318
I really begged...

2333
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:41,789
for us to win the first place.

2334
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:43,560
The first place belongs to The CrewOne.

2335
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,760
We never got to win anything even after releasing three albums.

2336
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,630
We'll do better in the next performance.

2337
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:50,930
Just keep smiling no matter what the result is.

2338
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,328
(The CrewOne versus 8TURN)

2339
01:48:53,329 --> 01:48:56,699
(Which team will win the first place for the Team Battle?)

2340
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:00,369
(2. TEMPEST 3. ONEUS 4. THE NEW SIX 5. YOUNITE 7. CRAVITY)

2341
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,679
(1st place)

2342
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,978
(To be continued)

2343
01:49:09,979 --> 01:49:12,920
(2. TEMPEST 3. ONEUS 4. THE NEW SIX 5. YOUNITE 7. CRAVITY)

2344
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:18,318
(Team Ranking)

2345
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:20,130
(1st place: 8TURN)

2346
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:24,829
(8TURN won 1st place for the Team Battle.)

2347
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,000
(Is this real?)

2348
01:49:30,569 --> 01:49:32,099
(1st place: 8TURN)

2349
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,140
This is amazing.

2350
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:35,639
Congratulations.

2351
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,109
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2352
01:49:38,539 --> 01:49:40,909
(8TURN wins first place in the Evaluation Match.)

2353
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:43,818
(They're celebrating now because they didn't get to earlier.)

2354
01:49:43,819 --> 01:49:45,979
We worked really hard for this.

2355
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:49,148
So this is how winning the first place feels like.

2356
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:50,618
My tears swelled up a little.

2357
01:49:50,619 --> 01:49:53,559
I think it's because we never won anything ever since our debut.

2358
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:55,689
- This was our first win ever. - Our first win.

2359
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:59,800
I felt like we got acknowledged from a lot of people.

2360
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:04,038
I think we can prepare the first match with a healthy mindset now.

2361
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:05,039
(We'll do our best.)

2362
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:09,269
As a result, The CrewOne falls into sixth place.

2363
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:11,438
- It's okay. - It's fine.

2364
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:12,640
(6th place: The CrewOne)

2365
01:50:12,909 --> 01:50:15,010
Lastly, the seventh place belongs to CRAVITY.

2366
01:50:15,479 --> 01:50:16,818
(7th place: CRAVITY)

2367
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:17,979
The Evaluation Match ended with us in the seventh place.

2368
01:50:18,949 --> 01:50:22,989
We're going to make it to the top from the first match.

2369
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:29,260
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

2370
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:40,369
The official supporting race...

2371
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:42,670
for Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace has begun.

2372
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:45,680
Collect boosters from Mnet plus...

2373
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:48,350
to support your aces right now.

2374
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:51,220
(The long-awaited 1st match, VS Mission)

2375
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,549
(It's a 1-on-1 match!)

2376
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,618
We must be fighting against each other.

2377
01:50:53,619 --> 01:50:55,419
- We must be fighting! - But there are seven teams.

2378
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:56,619
Gosh, what is this?

2379
01:50:56,819 --> 01:50:57,959
(Stray Kids match)

2380
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,090
(ENHYPEN match)

2381
01:50:59,289 --> 01:51:01,859
(NCT, THE BOYZ, TOMORROW X TOGETHER match)

2382
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:03,289
(A triple match where 3 teams compete)

2383
01:51:03,529 --> 01:51:04,559
(I can take any team.)

2384
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,629
No matter which team we go against,

2385
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:06,970
I think we can beat them all.

2386
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:09,669
(The air is tense from the rehearsal.)

2387
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:10,799
(What do we do, seriously?)

2388
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,939
(I think we'll win.)

2389
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,238
(Do we have to change into our outfits now?)

2390
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,809
(I think they're hiding it on purpose.)

2391
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,709
(Okay, so that's the attitude you're going to take.)

2392
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:19,439
(They make my blood boil from the start.)

2393
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:21,109
(The competition with points on the line begins in earnest.)

2394
01:51:21,979 --> 01:51:23,179
(A series...)

2395
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,520
(of shocking and admirable performances)

2396
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,788
(I'll rewatch it 30 times once it airs.)

2397
01:51:27,789 --> 01:51:28,789
(What will be the result of the VS match...)

2398
01:51:28,789 --> 01:51:29,789
(with 1,000 points at stake?)

2399
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:33,858
(That was awesome!)

2400
01:51:33,859 --> 01:51:36,960
- What? - The result is out already?

2401
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:39,259
You're going to tell us now?

2402
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,169
His hand is shaking badly.

2403
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:43,199
- The veins on his face are popping. - I've never seen him like that.

2404
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:45,340
What?
