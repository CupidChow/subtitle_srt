(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:28,969
Road to Kingdom.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,239
(Round 2, where a team will be eliminated for the 1st time)

12
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,640
(A team in 7th place in Team Ranking...)

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,109
(versus a team in 7th place in Ace Ranking)

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,069
(Through a single Ace Battle, the first team to be eliminated...)

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,079
(will be determined.)

16
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,039
(I think it's the cruelest to be eliminated through the Ace Battle.)

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,250
(2 teams to fight in the Ace Battle will be decided.)

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,710
(Round 2 continues.)

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,649
(The CrewOne became even stronger with powerful dances and a story.)

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,048
(TEMPEST seeks to escape the lower ranking...)

21
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,619
(with their refreshing theme.)

22
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,089
(ONEUS secures their spot in the upper ranking...)

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,359
(through a distinct theme and splendid performance.)

24
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,990
(It suits the mission so well.)

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,328
(The 7 teams showed their identities through their songs.)

26
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,500
(Which team will rank 7th in the Team and Ace ranking?)

27
00:00:58,929 --> 00:00:59,959
The team in seventh place.

28
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,130
(The 2 elimination candidates are revealed at last.)

29
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,439
(The Ace Battle with their survival on the line begins.)

30
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:05,900
After the Ace Battle...

31
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,109
(The first team to be eliminated will be revealed soon.)

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,950
(Gosh, this is so cruel.)

33
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,049
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,890
(Road to Kingdom, Round 2)

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,159
(Identity Mission)

36
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,989
(The day 1 of the 7 teams will be eliminated)

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,328
(ONEUS made the cue sheet for Round 2.)

38
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:32,799
We're first.

39
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,599
They placed us sixth...

40
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,469
(ONEUS decided on an order that'd make the ending stand out.)

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,239
(For Round 2, 8TURN will perform first.)

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,378
(8TURN caught everyone's attention with an elaborate start.)

43
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,310
(They're putting on a magic show from the get-go.)

44
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,019
(8TURN's "TIC TIC" had a strong concept and story.)

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,289
Wait. Timeout.

46
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,290
That was so strong.

47
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,620
The other teams must be so nervous.

48
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,730
(Next up are THE NEW SIX and CRAVITY.)

49
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,188
After a lot of thought,

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,129
we chose "Love or Die."

51
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,530
It's "Love or Die."

52
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,099
(Explosive reactions)

53
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,668
(It's a mirror match!)

54
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,900
(Both groups chose a song titled "Love or Die.")

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,538
(THE NEW SIX performed "Love or Die...")

56
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,039
(with eye-catching choreography using props.)

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,438
(The ace...)

58
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,710
I really didn't notice them.

59
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,710
(However, they got feedback about the ace not being noticeable.)

60
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,719
(The third performance put on by CRAVITY followed.)

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,719
(They produced an impactful start by using their ace.)

62
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,158
(CRAVITY's performance of "Love or Die...")

63
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,589
(centered around their ace from beginning to end.)

64
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,959
I could really see their ace.

65
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,460
I think they'll get a high ranking again.

66
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,159
(Meanwhile, THE NEW SIX got nervous watching CRAVITY's performance.)

67
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,560
Why are everyone's performances so strong?

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,598
(The fourth performance put on by YOUNITE followed.)

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,139
Strategically, we used YOUNITE's strength...

70
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,370
(YOUNITE prepared a performance with a clean, youthful theme.)

71
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,638
(YOUNITE performed "WATERFALL...")

72
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,979
(with a clean, youthful concept, very different from Round 1.)

73
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,379
(But things don't feel great in the green rooms.)

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,550
(It was lacking some power.)

75
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,020
(The other teams were disappointed in YOUNITE's performance.)

76
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,250
(The four teams' performances were all evaluated differently.)

77
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,888
(Now, there are three teams left to perform.)

78
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,189
(Round 2 continues! What will the next performance be?)

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,199
(Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace)

80
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,770
Round 2's 5th team...

81
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,370
is The CrewOne.

82
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,270
(We're excited.)

83
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,009
(The CrewOne)

84
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,649
The CrewOne!

85
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,008
A big group.

86
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,549
It hasn't been long since The CrewOne...

87
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,119
formed an alliance.

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,919
So I'm even more curious about their identity.

89
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,259
That must've been the most difficult task for them.

90
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,889
This group is in trouble.

91
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,959
They're at risk of being eliminated too.

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,289
They got sixth in each category.

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
What kind of performance will they put on this time?

94
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,400
Junseok was the ace they revealed.

95
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,169
(When revealing each team's ace)

96
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,968
(Oh Junseok was revealed as the ace.)

97
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,439
(His first time being the ace!)

98
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,280
(Junseok seems especially nervous while waiting to perform.)

99
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,009
Naturally, The CrewOne...

100
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,309
(The CrewOne started with a lower ranking.)

101
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,348
It's just the beginning. Everyone has zero points right now.

102
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,580
It just feels bad.

103
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,349
(Let's use this bad feeling as motivation!)

104
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,520
(They prepared for Round 1 wanting to get a high ranking.)

105
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,060
(However)

106
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,990
(They got 6th in the team ranking in Round 1 as well.)

107
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,628
(We stayed in the same place!)

108
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,699
Is this real?

109
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,329
(Oh, I want to go home.)

110
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,670
There's still the Ace Ranking left.

111
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,139
(But they even got 6th in the Ace Ranking.)

112
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,410
We're always sixth.

113
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,879
Seriously.

114
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,980
We got sixth again?

115
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,180
This cruel world.

116
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,850
We didn't improve or get worse.

117
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,050
(We almost got last place.)

118
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,588
(6th place in the Evaluation Match Team Battle)

119
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:45,789
(6th place in Round 1 Team Battle and Ace Battle)

120
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,859
This is how I felt.

121
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,589
We're just set in sixth place,

122
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,799
and the other six teams...

123
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,599
are competing against each other.
That's what I thought.

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,268
I felt so left out.

125
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,268
It made me doubt myself so much.

126
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,670
Did I not try very hard?

127
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,209
I was denying the fact that we got sixth place in the Evaluation Match.

128
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,110
But I almost felt sixth place was right for us.

129
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,008
What should be our goal from now on?

130
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,550
I started to question that.

131
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,449
(Will The CrewOne escape the lower rankings?)

132
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,990
(Their practice studio is full of silence and sighs.)

133
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,959
In short, we're in the worst position.

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,100
We even formed this alliance to win this.

135
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,029
So if we get eliminated...

136
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,500
I'll have a mental breakdown.

137
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,870
I really don't want to get eliminated first.

138
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,870
I think it'll be best...

139
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,079
to stay strong.

140
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,378
Everyone earnestly wants this.

141
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,149
Honestly, we want to survive, right?

142
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,649
I think we should prepare as if this will be our last chance.

143
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,778
We can do it.

144
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,819
- It's not over yet. - You're right.

145
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,790
This is not an easy situation.

146
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,420
So...

147
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:54,888
(What will...)

148
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,430
(Junseok say?)

149
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,600
I will be the ace this time.

150
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,999
(You're cool.)

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nice. We need Junseok for sure.

152
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,938
I think he should've been the ace before.

153
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:09,040
- You're right. - We need you right now.

154
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,179
Because the future of our team depends on this,

155
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,910
I'll make it happen no matter what...

156
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,680
as the ace.

157
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,648
Since Junseok is the ace,

158
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,318
I think they'll focus on performance.

159
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,219
He's in charge of performance in that team.

160
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,818
He's so good at dancing.

161
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,789
- He is. - He has so much power.

162
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,959
He's very eye-catching on stage.

163
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,989
(Junseok was the main dancer and leader of ATBO.)

164
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,229
Actually, we always thought of Junseok...

165
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,698
as our performance ace.

166
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,499
(Everyone praises his clean and powerful dancing.)

167
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,369
What about this?

168
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,810
(He is now the performance leader of The CrewOne.)

169
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,909
(The master of details)

170
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,578
(He checks every step and formation of the choreography.)

171
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,680
It has to be faster.

172
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,180
(The is the secret behind The CrewOne's perfect dancing.)

173
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,179
ATBO and JUST B...

174
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,089
had very different styles of dance.

175
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,249
I think Junseok helped us find a good middle ground.

176
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,420
- That was great. - Yes, that was good.

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,859
We picked one person,

178
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,129
- but we need one more. - Right.

179
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,628
And I think it'd be even better if it's someone...

180
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,729
who could create synergy with Junseok.

181
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,730
- Right. - Right.

182
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,000
I think...

183
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,938
my energy is my strength.

184
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:11,939
Right.

185
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,410
In terms of energy,

186
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,838
I can think of one other person. Everyone is looking at him.

187
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,939
Jimin.

188
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,109
(Lim Jimin, a powerful performer,)

189
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,509
(got 2nd place in the Evaluation Match Ace Battle.)

190
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,810
What do you think?

191
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,519
If it's with Junseok, I can do it.

192
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,790
Yes.

193
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,289
I think those two can do it.

194
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,518
Let's get rid of the label of the team up for elimination.

195
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,589
- Let's do it. - Yes.

196
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,458
I personally want...

197
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,429
to show that ATBO and JUST B...

198
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,028
have become one team...

199
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,199
and show people our identity.

200
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,528
By mixing our songs.

201
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,628
- Should we mix our songs? - I see.

202
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,899
- A mash-up? - A mash-up.

203
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:49,069
As for the song that can show JUST B's identity,

204
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,209
"Get Away" comes to my mind.

205
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,949
And with that, ATBO's "ATTITUDE..."

206
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,679
Then it becomes "Gettitude."

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,949
"Gettitude."

208
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,719
JUST B's "Get Away..."

209
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,920
has the lyrics, "Move out of the way."

210
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,688
The song's message...

211
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,589
is that we'll create our own path.

212
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,688
ATBO's "ATTITUDE..."

213
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:11,198
says, "We'll show you our unique style."

214
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,929
"We'll show you our unique performance."

215
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,269
That's the message we have.

216
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,638
("ATTITUDE," "Get Away" by The CrewOne)

217
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,369
(A mash-up that illustrates the story of this alliance team...)

218
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,170
(and says, "With our two teams, we can overcome any obstacles.")

219
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,079
We need to figure out what the problem is first.

220
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,239
Let's see.

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,249
- Okay. - Let's see.

222
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,310
Gather around.

223
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,209
Let's see what we did well and what we didn't do well.

224
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,648
Let's praise ourselves for what we did well,

225
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,149
and let's be honest about what we didn't do well.

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,788
(Watching "WATCH IT" from Round 1 with an objective view)

227
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,888
(Focused)

228
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,190
- It seems very flat. - Yes, it's flat.

229
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,489
Seunghwan feels like the center of this team,

230
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,658
- but he doesn't seem... - Like the ace.

231
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,860
like the ace.

232
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,298
From this performance,

233
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,029
all I get is, "They're good at dancing." That's it.

234
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,638
And I didn't even get that very clearly.

235
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,999
I couldn't see our strengths,

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,639
and we didn't cover up our weaknesses.

237
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,340
We did that in the Evaluation Match,

238
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,309
and we made the same mistake again.

239
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,408
For Round Two,

240
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:03,209
we did our best to correct the mistakes we made...

241
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,080
in the last performance right off the bat.

242
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,179
Seven, eight.

243
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,119
- Then I go like this. - Yes.

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,758
- Your first step needs to be fast. - Okay.

245
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,259
We need to be in sync when we shoot.

246
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,860
- Make it pop, it the new face - Make it pop, it the new face

247
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,558
I think it'll be better if we push it back a bit more.

248
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,659
- Like this? - Yes.

249
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,658
(Making sure to monitor their practice sessions)

250
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,299
Until now, we mostly showed the audience our dancing.

251
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,569
For this round, I think the audience...

252
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,570
will have many exciting moments to look out for.

253
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,769
Yes!

254
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,879
We'll begin the dry run.

255
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,409
(The CrewOne does a final check on the day of Round 2.)

256
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,109
(Breaking the stage)

257
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,549
(Their final rehearsal is done.)

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,059
(But Jimin looks like he's in pain.)

259
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,788
When preparing for this performance,

260
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,388
I was practicing the part...

261
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,029
where I jump down from a flight of stairs,

262
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,330
and I hurt my ankle.

263
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Okay.

264
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,969
(Ace Jimin hurt his ankle during practice.)

265
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,009
Let's go!

266
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,679
(Their ace unexpectedly got injured the day before the match.)

267
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,950
This is a very important performance that could be our last.

268
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,949
So even though it hurts,

269
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,320
I plan to sacrifice my body for it.

270
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,558
(From getting a low ranking in Round 1...)

271
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,028
(to their ace getting injured)

272
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,929
- Let's go! - You can do it!

273
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,599
(Will The CrewOne survive the elimination?)

274
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
(What?)

275
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,428
Jimin.

276
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,969
The combination we were most afraid of...

277
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,700
- is here. - You're right.

278
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,508
The two good dancers...

279
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,840
I'm scared. It's Jimin.

280
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,269
What?

281
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,679
- School uniforms? - They're wearing school uniforms?

282
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,409
- It's kind of... - "Harry Potter?"

283
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,749
Gryffindor and...

284
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,750
- Slytherin. - Slytherin.

285
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,878
The two up front.

286
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,580
I'm so excited to see how they'll portray that on stage.

287
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,289
Team The CrewOne.

288
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,259

("ATTITUDE," "Get Away" by The CrewOne)

290
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,549
What?

291
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,720
What? It's really magic.

292
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,620
It's magic.

293
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,388

("With our two teams together, we can beat any enemy.")

296
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,278
It is "Harry Potter!"

That's platform 9 and 3 quarters.

298
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,379
It's platform 9 and 3 quarters.

299
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,369
The book became a hat.

300
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,710
They're really doing magic.

301
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,049
It's a magic school.

302
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,659
Junseok is so good at dancing.

303
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,299

(The crowd stirs at the change in mood.)

306
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,220
- They're dementors. - Dementors.

00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,360
Oh, he fell.

308
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,808
This is the right feel.

310
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,809
This is insane.

He really is an ace.

317
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,019

Light the fire.

326

- That was cool. - That was cool.

327
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,089
They really burned it up.

328
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,729
- It was a real magic school. - Seriously.

329
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,429
They really used magic in the middle.

Nice.

333
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,870
- There was so much to see. - Right, it was really fun to watch.

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,839
Out of all the performances we watched so far,

335
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,679
their story came through the most.
So I liked that.

336
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,610
The incredible dancing from Junseok and Jimin stood out.

337
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,980
And their chemistry was great too.

338
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,480
They have the best chemistry between the aces.

339
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,179
Well done, aces.

340
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,289
- Nice. - Well done.

341
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,789
Guys, I loved it.

342
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,259
The audience went wild.

343
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,899
We did a total of three performances so far.

344
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,599
This performance gave me the biggest satisfaction.

345
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,399
We've been performing as The CrewOne.

346
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,899
And for the first time today,

347
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,400
it felt like we were truly one team.

348
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,868
I could feel that we were...

349
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,740
all looking at the same goal.

350
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,109
I gave it my all to the performance, so I don't have any regret.

351
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,548
Everyone felt that we were still so passionate.

352
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,890
We're still passionate, and we can do more of this.

353
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,890
So it was a rewarding performance for us.

354
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,519
Hold on.

355
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,828
So what did they try to express about their identity?

356
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:37,459
- Right. - You're right.

357
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,298
Here's what I was wondering.
What do those two songs...

358
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,469
have to do with "Harry Potter,"
the movie series?

359
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,538
I think they just came up with "Harry Potter" first.

360
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,868
They might have tried to force the songs to suit the theme.

361
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,710
- That crossed my mind. - They chose the songs afterward.

362
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,538
It sort of felt like I was watching a magic show.

363
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,739
They focused too much on giving the audience the wow factor.

364
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,650
(The feedback is mixed. What kind of result will The CrewOne face?)

365
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,880
The 6th group to perform for Round 2 of Road to Kingdom is...

366
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,078
I'm certain ONEUS will go last.

367
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,190
Right. They'll probably want to go last.

368
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,990
- Then isn't it TEMPEST? - So...

369
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,190
It's TEMPEST.

370
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,289
(HYEONGSEOP)

371
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,289
(HYEONGSEOP, LEW)

372
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,789
(TEMPEST)

373
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,730
(As expected, TEMPEST is the sixth group to perform.)

374
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,630
(It's so nice to see you!)

375
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,769
- TEMPEST! - They look cool.

376
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,210
Their outfits look so cute.

377
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,109
Their colors are the brightest of all the groups we've seen so far.

378
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,008
- It's We! Hello. - It's We! Hello.

379
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,339
- We're TEMPEST! - We're TEMPEST!

380
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,750
(Make some noise!)

381
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,650
Wait. His hairstyle reminds me of a tennis ball.

382
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,619
(Strangely resembling)

383
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,058
As you guys prepared for Round Two,

384
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,799
I heard you were quite determined.

385
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:47,000
So tell us about your performance today.

386
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,069
Aren't you guys tired?

387
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,828
- Yes! - Yes!

388
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,669
We'll wake you up!

389
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,640
(Let's get this party started!)

390
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,309
I guess they went with a cheerful theme.

391
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,140
Yes, it's a cheerful theme.
Something bright and energetic.

392
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,108
I thought we would be the only ones going with that theme.

393
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,778
- Right. - The theme looks totally cheerful.

394
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,078
(Slightly flustered by the overlapping theme)

395
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,819
I'm curious about the two members who stepped up as the aces.

396
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,359
Obviously, the guys dressed in pink must be the aces.

397
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,389
Are the guys dressed in pink the ace members?

398
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,759
(Are HYUK and EUNCHAN the ace members as expected?)

399
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
(The meeting to discuss the song selection for Round 2)

400
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,298
We revealed to the other groups that...

401
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,400
- HYUK was one of our ace members. - Yes.

402
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,170
I think HYUK will lead us to a brighter future.

403
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,269
He will be the lighthouse of TEMPEST.

404
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,169
- Like a lighthouse. - Yes.

405
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,170
Please!

406
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,240
The ace of TEMPEST is...

407
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,179
(The identity of their ace, HYUK, was revealed to the other groups.)

408
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,209
HYUK.

409
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,949
He's the main vocalist.

410
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,750
It might mean that he will kill it with his vocal skills.

411
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,720
But HYUK is a great dancer.

412
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,049
- He's an all-rounder. - Right. He's good at everything.

413
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,389
Of all the singers on Road to Kingdom,

414
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,589
I daresay he has the most attractive voice.

415
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,430
(HYUK's attractive voice is the pride of TEMPEST.)

416
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,528
We have a superb vocalist who can give the audience...

417
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,129
a refreshing sensation.

418
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,599
I think we can definitely impress the audience.

419
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,269
Our main vocalist, HYUK, will be the ace.

420
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,038
Our main dancer, HANBIN,

421
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,669
- will be the ace again. - Right.

422
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,538
I believe that their chemistry will be amazing because...

423
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,509
they have two of the most important positions in our group.

424
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,749
(Curious about HANBIN's opinion)

425
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,049
It's the perfect combination.

426
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,279
- We have nothing to be scared of. - The perfect combination.

427
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,619
Come on.

428
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,289
So you're experienced.

429
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,889
He's definitely at ease since he's done this before.

430
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,890
(The synergy of the experienced ace and the first-time ace)

431
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:24,630
Then what do we want to show in Round Two?

432
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:25,859
There is...

433
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,329
something I want to try out.

434
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,969
When you look back on the performances of Round One,

435
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,910
none of them could make the audience smile.

436
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,309
A lot of us mostly went with intense and fierce themes.

437
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,940
(Including their version of "MANIAC,")

438
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,509
(Round 1 was a series of intense and powerful performances.)

439
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,518
So this time,
let's try something that can make the audience smile.

440
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,048
- Like a festival. - Right.

441
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,759
Going with that kind of theme might be good for us.

442
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,359
Then let's go with something we're good at.

443
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,758
How about doing a performance we can showcase our cheerful energy?

444
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,759
Sounds good.

445
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,000
We have a lot of cheerful songs.

446
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,099
We have "DIVE."

447
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,670
(The boyish charm with a cheerful theme, "DIVE")

448
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:05,869
"Bad News."

449
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,699
(Their youthful debut song, "Bad News")

450
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,969
I like "Dangerous" too.

451
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,539
(A funky, fresh, energetic performance, "Dangerous")

452
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,778
What else?

453
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,879
Personally, I would say...

454
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,009
"Can't Stop Shining" showcases our style well.

455
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,779
I think that's our baseline.

456
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,018
(The song portrays their bubbly and young energy.)

457
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,518
I like the title, "Can't Stop Shining."

458
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:28,230
It screams positive energy. It has an energetic vibe.

459
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:29,990
We have fun when we perform that song too.

460
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,899
- Right. - I think we can have fun with it.

461
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,999
- Right. - Then why don't we turn that...

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,429
into a performance...

463
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,899
everyone can join in and enjoy like at a festival?

464
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,499
Getting the audience feel included might be pretty good.

465
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,769
- I like it. - That's good.

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,068
To add to what I just said,

467
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,939
why don't we do a mash-up with a B-side track?

468
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,108
What do you think about making our performance more interesting?

469
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:48,279
(Offering many ideas to make their performance shine more)

470
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,949
- We'll offer two different styles? - I like it.

471
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,950
(Totally on board)

472
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,279
How about this song?

473
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,819
"EYE OF THE TEMPEST."

474
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,490
(A hidden favorite of the fans, "EYE OF THE TEMPEST")

475
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:57,518
(- Let's make this the title track. - This song is so energetic.)

476
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,519
(I didn't know they had a song like this. It's amazing.)

477
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,960
The eye of the storm is...

478
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,259
shining brightly. So it "can't stop shining."

479
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,189
(That's a great interpretation.)

480
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,200
Nice.

481
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,930
Our group's name is TEMPEST,
which means a storm.

482
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,328
It will blend well with our mission since it's about our identity.

483
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,339
Right.

484
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,338
("EYE OF THE TEMPEST" is a hip-hop dance song with intense beats.)

485
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,608
("Can't Stop Shining" is a cheerful dance song about a bright future.)

486
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,210
(The mash-up of these two songs will represent their identity.)

487
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,380
I had a lot on my mind after Round One.

488
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,480
We made our debut three years ago.

489
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,518
Our position in this industry is still shaky.

490
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,618
We're on this show because we want to fix that.

491
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:32,089
But even on this show, our position...

492
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,430
is getting shaky.

493
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,399
(TEMPEST, 5th place, 4,756 points)

494
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,670
(TEMPEST ranked 5th as a team in Round 1.)

495
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,099
(They received only 300 more points compared to the group ranked last.)

496
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,838
(As for Round 2,)

497
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,439
(we'll have to give it our all, thinking that it's our last chance.)

498
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,109
(It really might be our last chance.)

499
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,480
(I really wanted to do well.)

500
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,950
(Let's work harder.)

501
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:03,288
(Let's get ranked high for Round 2.)

502
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:04,289
Yes.

503
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,588
(But the result didn't meet their expectations.)

504
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,690
If we don't get to make an impression,

505
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,230
that will be my biggest regret.

506
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:11,329
- Right. - I agree.

507
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,200
I don't want us to have any regret this time around.

508
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,669
I want us to enjoy ourselves on the stage.

509
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,670
Let's enjoy it.

510
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,538
If we have fun and are happy with the performance,

511
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:23,470
that will make the audience smile.

512
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:25,880
Let's do this. Let's go!

513
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,409
(Their goal is to bring joy with their performance.)

514
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,349
(Will their goal be realized?)

515
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,118
One, two, three, four.

516
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,548
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Smile!

517
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,789
(The keypoint of Round 2, Enjoy the performance with a smile)

518
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,190
Smile!

519
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,288
- Five, four... Do it right away. - Right.

520
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,130
- Right here? - All the way.

521
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,430
Focus, will you?

522
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,630
I want you to say that while smiling.

523
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,470
- Focus, will you? - Okay.

524
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,838
- Let's focus! - Let's go.

525
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:55,608
- Be cheerful. Five, six, seven... - For the previous performances,

526
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:58,640
I was mostly worried that I might make a mistake.

527
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,650
But for Round Two,
I can't wait to have fun on stage.

528
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,278
(The practice studio of TEMPEST late at night)

529
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,849
Should we practice our facial expression in the beginning?

530
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,319
When I do this, you do this. Yes, that's the vibe.

531
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,519
(Even their outfits look similar.)

532
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,359
(Perfectly in sync)

533
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,229
(Their teamwork is improving.)

534
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,889
HANBIN and I helped each other...

535
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,528
if there was something we had to improve.

536
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,329
We exchanged a lot of feedback with each other.

537
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,529
Well done.

538
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,999
- We complimented each other too. - Let's go.

539
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,539
- We can do this. - He's reliable.

540
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,869
- Let's do a good job. - Let's do well.

541
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,970
We were together around the clock.

542
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,480
When we ate, we watched our practice videos.

543
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,740
Even on the planes too.

544
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,219
When we went to Japan for work,
we shared a hotel room together.

545
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,649
We tried to spend as much time as possible.

546
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,690
(Practicing side by side while brushing teeth)

547
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,750
You can see those two, right?

548
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,220
They're always together whenever they get a chance.

549
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,160
You guys are always together.

550
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,859
- It's a secret. - It's a secret.

551
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,429
- It is? - Yes.

552
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,430
(The ace pair is bonding while spending time in private.)

553
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:55,230
We thought that once we bonded,

554
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,940
our chemistry would show on stage in the end.

555
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,640
So I have nothing to worry about since I'd be with HANBIN.

556
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,039
Let's start the rehearsal.

557
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,140
Rabbits, please be on standby.

558
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,608
(Rabbits?)

559
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,349
It'd be great if you can move back.

560
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,750
Yes. This is great. Thank you.

561
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,450
Thank you for working with us!

562
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,318
- Thank you. - Thank you.

563
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,319
(Thanking the dancers who will join them)

564
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,789
(Their performance begins with HYUK's solo.)

565
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,758
The theme of the performance is "Alice in Wonderland."

566
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,299
We put together a performance that would show up in a fairy tale.

567
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,900
I believe we can show our bubbly energy...

568
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,130
to the fullest with this performance.

569
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,740
- First letter. - "Alice in Wonderland," our theme.

570
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,470
- Second letter. - In this performance.

571
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:40,079
- Third letter. - We'll show you what we can do.

572
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,479
- Yes! - We'll show you what we can do.

573
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,608
We'll show you.

574
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,119
- We'll show you what we can do. - Yes.

575
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,319
We practiced day and night with determination for this.

576
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:56,789
The most important thing for us is not to have regret and to enjoy it.

577
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,400
We'll kill it.

578
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,339
Team TEMPEST.

579
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,920
I can't wait to watch their performance.

580
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,949
We'll perform after them.

581
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,150
So it'd be to our advantage if they don't do well.

582
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,259
("EYE OF THE TEMPEST" and "Can't Stop Shining" by TEMPEST)

583
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,199
("Alice in Wonderland" is their motif.)

584
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,328
(It showcases their cheerful energy and their determination...)

585
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,069
(to build their wonderland with their fans despite the hardships.)

586
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,999
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

587
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,240
- It's "Alice in Wonderland." - My gosh.

588
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,250
It looks like an amusement park.

589
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,259
Oh, my. How beautiful.

590
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,269
(TAERAE, LEW)

591
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,409
He fell into the keyhole.

592
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,869
It's a fairy tale.

593
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,959
- Nice! - Hey.

594
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,799
- This is upbeat energy. - It's upbeat and powerful too.

595
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,119
I like the choreography.

596
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,259
Their moves are powerful and beautiful at the same time.

597
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,710
- It's changing. - My gosh.

598
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,809
A dance break.

599
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,210
- Let's go! - Let's go!

600
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,819
HANBIN is a great dancer.

601
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,098
- Hey. - Check that out.

602
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,109
The partner dance.

603
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,288
What?

604
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,450
A mash-up?

605
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,959
- What? - Wonderland.

606
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,200
How cute!

607
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,609
- He's beautiful. - My gosh.

608
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,949
This song really gets you pumped up.

609
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,720
- This bubbly theme suits them well. - Yes.

610
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,258
He winked. That's cheating.

611
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,058
Stop showing off your good looks!

612
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,799
You can't flirt with us like that.

613
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,990
Everyone, scream!

614
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,130
(LEW)

615
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,160
It feels like the performance at a year-end ceremony.

616
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,649
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

617
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,809
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

618
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,619
(TEMPEST's ace, HANBIN)

619
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,719
(TEMPEST's ace, HYUK)

620
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
(TAERAE, LEW)

621
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,419
(You can find the the mash-up of "EYE OF THE TEMPEST...")

622
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,019
(and "Can't Stop Shining" by TEMPEST on music streaming services now.)

623
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,220
They did well.

624
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,719
That was really fun to watch.

625
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,189
It was a huge surprise.

626
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,758
My gosh, their performance was so beautiful.

627
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,328
So bright

628
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,328
(Unable to hold back, getting suddenly excited)

629
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,268
(Perfectly syncing up with TEMPEST)

630
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:42,268
Personally, this performance...

631
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:44,669
suited them better than the last one.

632
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,639
- This was the right style for them. - Right.

633
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,338
- It suited their identity. - Yes.

634
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,150
- It was pleasing to the eyes. - Yes.

635
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,949
How should I put it? It reminded me...

636
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,979
of my mom reading the storybook when I was a child.

637
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
(He's too into it.)

638
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:55,989
- Really? - Yes.

639
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,759
Their performance had a lot of elements.

640
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,719
It was upbeat and fun.

641
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,430
There were a lot of elements the audience could enjoy.

642
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,298
They were performing a bubbly,
yet somewhat sorrowful song.

643
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,058
I was impressed that they could still make...

644
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,829
their performance shine despite everything.

645
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,239
They looked like princes from fairy tales.

646
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,369
It was a beautiful performance.

647
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,240
It's over.

648
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,239
- Well done. - Good job.

649
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Well done.

650
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:21,278
How was it? Did you have fun?

651
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,250
It was really fun. It was amazing.

652
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:24,910
It's over.

653
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,979
Looking back on our performances...

654
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,318
for the Evaluation Match and Round One,

655
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,848
there was an ounce of regret.

656
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,960
But this time, we didn't have an ounce of regret.

657
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,990
We could enjoy the performance to the fullest.
That was it.

658
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,459
There were fans who had light sticks for other groups.

659
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,630
But when I saw how much they enjoyed our performance,

660
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,930
I was confident that they were feeling our energy.

661
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,500
I was elated while performing on stage.

662
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,240
I really enjoyed it. That's it.

663
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,639
I'm expecting a good result and to climb up the ranks.

664
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,139
(TEMPEST filled the stage with their bubbly energy.)

665
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,609
(Will they be able to climb up the ranks?)

666
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,008
Only one team remains to perform...

667
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,318
for Round Two of Road to Kingdom.

668
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,518
They'll perform at last.

669
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,749
The group behind the cue sheet.

670
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,349
They're the last group. Let's go.

671
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,519
ONEUS. Come up to the stage.

672
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:11,460
(ONEUS enters the stage while showing off their fancy outfits.)

673
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,730
(We missed you!)

674
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,029
(Hello, everyone.)

675
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,629
- What is that? - What is that?

676
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,969
It's shining.

677
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,068
Their costumes will stand out a lot on stage.

678
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,940
Their makeup is intense too.

679
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,578
HWAN WOONG. You were the ace in Round One.

680
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:28,180
Could you introduce the aces for Round Two?

681
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,949
Well, we know HWAN WOONG is 1 of the 2.

682
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,578
- It's him again? - Him again?

683
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,149
Him again?

684
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,220
Right.

685
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,950
(HWAN WOONG, ONEUS's revealed ace)

686
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,848
(We saw this coming.)

687
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,960
(It's as expected.)

688
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,058
(Gosh, he's performing as the ace 3 times in a row?)

689
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,258
(This is too much.)

690
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,130
(He's monopolizing.)

691
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,258
(From the Evaluation Match, he won every single match.)

692
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,630
(He's been the number 1 ace in all of the matches.)

693
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,240
(Thanks to the result, he'll perform as the ace 3 times in a row.)

694
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,609
The member who will perform passionately as my fellow ace is...

695
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:58,838
- Who is it? - Is it LEE DO?

696
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,108
I bet it will be LEE DO.

697
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,239
No, it will be someone else.

698
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,650
- SEO HO. - Yes.

699
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:03,879
Let's see.

700
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,048
- Who is it? - Who is it?

701
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,049
(Who is the second ace?)

702
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,319
He and I have been performing together the longest.

703
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,218
It's SEO HO.

704
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,420
(The second ace of ONEUS, SEO HO)

705
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,389
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

706
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,605
They both have the main positions.

707
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,189
He's a great singer. We all know that.

708
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,030
- But he's a great performer too. - Right.

709
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,030
His backward flip is the only thing I remember from Round One.

710
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:26,768
(He has great dance skills...)

711
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:30,309
(as well as vocal skills.)

712
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,409
(The all-rounder ace of ONEUS, SEO HO)

713
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,138
My gosh, this pair scares me too.

714
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,309
This one will be tough.

715
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,309
Congratulations.

716
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,150
HWAN WOONG and SEO HO.

717
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,448
(Please make us proud.)

718
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,589
How do you feel?

719
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,589
I'm not sure if it's something to be congratulated for.

720
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,089
- This is a lot of pressure. - Is it?

721
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,518
Yes. There's a lot of pressure.

722
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,828
Don't say it if you're not confident.

723
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:50,889
I'm confident.

724
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,500
(Suddenly brimming with confidence)

725
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,260
I'll try to turn the sense of pressure into good energy.

726
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,670
The mission for Round Two is Identity.

727
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,738
You know what? Honestly,

728
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,098
it's a mission we must win first place for.

729
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,569
We released numerous albums...

730
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,280
and performed a lot to build these layers of our identity.

731
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,909
This is one mission I cannot give up.

732
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:12,948
(They made a debut 6 years ago.)

733
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,479
Including the B-side tracks...

734
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,018
and the choreography we made for our concert,

735
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,388
- we would have over 100 songs. - Gosh.

736
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,488
That's a lot of songs.

737
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:19,659
(What's their identity?)

738
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,388
When I thought about...

739
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:24,329
which of our songs was the most well-received...

740
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:25,960
in our career,

741
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,129
it's either "LUNA..."

742
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,188
- or "No diggity." - I agree.

743
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,799
I think a lot of people are expecting us...

744
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,451
to perform "LUNA."

745
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,669
One of our strongest remaining identities...

746
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,670
would be the Korean-inspired genre.

747
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:42,078
It was one of the beloved themes by our fans.

748
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,408
They might expect us to go with the Korean-inspired genre.

749
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,480
But I want to surprise them.

750
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,319
So if we were to perform this song...

751
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,190
- Won't they be disappointed? - "What's that?"

752
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:52,289
- "What?" - They might be disappointed?

753
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,759
During our tours,

754
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,589
they said they were surprised to see we could dominate the stage...

755
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,230
with so much energy for the first time in our career.

756
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,400
I love the energy this song brings.

757
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,468
If we perform "No diggity,"

758
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,399
we might be able to show people our theme is more than...

759
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,340
just the Korean-inspired genre.
We could show them something new.

760
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,009
We performed "No diggity" countless times.

761
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,339
The members who would shine the most with this song...

762
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,980
would be HWAN WOONG and SEO HO.
I know they can crush it.

763
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,779
When we performed the song on stage,

764
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,618
our secret weapon that the audience loved was...

765
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,788
the dance break with HWAN WOONG in the center.

766
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:27,788
(HWAN WOONG's dance break in the center)

767
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,359
Our next secret weapon is SEO HO,
the backbone of our music.

768
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,828
It's his vocal performance of the high notes.

769
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:35,769
(The main vocalist, SEO HO's high notes)

770
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,299
I think we can do a good job.

771
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,828
SEO HO and I have good chemistry.

772
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,170
- We have good chemistry. - That's right.

773
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,799
- "No diggity" is a good choice. - I like it.

774
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,368
Let's go with "No diggity."

775
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,439
Let's do this.

776
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,610
(Let's go with "No diggity." Let's do this!)

777
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,839
("No diggity" is the title track of ONEUS' 1st album.)

778
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,808
(It delivers the message, "Do what you want to do.")

779
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,779
(It becomes more energetic toward the latter part of the song.)

780
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,579
(The singing is also impressive.)

781
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,880
Today,

782
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,320
ONEUS is gathered for our first practice session.

783
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,760
Let's go.

784
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,429
(Practicing with the dancers)

785
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,400
We ranked fourth in the Team Ranking.

786
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,269
In fourth place for Team Ranking is ONEUS.

787
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,999
(Their brains freeze at the unexpected outcome.)

788
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,039
There's nothing I can do other than smile bitterly.

789
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,369
This is disappointing.

790
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,010
It didn't feel good to be in the lower ranks.

791
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:24,650
It means we just did okay.

792
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,719
The dancers will fall back faster.

793
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,389
- Let's try that again. - Okay.

794
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,049
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

795
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,518
- Up. - Wait.

796
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,988
(They check all the details...)

797
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,489
(and practice repeatedly for a perfect performance.)

798
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,558
I want us to prove ourselves by putting on a performance...

799
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,260
that will place us in first for both rankings.

800
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,829
One.

801
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:44,899
All right.

802
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,638
(SEO HO and HWAN WOONG even practice during the break.)

803
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,469
HWAN WOONG has been in first place so far.

804
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,340
If the ranking drops...

805
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,679
after I join him...

806
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,849
The thought stresses me out.

807
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,050
I think I need to be compatible with HWAN WOONG...

808
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,989
to receive a good score.

809
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,360
So I tried very hard.

810
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,089
Get out of my way

811
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,599
Since I'm joining HWAN WOONG for the first time as an ace,

812
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:16,530
I'll take our team to first place,

813
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,369
which is the most important thing at the moment,
with this stage.

814
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,308
(HWAN WOONG and SEO HO appear on the stage.)

815
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,479
- Here they go. - They're starting.

816
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
- Here they go. - Gosh.

817
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,480
- Finally. - Here they go.

818
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,049
The new ace.

819
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,179
I can't wait to see this.

820
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,119
It looks like they have something big prepared.

821
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,690
Team ONEUS.

822
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,840
- What's that? - What's that?

823
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,539
- What could it be? - It's a dinosaur egg.

824
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,609
It looks like "Snowpiercer."

825
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,780
I see something covered.

826
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,920
("No diggity" by ONEUS)

827
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,718
(This song displays the explosive energy and strength...)

828
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,988
(unique to ONEUS.)

829
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:11,989
(They added an eye-catching performance, a new rap part,)

830
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,289
(and locking moves to highlight the stage.)

831
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,598
- It's "Mad Max." - It really is "Mad Max."

832
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,429
- It's the wasteland. - Take him.

833
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,999
Gosh, who is that?

834
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,500
Is it SEO HO or HWAN WOONG?

835
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,420
What's that?

836
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,948
Seriously?

837
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:43,888
That's not fair.

838
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:44,989
It's already insanely good.

839
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,698
It's fire.

840
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,070
(Screaming)

841
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,499
(They can't believe their eyes.)

842
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,869
They're reenacting that scene?

843
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,329
- Gosh. - Why?

844
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,760
He's tied.

845
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,269
- His live singing... - He's such a good singer.

846
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,699
What is that?

847
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:04,789
The aces are a good match.

848
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,579
- Bring it on. - Bring it on.

849
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,449
His live singing is easy on the ear.

850
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,380
Are you ready?

851
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:28,880
The reaction is different.

852
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,389
Put your hands up.

853
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,260
Hands, hands, hands.

854
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,630
- I think there's something coming. - What is it this time?

855
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,539
It's a motorcycle.

856
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Turn it around.

857
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,670
(HWAN WOONG, XION)

858
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,070
- They're going again? - They won't give us a break.

859
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,019
They keep pushing forward.
It's totally "Mad Max."

860
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,730
(ONEUS' ace, HWAN WOONG)

861
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:50,869
(ONEUS' ace, SEO HO)

862
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,468
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

863
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:53,799
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

864
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,110
- Encore, encore. - Encore, encore.

865
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:00,940
- Encore, encore. - Encore, encore.

866
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,179
- Gosh. - They killed it.

867
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,749
(He can't get over it.)

868
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,750
Seriously.

869
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:08,848
How could it be so intense from beginning to end?

870
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,019
I'm overwhelmed.

871
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,919
They know how to communicate with the audience.

872
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,719
Yes, they're really good at interacting with the audience.

873
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,429
HWANG WOONG was as good as he always was.

874
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,429
I thought, "Him again?"

875
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,170
But he surprised me again.

876
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,069
HWANG WOONG was the ace three times already.

877
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,908
So I thought he'd be way better than SEO HO.

878
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,440
But it was nice to see there wasn't much of a difference.

879
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:35,979
SEO HO is the main vocalist...

880
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,979
but this time, he proved himself...

881
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,750
as an ace in performance as well.

882
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,550
He brought out the maximum effect of his role.

883
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,619
I can't deny that.

884
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,030
We crushed it.

885
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:51,289
(Grunting)

886
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,590
I have no regrets.

887
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,928
- It was fun. - Right?

888
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:56,098
I think it was nice and exciting.

889
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,269
I could feel it while performing.

890
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,999
The Identity Mission...

891
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,500
was one of the missions I wanted to do well in.

892
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:04,139
The audience felt our energy.

893
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:07,340
The first thing I felt was relief.

894
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,550
I feel proud of myself for pulling off an important role.

895
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,479
I think we have a good chance of winning first place.

896
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,190
(Will the undeniably good stage lead to a good result?)

897
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:20,219
All 7 stages of Round 2 have ended.

898
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,389
Now it is time to determine their destiny.

899
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,459
The Self-Evaluation score will make up 30 percent,

900
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,698
and the on-site judges' score...

901
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,199
will make up 70 percent of the total score.

902
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,599
You will vote for the top 3 stages out of the 7 performances...

903
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,069
along with the team...

904
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,210
with the most impressive pair of aces.

905
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,439
We will begin voting.

906
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,139
(Round 2 Team Voting)

907
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,848
(The voting was monitored by observers.)

908
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:46,419
(Ms. Han, 20s, Gyeonggi Province, Ms. Lee, 20s, Gyeonggi Province)

909
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,519
We really want this.

910
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,519
I don't want to go home.

911
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,219
Please.

912
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:53,289
Please don't make us do the Ace Battle.

913
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,489
Every vote counts.

914
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,889
Five, four,

915
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:01,230
three, two, one.

916
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,329
Voting is over.

917
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,670
(A team will be eliminated for the 1st time in Round 2!)

918
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,709
(Performances that displayed the identities of the 7 teams)

919
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,869
I could tell everyone was determined to win...

920
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,539
as they prepared their stages since someone will be eliminated.

921
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,980
This time,

922
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,710
I really can't guess the ranking.

923
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:20,579
We're in danger of going home.

924
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,179
I don't want to be eliminated.

925
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,389
I just don't want to be a candidate for elimination.

926
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,559
(Please...)

927
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,159
The performances of the seven teams...

928
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,190
for Round Two, Identity Mission...

929
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,699
on Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace are over.

930
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,468
- Good job. - Good job.

931
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:38,599
- Good job. - Good job.

932
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,299
- Good job. - Good job.

933
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,500
(Nicely done, everyone.)

934
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,070
Now, the inevitable time...

935
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:46,340
of announcing the result awaits us.

936
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,750
Seriously.

937
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,849
(Sighing)

938
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,119
I want to avoid it.

939
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,320
The 1st team out of the 7 teams here to go home will be decided.

940
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:01,519
Already?

941
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,059
- I just don't want to be first. - I hope it isn't us.

942
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,059
I'm so nervous. This is nerve-racking.

943
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:09,969
The scores of Round 1 and Round 2 will be added up.

944
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,268
The teams in seventh place in Team Ranking and Ace Ranking...

945
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:15,469
are the two elimination candidates.

946
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:19,009
Even if the Team Ranking is high,
if the Ace Ranking is low...

947
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,610
- We'd be in danger of elimination. - Right.

948
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,510
You have to be safe in both rankings.

949
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,110
The first team to be eliminated...

950
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,150
will be decided through a final Ace Battle.

951
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,019
If the same team is in seventh place for both rankings,

952
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:32,889
that team will be eliminated immediately...

953
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,019
without an Ace Battle.

954
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,488
That would be the cruelest.

955
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:38,659
To be eliminated without even an Ace Battle.

956
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,760
That would make me feel so empty.

957
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:44,030
It would be humiliating to leave after ranking seventh in both.

958
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:45,670
That would be unacceptable.

959
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,869
- Please. - Come on.

960
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,940
I was so nervous.

961
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,480
I was really nervous.

962
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,678
I can't breathe.

963
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:57,679
(8TURN is also in danger of elimination.)

964
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,880
Please.

965
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,050
I felt like we were in danger...

966
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,389
because we ranked 7th in both in Round 1.

967
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,719
The result of Round One was quite disappointing.

968
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,989
I just don't want to be in last place.

969
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,860
We will reveal the total scores and rankings...

970
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,769
of Round 1 and 2 at once.

971
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,670
(Round 1 and Round 2, Total Ranking, Team Ranking, Ace Ranking)

972
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,368
(Unbelievable)

973
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:24,439
- What? - Wait, all at once?

974
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,909
They're going to reveal the total ranking right away?

975
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,440
- Wait, including Round Two? - Wait a second.

976
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:29,780
Round 1 and 2 all together?

977
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,079
Someone could be in seventh in both.

978
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,719
- Then it would be over right away. - Why?

979
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,219
- We will start with YOUNITE. - What?

980
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,329
- Why are we first? - Us?

981
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:44,730
Why?

982
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:47,400
- He just chose a team? - Just like that?

983
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,599
- Why? - I'd be scared.

984
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:53,739
Please show us YOUNITE's Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.

985
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,268
- Wait a second. - Wait a second.

986
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:57,809
Why are we first?

987
00:48:58,469 --> 00:48:59,469
They'll be in the higher ranks, right?

988
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,379
They were pretty high in both.

989
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,809
- Right. - They ranked second in both.

990
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,349
They were always in the higher ranks.

991
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:12,690
(YOUNITE was in 2nd place for both rankings in Round 1.)

992
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,389
Please show us YOUNITE's Team Ranking and Ace Ranking.

993
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,599
They had a high score in Round One.

994
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:25,768
There's a high possibility they're in the higher ranks.

995
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,639
We don't know how they did today though.

996
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:30,239
I can't get a grasp of this.

997
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,768
Please let us be high up.

998
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,139
My heart is racing again.

999
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:37,510
- I just hope we aren't in seventh. - Me too.

1000
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,719
Please.

1001
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,849
(3rd, YOUNITE, 15,854 points, 3rd, YOUNITE, 15,206 points)

1002
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,149
- Gosh. - Okay.

1003
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,719
- That's a relief. - What a relief.

1004
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:48,420
- Good job. - What a relief.

1005
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,960
- Well done. - Good job.

1006
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,260
That's truly a relief.

1007
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:54,730
They're steady.

1008
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,059
I'm jealous.

1009
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:59,599
YOUNITE's Team Ranking score was 10,249 points in Round 1...

1010
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,839
and 5,605 points in Round 2.

1011
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,038
They are in third place...

1012
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,909
with a total of 15,854 points.

1013
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,210
Their Ace Ranking score was 9,160 points in Round 1...

1014
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:13,578
and 6,046 points in Round 2.

1015
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,678
They are in third place in Ace Ranking as well...

1016
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,420
with a total of 15,206 points.

1017
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,959
(Good job.)

1018
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Third place.

1019
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,589
They got over 10,000 points last time.

1020
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,590
I know.

1021
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,598
They didn't get as good a score this time.

1022
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:28,459
- They did really well last time. - I know.

1023
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,170
Our score for Round Two must've been low.

1024
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,900
They ranked 2nd in both rankings in Round 1.

1025
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,569
But they ranked 6th in both in Round 2 today.

1026
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,579
This resulted in them ranking third in both charts in total.

1027
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,238
They ranked 6th in both in Round 2?

1028
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,249
- Really? - Sixth place?

1029
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,709
They're still in 3rd place even if they ranked 6th.

1030
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,250
Because they did very well in Round One.

1031
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:50,050
That means their score was very low in Round Two.

1032
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,750
- We could've been in trouble. - We were in sixth for both.

1033
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,488
The refreshing concept didn't go as well as we expected.

1034
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:56,489
(The reason they did so poorly was because of the concept.)

1035
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,190
We can't do this from now on.

1036
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:03,170
We'd be in danger if we didn't have our score from Round One.

1037
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,339
We'll have to put on an eye-catching performance...

1038
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,670
in Round Three.

1039
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:11,309
I thought to myself we had to be better prepared.

1040
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,509
They were in 6th place today but still ended in 3rd place.

1041
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,550
- I know. - They did well in Round One.

1042
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:18,448
The total score is important.

1043
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:19,449
(Constantly getting a high score is important in this ranking system.)

1044
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,518
Our predictions are meaningless.

1045
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:22,519
- You're right. - Right?

1046
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,150
The score can fluctuate.

1047
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,059
I don't know about Round Two.

1048
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,419
Next.

1049
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,230
(Which team will be next in this unpredictable situation?)

1050
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:33,500
We will announce TEMPEST's rankings.

1051
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,799
(Even the order of the announcement is unpredictable.)

1052
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,030
- Gosh. - What should we do?

1053
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:40,269
This soon?

1054
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,070
Hold hands, everyone.

1055
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,139
- Give me your hand. - My palms are sweaty.

1056
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,010
I think he's announcing the higher ranks first.

1057
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:48,380
I think they will be in 2nd or 4th.

1058
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:49,809
Me too. If they did well,

1059
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,408
- we could be in danger. - You're right.

1060
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,619
If teams that were in the lower ranks come up,
we're in danger.

1061
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:57,049
If we are in seventh place,
we'll go to the Elimination Battle.

1062
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,090
That's right.

1063
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,589
We'll be in danger if TEMPEST does well.

1064
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,789
(TEMPEST ranked 5th in Round 1.)

1065
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,960
We can't hope they'll be in seventh place.

1066
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:10,570
(TEMPEST lost to THE NEW SIX in Round 1's VS Mission...)

1067
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,440
(and ended up in 5th place.)

1068
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,840
Our ranking was low in both charts.

1069
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,670
I was hoping we'd show a rebound this time.

1070
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,710
I can't watch this.

1071
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:26,309
(Will TEMPEST succeed in a rebound after doing poorly in Round 1?)

1072
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,889
(6th, TEMPEST, 11,667 points, 4th, TEMPEST, 13,682 points)

1073
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,519
(TEMPEST's total ranking, Team Ranking 6th, Ace Ranking 4th)

1074
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,619
Wait a second.

1075
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,590
Good job.

1076
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,059
We did a good job.

1077
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,530
TEMPEST is sixth in Team Ranking...

1078
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,030
and fourth in Ace Ranking.

1079
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,769
Their Team Ranking score was 4,756 points in Round 1...

1080
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,808
and 6,911 points in Round 2.

1081
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:55,610
They are in 6th place with a total of 11,667 points.

1082
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:59,308
Their Ace Ranking score was 6,025 in Round 1...

1083
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,618
and 7,657 in Round 2.

1084
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:04,988
They are in fourth place...

1085
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,889
with a total of 13,682 points.

1086
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,789
- Good job. - We survived.

1087
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:13,090
Our score was higher in Round 2 than Round 1.

1088
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,099
They did really well today.

1089
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,129
If a team gets eliminated today,

1090
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,239
we'll be last.

1091
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,269
We'll be next.

1092
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,940
We have to do better in the Team Ranking.

1093
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,039
You're right.

1094
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,039
(Their Team Ranking has to go up for them to avoid elimination.)

1095
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,179
We were still in danger.

1096
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,509
We were always in the lower ranks.

1097
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,618
We ranked 6th, which is 2nd to last.

1098
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:38,349
I'm starting to feel suffocated.

1099
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,690
I'll think of this as war.

1100
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,029
We don't know what will happen.

1101
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,190
So that's possible.

1102
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:46,559
It's a total of the scores.

1103
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,729
I'm getting more and more confused.

1104
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,730
(Which team will be next as the rankings go up and down?)

1105
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:53,400
We will announce CRAVITY's rankings next.

1106
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:54,739
It's time.

1107
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:01,610
I think CRAVITY will be first in Team Ranking.

1108
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,380
They won first in Team Ranking last time.

1109
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,949
I think CRAVITY will get a high ranking.

1110
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,320
We have to do well in the Ace Ranking.

1111
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:11,489
I can't tell how we will do in the Ace Ranking.

1112
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,590
I hope we'll do well in both.

1113
00:54:12,591 --> 00:54:13,889
I want to be in first place for both.

1114
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,530
(They went from 7th to 1st in Round 1's Team Ranking.)

1115
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:22,900
(However, they were in 3rd place in Ace Ranking.)

1116
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,070
(MINHEE and TAEYOUNG were the aces for Round 2.)

1117
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,869
(Will they be able to win 1st place in both Team and Ace Rankings?)

1118
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,170
Please.

1119
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,480
My heart is racing.

1120
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,578
- Let us be high on the chart. - Gosh.

1121
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,419
(Will they get a high ranking again without any sudden changes?)

1122
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,420
Come on.

1123
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,419
(Round 1 and Round 2, Total Ranking, Team Ranking, Ace Ranking)

1124
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,530
CRAVITY ranked 1st in Team Ranking and 2nd in Ace Ranking.

1125
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,899
(CRAVITY finally lets out a sigh of relief.)

1126
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,130
I almost went crazy.

1127
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,400
(Good job, everyone.)

1128
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,768
(Gasping)

1129
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:01,769
They got over 20,000 points.

1130
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,039
That means they almost got perfect scores both times.

1131
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,440
They're way ahead.

1132
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,610
They're 9,000 points ahead of us.

1133
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,610
We need to do two more rounds to catch up.

1134
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,650
I'm jealous.

1135
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:17,320
CRAVITY's Team Ranking score was 10,769 points in Round 1...

1136
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:19,650
and 10,000 points in Round 2.

1137
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,989
They stayed in first place...

1138
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,460
- with a total of 20,769 points. - That's incredible.

1139
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,300
Their Ace Ranking score was 7,498 points in Round 1...

1140
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,099
and 9,045 points in Round 2.

1141
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:35,638
- You did really well. - They are in second place...

1142
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:37,809
- with a total of 16,543 points. - You did a good job.

1143
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:39,210
- Thank you. - What a relief.

1144
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,840
Thank you so much.

1145
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,138
(CRAVITY, Total Ace Ranking, Round 1, 3rd, 7,498 points)

1146
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,150
(Round 2, 2nd, 9,045 points, 2nd, 16,543 points)

1147
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,279
We will announce ONEUS' ranking next.

1148
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,980
(ONEUS' total ranking announcement)

1149
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,889
Will they win first place in Ace Ranking again?

1150
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,489
ONEUS is definitely first place in Ace Ranking.

1151
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,690
(Thanks to ace HWAN WOONG,)

1152
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,659
(ONEUS won 1st place in Round 1's Ace Ranking.)

1153
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:05,629
(However, their Team Ranking was quite low at 4th.)

1154
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,500
No matter how good the ace is, if the Team Ranking keeps dropping,

1155
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,369
we're in danger of elimination.

1156
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,979
(They can't relax because of their result in Round 1.)

1157
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,039
Will we be in fourth again in Team Ranking?

1158
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,949
They won't be 1st and 2nd, will they?

1159
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,280
(2nd in Team Ranking and 1st in Ace Ranking are still open.)

1160
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:23,690
My heart aches.

1161
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,558
(Will ONEUS be able to overcome their bad Team Ranking result?)

1162
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,090
(2nd in Team Ranking, 1st in Ace Ranking)

1163
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,629
I had no idea.

1164
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,900
(Surprised)

1165
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,698
- I was so... - Good job.

1166
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,570
- You did so well. - We all did well.

1167
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:42,038
No plot twists.

1168
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:43,340
It was expected.

1169
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:46,239
They won the Ace Ranking by a landslide.

1170
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,578
Their Team Ranking score in Round One...

1171
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,510
was 6,997 points.

1172
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:54,119
Their score in Round 2 was 9,338.

1173
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,920
They placed 2nd with a total score of 16,335.

1174
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,760
They went up a lot of rankings in one go.

1175
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,260
Their Ace Ranking score in Round 1 was 9,483.

1176
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,760
Their score in Round 2 was 9,629.

1177
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,868
They maintained their place in first...

1178
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:13,429
with a total score of 19,112.

1179
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,539
We should have widened the gap more.

1180
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:19,909
It's not easy to beat their ace score.

1181
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:22,179
That's a big hurdle.

1182
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,110
A high mountain we must overcome.

1183
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,948
We'll keep our place in the Team Ranking...

1184
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:29,218
and take their spot in the Ace Ranking.

1185
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,019
- I think we're close. - Yes.

1186
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,488
We'll widen the gap in the Ace Ranking...

1187
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:35,488
so much that they won't even think about taking our place.

1188
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:39,589
We'll stop CRAVITY's sole lead in the Team Ranking...

1189
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,630
and place first in both.

1190
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:46,069
(We only have the bottom teams left.)

1191
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,269
I'm a little worried that seventh place is still veiled.

1192
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:52,509
- Why isn't our team being called? - Seriously.

1193
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,309
Please.

1194
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:56,710
We might place seventh in either one of them.

1195
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,679
Oh, no.

1196
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,179
What if we actually go to the Elimination Battle?

1197
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,719
- Us? - No. Let's wait.

1198
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,360
Next, I will announce the rankings of The CrewOne.

1199
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:11,659
(Startled)

1200
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,029
(There are only bottom teams left to be announced.)

1201
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,198
It's our turn.

1202
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,299
(They hope they're not in 7th place.)

1203
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,129
(Sighing)

1204
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,268
Please.

1205
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:21,400
We were off to a smooth start with the expected ranking of first.

1206
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:22,639
First.

1207
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:24,968
(The CrewOne was expected by the 7 teams...)

1208
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:26,980
(to place 1st in the Evaluation Match.)

1209
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,639
(But...)

1210
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,110
(their Team Ranking was 6th in the Evaluation Match,)

1211
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:33,780
(and they placed 6th in Round 1's Team and Ace Rankings.)

1212
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,989
(They barely avoided placing last.)

1213
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,190
Oh, please.

1214
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,719
They were in danger last time.

1215
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,459
It won't be easy to go up right away.

1216
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,489
You're right.

1217
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,299
- We can't place last in both. - We can't.

1218
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,598
Please.

1219
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,768
(They'll be immediately eliminated if they place 7th in both.)

1220
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:52,469
Please spare us just once.

1221
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,800
Just this once.

1222
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,439
(What's The CrewOne's accumulated ranking?)

1223
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,340
(Rounds 1 and 2 Overall Ranking)

1224
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,038
(Startled)

1225
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:03,079
(The result shocked everyone.)

1226
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:05,308
(7th place and 6th place)

1227
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:06,509
(The CrewOne placed 7th in Team Ranking...)

1228
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,679
(and 6th in Ace Ranking.)

1229
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,888
(The CrewOne becomes the first elimination candidate...)

1230
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:15,159
(by placing 7th in Team Ranking.)

1231
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:25,829
What do we do?

1232
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:28,538
They're going to the Elimination Battle.

1233
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:30,739
(Their ranking is a shock to other teams as well.)

1234
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:35,579
- This is the result? - Team Ranking?

1235
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,678
Their Team Ranking score in Round 1 was 4,585.

1236
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,149
Their score in Round 2 was 5,755.

1237
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,319
With a total score of 10,340,

1238
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,289
they placed seventh in Team Ranking.

1239
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,889
Sadly, The CrewOne became an elimination candidate.

1240
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,999
Their Ace Ranking score in Round 1 was 4,674.

1241
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,328
Their score in Round 2 was 6,990.

1242
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:02,300
With a total score of 11,664,

1243
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,010
they placed sixth.

1244
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,638
They would have been eliminated...

1245
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,178
if their Ace Ranking was one place lower.

1246
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:09,780
It was so close.

1247
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,610
We still have the Elimination Battle.

1248
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,420
(The CrewOne barely avoided getting eliminated on the spot.)

1249
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,846
Junseok of The CrewOne.

1250
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,118
You have the Ace Battle coming up.

1251
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,030
Please say a few words.

1252
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,900
(Junseok stands up and represents his team.)

1253
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,340
First...

1254
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:43,730
I can't watch this.

1255
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:49,404
Oh, boy.

1256
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,324
I don't regret much...

1257
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,920
about the performance as a team.

1258
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,500
We'll survive.

1259
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,433
Thank you.

1260
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:19,679
There's a team who placed seventh in the Ace Ranking.

1261
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,050
The Ace Ranking is important now.

1262
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,949
There are still two teams left.

1263
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,460
The two teams that I never thought would place so low.

1264
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,989
The remaining teams are THE NEW SIX...

1265
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,929
and 8TURN.

1266
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,229
One of these two teams...

1267
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,098
will place last in the Ace Ranking...

1268
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:40,130
and participate in the Ace Battle.

1269
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,170
(Exclaiming)

1270
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,054
Please.

1271
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:51,309
(8TURN placed 7th in Team and Ace Rankings.)

1272
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,949
(The oldest members performed as aces in Round 2.)

1273
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:56,820
(Will there be an unexpected result?)

1274
01:01:57,019 --> 01:02:00,190
But 8TURN's aces stood out in this round.

1275
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:02,719
Will their Ace Ranking have gone up?

1276
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,030
Did THE NEW SIX place low in the Ace Ranking?

1277
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,928
It wasn't that high last time.

1278
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:09,259
I think they were fourth.

1279
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,769
This is such a plot twist.

1280
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,530
I can't predict anything.

1281
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,969
(Amazed)

1282
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,139
(THE NEW SIX was one of the top three teams in the VS Mission.)

1283
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,440
(But their Ace Ranking was 4th, which was lower than expected.)

1284
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:25,679
(JUNHYEOK and KYUNGJUN performed as aces in Round 2.)

1285
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:29,480
(But some thought that the aces didn't stand out.)

1286
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,519
Why do I have a feeling that we'll place seventh in Ace Ranking?

1287
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,689
Let's just think that we'll place 4th and 5th.

1288
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,960
We need to think positively.

1289
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,529
No, it must be a misunderstanding.

1290
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:39,689
(8TURN hopes to place 5th in the Ace Ranking.)

1291
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,130
I can't watch this.

1292
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,699
We don't want to go to the Ace Battle.

1293
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:47,968
One of those two teams...

1294
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:50,170
will go to the Elimination Battle with us.

1295
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:53,609
I will announce the overall scores and rankings...

1296
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,940
of THE NEW SIX and 8TURN simultaneously.

1297
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,279
(4th and 5th in Team Ranking and 5th and 7th in Ace Ranking left)

1298
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,250
I hope we at least place fifth.

1299
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,448
(Which team will place 5th in the Ace Ranking...)

1300
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:05,219
(and avoid being eliminated?)

1301
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:07,090
I can't breathe.

1302
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,460
We can't place last.

1303
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,630
Please give us one last chance.

1304
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,269
Let's not place seventh.

1305
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,069
(Which team will place 7th in the Ace Ranking...)

1306
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,039
(and head to the Elimination Battle?)

1307
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,509
- What? - What's that?

1308
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:29,939
- What? - What?

1309
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,780
(The outcome shocks everyone.)

1310
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,519
(THE NEW SIX or 8TURN, which team is the elimination candidate?)

1311
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:38,920
(To be continued shortly)

1312
01:03:39,377 --> 01:03:41,047
THE NEW SIX and 8TURN.

1313
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:43,573
Please reveal their Team Rankings...

1314
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,047
and Ace Rankings.

1315
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:48,357
(The CrewOne, 7th place in overall Team Ranking)

1316
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:53,187
(Which team will place 7th in Ace Ranking and fight them?)

1317
01:03:54,926 --> 01:03:56,296
(Rounds 1 and 2 Overall Ranking)

1318
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:57,496
(Team Ranking and Ace Ranking)

1319
01:03:57,497 --> 01:04:00,196
(8TURN's overall ranking, 5th in Team and 5th in Ace)

1320
01:04:00,527 --> 01:04:01,937
No way.

1321
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,366
Oh, gosh.

1322
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:09,476
(They went two places up from 7th place.)

1323
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:11,977
- We went up a lot. - I told you you did well.

1324
01:04:12,806 --> 01:04:14,075
We came a long way.

1325
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:15,176
The tables have turned.

1326
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:16,946
They overturned it in the end.

1327
01:04:17,216 --> 01:04:19,846
8TURN got a lot of points in Round Two.

1328
01:04:20,116 --> 01:04:23,786
Their Team Ranking score in Round 1 was 4,423.

1329
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:27,797
Their score in Round 2 was 8,488.

1330
01:04:28,357 --> 01:04:30,626
With a total score of 12,911,

1331
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:31,926
they placed fifth.

1332
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:33,596
They got double the points.

1333
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:34,514
That's a huge gain.

1334
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:38,366
Their Ace Ranking score in Round 1 was 4,517.

1335
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:42,306
Their score in Round 2 was 8,623.

1336
01:04:43,107 --> 01:04:45,676
With a total score of 13,140,

1337
01:04:46,107 --> 01:04:48,676
they placed third in both rankings...

1338
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:50,746
and got exempted from the Elimination Battle.

1339
01:04:50,747 --> 01:04:51,945
No way. Third place.

1340
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:53,417
Goodness.

1341
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:56,716
Oh, gosh.

1342
01:04:57,286 --> 01:05:00,187
JAE YUN of 8TURN, please tell us how you feel.

1343
01:05:00,556 --> 01:05:03,206
After Round One,

1344
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:06,596
we had...

1345
01:05:07,397 --> 01:05:08,966
such a hard time.

1346
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,167
And...

1347
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:15,576
it seemed like YUN GYU...

1348
01:05:15,977 --> 01:05:18,147
was struggling a lot.

1349
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:19,706
I prepared for Round Two...

1350
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,977
just for him.

1351
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:26,087
I'm glad...

1352
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:28,015
MYUNG HO, the oldest member,

1353
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:30,686
and I, the leader, were able...

1354
01:05:30,687 --> 01:05:33,395
- to yield a great outcome. - Great work.

1355
01:05:33,656 --> 01:05:37,055
We'll show you how we keep climb up the ranking.

1356
01:05:37,056 --> 01:05:38,627
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1357
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:40,397
Thank you.

1358
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,207
They must have been so distressed.

1359
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,806
But I'm sure we all feel the same.

1360
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:50,706
(And THE NEW SIX's ranking threw everyone off.)

1361
01:05:50,707 --> 01:05:52,547
That team doesn't belong in seventh place.

1362
01:05:53,107 --> 01:05:55,175
THE NEW SIX must have been so surprised.

1363
01:05:55,176 --> 01:05:56,216
I know, right?

1364
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:58,087
Oh, boy.

1365
01:05:58,516 --> 01:06:02,187
That team became an elimination candidate because of Ace Ranking.

1366
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:06,526
(Sighing)

1367
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:08,027
I can't believe this is real.

1368
01:06:09,727 --> 01:06:10,926
THE NEW SIX's...

1369
01:06:11,297 --> 01:06:14,797
Team Ranking score in Round 1 was 9,879.

1370
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:18,966
Their score in Round 2 was 4,498.

1371
01:06:19,337 --> 01:06:22,076
With a total score of 14,377,

1372
01:06:22,306 --> 01:06:24,207
they placed fourth in the Team Ranking.

1373
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,046
They didn't win enough points in Round Two.

1374
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:27,106
You're right.

1375
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:28,247
It's almost half the score.

1376
01:06:32,216 --> 01:06:35,587
Their Ace Ranking score in Round 1 was 6,465.

1377
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:39,026
Their score in Round 2 was 4,295.

1378
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:41,096
With a total score of 10,760,

1379
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:43,156
they placed seventh in the Ace Ranking...

1380
01:06:43,297 --> 01:06:45,866
and sadly became an elimination candidate.

1381
01:06:47,497 --> 01:06:49,567
- We placed last in all of them. - I'm speechless.

1382
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,736
When I saw that we were seventh,

1383
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:56,076
I wondered what we had missed.
I was furious.

1384
01:06:56,906 --> 01:06:58,806
I realized...

1385
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:02,877
once again how crucial...

1386
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,946
the Ace Ranking was.

1387
01:07:06,786 --> 01:07:08,186
(Rounds 1 and 2 Overall Team Ranking)

1388
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:09,485
(CRAVITY, ONEUS, YOUNITE,)

1389
01:07:09,486 --> 01:07:10,825
(THE NEW SIX, 8TURN, TEMPEST, and The CrewOne)

1390
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,055
(Rounds 1 and 2 Overall Ace Ranking)

1391
01:07:12,056 --> 01:07:13,325
(ONEUS, CRAVITY, YOUNITE,)

1392
01:07:13,326 --> 01:07:14,556
(TEMPEST, 8TURN, The CrewOne, and THE NEW SIX)

1393
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:17,467
We'll have to fight THE NEW SIX.

1394
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:20,127
Getting eliminated like this...

1395
01:07:21,566 --> 01:07:22,597
makes me so mad.

1396
01:07:25,906 --> 01:07:27,207
We have to win.

1397
01:07:28,036 --> 01:07:29,836
I can do this. Give me your energy.

1398
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,075
(Which team will survive...)

1399
01:07:31,076 --> 01:07:32,547
(in the Elimination Battle?)

1400
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:34,815
All right.

1401
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:37,047
(The CrewOne returns to the waiting room.)

1402
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:48,997
(The air is heavy as they may be eliminated.)

1403
01:07:53,297 --> 01:07:55,436
If we become the first team to be eliminated,

1404
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,736
should I continue being an idol singer?

1405
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:03,177
It even made me think that.

1406
01:08:03,837 --> 01:08:08,276
It would feel like that what I do was unappreciated.

1407
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:10,747
I'm afraid of that.

1408
01:08:12,887 --> 01:08:16,386
(Another elimination candidate, THE NEW SIX)

1409
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:17,486
This is irritating.

1410
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,127
We placed last in both of them, right?

1411
01:08:21,127 --> 01:08:22,156
Right.

1412
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:23,825
(They placed 7th in Team and Ace Rankings...)

1413
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:25,497
(in Round 2.)

1414
01:08:26,467 --> 01:08:28,337
Was it that bad?

1415
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:30,396
It's so shocking.

1416
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:34,475
It makes me upset...

1417
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:35,935
that we're even in the Elimination Battle.

1418
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:36,936
Right.

1419
01:08:37,106 --> 01:08:39,105
But we can't blame anyone else...

1420
01:08:39,106 --> 01:08:42,146
or make excuses.

1421
01:08:43,116 --> 01:08:45,516
We left no regrets, and we did our best.

1422
01:08:45,517 --> 01:08:47,217
(They got those scores after doing their best.)

1423
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:49,086
We have to survive to get another chance.

1424
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:50,116
Right.

1425
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:51,856
I can't go home like this.

1426
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:56,427
We placed fourth in the Team Ranking,

1427
01:08:56,526 --> 01:08:57,865
and we didn't think that was so low.

1428
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,967
So, we thought that we had a shot.

1429
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:03,967
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace,

1430
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,467
the Ace Battle.

1431
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:07,166
The last-place team in the Team Ranking...

1432
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:08,677
and the last-place team in the Ace Ranking...

1433
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:11,007
will fight for their survival in the Ace Battle.

1434
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:12,605
All members...

1435
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,716
of the two teams will get a chance to participate.

1436
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,717
Only two can participate in a round at most.

1437
01:09:17,076 --> 01:09:19,247
You will be given one minute,

1438
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,356
and there are no limits to your performance.

1439
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:23,087
This will be a single-round match,

1440
01:09:23,257 --> 01:09:24,985
and the winner and loser will be decided...

1441
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:26,656
by the Self-Evaluation of other teams.

1442
01:09:27,326 --> 01:09:28,957
As their teams' survival is on the line,

1443
01:09:29,226 --> 01:09:31,127
we're more curious to know who will be the ace.

1444
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:33,967
The longer it goes, the pressure of the ace...

1445
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:37,036
is getting too immense.

1446
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:38,967
The seventh-place team of the Ace Ranking,

1447
01:09:39,236 --> 01:09:41,036
THE NEW SIX's leader, TAEHUN.

1448
01:09:41,436 --> 01:09:44,506
Tell us who will participate in the Ace Battle.

1449
01:09:44,507 --> 01:09:47,207
(Which member will participate in the Ace Battle?)

1450
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:53,146
From THE NEW SIX, the member to participate in the Ace Battle...

1451
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,417
is HWI.

1452
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:57,087
You've got this.

1453
01:09:57,088 --> 01:09:58,386
(The main rapper of THE NEW SIX, HWI)

1454
01:09:58,387 --> 01:09:59,656
I guess he's performing solo.

1455
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:01,457
- Just one? - One?

1456
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:03,497
Seriously?

1457
01:10:04,127 --> 01:10:05,767
Yes, it's me, guys.

1458
01:10:07,127 --> 01:10:09,767
(He was the ace in Round 1 for the VS Mission.)

1459
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:12,967
(He showed his rapping and performance skills as the ace.)

1460
01:10:13,307 --> 01:10:15,706
I don't think that we gave a performance...

1461
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:17,976
that deserved the Elimination Battle.

1462
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:19,406
I will use this anger...

1463
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:22,217
to kill it in the Ace Battle.

1464
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:24,486
The seventh-place team in the Team Ranking,

1465
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,486
The CrewOne's leader, Geonu.

1466
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:29,386
Tell us the member to participate in the Ace Battle.

1467
01:10:29,387 --> 01:10:30,485
(Which member will participate in the Ace Battle?)

1468
01:10:30,486 --> 01:10:34,597
From The CrewOne, the members to participate in the Ace Battle...

1469
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:36,427
Bring it on.

1470
01:10:37,797 --> 01:10:39,597
are Oh Junseok and Jeong Seunghwan.

1471
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:42,167
Oh Junseok and Jeong Seunghwan.

1472
01:10:43,036 --> 01:10:44,906
- Two? - It's two to one.

1473
01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:49,106
- It's 2 to 1. - They're different.

1474
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:51,276
Oh, my gosh.

1475
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,007
The difference is going to be huge if the number differs.

1476
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,975
I have a feeling that the solo participant...

1477
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,217
is at a disadvantage.

1478
01:10:57,646 --> 01:11:01,185
But if the two aces don't have good teamwork,

1479
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:03,186
it won't be as good as performing solo.

1480
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:04,786
That's true.

1481
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,587
No pressure.

1482
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:09,057
I'm angry,
and I think it'll help me with the performance.

1483
01:11:10,627 --> 01:11:11,627
You can do this.

1484
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:13,267
Show them.

1485
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:16,196
Yes, you could say that we got a second chance.

1486
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:17,807
Okay.

1487
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,767
You're right. We got a new opportunity.

1488
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:24,906
(Seunghwan was the ace in Round 1.)

1489
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:29,877
I didn't score that high in Round One,

1490
01:11:30,146 --> 01:11:32,986
so I wanted to make up for it and be of help to my team.

1491
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:36,417
(Junseok was also the ace in Round 2.)

1492
01:11:36,656 --> 01:11:39,127
My primary wish was to save my team.

1493
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:43,026
I was telling myself that it shouldn't be...

1494
01:11:43,557 --> 01:11:45,196
just a wish.

1495
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,536
I'm going to find a way to pull this off.

1496
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:52,936
- You look great. - Looking good!

1497
01:11:53,106 --> 01:11:55,075
- That's great. - You startled me.

1498
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:56,406
They changed outfits.

1499
01:11:56,906 --> 01:11:58,406
They look like characters from "Street Fighter."

1500
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,246
Or Son Goku.

1501
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:02,376
(Nervous)

1502
01:12:02,377 --> 01:12:03,377
He's here.

1503
01:12:06,547 --> 01:12:08,256
I don't think he's going to dance.

1504
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,286
I feel like he'll do breakdancing.

1505
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:12,087
Is he going to rap?

1506
01:12:12,757 --> 01:12:15,957
He might rap or dance.

1507
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:17,696
I didn't know what he'd do.

1508
01:12:18,826 --> 01:12:19,865
Have fun.

1509
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:21,266
We've already thought of all the possibilities.

1510
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:22,436
Feel no pressure.

1511
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:24,707
Don't worry. Relax yourself now.

1512
01:12:24,906 --> 01:12:27,106
We can't turn back time, anyway.

1513
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,137
We'll have to accept our fate.

1514
01:12:30,406 --> 01:12:32,677
At the crossroads of survival and elimination,

1515
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:35,847
this is your last Ace Battle for the fate of your team.

1516
01:12:36,377 --> 01:12:37,716
(The CrewOne versus THE NEW SIX)

1517
01:12:37,717 --> 01:12:39,517
The CrewOne versus THE NEW SIX.

1518
01:12:40,116 --> 01:12:42,655
This must be more nerve-racking than the main rounds.

1519
01:12:42,656 --> 01:12:43,917
(The Ace Battle for elimination makes them even more nervous.)

1520
01:12:44,757 --> 01:12:47,026
Oh, man. The time has come.

1521
01:12:47,387 --> 01:12:48,757
One minute to change our fate.

1522
01:12:49,627 --> 01:12:50,856
I hope everyone does well...

1523
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:52,667
without any mistakes.

1524
01:12:53,427 --> 01:12:56,167
The CrewOne, who placed last in the Team Ranking, will go first.

1525
01:12:56,896 --> 01:12:59,337
THE NEW SIX will go second.

1526
01:13:00,536 --> 01:13:01,575
Nice.

1527
01:13:01,576 --> 01:13:03,406
Either way...

1528
01:13:03,776 --> 01:13:05,547
- You can do this. - It's the grand finale.

1529
01:13:06,677 --> 01:13:08,946
The Ace Battle between these two teams...

1530
01:13:09,047 --> 01:13:11,785
to fight for their survival begins now.

1531
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:12,786
Let's go.

1532
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:14,486
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1533
01:13:14,786 --> 01:13:16,556
- Let's go! - Yes!

1534
01:13:16,557 --> 01:13:17,887
- All right! - You've got this!

1535
01:13:18,057 --> 01:13:19,057
Go!

1536
01:13:21,127 --> 01:13:23,826
How do we perform?

1537
01:13:23,957 --> 01:13:26,066
- With great force! - With great force!

1538
01:13:26,127 --> 01:13:27,725
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1539
01:13:27,726 --> 01:13:28,967
(Shouting)

1540
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:31,566
- Good luck! - Goodness.

1541
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:32,906
- Their energy... - Their energy...

1542
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:36,076
(Impressed)

1543
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:39,076
I feel like they'll do martial arts.

1544
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:40,677
I bet it's disciplined.

1545
01:13:43,076 --> 01:13:45,887
I felt that I still had a burning desire and will.

1546
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:47,486
I don't want to be eliminated.

1547
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,017
We were...

1548
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:53,356
really going to show our desperation.

1549
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,525
Just do as you practiced.

1550
01:13:57,526 --> 01:13:58,596
(And the members are as nervous as the two aces.)

1551
01:13:58,597 --> 01:13:59,627
Let's do this.

1552
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,035
(Let's check out the performance by Seunghwan and Junseok.)

1553
01:14:03,036 --> 01:14:04,497
They must be so nervous.

1554
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,507
Their hearts must be pounding like crazy.

1555
01:14:14,976 --> 01:14:16,116
Look at their eyes.

1556
01:14:16,677 --> 01:14:18,986
- They want to kill everyone. - They want to smash things.

1557
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,217
They're very disciplined.

1558
01:14:22,816 --> 01:14:24,486
- This should be good. - Let's go.

1559
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:27,587
Go easy on us.

1560
01:14:31,226 --> 01:14:34,167
("Like Adding Wings to a Tiger" by The CrewOne's Junseok and Seunghwan)

1561
01:14:37,396 --> 01:14:38,406
Like a tiger.

1562
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:12,967
Let's go!

1563
01:15:20,946 --> 01:15:22,976
It's like they're fighting each other.

1564
01:15:55,616 --> 01:15:58,017
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1565
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:00,717
I got goosebumps.

1566
01:16:01,816 --> 01:16:02,816
That was insane.

1567
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,986
I wish I could watch it again from the front.

1568
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:09,426
- Well done! - The Taekwon Boys.

1569
01:16:09,427 --> 01:16:11,497
- Nice! - I can sense their desperation...

1570
01:16:12,427 --> 01:16:13,997
from their dance.

1571
01:16:15,997 --> 01:16:18,766
(The CrewOne members give them a heartfelt applause.)

1572
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:21,065
- Come on! - Well done!

1573
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:22,406
(Our aces were the best!)

1574
01:16:23,677 --> 01:16:24,746
Good job!

1575
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:25,807
Thank you.

1576
01:16:26,007 --> 01:16:27,676
- You guys were great! - Thank you.

1577
01:16:27,677 --> 01:16:28,677
(Seunghwan and Junseok finished the performance without a mistake.)

1578
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,946
You can do this. Enjoy it. You're cooler.

1579
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:33,145
It went by faster than I thought.

1580
01:16:33,146 --> 01:16:35,557
I know, right?
I didn't know one minute was so short.

1581
01:16:37,116 --> 01:16:38,756
Great job, guys.

1582
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:40,087
(They return without regrets.)

1583
01:16:41,057 --> 01:16:42,127
That was awesome.

1584
01:16:44,457 --> 01:16:45,466
Was that all right?

1585
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:46,726
- Nice. - It was fantastic.

1586
01:16:47,597 --> 01:16:50,196
We did all we could do.

1587
01:16:50,696 --> 01:16:54,406
I wonder if the other teams felt our sincerity.

1588
01:16:54,807 --> 01:16:55,837
We'll see.

1589
01:16:57,536 --> 01:17:00,376
Next, HWI of THE NEW SIX.

1590
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:01,746
- Get ready to perform. - Let's go!

1591
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,846
(THE NEW SIX's ace, HWI, will perform next.)

1592
01:17:03,847 --> 01:17:04,847
Let's do this.

1593
01:17:08,887 --> 01:17:11,017
(He performs solo in the Ace Battle.)

1594
01:17:11,286 --> 01:17:12,887
I can't imagine the pressure of performing solo.

1595
01:17:14,286 --> 01:17:17,257
Can he match the energy of the two by himself?

1596
01:17:18,127 --> 01:17:20,266
- He must be so nervous. - He must be.

1597
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:21,536
(He has to perform on the stage all by himself.)

1598
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:23,735
- He must be nervous. - Gosh.

1599
01:17:23,736 --> 01:17:27,566
(HWI's members watch him.)

1600
01:17:29,036 --> 01:17:32,347
Before I begin...

1601
01:17:33,677 --> 01:17:35,377
This song is called "Underworld."

1602
01:17:35,677 --> 01:17:39,017
You could say that we're all in the underground league.

1603
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:41,485
I sing the aspiration of becoming a leader...

1604
01:17:41,486 --> 01:17:42,844
at least in that league.

1605
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,057
You'll be able to relate to most of the lyrics.

1606
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,131
Though this is the Elimination Battle,

1607
01:17:48,156 --> 01:17:51,396
I hope you'll enjoy the performance together.

1608
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:53,326
Let's go!

1609
01:17:53,655 --> 01:17:54,566
Good luck!

1610
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:56,435
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1611
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:58,060
Show them what you've got!

1612
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,306
HWI!

1613
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,906
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1614
01:18:02,254 --> 01:18:03,254
Let's go!

1615
01:18:03,677 --> 01:18:04,677
Good luck.

1616
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,747
Will we be able to express...

1617
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:12,186
the desperation that he sings by dancing?

1618
01:18:12,286 --> 01:18:13,286
I was afraid.

1619
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:23,757
Please do well.

1620
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,266
I'm so nervous.

1621
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:27,396
Take it easy.

1622
01:18:27,866 --> 01:18:28,996
Do well.

1623
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:30,066
(His lips are parched.)

1624
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:35,837
Although I have to take on two guys,

1625
01:18:36,576 --> 01:18:39,946
I'll find a way to defeat them and survive.

1626
01:18:42,816 --> 01:18:46,217
("Underworld" by HWI of THE NEW SIX)

1627
01:19:23,017 --> 01:19:24,017
You're awesome!

1628
01:20:02,396 --> 01:20:05,326
(You can watch the full version of the performance on YouTube.)

1629
01:20:05,566 --> 01:20:07,065
(HWI's amazing rap song livened the mood.)

1630
01:20:07,066 --> 01:20:08,066
You're so cool!

1631
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,396
Is this "Show Me the Money?"

1632
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,406
You killed it!

1633
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:15,906
Now, I don't know who will win.

1634
01:20:16,307 --> 01:20:18,507
It was good enough to make me forget it was 2 to 1.

1635
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,815
It was the voice of a man who had nothing left to lose.

1636
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:22,877
(HWI delivered his honest thoughts.)

1637
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:25,416
(We're proud of you!)

1638
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:26,417
Hip-hop!

1639
01:20:26,986 --> 01:20:29,115
(HWI is the best.)

1640
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:32,326
Hey!

1641
01:20:33,957 --> 01:20:36,097
Were you able to see our performance well from the side?

1642
01:20:36,557 --> 01:20:37,596
From the side?

1643
01:20:37,597 --> 01:20:41,167
Those who sat on the side only saw us from the back or side.

1644
01:20:41,767 --> 01:20:42,837
I was so anxious.

1645
01:20:43,997 --> 01:20:45,767
The other teams' reactions...

1646
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:48,836
and the assumption that they might not have been able...

1647
01:20:48,837 --> 01:20:50,207
to see our performance that well came together,

1648
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:53,406
and it made me incredibly anxious.

1649
01:20:56,177 --> 01:20:59,887
The performances of the Ace Battle for their survival have ended.

1650
01:21:00,616 --> 01:21:04,387
We only have the result to determine their fate left.

1651
01:21:04,932 --> 01:21:07,472
The CrewOne or THE NEW SIX.

1652
01:21:07,856 --> 01:21:10,656
One of these two teams will survive...

1653
01:21:10,957 --> 01:21:13,526
and continue their journey on Road to Kingdom.

1654
01:21:14,396 --> 01:21:16,195
(Exhaling)

1655
01:21:16,196 --> 01:21:19,106
The winner and loser will be decided by the Self-Evaluation...

1656
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,707
by you, the audience.

1657
01:21:21,036 --> 01:21:23,536
How are we supposed to vote?

1658
01:21:23,776 --> 01:21:25,406
How can I pick one?

1659
01:21:28,076 --> 01:21:31,816
(It's not easy to decide as it's about elimination.)

1660
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:34,916
Vote for the ace that you think is the winner.

1661
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,285
(The Ace Battle vote starts.)

1662
01:21:36,286 --> 01:21:37,286
Seriously.

1663
01:21:37,616 --> 01:21:39,656
I can't believe that one of them has to be eliminated.

1664
01:21:41,186 --> 01:21:45,966
(The two teams can only wait now.)

1665
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:46,967
It's so...

1666
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,666
(The team's destiny is...)

1667
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:55,436
(decided by a minute-long performance.)

1668
01:21:58,807 --> 01:21:59,807
Did you press it?

1669
01:22:01,276 --> 01:22:02,877
(This is tough.)

1670
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:05,115
(Except for THE NEW SIX and The CrewOne,)

1671
01:22:05,116 --> 01:22:07,087
(all 5 teams have voted.)

1672
01:22:07,146 --> 01:22:09,316
We have the voting result.

1673
01:22:11,087 --> 01:22:13,557
- I can't watch this. - I honestly can't.

1674
01:22:15,826 --> 01:22:17,627
Which ace saved their team...

1675
01:22:17,757 --> 01:22:20,167
from elimination and kept the team alive?

1676
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:22,866
- I bet they're extremely nervous. - They have to be.

1677
01:22:24,497 --> 01:22:26,736
Please announce the winner of the last Ace Battle...

1678
01:22:26,837 --> 01:22:29,507
between The CrewOne and THE NEW SIX.

1679
01:22:44,457 --> 01:22:46,127
I won't watch it.

1680
01:22:47,557 --> 01:22:49,597
No, let's accept our fate.

1681
01:22:50,196 --> 01:22:51,196
We did our best.

1682
01:22:53,366 --> 01:22:54,726
I'm not going home.

1683
01:22:57,767 --> 01:22:59,467
I can't stand this.

1684
01:23:01,606 --> 01:23:03,007
My heart breaks already.

1685
01:23:04,337 --> 01:23:05,776
I hope they both survive.

1686
01:23:07,507 --> 01:23:11,316
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

1687
01:23:12,547 --> 01:23:13,615
What do I do?

1688
01:23:13,616 --> 01:23:15,387
This is so cruel. It's hard to watch.

1689
01:23:16,286 --> 01:23:19,725
(The CrewOne versus THE NEW SIX)

1690
01:23:19,726 --> 01:23:21,526
(Which team will be eliminated for the first time?)

1691
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:25,467
(Startled)

1692
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,726
Oh, boy.

1693
01:23:28,226 --> 01:23:34,019
(To be continued shortly)

1694
01:23:34,044 --> 01:23:36,462
Please announce the winner of the last Ace Battle...

1695
01:23:36,893 --> 01:23:39,502
between The CrewOne and THE NEW SIX.

1696
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,631
(Sighing deeply)

1697
01:23:42,632 --> 01:23:43,632
(Exclaiming)

1698
01:23:43,657 --> 01:23:45,473
(Restless)

1699
01:23:45,498 --> 01:23:46,886
They're announcing it right away?

1700
01:23:47,603 --> 01:23:49,742
I don't think I can watch this.

1701
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:52,582
I have no idea how it will turn out.

1702
01:23:52,782 --> 01:23:54,882
Do they both survive if it's a tie?

1703
01:23:55,483 --> 01:23:56,988
Can someone hold my hand?

1704
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:58,852
I'm too scared.

1705
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:04,093
(Which team survived on the verge of elimination?)

1706
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:06,263
(The CrewOne wins, and THE NEW SIX loses.)

1707
01:24:10,393 --> 01:24:11,563
Oh, man.

1708
01:24:18,843 --> 01:24:19,843
What?

1709
01:24:19,844 --> 01:24:25,273
(THE NEW SIX is the first team to be eliminated.)

1710
01:24:29,752 --> 01:24:31,882
It's fine. It happens.

1711
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,363
It's a bummer, indeed.

1712
01:24:46,903 --> 01:24:47,933
Yes, it is.

1713
01:24:49,403 --> 01:24:52,803
(The CrewOne barely survives from getting eliminated.)

1714
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,411
(Sighing)

1715
01:24:55,412 --> 01:24:56,473
Seriously.

1716
01:25:02,983 --> 01:25:08,023
(Crying from relief)

1717
01:25:16,462 --> 01:25:17,563
You did well.

1718
01:25:18,933 --> 01:25:20,563
Good job. Thank you, guys.

1719
01:25:31,742 --> 01:25:33,082
I really appreciate it.

1720
01:25:36,752 --> 01:25:38,212
After the Ace Battle,

1721
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:40,952
with 14 to 11,

1722
01:25:41,122 --> 01:25:44,153
the eliminated team is THE NEW SIX.

1723
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,363
- Goodness. - After the Ace Battle...

1724
01:25:46,662 --> 01:25:47,922
It was a close battle.

1725
01:25:48,162 --> 01:25:49,893
The score gap is not even wide.

1726
01:25:51,992 --> 01:25:53,103
What a shame.

1727
01:25:54,263 --> 01:25:55,571
(THE NEW SIX lost by only 3 votes.)

1728
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:57,171
- We did well. - Good job.

1729
01:25:57,172 --> 01:25:58,202
- Great work. - Good job.

1730
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:01,002
- We did well. - Good job.

1731
01:26:01,172 --> 01:26:02,242
Great work.

1732
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:04,541
- It's okay. Good job. - Great work.

1733
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:07,411
(They comfort Ace HWI who had it tough.)

1734
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,443
Good work.

1735
01:26:11,483 --> 01:26:12,553
Great job.

1736
01:26:14,322 --> 01:26:15,593
Seriously.

1737
01:26:18,223 --> 01:26:21,922
Ace Junseok of The CrewOne will advance to Round Three.

1738
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:24,049
May I ask how you feel right now?

1739
01:26:25,332 --> 01:26:26,332
Here.

1740
01:26:27,763 --> 01:26:30,433
Firstly, I won...

1741
01:26:30,702 --> 01:26:34,372
thanks to The CrewOne members rooting for me.

1742
01:26:35,672 --> 01:26:38,372
And I'm very sorry to THE NEW SIX.

1743
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:40,683
Don't be.

1744
01:26:41,412 --> 01:26:44,653
As it's a hard-earned result,

1745
01:26:45,013 --> 01:26:49,353
we will repay them by reaching high up.

1746
01:26:49,952 --> 01:26:52,723
And this was the first time...

1747
01:26:52,863 --> 01:26:56,233
I could protect my group members.

1748
01:26:56,992 --> 01:26:59,632
I'm extremely happy. Thank you very much.

1749
01:27:03,572 --> 01:27:05,072
Thanks, Junseok.

1750
01:27:06,473 --> 01:27:08,701
Unfortunately, THE NEW SIX...

1751
01:27:08,702 --> 01:27:11,374
is the first group to leave Road to Kingdom.

1752
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,417
HWI of THE NEW SIX.

1753
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,890
Can we have you say a word, please?

1754
01:27:23,353 --> 01:27:24,523
Well...

1755
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:33,002
We...

1756
01:27:41,103 --> 01:27:42,843
Although we were eliminated...

1757
01:27:45,212 --> 01:27:46,643
in this battle,

1758
01:27:47,343 --> 01:27:49,712
there were various ideas...

1759
01:27:50,712 --> 01:27:52,622
we wanted to show.

1760
01:27:53,183 --> 01:27:56,353
But not being able to perform those is a shame.

1761
01:27:58,252 --> 01:27:59,622
Though it was short,

1762
01:28:00,393 --> 01:28:04,393
it was a good experience and memory.

1763
01:28:06,303 --> 01:28:09,473
With it, we'll work to become artists...

1764
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,372
who shine more.

1765
01:28:12,672 --> 01:28:14,542
Please love us a lot.

1766
01:28:17,273 --> 01:28:19,143
Great work. I'm serious.

1767
01:28:20,443 --> 01:28:22,911
(Cheering for the fellow group they've competed with)

1768
01:28:22,912 --> 01:28:24,381
Good work.

1769
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,582
Stop crying.

1770
01:28:29,353 --> 01:28:32,222
(They burst into tears at the last moment.)

1771
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:33,722
- Enough crying. - Stop crying.

1772
01:28:33,723 --> 01:28:35,462
- You did well. - Good job.

1773
01:28:35,563 --> 01:28:37,263
You were really cool.

1774
01:28:37,332 --> 01:28:38,593
Great work.

1775
01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:40,208
Good job.

1776
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:41,962
- Great work. - Great work.

1777
01:28:42,132 --> 01:28:43,708
- I'm terribly sorry. - It's okay.

1778
01:28:43,733 --> 01:28:45,202
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

1779
01:28:45,973 --> 01:28:49,041
You really did well, JUNHYEOK.

1780
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:50,172
Good job.

1781
01:28:51,113 --> 01:28:52,542
- Great work. - You too.

1782
01:28:53,282 --> 01:28:55,343
- You were really cool today. - Totally.

1783
01:28:55,582 --> 01:28:56,751
Good job.

1784
01:28:56,752 --> 01:28:58,451
(Bidding THE NEW SIX farewell)

1785
01:28:58,452 --> 01:28:59,821
- Keep in touch. - Okay.

1786
01:28:59,822 --> 01:29:01,052
- Good job. - You did well.

1787
01:29:01,053 --> 01:29:05,185
Since the moment we decided to be a part of Road to Kingdom,

1788
01:29:05,452 --> 01:29:07,362
we have experienced many things...

1789
01:29:07,363 --> 01:29:09,662
and learned valuable lessons.

1790
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:12,895
We were in first place in the Evaluation Match.

1791
01:29:13,803 --> 01:29:15,903
After the performance,

1792
01:29:15,928 --> 01:29:19,339
I felt these emotions.

1793
01:29:20,303 --> 01:29:22,772
Without having to say it,
we did really well,

1794
01:29:22,773 --> 01:29:24,242
leaving no regrets.

1795
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:27,942
The satisfaction was unforgettable.

1796
01:29:27,943 --> 01:29:31,013
Through that,
I realized how priceless the stage was...

1797
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:33,208
and how precious our fans were.

1798
01:29:34,223 --> 01:29:37,291
But above all,
I felt how indispensable my group mates were.

1799
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:39,100
I'm grateful to everyone.

1800
01:29:40,462 --> 01:29:44,593
(Their journey started with an aspiration full of spirit.)

1801
01:29:46,846 --> 01:29:48,915
It was short, but performing together...

1802
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:51,171
for a few months was fun.

1803
01:29:51,572 --> 01:29:52,966
The competition was interesting.

1804
01:29:53,372 --> 01:29:55,541
With those, we shared diverse emotions.

1805
01:29:55,542 --> 01:29:57,571
Everything was so much fun.

1806
01:29:57,572 --> 01:29:59,613
(THE NEW SIX will start anew with the end of Road to Kingdom.)

1807
01:30:00,983 --> 01:30:03,053
We were THE NEW SIX.

1808
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:04,353
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1809
01:30:12,093 --> 01:30:14,693
Road to Kingdom: Ace of Ace.

1810
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,562
Only the remaining six groups here...

1811
01:30:16,563 --> 01:30:18,393
are advancing to Round Three.

1812
01:30:18,632 --> 01:30:19,702
CRAVITY.

1813
01:30:20,233 --> 01:30:21,303
ONEUS.

1814
01:30:21,863 --> 01:30:22,933
YOUNITE.

1815
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:24,532
8TURN.

1816
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:26,273
TEMPEST.

1817
01:30:26,843 --> 01:30:27,872
The CrewOne.

1818
01:30:28,973 --> 01:30:30,013
However,

1819
01:30:31,313 --> 01:30:33,081
only five teams...

1820
01:30:33,082 --> 01:30:35,282
will advance to the Finals.

1821
01:30:35,483 --> 01:30:38,212
(1 out of the 6 teams will get eliminated.)

1822
01:30:38,353 --> 01:30:39,553
Another elimination?

1823
01:30:41,452 --> 01:30:43,593
It's one hurdle after another.

1824
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:45,762
Round Three will be an important match...

1825
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:47,693
that will decide the finalists.

1826
01:30:48,093 --> 01:30:50,433
Aren't you curious as to what the mission...

1827
01:30:50,693 --> 01:30:52,161
of Round Three will be?

1828
01:30:52,162 --> 01:30:53,762
- I am. - I am.

1829
01:30:53,763 --> 01:30:55,002
I'm dying to know.

1830
01:30:55,803 --> 01:30:59,172
I will now reveal Round Three's mission.

1831
01:31:00,803 --> 01:31:02,372
There's no time to relax.

1832
01:31:02,513 --> 01:31:03,712
We have no break.

1833
01:31:04,643 --> 01:31:07,242
(Round 3: No Limit)

1834
01:31:07,343 --> 01:31:08,442
What? "No limit?"

1835
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:09,482
- What? - What?

1836
01:31:09,483 --> 01:31:10,911
- Unlimited? - There's no limit.

1837
01:31:10,912 --> 01:31:12,183
It's limitless?

1838
01:31:12,252 --> 01:31:14,853
Does that mean we can do anything?

1839
01:31:15,223 --> 01:31:16,693
Or there's no time limit.

1840
01:31:16,992 --> 01:31:19,322
(We can't survive without a time limit.)

1841
01:31:19,363 --> 01:31:23,093
For a performance, no limits should be set.

1842
01:31:23,263 --> 01:31:26,532
It's a mission where you can perform the stage of your dreams.

1843
01:31:26,832 --> 01:31:30,032
But there's a difference from the previous rounds.

1844
01:31:30,403 --> 01:31:32,303
Unlike Rounds 1 and 2...

1845
01:31:32,672 --> 01:31:34,273
where there was only one match each...

1846
01:31:34,372 --> 01:31:36,212
- What? - What is it this time?

1847
01:31:36,372 --> 01:31:37,372
Are there two matches?

1848
01:31:37,843 --> 01:31:41,282
Round 3 has 2 rounds.

1849
01:31:41,483 --> 01:31:42,552
So two rounds?

1850
01:31:42,553 --> 01:31:43,682
What's that?

1851
01:31:43,683 --> 01:31:45,921
- Two rounds? - Really?

1852
01:31:45,922 --> 01:31:47,422
- Two rounds? - Two rounds?

1853
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:49,893
Please stop.

1854
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:51,223
Is it an Ace Battle?

1855
01:31:51,523 --> 01:31:52,863
Does it have to do with the Ace?

1856
01:31:53,162 --> 01:31:55,362
Like the other rounds, the 2nd round of Round 3...

1857
01:31:55,363 --> 01:31:56,893
is a Team Battle.

1858
01:31:57,433 --> 01:31:59,763
The first round is the Ace Battle.

1859
01:32:00,002 --> 01:32:01,162
Ace Battle?

1860
01:32:01,462 --> 01:32:02,733
Is it a 1-on-1 battle?

1861
01:32:03,032 --> 01:32:04,872
There must be multiple aces.

1862
01:32:05,072 --> 01:32:07,773
The Ace Battle in the 1st round of Round 3...

1863
01:32:08,343 --> 01:32:10,973
is composed of two concept performances.

1864
01:32:11,273 --> 01:32:12,741
- What? - Two performances in one round?

1865
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:14,443
- What's that? - There must be two teams.

1866
01:32:14,582 --> 01:32:15,912
Is it a 3-on-3 team battle?

1867
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:17,752
The concepts are...

1868
01:32:17,983 --> 01:32:19,081
Refreshing?

1869
01:32:19,082 --> 01:32:20,282
Powerful and sexy?

1870
01:32:22,853 --> 01:32:24,792
water and fire.

1871
01:32:27,322 --> 01:32:28,522
Water and fire?

1872
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:30,461
Some might even bring a flame thrower.

1873
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:31,863
We'll do anything.

1874
01:32:31,992 --> 01:32:34,501
The teams are to pick one ace from their team...

1875
01:32:34,502 --> 01:32:36,603
who suits each concept well...

1876
01:32:36,832 --> 01:32:39,403
and prepare two Ace Unit stages.

1877
01:32:40,343 --> 01:32:43,273
As each team's ace has gathered in one performance,

1878
01:32:43,613 --> 01:32:46,443
standing out the most is crucial.

1879
01:32:46,643 --> 01:32:48,813
We're really creating a performance together.

1880
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:51,813
The ace is extremely important.

1881
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:55,252
We must send the most elite member to that battle.

1882
01:32:55,523 --> 01:32:57,552
I will now reveal...

1883
01:32:57,553 --> 01:32:59,921
the water and fire...

1884
01:32:59,922 --> 01:33:01,863
performance videos.

1885
01:33:03,563 --> 01:33:04,692
Do we watch it here?

1886
01:33:04,693 --> 01:33:06,062
It'll be revealed now?

1887
01:33:06,063 --> 01:33:07,433
We're watching it here?

1888
01:33:07,603 --> 01:33:08,862
Does the performance exist?

1889
01:33:08,863 --> 01:33:09,871
(Excited)

1890
01:33:09,872 --> 01:33:11,973
We'll have to fight for the parts.

1891
01:33:13,242 --> 01:33:16,072
(The youngest team is losing their senses.)

1892
01:33:16,443 --> 01:33:18,013
(Performance Director: Choi Young Jun)

1893
01:33:18,643 --> 01:33:22,082
(We love it.)

1894
01:33:22,113 --> 01:33:24,081
Do we get new songs?

1895
01:33:24,082 --> 01:33:25,183
I'm shocked.

1896
01:33:25,382 --> 01:33:27,782
(Playing the water performance video)

1897
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:29,291
(Exclaiming from the start)

1898
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,853
(TAEYOUNG is in his element.)

1899
01:33:33,023 --> 01:33:33,900
Is that water?

1900
01:33:34,363 --> 01:33:36,492
It's like TAEMIN's vibe.

1901
01:33:36,632 --> 01:33:37,893
TAEMIN's vibe.

1902
01:33:37,918 --> 01:33:39,458
Part three is the main.

1903
01:33:39,617 --> 01:33:41,148
- Wait. - This will be interesting.

1904
01:33:41,662 --> 01:33:44,572
(Performance Director: Back Koo Young)

1905
01:33:44,672 --> 01:33:45,974
Is this for real?

1906
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,714
The master of choreography.

1907
01:33:48,202 --> 01:33:49,241
Or head? Which is it?

1908
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:51,572
- Both master and head are right. - Master and head.

1909
01:33:51,712 --> 01:33:54,212
(Playing the fire performance video)

1910
01:33:54,643 --> 01:33:57,983
(Their reaction is on fire from the introduction.)

1911
01:33:59,683 --> 01:34:01,252
They're already lit.

1912
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:03,922
(Going wild)

1913
01:34:03,992 --> 01:34:06,363
(It's really hot.)

1914
01:34:08,322 --> 01:34:11,693
(The fire performance is right up 8TURN's street.)

1915
01:34:11,832 --> 01:34:13,103
That's a bomb.

1916
01:34:14,202 --> 01:34:18,632
(TEMPEST is also getting excited.)

1917
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:22,025
If we don't get many votes from the Ace Battle,

1918
01:34:22,148 --> 01:34:23,488
it'll get really tough.

1919
01:34:23,629 --> 01:34:24,999
In Round Three,

1920
01:34:25,212 --> 01:34:28,041
we won't lose in any of the performances.

1921
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:31,282
We should put all of our souls into it.

1922
01:34:31,412 --> 01:34:35,023
I think we should always have big goals and ambitions.

1923
01:34:35,153 --> 01:34:36,186
We always go for first place.

1924
01:34:36,956 --> 01:34:38,425
It's win or die.

1925
01:34:38,646 --> 01:34:40,346
I want to prove it with a performance...

1926
01:34:40,393 --> 01:34:41,822
that deserves to win first place.

1927
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:44,732
(Pre-release of the full version of No Limit Mission)

1928
01:34:44,733 --> 01:34:46,531
(The full version of their performances...)

1929
01:34:46,532 --> 01:34:48,232
(will be pre-released on October 21 at 12pm.)

1930
01:34:48,233 --> 01:34:49,932
(The number of views will be reflected in the Finals.)

1931
01:34:49,933 --> 01:34:52,032
(The last competition before the Finals, the day of Round 3)

1932
01:34:53,242 --> 01:34:55,171
(The aces on each team will make 2 units, Fire and Water.)

1933
01:34:55,172 --> 01:34:57,211
(A Super Ace will be chosen.)

1934
01:34:57,212 --> 01:34:58,541
(A Super Ace?)

1935
01:34:58,542 --> 01:34:59,942
(I'm not going to let them have the title.)

1936
01:34:59,943 --> 01:35:02,211
(We should put our lives on the line here.)

1937
01:35:02,212 --> 01:35:04,013
(I should save my team.)

1938
01:35:05,683 --> 01:35:07,222
(A line distribution battle to become a Super Ace)

1939
01:35:07,223 --> 01:35:08,852
(It's going to be a bloodbath.)

1940
01:35:08,853 --> 01:35:10,092
(I like a bloodbath.)

1941
01:35:10,093 --> 01:35:11,552
(It's nerve-wracking.)

1942
01:35:11,553 --> 01:35:12,693
(My hand is shaking.)

1943
01:35:12,962 --> 01:35:13,962
(Who wants Part 3?)

1944
01:35:13,963 --> 01:35:15,161
(I can't give it up for others.)

1945
01:35:15,162 --> 01:35:16,162
(I'm sorry, but...)

1946
01:35:17,992 --> 01:35:20,063
(I have the right to choose a part first.)

1947
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:22,032
(What if I refuse?)

1948
01:35:23,532 --> 01:35:28,072
(Secure the important part solely through your skills)

1949
01:35:28,172 --> 01:35:30,212
(It suddenly feels like "Street Man Fighter.")

1950
01:35:30,872 --> 01:35:31,912
Hello.

1951
01:35:32,372 --> 01:35:33,741
(A special guest visits the aces.)

1952
01:35:33,742 --> 01:35:35,143
Three and four.

1953
01:35:35,212 --> 01:35:36,483
One, two.

1954
01:35:36,553 --> 01:35:38,951
(Unexpectedly harsh feedback)

1955
01:35:38,952 --> 01:35:40,882
(Will I be able to win first place at this rate?)

1956
01:35:41,082 --> 01:35:42,922
Put your hand on the floor in advance at five.

1957
01:35:43,223 --> 01:35:44,452
(HWAN WOONG, are you disappointed?)

1958
01:35:45,223 --> 01:35:46,223
(I felt bitter.)

1959
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:48,661
(I worked hard to prepare it with no regrets.)

1960
01:35:48,662 --> 01:35:49,932
(I'm so desperate.)

1961
01:35:49,933 --> 01:35:52,131
(I'll make sure to win 1st place.)

1962
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:54,603
(I'll become a Super Ace no matter what.)

1963
01:35:55,403 --> 01:35:57,531
(The Ace Battle, the 1st round of Round 3...)

1964
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:00,372
(featuring the aces from each team)
