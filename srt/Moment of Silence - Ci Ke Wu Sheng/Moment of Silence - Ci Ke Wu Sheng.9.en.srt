=Moment of Silence=

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,680
There is no sign of pregnancy.

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,760
Test-tube babies are very fragile.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,280
She was in the first trimester.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,860
It's easy to end in miscarriage.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Ms. Mai, any comment?

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,880
Stop taking videos!

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Stop it!

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,520
Ms. Mai, please answer the question!

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,080
- Is it Ms. Su?
- Yes.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,960
How dare she show up?

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,960
Doesn't she feel humiliated?

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,660
(Shameless Mistress)

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
Guys, come here!

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,960
She's crying.

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
Yes, she really is.

(Caijia Villa)

19
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,720
Sit here.

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Why did you call me?

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,280
You'll take action?

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
No way.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Your scandal broke out yesterday.

24
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
And today things look nastier.

25
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
How can I take action?

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
What are you suggesting?

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,560
I want to quit.

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Don't call me again.

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Wait.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,520
I wired money to you twice.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
You can't quit now.

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
I didn't ask you to give up the plan.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,600
Chill out.

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
My effort is worth the money.

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
Mai Lingjing's Miscarriage Report?

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
I don't need it from you.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,440
Look at the date.

38
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,640
(Miscarriage Date: September 19, 2023)

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,480
On September 19?

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
It was two days ago.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,160
How did you get it?

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm a professional.

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,760
She deceived everyone.

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
Is the report accurate?

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,120
Is it?

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
Welcome home.

47
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,040
How dare you come here?

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,080
Get lost!

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm delivering what you need most.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
You should thank me properly.

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,280
Mai Lingjing had an abortion
the day before yesterday.

52
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,560
Hormonal imbalances
were caused by mental stress.

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
So, you have nothing to do

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,960
with her miscarriage.

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,640
But she blamed you for the baby's death

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,000
in front of everyone.

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
She fooled me!

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
I'll confront her now!

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
My sweetheart.

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,080
Don't be silly.

61
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
You could never win the game

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
if you were so naive.

63
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
Think about it.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,640
How did Mai Lingjing cheat you?

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,640
She pretended to be nice

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,080
and said she'd forgive

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
both of us.

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,280
Then she went back on her word
in front of the news agencies.

69
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,120
She ruined your reputation.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,640
She ruined mine, too.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,000
What are you suggesting?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
I would say

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,120
you should make her

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
get a taste of her own medicine.

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,480
I'll hold a news conference for you.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,680
A much bigger one.

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll invite more reporters

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
and you should apologize sincerely.

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,840
Ask them to forgive you.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
When everyone thinks

81
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,920
you'll apologize for her miscarriage,

82
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,760
(Ultrasonic Testing Report)

83
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
show them the report.

(Ultrasonic Testing Report)

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,340
(Miscarriage Date: September 19, 2023)

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,400
It'll be much better

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,680
if you can

88
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,200
shed some tears.

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,880
Everyone thinks

90
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,400
I killed Mai Lingjing's baby.

91
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,600
Everyone is cursing me,

92
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
and wants me to die.

93
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,320
But it's the whole truth.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,760
Mai Lingjing

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,640
always frames others in this way.

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,040
She took advantage of
your kindness and sympathy.

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
It's not enough.

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
We'll take the chance
to guide public opinion,

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,800
and provoke their anti-wealth sentiment.

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,240
It will be your stage.

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,160
Come on.

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,380
Step forward and take pictures.

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Give me a place.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
Twenty years ago,

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,600
my father and Mai Lingjing's father

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,800
founded the company together.

107
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,240
My father died young.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,480
So, the Mai family
controlled the company.

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,720
In all these years,

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,560
Mai Lingjing has never done
any contributions.

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,120
But she's been the CEO since forever.

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
The rest of us are always

113
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,200
dedicating ourselves to the company.

114
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,520
But we can only be her employees.

115
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,160
Mai Lingjing

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,720
(I believe Su Xi.)
makes a big fortune

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,600
(It's so unfair!)
without doing anything.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
(It's so unfair!)

119
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,700
(It's so unfair!)

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,560
The evidence of kickbacks from suppliers

121
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,600
now comes in handy.

122
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm one of the Mai Group suppliers.

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
I've heard they'll fire Ms. Su.

124
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,560
Now I'll speak for all suppliers.

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,800
Once Ms. Su is fired,

126
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
we'll rescind our contracts in no time.

127
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,640
(It is so unfair!)

128
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
(Su Xi was framed! I hate Mai Lingjing!)
so we choose to work with the Mai's.

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,040
Guys,

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,040
the board has decided

131
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,600
to terminate
the accountability procedure

132
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,840
towards Ms. Su, the General Manager.

133
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,000
Today,

134
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
I'll apologize to Miss Su Xi

135
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,800
on behalf of the board.

136
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
Ms. Su, we're sorry.

137
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,940
(I support Su Xi!)
(Su Xi has won!)

138
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,720
- Hello, Ms. Su.
- Hi, Ms. Su.

139
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,280
- Hello, Ms. Su.
- Hi, Ms. Su.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
Hello, Ms. Su.

141
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,720
- Hello, Ms. Su.
- Hi, Ms. Su.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,640
You said I couldn't fire you yesterday.

143
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Sorry, Ms. Su.

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
We made a mistake.

145
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,680
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

146
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
You're all fired.

147
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,720
Go pack your stuff.

148
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
By the way,

149
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,200
who wrote
"Shameless Mistress" on my door?

150
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,680
Get lost, now!

151
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,840
Or I'll check the security footage.

152
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,040
It's a birthday gift for you.

153
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,960
(Portfolio)
Thank you, Dad.

154
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,480
What is it?

155
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
The company's shares.

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,280
Really?

157
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
Xi will get some, right?

158
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,400
I'll give her something else.

159
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
She's not the same with you.

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,440
The company will be yours.

161
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,560
I've done everything for you.

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,480
Dad,

163
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,040
I'll tell the whole world

164
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,200
what Mai Yuanzhi did.

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
I will make both of them

166
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
lose all reputation.
