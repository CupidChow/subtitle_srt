=Moment of Silence=
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,720
Honey, you're so weak.

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,960
Get more rest.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Don't touch me.

6
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,080
Where is Su Xi?

7
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,320
Su Xi?

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,040
Honey,

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,160
you've forgotten everything?

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,360
What happened?

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
It's OK if you can't remember it.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
I have handled it.

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,600
No one would know.

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,480
Where is Su Xi?

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,520
Honey...

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
You killed her.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,320
The other day,

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
I saw you holding her hands

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,840
when I got to the river bank.

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,320
Lingjing, can you forgive me?

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,160
Do you think I can forgive you

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,320
after you hurt me so badly?

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,480
I'll do anything for you

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,000
if we can bury the hatchet.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,440
I want you

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
to die!

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,840
Honey!

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,240
Don't!

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,640
Honey. Where are you going?

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,880
I'll go find Su Xi!

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,480
But she has died!

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,960
Wang Shiming, you can't fool me

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,560
in such a stupid way.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,240
I don't believe what you said.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,600
Honey,

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
you can't remember it?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
I'll do anything for you.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,520
I want you

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,400
to die!

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Honey!

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't!

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Help!

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Honey,

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
are you crazy?

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
It can prove that you killed her.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
You can't slander me
with fake evidence!

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
I'll call the police now!

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,640
Honey,

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,320
I haven't shown you everything.

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,420
(Xi, come meet me at the river bank.)

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360
(Xi, come meet me at the river bank.)
You met her at the river bank.

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,560
(Xi, come meet me at the river bank.)
And then, she went missing.

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,440
By the way,

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
illicit drugs will be detected
in your blood.

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,720
I injected them into your body.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
You want to call the police?

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,960
Think twice.

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
It will work against you.

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
What do you want?

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,120
How about this?

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,320
Have breakfast with me first.

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,760
And make an announcement
in the company.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Here's your coffee.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,040
It's too hot.

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
I don't want it.

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,040
Make another one!

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,320
Did you hear what I said?

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Do it now!

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
How clumsy you are!

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
Can you do it or not?

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll punish you

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,560
if it happens again!

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,920
Wang Shiming, you've gone too far!

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,720
Really?

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
You're mad at me?

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,280
Now you know

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,400
what a miserable life I was living!

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
You're my kept woman now.

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,680
Get changed and go to work.

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I don't like your dress.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,920
You know what to say in the company?

82
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
Honey, cheer up!

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
Smile for me.

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,920
You're a shameless mistress!

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Stop it!

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Is it Ms. Mai?

87
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
She's a slut!

88
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,600
Guys, listen to me!

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,360
The woman seduced my husband

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
and hurt me badly!

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
You're cuckolded by her!

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
Look at her!

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
She seduced my husband!

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
A slut and a fool!

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Did you set me up?

96
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,520
What a great couple!

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,680
Unbelievable!

98
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,560
I don't buy it.

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
We should go.

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,640
Where are you going?

101
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,280
You have a meeting soon.

102
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Don't keep everyone waiting.

103
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
I can't show up like this!

104
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,680
Why not?

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,440
You look good.

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
Ms. Mai will take a long vacation?

107
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
Ms. Su just got fired.

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,720
If Ms. Mai leaves now,
will the company be impacted?

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,240
No.

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
Mr. Wang has been reinstated.

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,280
Ms. Mai looks weird.

112
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,040
- Is she sick? - Maybe.

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Mr. Wang said
she's in a bad mental state.

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,080
Everyone saw you in a mess.

115
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
You don't need to clean it.

116
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
You just wanted to humiliate me

117
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,160
by embarrassing me in public.

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,760
Are you happy now?

119
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,280
My sweetheart.

120
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,760
Don't play dumb.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,120
I won't be happy

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
unless I can control the company.

123
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Honey,

124
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,680
you can only
keep my pictures in your office.

125
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Wang Shiming! How dare you?

126
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Ouch!

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,480
Ms. Mai, stop it!

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
I'll kill the jerk!

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
- Ms. Mai, don't do it!
- Mr. Wang, are you OK?

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,640
Wang Shiming!

131
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,440
Listen to what you've said!

132
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Wake up!

133
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,960
- Calm down!
- Honey! I'm OK.

134
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,560
Calm down!

135
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Hands off me!

136
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
Get her the medicine!

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
Hurry up!

138
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,240
The medicine!

139
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
She's biting you!

140
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,960
It's OK.

141
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,080
Honey, take the pill.

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm not sick!

143
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,280
Honey!

144
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm not sick!

145
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,080
Take the pill, OK?

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm not sick!

147
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,720
Good.

148
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,040
How is Ms. Mai?

149
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,080
Is she OK?

150
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
Not sure why she suddenly goes insane.

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
She'll be fine after taking the pill.

152
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360
How could it happen?

153
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
She looks very sick.

154
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,240
It's OK.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll look after her at home.

156
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,480
OK.

157
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,440
Don't worry about her.

158
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,000
OK.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Take care of the company, please.

160
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,440
OK, we will.

161
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,160
I'll come back when I can.

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,360
Thank you very much.

163
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,280
You're welcome.
