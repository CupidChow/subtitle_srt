=Episode 4=

3
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,280
You were amazing today.

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,360
I should look at you with new eyes.

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,920
We can't celebrate now.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,480
Search there!

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,880
We didn't find her dead body.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,360
Where is she?

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,920
Mr. Wang.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,880
- Did you find her?
- Hold on.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,590
Where is Lingjing?

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,680
Do you know where she is?

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,600
Please stay calm for now.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,400
The rescue team found her phone.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,920
There are some traces.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,840
She fell down from that spot.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,160
I don't think

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
she is still alive.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
From now on,

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,600
we'll get everything Mai Lingjing had.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,640
You were such a loving husband.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,320
And you were such a good friend.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,320
It's not true!

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,280
Stay here!

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,790
- It's not true!
- It's dangerous to go there!

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,280
Honey!

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,120
Honey!

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,560
Let me pass!

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,480
Please!

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,080
Let me pass!

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,680
Honey!

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Lingjing!

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,300
(Logan Center)

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,640
Thank you, guys.

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you for your help.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
If I went home earlier,

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
Lingjing might not go extreme...

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,680
I'll do the talking.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
We asked everyone to get here

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,480
to release your worries.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,680
We'll handle Ms. Mai Lingjing's work
as soon as possible

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,960
so that the company will function well.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,980
Our shareholders can rest assured.

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
If Ms. Mai Lingjing died,

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,560
how would you distribute her equity?

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,600
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Lingjing will be fine!

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,160
May I ask why Ms. Mai Lingjing
suffered from depression?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Lingjing!

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,080
Lingjing!

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,520
Lingjing!

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
If I went home earlier that day,

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,400
The company will function well...

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,520
Lingjing might not go extreme...

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,440
If I went home earlier...

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,040
Lingjing!

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,040
You wake up.

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,960
Lingjing.

60
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,880
I've regained my hearing?

61
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,090
What are you staring at?

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm looking at Mai Lingjing's treasure.

63
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,880
She made it with her dad
when she was little.

64
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,920
It was not fair.

65
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,440
Mai Yuanzhi killed my dad
in order to keep the company to himself.

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
I became an orphan.

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,280
But Mai Lingjing lived a happy life

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
with her dad after everything.

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,760
And she showed off her little creations.

70
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I know.

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,760
She didn't let me touch them.

72
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
She thought I might break any.

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Really?

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,680
Now I'm feeling much better.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,880
Do you want to have a try?

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
You're childish.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Well,

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Mai Lingjing is dead now.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,200
You still don't dare to go against her?

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Or it's because

81
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
you'll never get the guts

82
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,000
as her kept man,

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,480
right?

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,640
Honey!

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
Honey!

86
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,760
Honey!

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Hi, sweetie!

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Where have you been?

89
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,790
I'm really worried about you.

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
I've got good news for you.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
What is it?

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,280
Why is she still alive?

93
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
Why?

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
I should've seen her dead body
before I left!

95
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Wang Shiming,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,520
kill her.

97
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,240
Kill her now!

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Sweetie,

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
what's the good news?

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm hungry now.

101
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
I need to grab a bite.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,040
OK.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,360
I'll cook noodles for you.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,720
Let's go.

105
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Come on.

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,280
Honey,

107
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,600
sit here and wait.

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,920
I'll go cooking in the kitchen.

109
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,920
OK.

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm not feeling well.

111
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,000
I need to use the bathroom.

112
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,440
OK.

113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
Wang Shiming!

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,040
The hearing loss
was caused by a head injury.

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
But the accident

116
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,960
happened to cure you.

117
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Great!

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll tell my husband the good news.

119
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
I want to surprise him.

120
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,760
Go back now.

121
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,560
I'll handle her.

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,200
It's the best chance to kill her.

123
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,960
Everyone thinks she has died.

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,640
We need to make sure
no one has seen her

125
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,600
coming back alive.

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:05,960
Wait...

127
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Listen.

128
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
Get out now.

129
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,200
I'll take care of everything.

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Wang Shiming!

131
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Honey, the noodles will be ready soon.

132
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,520
Why are you back?

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Lingjing?

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,720
Lingjing!

135
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
I was so scared!

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,000
The rescue team said
you fell from the dam.

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get you worried.

138
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,800
You fell asleep in the car.

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,960
So, I went to sweep.

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,370
When I got back, you went missing.

141
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,320
Where did you go?

142
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,040
I only remember
I fell asleep in your car.

143
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
Then I got befuddled.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
I don't know what happened.

145
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,280
Do you know where you were
when you woke up?

146
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Do you?

147
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,200
I was in the grass.

148
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,480
The grass?

149
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,840
We searched
all the grass near the car.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
But we didn't.

151
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,080
Where exactly were you?

152
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,320
I'll go check.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,120
If she told us the truth,

154
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
no one would know she's alive,

155
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,040
or she has come back home.

156
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,080
I'd suggest

157
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
you should kill her now!

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,120
Easier said than done.

159
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
What should I do with her dead body?

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
You were being smart yesterday.

161
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
Why are you stupid now?

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
We can drug her again

163
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,790
and make her fall down from the cliff
in the back of the cemetery.

164
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
Everyone believes she died there.

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
No one would suspect us

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,240
even if someone found her body.

167
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
You're right.

168
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,800
Let's do it.
