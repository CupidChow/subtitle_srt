=Moment of Silence=
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,160
Su Xi!

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Honey.

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,440
Sweetie.

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,680
Now you're sure she's still deaf.

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,760
When will you take actions?

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,080
We're very close to her.

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,560
If you ran over and killed her,

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,980
the police would suspect us in no time.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,600
We have to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

12
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,360
Honey.

13
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,440
I talked about work

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,240
with Su Xi just now.

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,960
I'll drive the car.

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,000
OK.

17
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,920
Wang Shiming...

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,040
I've told you I'll pay the debt!
Don't call me again.

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,960
How dare you?

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,240
Honey, who was that?

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,520
Just some cold call.

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,920
Why are you here?

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
I told you not to come.

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm here to visit Lingjing.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,880
And I want to check

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,400
if they beefed up security
and installed more cameras.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,320
Hi, Xi!

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,720
Lingjing, I want to mooch meals off you.

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
Are you happy to see me?

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,400
I really am.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
I will start cooking.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,720
Then I'll join you.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Su Xi,

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
don't play any tricks!

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,600
Mr. Wang,

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,040
why did you hang up on me?

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,560
Mr. Zhao...

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,320
You don't remember our deal?

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,890
I didn't make things clear on the phone.

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,320
So, I have to visit you in person.

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,440
Mr. Wang,

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
it's a gift

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,120
for you and your wife.

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,720
Mrs. Wang, you're young and pretty.

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,200
Mr. Wang,

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
you're a lucky guy.

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Thank you.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Who is this?

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,240
She's our domestic worker.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,600
She is clumsy of speech

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
and deaf.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,040
OK.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,440
Put it away.

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm begging you.

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Give me one more month.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,640
I will pay you back by then.

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,080
One month.

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,280
Mr. Zhao, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,960
The domestic worker is dull.

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,920
Shiming,

62
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,320
tell her to go cooking now.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,520
Get out of our hair.

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,680
Mr. Zhao,

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,240
would you like to join us?

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
I'll tell her to cook more.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,840
Thanks, but no.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,960
I just wanted to visit Mr. Wang.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,880
Mr. Zhao.

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh, Mr. Wang.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,720
I've got more gifts in my car.

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,160
Can you go get them?

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,680
No, thank you.

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,480
I'll pay you a visit soon.

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
Mr. Wang, don't refuse me.

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,040
How about this?

77
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,880
My people will take the gifts here.

78
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,640
Well,

79
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,960
Mr. Zhao, you're being generous.

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,240
I'll go with you.

81
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,240
Leave it to me.

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,320
Mr. Zhao,

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I'll go with you.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,960
Go to the kitchen.

85
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,200
This is my gift!

86
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,360
Do you like it?

87
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,200
What are you doing?
Why did you hit him?

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Shut up!

89
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
What do you want?

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,840
She has nothing to do with it.
Leave her alone, please.

91
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,720
You haven't paid me back!

92
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,520
How dare you bargain with me?

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Your wife is beautiful.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
If you don't pay the debt,

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,640
I'll give her a hard lesson!

96
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
I'll pay you back.

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
I promise!

98
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,080
One more month.

99
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,000
If you can't pay the debt by then,

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,000
we will kick your ass!

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,640
Do as what we say.

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Let's go.

103
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,480
Zhongnan,

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,240
help me investigate the guy.

105
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
Wang Shiming!

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,360
You went to gamble?

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,200
How much do you owe him?

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
None of your business.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,280
I can pay him soon.

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,120
How will you do it?

111
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,280
Trust me.

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,320
I want Mai Lingjing to die
more than you do.

113
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,280
I didn't marry her for I loved her.

114
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
I have no feelings for her.

115
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
I can't wait until the baby is born.

116
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,320
Mai Lingjing must die!

117
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,760
When will you take actions?

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,160
Within a week.

119
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,360
I'll call the killer soon.

120
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,400
However,

121
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,080
I need to confirm something.

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,480
Did you go to the cemetery on that day?

123
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
I got there two hours earlier.

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,200
Mai Lingjing is alive.

125
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,160
Do you know it?

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,120
I watched the news.

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
How will you explain it?

128
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,840
I thought Su Xi had killed her.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,150
I was going to deal with Su Xi,

130
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,440
but you showed up.

131
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
And you've known

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
what happened next.

133
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,900
You don't believe me?

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,680
Fine.

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Hold on.

136
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Do me a favor.

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,960
Milk for you.

138
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
Mom, what brings you here?

139
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,520
Hi, Mom.

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,200
I've brought you nice food.

141
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,840
Cold bread and iced milk

142
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,360
are only for foreigners.

143
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
Look what I've got.

144
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,640
We Chinese should always

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,160
have warm porridge for breakfast.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,640
I cooked it all night.

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,280
The ingredients

148
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,560
are good for you and the baby.

149
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,760
Come on, Lingjing.

150
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Take your time.

151
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,040
Thank you, Mom.

152
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
You're welcome. Enjoy it.

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
You and Xi screwed it up?

154
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
Didn't you have a good plan?

155
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,200
You failed to kill her last time.

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
When will you do it again?

157
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Mom,

158
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
just leave it to me.

159
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,480
Don't tell anyone about it.

160
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
Why would I do it?

161
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm not a fool!

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,320
Lingjing, do you like it?

163
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,000
The porridge is good, right?

164
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,040
I put ass-hide gelatin, ossa draconis, yam,
walnuts, and lotus seeds.

165
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
I know you can't hear me.

166
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Anyways,

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
all good stuff in it.

168
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,400
You failed to kill her last time.

169
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
Didn't you have a good plan?

170
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,280
I should've seen her dead body
before I left.

171
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,320
Easier said than done.

172
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,360
What should I do with her dead body?

173
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
I want Mai Lingjing to die
more than you do.

174
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
I can't wait until the baby is born.

175
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
I don't want the baby!

176
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,640
Mom!
