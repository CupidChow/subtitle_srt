3
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
Honey, what are you doing?

4
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,720
Xi is still here.

5
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,360
We should go upstairs.

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,600
Xi needs to go to bed, too.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,200
OK.

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
Xi, good night.

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,600
Lingjing, happy birthday.

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,800
Let me hug you.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,760
I'll go upstairs.

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:28,960
Let's go.

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,640
Stop doing it!

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you crazy?

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Go, now!

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,280
Shiming, don't fret.

17
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,920
She can't hear us.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
You don't need to lower your voice.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,920
Lingjing!

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,320
Your bed is huge!

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,480
I like it a lot!

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
She'll be mad if you wake her up!

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
Why are you caring for her so much?

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,560
You love being her kept man again?

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,080
I've never wanted that!

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm doing it for both of us!

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
Xi, I'm begging you.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Stop doing it.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,040
Let's go to your room.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Go get some sleep.

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,320
I don't want to.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,560
I feel lonely when sleeping alone.

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,120
I want to join you in the huge bed.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Xi, I'll go to your room.

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,160
And I'll stay with you, OK?

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Fine.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Let's go.

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,280
Move!

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,440
What are you doing?

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Stop it!

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,520
I've changed my mind.

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,440
Want something more exciting?

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,280
Su Xi, are you done?

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Our plan will work out
tomorrow afternoon!

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,880
Don't screw it up now!

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
Listen.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,800
I am crazy.

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,480
So, don't betray me!

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,800
Or I'll go down with you!

50
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,600
Wang Shiming, listen carefully.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,960
Don't you ever go behind my back.

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,480
And I won't allow her
to give birth to the baby.

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,960
You think I'll be afraid of you?

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,160
Don't do anything
before I carry out the plan

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,400
tomorrow afternoon!

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Xi!

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
Su Xi!

58
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,920
You killed her.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
I didn't do anything.

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,480
It was you!

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,440
It was you!

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
I did nothing!

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,920
It was you!

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,200
I didn't do it!

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Shiming, look carefully.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Who killed her?

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
No, I didn't do it!

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,920
I didn't do it!

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,160
I didn't kill her!

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,280
I didn't!

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,880
I didn't!

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
I didn't kill her!

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,000
Honey?

74
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,000
Where is Lingjing?

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,760
Where did she go?

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,400
What are you doing?

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,690
You don't remember, Shiming?

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
It is our plan, right?

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,920
I want to kill her
without anyone finding out.

80
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,520
If Mai Lingjing dies at home,

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,800
we'll be the suspects!

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,540
You change your mind
because she's pregnant?

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,840
I know exactly what you want.

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
You plan to have the baby.

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,400
And the baby can help you
get more properties.

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,160
As for me,

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,360
you want me to disappear right now.

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,320
So, you can live happily

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
with your wife and your baby, right?

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,360
See?

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm right about it.

92
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,800
Fine.

93
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
You think I'll betray you?

94
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
Then kill me now.

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,800
You...

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,520
It's just vitamin.

97
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,120
Don't panic.

98
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,440
You're really crazy!

99
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,040
Since the Mai family ruined my family,

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
I've been crazy.

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,720
So, Shiming,

102
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,600
you should be loyal to me.

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,440
Don't forget

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,200
how Mai Lingjing lost her hearing.

105
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,000
We were in the same boat five years ago.

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
If anything goes wrong,

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
both of us will be punished!

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,920
Xi! Shiming!

109
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
Honey! Xi!

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,880
Hands off.

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Honey!

112
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Hands off!

113
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,040
Xi!

114
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,440
You want Lingjing to see us?

115
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,280
Honey!

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,880
Let go of me!

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,920
What happened?

118
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,720
The milk was spilled.

119
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
Don't clean it up.

120
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,560
Leave it to Shiming.

121
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,880
I'll get you a band-aid.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
Shiming, as you know,

123
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,680
Lingjing is kind to me.

124
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,240
The Mai family has helped me a lot.

125
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
OK, time for breakfast.

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,440
Shiming loves you deeply.

127
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,600
I'm really happy for you.

128
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
I hope you can

129
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
find your Mr. Right soon.

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,560
Lingjing, enjoy the food.

131
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,600
You'll die this afternoon.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
The killer you found is reliable, right?

133
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,840
Did you hear me?

134
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,880
Don't worry.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm prepared for everything.

136
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,560
She will vanish

137
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,760
this afternoon.

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,400
I want to see her being killed.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,520
We've been waiting for long enough

140
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,400
to get a perfect alibi.

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,040
Now our chance has come finally.

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,880
So, I need to warn you

143
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
that you can't...

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Honey,

145
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,000
you have a meeting this morning.

146
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,000
Yep, time is up.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
I'll go with Xi.

148
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
Take care.

149
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,520
Thank you.

150
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
Our day has come.

151
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,360
You have an appointment
with Mr. Du, right?

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,920
He's an important client.

153
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
Take everything seriously.

154
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,200
I will.

155
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Lingjing.

156
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,280
Remember to visit
your dad's grave this afternoon.

157
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,840
I'll go with Shiming after work.

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,920
See you at the cemetery.

159
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,400
OK.

160
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,440
Don't screw it up.

161
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,080
Just stick to the plan.

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,640
Let's wait and see.

163
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,520
Remember our deal this afternoon.

164
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,360
Besides,

165
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
Su Xi appears to be mentally unstable.

166
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm afraid she'll get us into trouble.

167
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,520
You want me to drop the plan?

168
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,680
If we don't take care
of the crazy woman,

169
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,960
she will destroy us one day.

170
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
So,

171
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,760
I should kill both of them?

172
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,520
Leave no trace.
