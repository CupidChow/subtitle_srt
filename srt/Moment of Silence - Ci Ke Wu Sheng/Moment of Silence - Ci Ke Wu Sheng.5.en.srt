=Moment of Silence=

3
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,500
I don't have much time
to call the police.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,440
I should tell everyone I'm still alive.

(Property Management Office)

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,880
Hello.

7
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,740
Property Management Office?

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm an owner from the East Zone.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,760
Honey,

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,680
what's up?

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,240
Well,

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
I lost my phone.

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,560
So, I'll just use the old one.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,160
Is it still working?

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,200
Let me check.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,620
If it breaks down,

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:21,840
(No Outgoing Calls)
If it breaks down,

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,400
(No Outgoing Calls)
I'll get a new one for you tomorrow.

(No Outgoing Calls)

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,640
It works well.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,000
You can use it.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
Your noodles are ready.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Honey, what's wrong?

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,880
Not feeling well?

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
No.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,560
Lingjing, enjoy the noodles.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,120
Shiming is good at cooking.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,800
I put the drug in the bowl.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,720
She'll pass out

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
after taking a bite.

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,280
Would you like to share some?

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm not hungry.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,320
Lingjing, you go ahead.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
I'll answer the door.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
Lingjing, go ahead.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Shiming will answer.

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Hello, Mr. Wang.

40
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
A home owner passed by

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
and saw your house on fire.

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,720
Well, they got it wrong.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,760
Everything is OK here.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,920
Well, great.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
See you around.

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
I'll go have a look.

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
Lingjing, wait!

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Good to hear that.

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,240
Honey!

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,240
What happened?

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,040
Ms. Mai!

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
I thought you were...

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,680
It's great to see you.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
Xi, listen.

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Tell everyone in the company
that I am back.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,200
I don't want them to worry about me.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,890
How could she be alive?

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,880
She was almost dead.

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Do you think

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,440
Mai Lingjing is a little weird today?

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
What?

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
Do you think

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
she has regained her hearing?

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
Honey.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,080
Why didn't you die?

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Tell me why!

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,880
Why are you still alive?

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,640
Why didn't you die?

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
Honey.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,120
Honey.

71
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
What's wrong?

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,280
Nothing.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
I think

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
I had a nightmare.

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,080
Maybe you're tired.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,560
Probably.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,280
Watch out!

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,200
Honey.

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,800
Honey.

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,120
Honey.

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
Go back to sleep.

82
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,200
I need to go to work.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,920
OK.

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,840
Watch out!

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,080
OK. Got it.

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,680
OK.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,640
Yes.

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,160
Is she awake?

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,720
Yep.

90
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,160
Has she regained her hearing?

91
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm testing her now.

92
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,240
You've got a killer, right?

93
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,880
Tell him to kill her again.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,360
I'll call him soon.

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,680
Honey.

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
Sweetie,

97
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,040
the board directors said hello to you.

98
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,120
Will you go back to the company

99
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
so that they'll feel assured?

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,680
Sure.

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,200
I'll have a facial first,
and then go to the company.

102
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,760
OK.

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,960
Zhongnan,

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,520
when you found me in the cemetery,

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,040
I passed out, right?

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Yes. You lied there,
and I couldn't wake you up.

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,120
Did you see anything weird?

108
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,240
For instance,

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
anyone suspicious nearby?

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,680
Anyone suspicious?

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Like Su Xi and Wang Shiming.

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
Were they near me?

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
I didn't see them.

114
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,120
You were there alone.

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,880
What's wrong?

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
Nothing.

117
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Wang Shiming upset you again?

118
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,960
No.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,600
Lingjing,

120
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Mr. Mai helped me a lot.

121
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,640
I never did anything for him
because he died young.

122
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,440
You're his only daughter.

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,240
So, I'll do anything for you

124
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
if you need me.

125
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,040
Zhongnan,

126
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
I need to ask a favor.

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Investigate Su Xi and Wang Shiming.

128
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
I think they're plotting something.

129
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,080
No problem.

130
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
You know what I was doing
when I was abroad.

131
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
I think they're

132
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,840
having an affair.

133
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
And they want to kill me.

134
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,330
I can't alert them
by calling the police.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,080
I need to find out
why they are doing it.

136
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
Our new brand has done a good job.

137
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,000
The sales have increased 24 percents.

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,280
But compared to the last quarter, we...

139
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Excuse me, Mr. Zhang.
I need to ask you something.

140
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,380
Why didn't you type words
on the PowerPoint slides?

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,520
I didn't have time to do it.

142
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,960
They've been busy recently,
so the schedule is tight.

143
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,400
They forgot you'll be in the meeting.

144
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
Guys, I'm sorry for that.

145
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,960
Ms. Mai is deaf.

146
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,400
So, she always adds on more work

147
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,800
and wastes your time.

148
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,320
Please forgive her.

149
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,840
Ms. Mai,

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,760
I scolded them just now.

151
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
Should I ask him to revise it

152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,160
and type the words for you?

153
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
No need to do it.

154
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,980
Don't waste more time.

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,760
Keep going.

156
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,640
The plan for the next quarter...

157
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,080
Sorry.

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
I'll keep going.

160
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,440
She was in the meeting just now.

161
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
Yes. But she couldn't hear anything.

162
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,360
Why did she attend it?

163
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,640
Mr. Zhang says

164
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,040
having meetings with her
is to waste time.

165
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,960
Exactly.

166
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,160
It's troublesome enough
for us to make false contracts

167
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,080
for her to sign each month.

168
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,620
Last time...

169
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,840
How did you test her?

170
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
She reacted to the phone rings.

171
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,880
I have doubts, too.

172
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,480
This morning, I left the tap running.

173
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,880
But she didn't do anything.

174
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,040
Maybe it was a coincidence.

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,880
If she regained her hearing,

176
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,240
we would be screwed!

177
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,660
- Kill her as soon as possible.
- No.

178
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,680
The security has been beefed up.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,220
They have installed more cameras.

180
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,000
It's too risky to do it now.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,920
Save your crap.

182
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,520
You don't want to do it at all.

183
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,880
Fine.

184
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
If you don't do it,

185
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,840
I will.

186
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
Su Xi!

187
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,360
Where are you going?

188
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,520
None of your business.

189
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,680
She's here.

190
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,560
You should be her driver now.

191
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll drive her home.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,960
See you at your place.

193
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
Wang Shiming, listen to me.

194
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,680
If we don't kill her,

195
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,560
she'll control the company one day.

196
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,560
She'll ask you to stay at home

197
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,800
and take care of the baby.

198
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,080
You'll lose all your dignity
and continue to be her kept man.

199
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,760
Enough!

200
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,760
You're mad?

201
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
What a loser!

202
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,440
I can be patient.

203
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,200
However,

204
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,040
I need to make sure

205
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,600
if she is still deaf.

206
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,960
Su Xi,

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,990
what do you want?

208
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,880
Su Xi, what are you doing?

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Su Xi!

210
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
Su Xi!

211
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,920
Su Xi!

212
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,020
(Speed: 1 km per minute)

213
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
Su Xi!
