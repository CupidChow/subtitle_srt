00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,760
Eat something.

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,360
If you lose weight,

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,680
others may think I mistreat you.

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,560
Fine.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll feed you.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,280
Eat it.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,520
Just eat it!

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Do what I say!

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,720
You think you're still

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200
the CEO of the Mai Group?

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
I have controlled the company!

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,320
If you know your place,

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,360
just obey my orders.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,160
Eat it!

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,400
Eat!

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,760
Swallow it!

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,600
Now!

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,840
I put mental drugs in it!

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
Swallow it!

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,600
Sorry, the subscriber

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Hello,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,800
OK.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Got it.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,960
(I need to find my phone)

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,360
(and call the police.)

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,760
(I'll call the police.)

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,600
(I'll call the police.)

(Caijia Villa)

37
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,600
Honey,

38
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,440
run faster.

39
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,640
Hello.

40
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,400
Can I help you?

41
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,560
Well,

42
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
you're looking for the owner?

43
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
She moved out.

44
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,880
Honey,

45
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,640
he's your nanny.

46
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,200
Say hello to him.

47
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,840
Yu, how soon will we get there?

48
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
We're out of town.

49
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Will be there in an hour.

50
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,960
Honey,

51
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,600
you woke up.

52
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,160
Look around.

53
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
What a beautiful view!

54
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,000
But it's a remote place.

55
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,560
No one comes here often.

56
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
Wang Shiming,

57
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,480
push me into the lake if you dare.

58
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Honey,

59
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
your words hurt me a lot.

60
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
I was nice and gentle to you.

61
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,840
But you thought I was weak.

62
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
I won't push you down

63
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
because I care about you.

64
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
But you think I dare not.

65
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Now what?

66
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,320
You're scared?

67
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Just kill me if it's what you want.

68
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,840
Now your words are more hurtful.

69
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
Think about it.

70
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
We've been married for years

71
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,640
and I treat you well.

72
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,960
Don't you think I'm a good husband?

73
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
It's because

74
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,720
you've been acting!

75
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
You fooled me.

76
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,800
But you couldn't fool my dad!

77
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
I wouldn't kill you

78
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
if you didn't mention him!

79
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,160
You asked for it!

80
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,960
It's not my fault.
