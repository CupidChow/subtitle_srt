00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,720
Yu, I'll go to work.

4
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,840
I'll be back tomorrow.

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,760
Keep an eye on her.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,400
Turn on the signal blocker 24-7.

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,200
Got it.

(Lingjing)

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,640
I feel cold.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
Open the curtains.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
This side, too.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
I want some water.

15
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,240
Hello.

16
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,520
You just moved in, right?

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,360
I live next door.

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
But I've never seen you.

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,880
I've been living here for over 20 years.

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,440
I got the wrong person.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,320
Sorry for that.

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,720
Hello.

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,840
You just moved in, right?

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,480
I live next door.

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
Did Wang move out?

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Well...

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,880
I got the wrong person.

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,840
Hello.

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,120
Are you new here?

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
I live next door.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,960
It's my house.

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,640
You idiot.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,240
Go away.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,520
Hi, there.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,600
You just moved in, right?

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,520
I live next door.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
I'll introduce myself.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,160
My surname is Zhou. You can call me Zhou.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,640
Nice to meet you here.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,320
Go away.

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,800
Hold on.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,720
We're neighbors.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
Can I add you on WeChat?

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Please?

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,180
(No Signal)

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
(No Signal)
Wait...

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,680
You don't have

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,960
any signal here?

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
Hold on.

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,000
Listen,

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,200
your window is too bright.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,360
Is the house on fire?

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
Don't mess with me!

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
Wait. I bought my house not long ago.

57
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
The fire would burn it, right?

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Let me check.

59
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,180
I saw it just now.

60
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,200
What do you want?

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
Who sent you here?

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Bro, my bad.

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm sorry for that.

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,720
Sorry.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't play tricks.

67
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,600
I want to read in the study.

68
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,080
I want to read in the study!

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,440
How can I read in this way?

70
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
Don't try to run.

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
I'll be watching you.

72
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Hello.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,760
Lingjing,

74
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
I'm coming.

75
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,360
Wait there.

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,720
Don't make any sound.

77
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,800
OK.

78
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,400
Gosh!

79
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,560
Lingjing.

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
What the hell?

81
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,000
Hello, boss.

82
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
She's gone.
