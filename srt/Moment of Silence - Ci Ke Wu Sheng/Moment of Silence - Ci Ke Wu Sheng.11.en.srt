It's not here.

00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,040
How could it happen?

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,600
I caught you red-handed.

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,200
You're just like your father,

7
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,840
and always want to steal from my family.

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,320
Did you find the ledger?

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,560
The walls have ears.

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,640
I'll find out where you hide it.

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,640
I knew Wang Shiming
was ill-intentioned

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,160
when he offered to find a house for me.

13
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,960
You bribed him, right?

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,160
I didn't know he could be loyal to you.

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,760
Here is an official notice.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
The Board of Directors

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,240
will kick you out of
the Mai Group tomorrow.

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Remember to attend it.

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Honey, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,240
She sneaked out and went back.

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
Why no one told me the board
will kick me out?

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
They made the decision this morning.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
Su Xi turned the tide,

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,040
and things drifted off course.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
You're suspected of fraud
for the miscarriage.

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,720
So...

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,680
Everyone has signed?

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
Not yet.

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,920
They'll announce it tomorrow morning.

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,240
We still have a chance
if we can get the ledger.

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Honey,

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,880
will I get the trust fund tomorrow?

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,840
Don't worry.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,890
I'll wire the money to you.

35
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,800
OK.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
Take care.

where are you?

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Something went wrong.

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
I didn't get the ledger.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,820
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
If I didn't get it tomorrow morning,

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
I'd be removed from the board.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,880

good morning.

There is only one meeting agenda.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,520
We will vote to decide

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,240
if Miss Mai Lingjing should continue

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560

and relevant provisions,

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,880
I will conduct the vote

65

on behalf of the board.

66

Miss Mai Lingjing, any questions?

67

No.

68

The vote starts now.

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,080
Raise your hands if you're in favor of
removing Mai Lingjing as the CEO.

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960

79

You've regained your hearing?

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
Mai Lingjing, you're not deaf?

81

What do you think?

82
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,720

100

You asked too many questions.

101

You can't take me down with it.

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
You take advantage of your position

103

and cozy up to the suppliers.

104
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760

109
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,440
you should know

110
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
the Board of Directors listens to me.

111

Let's meet each other halfway.

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,640
Let me off the hook.

113
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,280
I'll ask them to vote again

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,480
and keep your position.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,040
Sounds good?

116
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,720
It's not your place to say it.

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,800
It's outrageous.

118

to everyone!

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,240

Wang Shiming, you're part of it!

128
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,280

I know you're part of the bribery.

However,

132
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,200
if you help me take down Su Xi,

133
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
I'll pay off your debt,

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,080
and forgive you for the nasty things

135
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,280
you've done in the company.

136

lose all reputation.

You should've told me the good news!

Wang Shiming,

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,560
look at you.

152
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,800
You said you wired the money,

159
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
but I didn't get it.

160
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Did the bank need a verification code,

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,990
but you forgot to send it to me?

162
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,760
You're way too stupid.

163
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,040
Do you think

164
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,360
I'll give you nine million?

165
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,440
But you told me just now...

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
I lied to you.

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,880
you can't do this.

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
You'll get me killed,

170
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
you know?

171
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
You deserve to die.

172
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,680
I'll kill you!

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
Mr. Wang,

174
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
she has saved your life!

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
You need to sign two agreements.

176

If you do it,

177
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll pay one million for you.

Mr. Zhao has agreed

179
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,920
the one million can keep you alive
for one month.

180
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,720
What agreements?

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
One is our divorce deal.

182
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,480
The other is an equity transfer agreement.

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
What's the equity transfer about?

184
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,600
To transfer your shares
of the Mai Group.

185
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,560

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
is the company's shares!

192
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,290
Taking the shares away
equals to taking my life!

193
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,590
I can still tell the world
you're part of the bribery

194
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,880
if I want to.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,040
Besides,

196
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,640
I'll pay one million to buy the shares.

197
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,080
It's a good deal for you.

198
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,840
Mr. Zhao...

199
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,160
Mr. Zhao, listen to me.

200
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Set me free.

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,760
My shares are worth
more than 10 million.

202
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,960
You'll lose lots of money

203
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
if you buy them from her.

204
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
Mr. Wang,

205
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,960
if you considered to sell them earlier,

206
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,680
you wouldn't end up here.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
I won't trust you anymore.

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Set me free, please.

209
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,640
I'll sell my shares if you can spare me.

210
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,560
I just need more time.

211
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Shut up.

212
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,600
I've heard enough.

213
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,160
I don't have time.

214
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,000
I trust your wife more.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,360
She'll pay cash.

216
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,800
Just sign.

217
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,480
Don't keep her waiting.

218
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Do it.

219
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,160
Mai Lingjing,

220
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
you can't get away with it!

221
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,040
Hold on.

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,960
You didn't know
Jiang Zhongnan betrayed you.

223
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,480
How did you know him?

224
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
I had investigated him

225
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,960
before I paid him to kill you.

226
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
Jiang Zhongnan

227
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,080
is not whom you think he is.

228
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,080
Do you know

229
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
why he approached you?

230
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,820
(Wu's Club)

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,520
Go check it!

232
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,360
There's smoke inside!

233
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,580
(Women Locker Room)

234
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
(Su Dahai Committed Suicide)

235
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Delete all surveillance footage
when Su died.

236
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,360
Got it, Mr. Mai.

237
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,800
Mr. Su left a few things behind...

238
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,920
Get rid of them.

239
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,680
Leave no trace.
