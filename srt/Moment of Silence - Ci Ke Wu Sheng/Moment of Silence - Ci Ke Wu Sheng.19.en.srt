3
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,680
Honey,

4
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,440
I want to have a baby with you.

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,680
Honey, great.

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
Shiming.

7
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,760
Shiming.

8
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
What are you doing?

9
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
Mom?

10
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,080
What brings you here?

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,480
You should call me first.

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,080
How can you say that?

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
I almost hit you.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
Check your phone.

15
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,880
You didn't pick up my calls.

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,880
Why was that?

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,040
Now I see.

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,880
You don't

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,080
respect me at all!

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,360
Mom.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
I've told you

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,960
I need to work hard
since the company just started.

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
Mai Lingjing died six months ago.

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,120
Why haven't you controlled her company?

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,840
Mom.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
You can't say that.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Mai Lingjing went missing.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
She isn't dead.

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
No one has ever heard from her.

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,160
She must be dead.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,960
Shiming,

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
why did you take a stick?

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,040
Tell me.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,160
What's wrong?

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Mom.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,280
I saw Su Xi the other day.

37
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,960
It's impossible.

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,480
Su Xi died a long time ago.

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,880
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,200
Shiming,

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
tell me the truth.

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,760
Did you kill Su Xi back then?

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Mom, don't mention her name.

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,560
How could you do it?

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,440
You own a big company.

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,080
What will happen
if people know about it?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How foolish!

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,640
Mom.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,680
No one would know if you kept silent.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,680
Did you visit her grave?

51
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
You should go pacify her soul

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
in case she gets upset.

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,440
Shiming,

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
listen to me.

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
Go visit her grave tomorrow.

56
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,480
I'll go with you.

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll go alone.

58
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Shiming,

59
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
you dumped me?

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,640
Did you?

61
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
You're messing with me?

62
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you done?

63
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Su Xi?

64
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
It's you?

65
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
You didn't die?

66
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,320
Wang Shiming,

67
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,160
I died.

68
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
You killed me,

69
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,200
remember that?

70
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
Did you see anyone here?

71
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,040
No.

72
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,400
- Did you see anyone here?
- No!

73
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
You didn't see anyone?

74
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,080
It's impossible!

75
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,760
She died.

76
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,640
Hi, Mr. Wang.

77
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
Did you see Ms. Su?

78
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
I saw her just now.

79
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
But she disappeared.

80
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
Who is she?

81
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,680
Su Xi, Ms. Su.

82
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,400
She comes back here.

83
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,360
Where is she?

84
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
She was here.

85
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
I can't find her now.

86
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
Where is she?

87
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
You big liar!

88
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,480
Who told you to do it?

89
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,440
Who is behind you?

90
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,120
What's going on?

91
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Mr. Wang...

92
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,240
Su Xi is dead.

93
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,800
How could you see her?

94
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,120
Who told you to say it?

95
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,760
Mr. Wang...

96
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,760
What did you mean?

97
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
She...

98
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,480
She can't be dead.

99
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
We all saw her.

100
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,480
Everyone did.

101
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
Who saw her?

102
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Tell me who!

103
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Mr. Wang,

104
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
what's wrong?

105
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
We saw Ms. Su just now.

106
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Yes, she was here.

107
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,480
Yep, I saw her.

108
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
I saw her in the lobby.

109
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
She was in the elevator.

110
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
- I saw her, too.
- In the pantry.

111
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,280
I saw her in the corridor.

112
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Yes, we saw her.

113
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,040
No way!

114
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
Su Xi can't be here!

115
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,840
You had hallucinations!

116
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,400
I met her in the dining room.

117
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,710
- In the meeting room.
- In the pantry.

118
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
I saw her at the front desk.

119
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,880
We saw her.

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
It's true.

121
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
She said hello to me.

122
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,080
You saw a dead person?

123
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,200
You're insane!

124
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,760
Shiming.

125
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,520
Get lost!

126
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,320
I killed Su Xi!

127
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,000
I murdered her!

128
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,800
Should we call the police?

129
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
He killed Ms. Su.

130
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,760
He did it.

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Murderer!

132
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,120
Yes!

133
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,240
Call the police.

134
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
We should.

135
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,200
- Ms. Su!
- Ms. Su!

136
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
Wang Shiming.

137
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,960
Long time no see.
