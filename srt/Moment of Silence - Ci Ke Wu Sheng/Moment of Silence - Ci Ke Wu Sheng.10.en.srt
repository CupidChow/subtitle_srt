=Moment of Silence=
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,200
Why are you here?

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,280
I told you not to come here.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,400
You may get in trouble again.

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,320
I need to see in person

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,160
how Lingjing is after being defeated.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,440
By the way,

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,520
thank you for your help.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,960
Keep it as a secret.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,560
Don't tell her I was involved.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Get lost, now!

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,000
We don't want to see
any ungrateful soul like you!

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,240
Honey, I'll throw her out.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Go get some rest.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,520
Lingjing,

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,760
how do you like it when being stabbed

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,800
in the back?

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,480
My best sister is sophisticated.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,800
Hi, Mr. Wang.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,560
Your wife and your mistress are at war!

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,440
I'll pay you back!

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,840
I will make it!

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
I promise I will!

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,760
Mr. Wang,

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I've heard enough of the empty talk.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,440
I'll pay the debt.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
I promise I will.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
I promise.

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Tell me when.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,280
If you can't do it by then,

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
I won't ask you for money.

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm tired.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,080
I'll sell your organs

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,040
as many as possible.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,720
If it's not enough, fine by me.

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,520
One month.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,200
Two weeks.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,320
Ten days.

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,920
Three days!

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,120
Tomorrow!

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Now you are talking!

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
You didn't need to suffer.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,920
It is due tomorrow.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,480
Lingjing,

46
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,240
I really feel bad for you

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,600
because your husband sucks.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,320
I know.

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,240
He's a big loser.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,200
Why do you have an affair with him?

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
Is it possible

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,320
that I'm just using him as my weapon?

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,480
It depends on who's the attacker,

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
and

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,640
who is the target.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
How is everything?

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,240
Any progress?

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Take a look.

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
If Ms. Su is fired...

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,360
(The Mai Group's scandal comes to light.)
The suppliers spoke for Su Xi

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,760
because they got benefit from her.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,760
They got many kickbacks from Su Xi.

63
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
It's the leverage Su Xi holds on them.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,960
If we can get the ledger,

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,760
we'll take Su Xi down.

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,480
I've got a plan.

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,320
But I need Wang Shiming's help.

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Honey,

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
I lied to you about something.

71
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,520
Su Xi told me everything.

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
How much do you owe the guy?

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,880
Nine million.

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
If I can't pay the debt tomorrow,

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
they will kill me.

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
It won't matter to me if I die.

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,080
But I don't want you to get in trouble.

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Are you serious?

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
You're threatening me, right?

80
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,160
No. No.

81
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,520
Honey, don't get me wrong.

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
They will do anything to get money.

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm just worried about you.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,440
If you really cared about me,

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,400
you'd tell me earlier.

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
Yes.

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm a loser.

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,080
I really am.

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,960
I deserve to die.

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,160
I deserve it.

91
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,160
I deserve to die!

92
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,440
You should've never married

93
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,080
a guy like me.

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
I love you.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
I can pay the debt for you.

96
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,280
However,

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,840
you need to help me with something.

98
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,600
Honey,

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I'll do anything for you.

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
I promise.

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,920
Su Xi has a ledger.

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
You know it, right?

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Help me get it.

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
The location
and the decoration...

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,880
Who are you?

106
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,490
How did you get in?

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,760
Excuse me.

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,120
May I ask who you are?

109
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm the house owner.

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
Who are you?

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
You're the owner?

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,440
Xi, you're here.

113
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,160
I asked them to come.

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,680
I'm going to sell the house.

115
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,120
It's my house.

116
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
You can't sell it.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
My dad bought it for you.

118
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,560
Unfortunately, your name wasn't put on
the property ownership certification

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
before he passed away.

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,800
As a result,

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
it is not your house.

122
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
Fine.

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,680
You want to kick me out?

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Let's wait and see!

125
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,880
Manage to throw Si Xi out.

126
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,080
She'll take the most important thing
before she leaves.

127
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,900
(Surveillance footage)

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,360
After that,

129
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,920
Wang Shiming will appear on the scene.

130
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,880
I've heard about what happened.

131
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,320
Seems Mai Lingjing is really cornered.

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
I'll find you another house.

133
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
You can stay here for now.

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,760
I have prepared toiletries

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,000
for you in the room.

136
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,360
Do you like it?

137
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
I really care about you.

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
Are you still mad at Lingjing?

139
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,040
Don't be.

140
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,640
I'll take you out for dinner.

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,200
Then I'll unpack for you.

142
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,320
You can get laid if you want.

143
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
Oh, come on.

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,480
Let's go.

145
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,840
When Wang Shiming takes her out,

146
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,600
we'll get what we want.

147
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,680
It's not here.

148
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
How could it happen?

149
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
Did you find the ledger?
