=Episode 3=

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,680
Hi, Mr. Wang.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,000
Hi.

5
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,680
Hello.

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
Mr. Wang, hello.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,360
Your wife is still alive?

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,160
This afternoon, you...

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
I'll pay the debt soon.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,960
OK. Waiting for your good news.

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,900
(Monday Afternoon)
(13:52)

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,360
How is it?

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,840
Ms. Su has never left, right?

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,440
No, she hasn't.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,460
She's been in her office.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,760
Where is she?

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,520
Don't worry, Miss Ding.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,160
I'll send you all the files.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,000
OK.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I'll meet you downstairs.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,800
Look through the files.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Mr. Du is downstairs.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,120
I'll go to meet him.

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,800
Xi,

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,120
I asked Mr. Du to meet us here

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,960
so that he will be our alibi.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,280
So,

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,600
Mai Lingjing has to
go to the cemetery on her own.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,120
I know.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Anything else?

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Promise me

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,880
that you won't leave your office today.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,680
The killer is on the way.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,320
He'll handle everything.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,040
I've made a perfect plan.

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,360
Just butt out.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,120
Rest assured.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
I will behave.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,840
Alright.

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,280
I'll go to meet Mr. Du.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
Mr. Du, this way.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Hi, Mr. Wang.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,040
Hi, Mr. Du.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Where is Ms. Su?

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,690
She went to meet you downstairs.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,880
Ms. Su?

47
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,320
I didn't see her.

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,880
You mean the most beautiful woman
in your company?

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,140
(Wang Shiming is calling)

50
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,960
Hello, Su Xi.

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Where are you?

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,400
Didn't we agree to meet at the cemetery?

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,880
Why do you upset the plan now?

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,600
What do you want?

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,120
I just need to see it in person.

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,640
Are you with Mai Lingjing now?

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Thank you.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,520
How did you know?

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm going to send her to her death.

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
I told the killer

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,200
Mai Lingjing will show up alone.

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Come back now!

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,720
I can help the killer finish his task

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,240
if he changes his mind.

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
OK. Talk to you later.

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Wait for my good news.

67
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,960
Hello!

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,240
Hello!

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Su Xi,

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,360
don't try to put me in prison!

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Su Xi...

72
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,760
(Navigation Map)

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,880
(Navigation Map)
Su Xi!

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,400
Su Xi!

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
Where is Mai Lingjing?

76
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,480
She's dead.

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,080
Where is she? Take me there.

78
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
I've told you she's dead!

79
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,280
Go there on your own.

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
I told you many times

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,240
not to do it now and just be patient.

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,480
Why didn't you listen to me?

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,640
After you kill her,

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,600
we'll go to jail

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
and be sentenced to death.

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,480
It's not worth it!

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
I'll warn you one last time.

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,000
It's fine if you want
to revenge for your dad.

89
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
But don't get me into trouble.

90
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,760
Where is Mai Lingjing?

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Where is she?

92
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,240
I drugged her with a high dose.

93
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,280
She couldn't wake up.

94
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,600
You'll get me killed!

95
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Go find her!

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Did the killer take her away?

97
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,380
It's impossible.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,000
He'd tell me if anything went wrong.

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Go find her now.

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
She couldn't go far.

101
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,920
Wang Shiming!

102
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,280
What's up?

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,240
Don't laugh! Say something!

104
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Mai Lingjing is dead.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,800
I told you so.

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,600
She was drugged by me.

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,240
So, when she fell into the lake,

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,000
her arms and legs would be weak,

109
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,920
and nothing could help her out.

110
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Now I'll get what belongs to my family.

111
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
I won!

112
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,360
What are you doing?

113
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
Tell me what you're doing!

114
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,960
Answer my question.

115
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Did you get in
from the front or the back?

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
From the back.

117
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
Good.

118
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,180
There is no surveillance camera.

119
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,800
What do you mean? What are you doing?

120
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,320
I'm making an alibi.

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,800
Mai Lingjing killed herself here
because of her depression.

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Before she did it,

123
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,440
she called me for the last time.

124
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
I went out of the bathroom

125
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,360
and saw a missed call from her.

126
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,000
So,

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,560
I called her back.

128
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
Honey,

129
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,320
I was in the bathroom,

130
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,560
and I didn't hear the phone ringing.

131
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,560
Why did you make a video call?

132
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Where are you?

133
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Mai Lingjing
jumped into the lake already.

134
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
So, she never texted me back.

135
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
In that case,

136
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,080
I had to ask you.

137
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Xi!

138
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,760
Lingjing went to visit her dad's grave.

139
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Shiming,

140
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
what's going on?

141
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,400
I've told her we have a meeting
in the afternoon.

142
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,480
So, we'll go there tomorrow.

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
Why did she go there alone?

144
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
I have no idea.

145
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,600
I don't know what's going on.

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
Shiming, calm down.

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll make some calls.

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
We'll find her.

149
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,400
What's next?

150
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Then, I will

151
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,680
call the killer.

152
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,640
Just drop

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
the plan.

154
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,960
And next,

155
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,960
I'll put her phone back.

156
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,680
You drive to the front gate.

157
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,280
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

158
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,760
I'll call the company

159
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,880
and tell people Mai Lingjing is missing.

160
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,320
Get me a rescue team.

161
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,880
Hello.

162
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,560
You go in the cemetery
from the front gate.

163
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,480
The security guard will remember you.

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,240
Thank you.

165
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,080
Hello, Su Xi.

166
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
- Did you get there?
- Yes.

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360
I asked the guard to look for her.

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
The rest part

169
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,120
depends on how we perform.

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,160
Stay calm.

171
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Maybe Ms. Mai lost her phone.

172
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,200
Did you contact the rescue team?

173
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,960
I'll pay as much as they want.
Go there quickly.

174
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,160
I'll call them now.

175
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
Lingjing!

176
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,400
Ms. Mai!

177
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,960
Where did she go?

178
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,000
It's all my fault.

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,980
I knew she was suffering
from depression.

180
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,100
I could talk to her
when visiting her dad's grave.

181
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,920
I'm swamped at work,

182
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,400
so I can't make time for her.

183
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,360
Ms. Su,

184
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,720
please calm down.

185
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
I'll go down there to check.

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,120
OK.

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,120
Captain.

188
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
Let's go check there.

189
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,880
Ms. Mai!

190
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,640
Lingjing!

191
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,680
Ms. Mai!

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,560
So many people are here.

193
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,200
I'm afraid something will happen.

194
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,600
The more people here,
the messier the scene.

195
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,480
In that case,

196
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
we'll be safer.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,720
Unless they can find her.

198
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,880
Honey!

199
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,880
Lingjing!

200
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,840
I found something!
