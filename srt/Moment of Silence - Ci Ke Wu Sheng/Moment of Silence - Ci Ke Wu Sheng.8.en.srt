=Moment of Silence=
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,840
Mai Lingjing will die tonight.

4
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,320
Don't ruin my plan again.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,720
Honey!

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,480
Honey!

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,040
You make me sick!

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,360
Hey, look.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,560
The video is already online.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
It's just a few minutes.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,880
Thousands of people watched it.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,680
Wait...

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,260
(CEO cheated on his wife with her best friend)

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
Hey, have you heard?

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Ms. Mai is pregnant.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Everyone knows about it.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,840
The cheating couple really sucks!

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,640
Exactly! They will be punished.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
The mistress must pay for it.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,480
- Ms. Su...
- Ms. Su...

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,520
Keep talking.

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,040
Sorry, Ms. Su.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,400
Why did you stop?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,160
You were having a nice chat, right?

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,320
Go to the Human Resource Office.
You're fired.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,840
Never show up before me!

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,280
You can't fire us like that!

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm the General Manager! I can do it!

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,800
Do you still want your redundancy pay?

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,440
The Board of Directors has decided

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
to fire you!

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,040
Don't be so swellheaded!

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,800
How pathetic you are!

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Let's go.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,120
How dare she?

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,920
What an arrogant person she is!

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,520
Mr. Wang. Ms. Su.

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,840
The Board of Directors
decided to hold a meeting.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
I'll hold you two accountable
on behalf of the board.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,400
Mr. Yue,

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
it's not your place to criticize me.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,760
It's a decision made by a majority vote.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,480
If you're against the decision,

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,160
you can consult
our Legal Department.

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,360
Today's accident

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,760
has a huge negative impact.

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
It caused our stock to hit a limit down.

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
If we don't take action in time,

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
we'll lose much more tomorrow.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,360
Cut to the chase.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
In order to restore our reputation,

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
the board has decided

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,560
to ask both of you
to resign from the company.

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,600
You can keep your shares, though.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
Did Mai Lingjing tell you to do so?

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,920
Su Xi!

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,800
You set me up and then kick me out?

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
Ms. Su, listen carefully.

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,720
It's made by the board.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,160
Mr. Yue,

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
Ms. Su and I

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,080
should take responsibilities.

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,400
But will the stock price go up

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,880
after you fire both of us?

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't think so.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,760
The company will lose
two senior managers.

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't you know it?

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Mai Lingjing set us up!

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Mr. Wang,

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,240
the board has got another plan.

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
If you two can apologize

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
in public at the news conference,

73
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,880
and come to an understanding
with Ms. Mai,

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,720
the board will consider
to keep your positions.

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
No way!

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,760
Ms. Su,

77
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
the board is serious about the decision!

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,240
Xi!

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,520
Xi! Listen to me!

80
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,680
Stop lying to me!

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,400
Get lost!

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
What else can I do?

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,430
Do you have any choice?

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
Go beg Mai Lingjing if you want.

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,640
I will never do it no matter what!

86
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,240
The board could fire you!

87
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
And Mai Lingjing would be happy!

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,280
Xi,

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
you know she deceived you.

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,480
If she could do it as your friend,

91
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
you can beat her at her own game.

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,600
I didn't ask you to beg her.

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
Just put on a show.

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,120
We've been doing it for years.

95
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,720
Don't forget about our plan.

96
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
Yeah.

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000
I've been enduring it for many years.

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,760
Xi...

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,160
Save it.

100
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,640
Go flatter Mai Lingjing if you want.

101
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,680
You're on board, right?

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,440
Honey,

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,680
I lost my mind and made a mistake.

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,840
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,240
I'll apologize to you

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
and to our unborn baby.

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,120
Please forgive me.

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,080
Our baby needs me.

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
Su Xi,

111
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
kneel down and apologize!

112
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,440
Su Xi!

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,720
Kneel down!

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,120
Mr. Mai,

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,040
I don't know
why I did such a stupid thing.

117
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,880
I don't deserve you.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,840
I know I'm a bad person.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
I'm so sorry.

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,040
It was all my fault.

121
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Could you please forgive me?

122
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,560
Could you ask Lingjing

123
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
to forgive me, please?

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,440
It was my fault.

125
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,120
I know I made a mistake.

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,840
It doesn't matter.

128
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,280
Let's start over.

129
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Lingjing,

130
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm very sorry.

131
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,080
No matter what happens,

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,240
you'll always be my sister.

133
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,040
I've promised

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,880
I'll look after you forever.

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,120
Lingjing,

136
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
it was all my fault.

137
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
Could you forgive me?

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,920
I will forgive you.

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
But you can't do it to me again.

140
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,400
Can you promise?

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I promise.

142
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,280
I promise it won't happen again.

143
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
OK.

144
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,160
Lingjing,

145
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,000
will you go to the news conference

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
with me tomorrow?

147
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,560
I want to apologize to everyone
when you're beside me.

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,920
Lingjing, it's OK.

149
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,440
I can handle it on my own

150
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,200
if you don't want to go with me.

151
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,360
But...

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,640
I'm so scared.

153
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Everyone is cursing me.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,880
They want me to die.

155
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,440
I'll go with you.

156
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,800
Lingjing, really?

157
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,040
From now on,

158
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm willing to be
under everyone's supervision,

159
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,920
and to be a good employee,

160
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,960
as well as a good husband.

161
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,320
I'll be a good father in the future.

162
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,960
I'm here to apologize to the society.

163
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
Please, trust me,

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
and supervise me.

165
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
I'm asking you all to supervise me, too.

166
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,280
I must apologize to Lingjing.

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
And I must thank her for everything.

168
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,160
She forgave me yesterday.

169
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,400
I'll return her kindness
for the rest of my life.

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,320
Ms. Mai,

171
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,000
the stock of the Mai's Group
hit the bottom yesterday.

172
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,320
The market value shed 100 million.

173
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
Did you truly forgive the affair

174
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,640
between your husband and your sister?

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,400
Or did you only do it

176
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,840
under the board's pressure?

177
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,040
I...

178
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,200
I...

179
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,680
Lingjing said she'd forgive me last night.

180
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
I'm the only family to her now.

181
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,560
We grew up together.

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
She has helped me
to get my achievements.

183
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,040
Lingjing,

184
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,680
I swear to my dad.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,040
I won't make the same mistake.

186
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
You've hurt my dad.

187
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,400
And you've hurt me.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You and my husband

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
know clearly I can't hear anything.

190
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,240
You hurt me on purpose

191
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,080
because I'm pregnant and disabled.

192
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,440
You think I don't know

193
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,160
the nasty things you did?

194
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
I have never

195
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
told her I'd forgive them.

196
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,960
And I won't forgive them.

197
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,520
They forced me to come here.

198
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
You crazy woman! I'll kill you!

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Su Xi, are you crazy?

200
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
Honey!
