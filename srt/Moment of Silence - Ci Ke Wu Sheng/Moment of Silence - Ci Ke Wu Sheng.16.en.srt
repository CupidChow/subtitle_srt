3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,120
It's because

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,680
you've been acting!

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,120
You fooled me.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,040
But you couldn't fool my dad!

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,560
I wouldn't kill you

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
if you didn't mention him!

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,520
You asked for it!

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,600
It's OK if you don't believe my words.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,360
But I'm telling you the truth.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Before I met with your dad,

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,280
I was really in love with you.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,750
Hello, dear interviewers.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,840
My name is Wang Shiming.

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
I didn't know
you were from a rich family.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Well...

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,600
So...

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm screwed!

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,600
Hi, Miss.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Well,

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,480
I've got a new white shirt.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
You can wear it

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,880
if it's OK with you.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
Really?

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,480
The size is bigger, though.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,120
It's OK.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll just roll up my sleeves.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,720
Why did you bring a shirt with you?

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,760
Well,

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,800
forewarned is forearmed.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
The interview means a lot to me.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
I have to make sure nothing goes wrong.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
It's my turn.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
They want to see me now.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,320
OK.

37
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
Hold on.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,080
Break a leg!

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,120
How was the interview?

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
I think it was good.

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,240
They said they would call me later.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,160
See you.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Wait!

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,080
Could you have dinner with me?

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,560
I want to thank you for the shirt.

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,680
I'd love to.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
My treat.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,120
No way.

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
It's on me.

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
OK.

(Job Offer from the Mai Group)

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Hi, Mr. Mai.

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,840
Dad,

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,880
he's Wang Shiming. I mentioned him.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,820
And he's done a good job
in the Marketing Department..

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,720
You told me to hire him

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
after the interview, right?

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
He's Wang...

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
Wang Shiming.

(Wang Shiming's Resume)

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,360
Dad,

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,840
it's not true.

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
I never said it.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's fine.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
See you at home.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
I'll go back to work.

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Let's go.

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
Wang,

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,000
I need to talk to you.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
I'll wait outside.

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,480
Lingjing is my only daughter.

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
So, I need to know

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,440
whom she is dating.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Mai,

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
I will work harder.

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,320
Working hard
doesn't mean you'll succeed.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,120
I looked into your past.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,720
You had a girlfriend in college.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,600
I heard

80
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,520
she had an abortion for you.

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,400
Did you remember that?

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
I wasn't mature enough.

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
I made a mistake.

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,680
Enough.

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,520
You should know

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,400
why I talked to you.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
Stay away from my daughter.

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
One more thing.

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,480
You didn't pass

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,280
the interview the other day.

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,880
I won't agree!

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
You are the apple of my eye.

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,640
Now you'll marry a jerk

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,760
and wait upon him?

Dad,

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
(In Memory of My Dear Father Mai Yuanzhi)
I will take care of Lingjing

98
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,120
as you wanted.

99
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
If you want to know when I stopped

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,160
loving you,

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,400
and started to hate you,

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
it was from the moment
when he said I didn't pass the interview,

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,520
and you helped me get the offer.

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,360
Didn't you think

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
you were noble and generous

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
to do it?

107
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,080
You're always on your high horse!

108
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
My dad was right.

109
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
You're a monster.

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,520
And you're a jerk!

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,400
Go to hell.

112
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,040
How did you like it?

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
You were scared, right?

114
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,080
I took you here

115
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
only to tell you

116
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
I could kill you

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
if you upset me.

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,040
However,

119
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,080
if you promise

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,160
you'll be a good wife

121
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
and help me at work,

122
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,360
I may treat you nicely.

123
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,000
Look at you.

124
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,320
You shed many tears.

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Tell me

126
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
if you agree or not.

127
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,360
You need to tell me the truth.

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,480
Fine.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
I will tell you.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
The truth is

131
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
I didn't kill your dad.

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,360
How do you explain the books?

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Dad,

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,160
I didn't do it.

135
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Don't call me "Dad".

136
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
You're just a loser

137
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
who married into a wealthy family.

138
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,480
If you behaved in a good way,

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,360
I could put up with your stupidity.

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,720
But you're stupid

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,280
and ill-intentioned.

142
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
No, Dad.

143
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,920
I was framed

144
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
by others.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,840
You can

146
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,400
fool my daughter in that way.

147
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,160
But you can't fool me.

148
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,600
I made a mistake.

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I wasn't thinking

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
when I did it.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,360
Please forgive me.

153
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
Give me a second chance, please.

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,520
Fine. I'll forgive you.

155
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
I won't call the police.

156
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
But you have to divorce my daughter

157
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,360
and don't take any money.

158
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
Lingjing loves me deeply.

159
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,400
She won't divorce me.

160
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,680
She won't.

161
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,960
Don't worry about it.

162
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll tell her you cheated on her.

163
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,120
She'll agree to divorce you.

164
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,080
Besides,

165
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
you have nothing to lose

166
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,280
because you didn't have anything.

167
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,040
You're just a parasite

168
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,160
that has been leeching on us.

169
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
You didn't pass...

170
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
But you're stupid...

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
You're just a loser
who married into a wealthy family.

172
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,640
She'll divorce you.

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
What are you doing?

174
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
Destroying it?

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
You're such a fool!

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
I've got enough copies!

177
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,160
Give me the original copy!

178
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,760
Give me it!

179
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,440
What do you want?

180
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,040
Give me it!

181
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,400
- You're insane!
- Give me it!

182
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
Get lost!

183
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Pass the...

184
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,840
Pass the medicine to me.

185
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,320
Pass it to me.

186
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,560
You're just a parasite
that has been leeching on us.

187
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,680
What happened?

188
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,480
Don't ask!

189
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,560
Never ever!

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
Mai Yuanzhi died.

191
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,720
What? What did you do?

192
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,280
Tonight, you didn't see me in the company!

193
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,320
And I didn't see you!

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,280
You got it?

195
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,120
Did you kill him?

196
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,840
No, I didn't.

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Really?

198
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,720
I swear I didn't.

199
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Then who did it?

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Don't mention it to others.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
If you tell anyone,

202
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,280
I'll get you in trouble!

203
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,080
Remember that we were working on

204
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,840
the files of the new project tonight.

205
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,520
We didn't see each other! Got it?

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,280
He wanted to fire me.

207
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,640
Why would I give him the medicine?

208
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,160
He deserved to die!

209
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
Mai Yuanzhi,

210
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
look at your dear daughter.

211
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,880
Karma is real!
