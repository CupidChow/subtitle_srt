3
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,200
Wang Shiming!

4
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,600
How dare you come here?

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
It's my house.

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,720
Of course I can.

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,360
Without you,

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,800
I could have paid off old scores.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,060
Do you want the evidence
that proved Mai Yuanzhi killed your dad?

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,560
Mai Yuanzhi must have left
something behind.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
I can get it for you.

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,560
Let's work together.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,960
But you have to reward me

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
half of the Mai Group shares
when we make it.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,280
What do you want me to do?

16
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,080
Xi,

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
from now on,

18
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,080
I'll treat you as if
you were my own daughter,

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,480
OK?

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,400
Xi,

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
we are sisters now.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
My father raised you for so many years.

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
And I treated you as my sister.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
You meant

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,320
you treated me as your sister
by ruining my family?

26
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,040
If my dad were a bad guy,

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,600
why would he offer you so much help,

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
and care about you a lot?

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,000
He wanted to whitewash what he had done.

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,960
No one would ever blame a guy
who was a good friend

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
and a great father.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,360
What you know
is just one side of the story.

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,720
I know my father was a good person.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,960
Mai Lingjing, don't play dumb.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
You never smelt a rat?

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,320
Dad.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
Jing.

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,120
Don't worry.

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
I'm OK.

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,160
Just remember
I'm doing everything for you.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
You were sleeping and having a dream.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,040
You didn't see anything,

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,040
right?

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,880
A moment of silence, huh?

45
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
I hit you where it hurts, right?

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
My dad would never do it.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
There must be reasons for that.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
All investigations showed

49
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,840
that my dad was innocent.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,720
Mr. Su

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,040
committed suicide.

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm sure your dad
did something terrible!

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
Whatever you say.

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,840
My dad was innocent.

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
Mai Yuanzhi killed my dad.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,560
He was the murderer.

57
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,840
And you were his accomplice!

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,840
I checked the handwriting
in Su Dahai's suicide note.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,560
Graphology analysis showed
that the note was the same as Mr. Mai's.

60
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,240
Mai Yuanzhi killed my dad.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
He was the murderer.

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,240
And you were his accomplice!

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,200
Qiu Zheng,

64
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,040
Su is dead.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't tell anyone about him.

66
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Got it, Mr. Mai.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Cameras caught him and me on the roof.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,790
Delete the footage.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,880
OK, got it.

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,440
If anyone asks about it,
tell them the cameras were broken.

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,080
If you want to know the truth,

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,120
you should go check
what Mr. Mai left behind.

75
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,540
(Phone Videos)

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,520
You'll do nothing to help me out?

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,160
You want to kick me out
and control the company, right?

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,560
Wang Shiming?

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Wang Shiming.

80
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Honey,

81
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
I know what you're looking for.

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,120
I've got the evidence that proves
Mai Yuanzhi killed Su Dahai.

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
What do you want?

84
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Come meet with me

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,960
at the river bank.

86
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Why are you here?

87
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
What are you doing?

88
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm waiting for Wang Shiming.

89
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,720
He'll give me the evidence
that I've been looking for.

90
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,000
(New Message from Wang Shiming)
You're screwed.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,540
(New Message from Wang Shiming)

92
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
(New Message from Wang Shiming)
I have got it.

93
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Mai Yuanzhi! You're trying to kill me!

94
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,400
We've been good friends.

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,240
How can you do it to me?

96
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,320
Su Dahai,

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,840
look what you have done!

98
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,800
You have disappointed me!

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920
I've done nothing wrong!

100
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,000
We can't make a fortune
even if we exhausted ourselves!

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
Just split the money and go gambling!

102
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,960
No way...

103
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,520
(Surveillance Footage)
Mai, I'm begging you!

104
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,480
(Surveillance Footage)
Please give me a second chance!

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,920
I swear it's the last time!

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
Otherwise,

107
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,600
Su Xi will lose her dad
at such a young age!

108
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
Mai, please!

109
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,320
You know I'm not a bad guy.

110
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,840
(Surveillance Footage)
But you're a shameless gambler!

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,200
Mai, you really won't help me out?

112
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,480
I can't help you in this way!

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
You deserved everything!

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
Resign from the company.

115
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,560
What do you mean?

116
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,960
It's not true.

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
You want to kick me out?

118
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,720
It's not true...

119
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't want to kick you out.

120
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,990
But you have lost all the money
you borrowed from the company

121
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,840
by gambling!

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,120
You'll destroy the company!

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,840
Save your crap!

124
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,600
Tell me

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
if you'll give me the money!

126
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,200
We're suffering
the capital chain rupture!

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
I don't have money for you!

128
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,040
You have cornered me!

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,080
(Surveillance Footage)
Pay the money back!

130
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,800
(Surveillance Footage)
You're crazy!

131
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
(Surveillance Footage)
Let me off the hook!

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,200
You're doomed!

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
Now I see.

134
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,600
Mr. Su killed himself because
he couldn't pay off his gambling debts.

135
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
No...

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
No way!

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
My dad would never do it!

138
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,320
It's not true.

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,800
It was you!

140
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,800
You forged the video

141
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,200
and tried to fool me with Wang Shiming!

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
Did you forge it?

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,240
No, I didn't.

144
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
It was real.

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
I'll give you one last chance.

146
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
Admit you forged the video,

147
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
and I'll let you off!

148
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,120
Do it!

149
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,600
The video was real.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
I didn't lie to you.

151
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,400
It was true.

152
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,600
It really was.

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,920
Liar.

154
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
You're all liars.

155
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,920
You lied to me.

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,120
You're all liars!

157
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,960
All of you!

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's OK.

159
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,800
Lingjing.

160
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,200
Lingjing.

161
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm so sorry.

162
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,240
Lingjing.

163
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,640
Lingjing.

164
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,040
I didn't kill Mr. Mai.

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
Wang Shiming did it.

166
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,400
It was Wang Shiming!

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
I can prove it.

168
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,320
I really can. Trust me, Lingjing.

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,160
I've got the proof.

170
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,960
Where is it?

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,120
It's in my house.

172
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
OK.

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I'll go get the car.

174
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,240
Xi!
