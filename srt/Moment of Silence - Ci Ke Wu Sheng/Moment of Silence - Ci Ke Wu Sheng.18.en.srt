00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,120
(Six Months Later)
Hi, Mr. Wang.

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,400
Hi, Mr. Wang.

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,280
Hello, Mr. Wang.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,000
Mr. Wang.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,160
These are contracts
you need to sign this month.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,840
Did you get the financial statement?

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,840
Yes, I did.

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,600
The business grows three percent.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,240
If we keep doing it,

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,440
we may get a 20% growth this year.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,760
Mr. Wang,

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,680
how is Ms. Mai?

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,600
Is she getting better?

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,320
Don't get me wrong.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
We haven't seen Ms. Mai for a long time.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,080
So we care about her a lot.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
Everyone is wondering how she is.

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,560
Thank you for caring about her.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,080
But you know about her sickness.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
She needs to rest.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,400
She isn't getting any better.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,480
She needs a rest?

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Good to know.

27
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,460
(Yu is calling)

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,880
See you.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,400
Call me if you need anything.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Hello.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,400
Have you found her?

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
No.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
It's been six months!

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,880
Why haven't you found her?

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,800
How could she vanish like that?

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,880
Should I go to other provinces?

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Keep looking.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,440
You must find her.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,600
Boss,

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
my people have been working
for six months.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,160
Could you pay us, please?

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
We're broke now.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,480
If we don't get any money,
no one will work for you again.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
I'll transfer 200 thousand yuan to you.

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
Thank you for your work.

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Loser!

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,640
They're all losers!

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,800
If you didn't get something on me,

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
I would kill you!

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,040
Mr. Wang,

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
it's time to meet the clients.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
Should I delay it?

53
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,120
No.

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
I'll be there.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,720
Su Xi!

56
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
What the heck?

57
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,740
(Caijia Villa)

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,040
Happy anniversary!

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,200
Thank you, honey.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
Guess what I've got here?

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
It's a huge packet!

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,200
Honey,

63
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
I want to have a baby with you.

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
OK.

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Honey, great!

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,360
I should sell the house now.

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
Everything is over.

68
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
It's impossible!

69
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,560
No one can mess with me again!

70
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
The security cameras!

71
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
The cameras!

72
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,440
Hi, Shiming.
