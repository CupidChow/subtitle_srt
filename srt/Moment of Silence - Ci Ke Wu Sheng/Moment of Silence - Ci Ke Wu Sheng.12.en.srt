3
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,120
Do you know what to say in the meeting?

4
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,040
The business report
for the second quarter is ready.

5
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,920
I'll do the speech

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,320
in the way you want me to.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,840
Mr. Zhang, you're smart.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,480
Pack Su Xi's stuff and send it to her.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,190
Ask the Legal Department to contact her.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
Make her to return
what she took from the company.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Got it, Ms. Mai.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,360
Ms. Mai,

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,160
how should I

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,720
deal with what Su Xi left here?

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
I'll take care of it.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,160
You can go now.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
I sent you his files.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,640
When will I get?

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,590
I've found out something.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Jiang Zhongnan worked as a private
detective when being abroad.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,480
But I don't know
what he does after he came back.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,240
We're trying to find his whereabouts.

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Please be patient.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Are you OK?

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Wang Shiming,

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
Mai Lingjing is an evil person!

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,160
It is she

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,320
who gets you in trouble!

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Su Xi, stop it!

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,480
It's over now!

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,990
We'll call the police
if you don't leave!

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Su Xi, I won't call the police today
since you were my best friend.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,240
Go, now.

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,960
Thank you, honey.

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
Honey,

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,160
we've married for years.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
I want to mend my ways for you.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,760
Could you give me a second chance?

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm done.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Honey,

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,680
I believe you still love me.

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm begging you

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,130
to give me a second chance
for the last time,

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
please?

45
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
When my dad passed away,

46
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
where were you?

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
Honey,

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,960
you begin to doubt me?

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
As you know,

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
my dad's death

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
has always been my hidden scar.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
OK.

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,760
I'll tell you the truth.

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,480
But after that,

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,480
could you forgive me,

56
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,320
please?

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
On that day,

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
I worked late.

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,480
When I was about to go home...

60
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Hi, Xi.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,360
It's late.

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Why are you still here?

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
What's wrong?

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Take me home.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,560
Take me home.

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,280
What happened? Are you OK?

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,640
Xi, I'm your brother-in-law!

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Have you heard?

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Mr. Mai died of
a heart attack last night.

70
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,960
How did you know?

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,760
They sent the message
in the chat group.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,920
I joined the company days ago.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
Will his death affect all of us?

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,760
It came so suddenly.

75
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I know.

76
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,280
Let's check.

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,080
Come on.

78
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Su Xi, what did you do last night?

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Shiming,

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,520
I spent the night with you, right?

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
Did you kill Mr. Mai?

82
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,680
You'll turn me in?

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
Don't forget

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
all security cameras were watching
when I was in your car.

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
You won't get away.

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
Su Xi went crazy.

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,560
I thought she might drag me down.

88
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
So, I had to keep it as a secret.

89
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,760
Since you asked about it,

90
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,680
I feel obliged to tell you the truth.

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,120
Honey,

92
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
I made a mistake.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm so sorry.

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,840
Dad might survive

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,160
if I could be strong enough.

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,720
It's getting late.

97
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
Honey!

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,760
You were in danger earlier.

99
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll stay in the living room.

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
You go get some rest.

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,760
You should...

102
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,180
(Jiang Zhongnan: Do what he says.)

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Honey,

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
is it OK?

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Honey?

106
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
OK.

107
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,560
Lingjing,

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
Wang Shiming lied to you.

109
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,640
Hello, Su Xi.

110
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
Do you know

111
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
you almost killed me?

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
Wang Shiming, are you serious?

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,480
You hurt me badly just now!

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,280
OK. Stop it.

115
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm very close to Mai Lingjing now.

116
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,360
You must have spoken ill of me.

117
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,840
Otherwise, you can't gain her trust.

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Do you want to take vengeance?

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,160
If you do,

120
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,280
just stick to the plan.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
Are you spying on me?

122
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,280
Lingjing,

123
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,880
I can't explain it to you now.

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,120
But I promise I will never hurt you.

125
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,280
Trust me.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,480
Then you should tell me everything.

127
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,040
Wang Shiming is always on the make.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,840
I'll keep an eye on him.

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
Meet with you tomorrow.

130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,320
Honey,

131
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,640
breakfast is ready.

132
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Enjoy it.

133
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,120
It's still warm.

134
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
Drink it

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
before you go to work.

136
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,840
Here you are.

137
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm running late.

138
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
I'd better go now.

139
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
Take care of your wound.

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,800
Honey, stay safe.

141
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,180
(Caijia Villa)

142
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,200
Just tell me

143
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,600
what happened.

144
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,120
Why did you avoid me?

145
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Wang Shiming said
you're up to something.

146
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
What did he mean?

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
And what is your intention?

148
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,520
Watch this.

149
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
Su Dahai is dead.

150
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
You were with him just now, right?

151
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,200
Don't ask.

152
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,480
The security cameras
caught me and Su Dahai?

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, there are cameras.

154
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
Delete the footage for me.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,480
Su Xi can never see it.

156
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,080
Got it.

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,600
Hurry up.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,520
Where did you get it?

159
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,000
I found it in Su Xi's safe.

160
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I came back to protect you.

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
I don't believe Mr. Mai killed Su Dahai.

162
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,360
But I have to

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,440
figure out how Su Dahai died
before handling everything.

164
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,920
Have you found clues?

165
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,160
Do you know how Su Dahai died?

166
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,520
He plunged to his death, right?

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
Everyone knows about it.

168
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
Do you know

169
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
Mr. Mai forged

170
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,240
Su Dahai's suicide note?
