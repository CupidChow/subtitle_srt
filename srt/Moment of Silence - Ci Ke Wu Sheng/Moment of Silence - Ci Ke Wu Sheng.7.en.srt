=Moment of Silence=
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,320
Lingjing, you woke up.

4
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Where am I?

5
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,400
The doctor said you need some good rest.

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,320
My baby...

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,560
Is...

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,160
Is my baby OK?

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,720
I took you from the hospital.

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,280
The baby is gone.

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,240
(Ultrasonic Testing Result)

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
The doctor said

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
the abortion arose from

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,600
an accidental stimulation.

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,760
Test-tube babies are fragile.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,400
Zhongnan,

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,800
did you hide something from me?

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,800
I...

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,480
Why did you go to the cemetery?

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,080
I think you know it.

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
Wang Shiming and Su Xi
wanted to kill you.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,360
So, you knew it from the beginning?

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,160
On that day,

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Su Xi tried to poison you
with vehicle exhaust.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,920
So,

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,800
you went there on purpose?

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,200
I stalked Su Xi.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
I knew Wang Shiming was scheming.

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,920
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
I promised Mr. Mai

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,400
I wouldn't tell you it
unless I had no choice.

32
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,520
He didn't want to upset you.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,600
My dad?

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
Why was my dad involved?

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,600
Mr. Mai knew
Wang Shiming was horrible.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,480
So, he never approved of your marriage.

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
No way!

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
You're the apple of my eye.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
I won't allow you to marry a jerk

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
and wait upon him!

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,400
Dad,

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,080
I have moved out.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
I'll live with Shiming.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Don't worry about me.

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Lingjing,

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,400
don't be silly.

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,080
He is taking advantage of you.

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm just trying to protect you.

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,960
But you didn't tell Mr. Mai
you married Wang Shiming.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
So, he asked me
to look into Wang Shiming,

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
and protect you in secret.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Dad,

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
(In Memory of My Dear Father, Mai Yuanzhi)
I'll take good care of Lingjing

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
as you wanted.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,080
Dad...

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm so sorry.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,440
I should've listened to you.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,720
I had a sound plan.

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,080
(Mai Yuanzhi  Mai Lingjing)
I approached Wang Shiming as a killer.

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,320
(Wang Shiming's Personal Details)
I planned to get the evidence

61
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
(Mai Lingjing's Information)
without hurting you.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
(Su Xi's Information)
But Su Xi went nuts suddenly.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,560
(Su Xi's Information)
My plan was ruined.

64
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
I will make them

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
pay the price!

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Honey, time for breakfast.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,440
I made coffee for you.

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you, honey.

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,280
Some bread for you.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Thank you.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
I'll see you off.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,880
See you.

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,160
It will work in two hours.

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
And the effect lasts three hours.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,100
(Special Offer for the National Day)

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,840
It's so hot today!

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,360
Morning, Mr. Wang.

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,000
Hi, Mr. Wang.

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,640
Mr. Wang,

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
water for you.

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,440
Thanks.

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,800
What are you doing?

83
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,640
People will see us.

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
I've locked the door.

85
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Honey, how are you?

86
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,280
Shh.

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm having a meeting.

88
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,480
I cooked soup for you.

89
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Come home early.

90
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
OK.

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
Hurry up.

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
- Hello, Ms. Mai.
- Hello, Ms. Mai.

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
- Hello, Ms. Mai.
- Hello, Ms. Mai.

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
Hi, Mr. Zhang.

95
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Ms. Mai, what brings you here?

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm bringing soup for my husband.

97
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,920
Tell everyone to attend the meeting.

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,570
Mr. Wang will announce
something important.

99
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,080
Got it.

100
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,760
Thanks.

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Honey, what's up?

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
I was in the bathroom.
Didn't hear my phone ringing.

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
Nothing.

104
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
I cooked soup for you.

105
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,040
Stop talking! Come back!

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,600
You're amazing today.

107
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Come with me!

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,040
I'll go back to work.

109
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,240
See you at home.

110
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Well, Ms. Mai.

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,040
Ms. Mai,

112
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
what do you want to tell us?

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
I'd better wait for Mr. Wang.

114
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,640
Let's go to his office.

115
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I don't think so.

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,480
It's a bad idea.

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Wait!

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,600
Ms. Mai!

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,960
It's a bad idea, Ms. Mai!

120
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,180
If she finds out what's going on...

121
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,640
What should I do?

122
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
Any ideas?

123
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,040
The door is locked.

124
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,760
It's OK.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
I've got the key.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
What the heck?

127
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,600
Honey.

128
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Honey, I can explain.

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,150
It's not what you think!

130
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,320
It's not like that!

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Listen...

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,840
Ms. Su...

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,370
What are you looking at?

134
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,600
Stop it!

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Go back to work!

136
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Get lost! Don't take videos!

137
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,980
It's so funny. Ms. Mai...

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,080
Hello, Ms. Mai.

139
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,160
Lingjing, I can explain it.

140
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,040
Cut your crap.

141
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm not blind.

142
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
I should've known you're so shameless.

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,720
Shameless?

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,680
Your dad was the most shameless one!

145
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,880
You want to hit me?

146
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,800
Go ahead!

147
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,680
If you hurt me,

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
your husband will be mad at you.

149
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,680
I won't bother to do it.

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,040
Mai Lingjing,

151
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,680
you can't turn the tide.

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
No one thinks
you're the boss in the company.

153
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Everyone listens to Shiming and me.

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,520
You can't destroy my reputation

155
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,600
with a scandal like that.

156
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Be patient.

157
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
The war just started.

158
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,000
You can't make it.

159
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,320
Don't get yourself killed.

160
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,440
Help!

161
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,680
- Honey!
- How did she fall?

162
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,240
Are you OK?

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,200
Shiming...

164
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,400
Su Xi...

165
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,280
Su Xi wants to kill our baby!

166
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
Stop looking! Get lost!

167
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,440
I thought you had a trump card.

168
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,400
But it seems you've got nothing.

169
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
Don't try to frame me.

170
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
Stop it!

171
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,280
Mai Lingjing will die tonight.

172
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Don't ruin my plan again.
