3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,040
Wang Shiming.

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,160
Long time no see.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,240
- Ms. Su.
- Ms. Su.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Take videos.

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,880
It's impossible.

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,080
How could it happen?

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,240
No way!

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
You're surprised

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,840
when seeing me alive?

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,960
Su Xi...

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,720
Don't take videos!

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,560
Stop!

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,440
Stop it!

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,120
Get lost!

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,000
Stop!

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,120
I was kidding you.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Ms. Su and I are good friends.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,000
I didn't kill her!

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,960
Believe me!

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm her brother-in-law.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,560
I didn't kill her, right?

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,840
I was just kidding!

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
You know I was kidding, right?

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,120
Xi,

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,240
stop it.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
Let's go home.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,720
Don't move!

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,440
Stay where you are.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,040
Xi,

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
just stop it.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Come to my office.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,240
Why?

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
You'll explain how you killed me?

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,720
I'll tell you how I survived?

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
Lingjing,

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,760
I didn't kill Mr. Mai.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Wang Shiming did it.

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,680
It was Wang Shiming!

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,480
Where is the proof?

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,360
It's in my house.

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,680
OK.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,840
I'll go get the car.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Wait for me.

46
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,440
I knew

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,480
you would hurt me.

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,120
But I wasn't cautious enough.

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
You told us to meet at the river bank.

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,480
I should've been on guard.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,320
But I wasn't.

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Wang Shiming,

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,400
you didn't expect

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,920
I could survive, right?

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Xi,

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
you shouldn't lie.

57
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,360
When did I go to the river bank?

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,360
Lingjing pushed you into the river.

59
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
I have proof on my phone.

60
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,760
I've got proof.

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
See? I've got it!

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,840
Mai Lingjing tried to kill her!

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,280
It was Mai Lingjing!

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,200
I can prove it!

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,360
What you've got there...

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,960
Ms. Mai?

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,560
Ms. Mai is here!

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,080
What you've got is fake evidence, right?

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
Mai Lingjing.

70
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
How dare you come back?

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,000
Look at him!

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,840
He's more like a murderer!

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,280
When did you get out
from the mental hospital?

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
She has a mental problem.

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
It is true!

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Everyone knows about it!

77
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,640
Mr. Zhang,

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,360
- you saw her when she went insane,
- I don't know.

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,800
right?

80
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,040
I don't know.

81
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,480
You imprisoned me in the mountain
six months ago.

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,160
Luckily, I ran away.

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,320
I know you're looking for me.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,160
Now I'm back.

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Are you happy to see me?

86
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,960
Lingjing, be calm.

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,120
We'll be home soon.

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,360
Xi!

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Lingjing!

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Gosh!

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,200
Mr. Wang lied to us!

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,160
How could he do it?

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,280
It's horrible!

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,440
He is awful!

95
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,880
No wonder Ms. Mai was never here!

96
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,760
Liar.

97
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,400
You're lying!

98
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
Why would I imprison you?

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,520
Why would I kill her?

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840
If I did it,

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
why didn't you call the police?

102
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,920
Am I right, guys?

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
Why didn't they call the police?

104
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
I'll tell you the reason.

105
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
We don't have enough proof.

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,760
Wang Shiming has got fake evidence.

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,350
Now everyone in the company
thinks Lingjing has a mental problem.

108
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,560
We can let him drop his guard first.

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,960
We have to destroy his reputation.

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I have an idea.

111
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,120
Wang Shiming thinks I'm dead.

112
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,400
We can take advantage of his fear

113
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,080
and make him tell the truth.

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,160
Su Xi!

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
What the heck?

116
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Shiming.

117
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,400
Wang Shiming, you're so scared.

118
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,560
Drop the act.

119
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm the CEO
of a publicly-traded company.

120
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,920
You can't just slander me like that.

121
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,560
No one will believe you.

122
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
If the police come, they won't buy it!

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,560
As you wish.

124
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
The police are coming.

125
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
Jiang Zhongnan!

126
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,720
You betrayed me!

127
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,880
If I didn't do it,

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,200
how could I get the evidence?

129
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,800
What evidence?

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
You're bluffing!

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
Here's the security footage

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,920
I copied from your house.

133
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,040
You and your mom
had a good conversation.

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
You didn't know
the security cameras

135
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,160
you installed would catch you red-handed.

136
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,640
You made a rod for your own back.

137
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,960
Wang Shiming,

138
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,040
now it's over.

139
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
Honey.

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,200
I made a mistake.

141
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,360
Honey, it was my fault.

142
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,640
Please forgive me.

143
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,640
Honey, I'm sorry.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,960
It was my fault.

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,160
Forgive me.

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
I love you.

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I love you.

149
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Come on!

150
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,280
Honey, I want to have a baby with you.

151
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Honey, great.

152
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
I made a mistake.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
Please forgive me.

154
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
I love you.

155
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,960
Honey!

156
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Honey!

157
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,190
(Now, all the criminals
are caught and sentenced.)

158
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,640
(Wang Shiming was sentenced to
20 years in prison for fraud and murder.)

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,150
(Su Xi was sentenced to five years
for murder and bribery.)

160
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,550

penal servitude for theft.)

162

163

(Yu Hai was sentenced to two years
for assaulting and imprisoning others.)

164
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,340
(Five Years Later)

165
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,900
(In Memory of My Dear Father, Mai Yuanzhi)

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,140
(In Memory of My Dear Father, Mai Yuanzhi)

167
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,840
Dad.

168
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Please rest in peace.
