1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,840
Greed.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,360
Jealousy.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,000
Beguilement.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,080
Lust.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Hatred.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Hypocrisy.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,360
Murder.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,880
None of those was in my world.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,640
I was the happiest deaf person
in the world.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,040
Until the moment

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,000
when I regained my hearing.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,200
All I heard was the evils' whispering.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,240
Then I realized...

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,520
I had been living in hell.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,040

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,060
(Caijia Villa)

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Honey, when will you get home?

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,840
I'll be back soon.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,720
Is everything done at home?

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,960
Yes, almost.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,520
Sweetie.

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,160
Yes?

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,520
The doorbell is ringing.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,960
It should be my mom.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,480
OK.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,920
I'll go answer the door.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
See you tonight.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Love you.

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,900
(Happy Birthday)

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,680
Madam.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
Put it here.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Mom, thank you.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,400
You're welcome.

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,000
Hi.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
Happy birthday, Ms. Mai.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Happy birthday!

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,320
Thank you.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,920
Ms. Mai,

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,640
let's take a picture.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,080
Happy birthday!

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Xi.

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,080
Lingjing,

45
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,560
happy birthday!

46
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Thank you.

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,200
I've been waiting for you.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,840
Where is Shiming? I didn't see him.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
He took a nap. Will be here soon.

50
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,440
Thank you, guys.

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,560
Today is my birthday,

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,200
and our wedding anniversary.

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
I'd like to say "thank you"

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
to my best friend, Su Xi,
and my husband, Shiming.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,640
In the recent years,

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,480
I haven't done anything for our company

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,280
because I'm suffering from hearing loss.

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,760
I appreciate everything they've done.

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,200
Lingjing,

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
you're not at work every day,

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,520
but you make big decisions for us.

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,760
Exactly, honey.

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
Don't be modesty.

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Yes.

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,320
Ms. Mai has worked hard,

66
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,880
so our business is thriving.

67
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Actually,

68
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,480
I need to tell you something else.

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,880
Honey,

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm pregnant.

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
It's great news!

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,480
How amazing!

73
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,160
Great!

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Congratulations!

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,040
Mr. Wang, congratulations!

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
Congrats, Ms. Mai!

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
We're happy for you!

78
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,640
I'll be a dad!

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,520
Congrats!

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,000
Madam, you'll be a grandma.

81
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,860
Congratulations!

82
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,820
Thank you.

83
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
Lingjing, if your dad knew it,

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
he would be thrilled.

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,400
I need to go to washroom.

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,720
Good things come in pairs!

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Congrats, Mr. Wang!

88
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
I'll drink it for her.

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
OK.

90
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,640
Honey,

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,240
the wine has run out.

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
I'll go get a new bottle of it.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,480
Really?

94
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
Great!

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,120
Xi,

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
listen to me.

97
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,920
I didn't want to keep it a secret.

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,960
You didn't?

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,090
When did you decide
to have a test-tube baby?

100
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
You said you'd marry me.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
But why did you have a baby with her?

102
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
Xi,

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,440
I did it only to deceive her.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
Besides,

105
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,440
her pregnancy doesn't mean anything.

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
Our plan will work out soon.

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
She'll die in no time.

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
So, she'll get out of your hair.

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
Then why did you look happy

110
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
when you knew she's pregnant?

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,360
And will you still

112
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,040
stick to our plan now?

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,440
What am I to you?

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
I'll make her get an abortion.

115
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
Xi, trust me, please.

116
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,400
I trusted you a lot.
So, I didn't force you to do anything.

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,360
I'll trust you again
if she could have an abortion.

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,180
Keep your voice down!

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,520
Many people are outside.

120
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,160
I won't!

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,680
Fine!

122
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,280
Then tell everyone
we want her dead, OK?

123
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,840
We'll be put in prison!

124
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
You're afraid now?

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,960
It was you who wanted to kill her!

126
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,400
You'd be happy
if everyone knew about our affair?

127
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
Lingjing, help me out.

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,080
I told him
we couldn't work with Huanxing Group

129
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
because it was in trouble.

130
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,160
But he signed the contract
without telling me.

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,400
Honey, please remember

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,760
we are family,

133
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
and we can trust each other.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, you should've told Xi about it.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,560
Honey,

136
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
I was telling her about it.

137
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,720
I'll value her opinions in the future.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,400
OK.

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,160
Time's up. Let's go.

140
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
We'll cut the cake together.

141
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,680
OK.

142
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,580
Make her sign the insurance contract.

143
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,100
Lingjing, let's go.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,320
I think Shiming can handle it.

145
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,320
This way.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
Xi, it's getting late now.

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,840
You can stay here tonight.

148
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,800
Good night.

149
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
Night.

Honey,

152
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,720
my friends recommend
one of the best private hospitals.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
The hospital director is nice.

154
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,200
And they're good at pregnancy tests.

155
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,960
Take a look.

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800

I've signed it.

158
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,920
You need to sign, too.

159
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,720
OK.

did she sign it?

Xi,

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,040
why are you playing the video
of our wedding?

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,840
It's your wedding anniversary.

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,840
You were very happy on the wedding.

Yes.

173

Lingjing,

174
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
you haven't danced with Shiming
for a long time.

Su Xi,

176
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
she signed. Just leave us alone.

177
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,280
Why not dancing together

178
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
to celebrate for the baby?

179

184
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,160
you forgot about your promise to me.

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,920
I'll remind you of it.

186
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,600
Shiming,

187
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,280
you've decided to kill Mai Lingjing?

188
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,760
I don't believe you've never loved her.

189
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,520
I will.

190
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,120

we'll take her to the cemetery.

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
And I'll ask someone to kill her.

194
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,280
The mountain slope there is steep.

195
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
No one

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
will ever find her

197
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,240
if she falls down.

198
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,200
Shiming,

199
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,200
there is no way back for you.
