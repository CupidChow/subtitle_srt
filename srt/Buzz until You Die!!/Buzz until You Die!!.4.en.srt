(Kanako Asano)

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,693
Definitely don't drink and drive.

3
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:06,297
Tapako I'll chase you!

4
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:06,297
That's really dangerous, isn't it?

5
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,396
Kiki! (Brake sound)

6
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,396
Poooooo (clank)

7
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:11,165
Gashan! (Collision sound)

8
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:11,165
Ugh...

(Yuto Watanabe) Tapako-san

10
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:14,594
The video of the accident was posted online.

11
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:16,627
Maybe Mr. Cotton?

12
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:19,000
I mean, the policeman

13
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:19,000
Why are you at the bottom like me?

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,858
Did you watch the broadcast?

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,858
I want to live happily➡

16
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,429
That was interesting.

17
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,429
📺(Announcer) This video is ➡

18
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:27,231
From witness Tapako

19
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:27,231
This is what was provided.

20
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:30,627
Is this an overwhelming buzz?

21
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:34,396
I decided

22
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:34,396
Become a dark hero Tapako.

23
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:38,099
You're the one who's taking pictures, aren't you?

24
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:38,099
This is a crime.

25
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:41,264
What I want to be popular about is

26
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:41,264
It's also for the money.

27
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:43,297
why

28
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:43,297
Do you need that much money?

29
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:45,759
I owe money to my ex-husband.

30
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,099
(Motohashi, recollection) We are at the bottom

31
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,099
No matter how hard I try, I'm still at the bottom.

32
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,891
Ah~ me...

33
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,891
When you meet your ex-husband➡

34
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,330
Hahahaha... I might get killed!

35
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,429
I'll follow up before anything happens.

36
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,429
If I'm here, you'll feel a little safer, right?

37
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,759
(Mami) The other day

38
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,759
Do you know about hit-and-run incidents?

Suspected of causing injury due to dangerous driving➡

41
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,396
I was arrested.

42
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:07,396
(Mami) That announcer➡

43
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:10,198
He's my father.

44
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:10,198
Today at my part-time job➡

45
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:12,957
Announcer who drove drunk

46
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:12,957
My daughter came.

47
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:16,726
Even if you just come to the store by chance.

48
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:16,726
Even starting a part-time job➡

49
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:20,132
Isn't it a little suspicious?

50
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:20,132
This was sent to me via DM.

51
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:22,165
The other day

52
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:22,165
I was drunk and got into a hit-and-run ➡

53
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,198
There was an announcer, right?

54
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,825
This is going to go viral.

Even if it's fake

62
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,924
I'm being pushed into it.

63
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:40,099
I was really caught...

64
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,165
(Mami) Um, the day after tomorrow.

65
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,165

I went the other day

67
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,693
From the owner of a members-only bar➡

68
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:49,792
I've been contacted by a party

69
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:49,792
I would like Mr. Asano to come too.

70
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,825
It seems that celebrities will also come.

71
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,858
Is that true?

72
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,858
(Mami) Yes.

73
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:58,297
My life up until now

74
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:58,297
There wasn't anything like that.

75
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,924
ah~.

76
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,924
Seriously, shitty life.

77
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,957
Too much trash every day.

I want to see it≫

82
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:10,330
But when it went viral, the world changed.

83
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,891
If it goes viral

84
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,891
everyone looks at me

85
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,132
You can get out from the bottom.

Because I'm feeling hazy.

373
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,660
Well then

374
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,660
Would you like to have sex like a man and a woman?

375
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,066
Sigh!? No way.

376
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:26,099
No, that's a lie.

377
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:30,462
Honestly...I want to.

378
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:32,957
Yeah~ Which one?

379
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:36,330
No, but that's it➡

380
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,957
relationship

381
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,957
I have to make it clear➡

382
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:42,066
I don't think it's good.

383
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:46,297
If it's the flow now

384
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:46,297
He seems to be considered that kind of man➡

385
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:49,891
When I'm this tired

386
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:49,891
It's different to do it➡

387
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:53,033
I don't understand Asano-san's feelings either.

388
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,066
that's why….

389
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:01,198
What? Are you sleeping again? That's a lie.

390
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,264
Huh... A lot.

391
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,297
Sigh….

392
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:13,264

I grabbed it.

395
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,693
I'm scared of my own talent.

396
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:24,396

With Kusunoki-kun

572
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,165
Looks like I'll have to drink it with sashimi.

573
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:16,198
I have to take advantage of this opportunity.

574
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:16,198
This guy is suspicious after all.

575
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:20,396
Anyone who tarnishes my brand

576
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:20,396
I will never forgive you.

577
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:23,660
Are you going to have a drink?

578
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:23,660
i want you to stay.

579
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,495
I'm not Watanabe's girlfriend either.

580
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,891
I'll definitely get the evidence.

581
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,099
I'll still have to drink it.

582
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,099
of course.

583
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,330
What do you think? He leaked it.

584
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,330
I thought he might be the culprit.

585
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,099
Kanako-chan is

586
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,099
I'm just a fan of Kusunoki.

587
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:41,660
I'm glad I called the owner.

588
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,330
This will go viral again.

589
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,429
Maybe I'm talented?

590
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,429
He has a talent for getting the point across.

591
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,660
My name is Kanako-chan.

592
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,660
