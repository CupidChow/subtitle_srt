Accident video

199
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:56,825
You posted it on the internet, right?

200
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,891
Mr. Tapako.

201

≪Why this police officer? ≫

202
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,429

≪Do you know about me? ≫

204
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,231

Sigh. Suddenly cut off the broadcast.

208
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:27,957
Please read my comment carefully.

I could see her clothes and hair.

216
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:54,231
Yeah, that's the worst.

217
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:54,231
The listener saw my face.

218
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,297
Hey, delete the video of the accident.

219
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:58,363
Oh no, it's getting a lot of buzz right now.

220
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:01,264
Sigh…. driver and car number

221
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:01,264

223
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,726
It's not a crime, so it's fine.

224

Well, I'm in a hurry.

225
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,924

00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,165
Would you like me to charge your smartphone?

237
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:45,264
Huh?

238
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,363
I'm currently communicating with someone from the TV station.

I have to reply right away.

240
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:52,495
Help me, police officer.

241
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:52,495
No, no, I'll have to do something about it myself.

00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,528
Convenience store etc.

243
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,528
There are so many.

00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:57,198
buy a charger

245
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:57,198
It's a waste.

246
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,891
Well, for civil servants who have a stable life.

247
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,891
Don't you understand?

248
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:03,528
And he also touched my breasts➡

No, can I go!

254
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,759

It's over now though...

263
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,363
Then it's decided!

264
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,792

To get people's attention.

280

Come home when you're done charging.

281
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,396
Why cotton?

282
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:21,759
Because it's Watanabe.

283
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,165
Easy.

284
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,165
Then why Tapako?

285
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:26,660
Because I work at a pasta shop.

286
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:26,660
suitable.

287
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,990
It's okay if something like this is appropriate.

288
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,132
I mean, the policeman

289
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,132
I can’t believe I’m on a streaming app➡

290
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,858
You don't think so.

291
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,858
Why are you like me➡

292
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,264
Did you watch the bottom stream?

293
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,264
Looking for a girl?

294
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:42,231
Oh no, I was actually at work.

295
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:42,231
You shouldn't use your smartphone though➡

296
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:45,099
I thought it was this neighborhood.

297
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:45,099
I was curious and watched.

298
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,132
Is that all?

299
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:52,297
I also want to enjoy my life

300
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:52,297
That was interesting.

301
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,693
Hmm.

302
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,990
At work

303
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,990
Don't play with your smartphone all the time➡

304
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,264
Please work properly.

305
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,264
I do pay taxes.

306
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,759
I understand. Later➡

307
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,066
If an accident occurs

308
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,066
Immediate report. Immediate ambulance.

309
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:09,396
I can't believe it's been broadcasting forever

310
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:09,396
That's insane.

311
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:14,759
You can't make money with common sense.

312
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:20,924
Haha, Mr. Cotton

313
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:20,924
Isn't the character different from the one on the internet?

314
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,396
I thought it was more of an oraora type.

315
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,396
No ➡

316
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:26,825
on the internet

317
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:26,825
I want to have a different personality.

318
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,462
You look serious.

319
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,231
It seems like he really can't do anything.

320

I'm serious though➡

321
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:41,561
I came to the house of a man who hasn't had a girlfriend for four years.

I can't sleep like that➡

323

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,693
I wish I could share the success

381
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,693
I'm so happy.

382
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,726
yeah? I haven't done anything though.

383
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,363
You watched the broadcast.

384
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,165
If it wasn't for Mr. Wata, I would be yesterday.

385
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,165
I don't think it was distributed.

386
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:24,693
thank you.

387
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:27,759
Yeah.

388
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:27,759
Ah, that's right.

389
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:32,429
What time do you work today?

390
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,957
I'm off duty today, why?

391
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,693
Do you know this cafe?

392
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,693
Morning➡

393
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:40,726
I've always wanted to go there.

394
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:44,957
Have fun in the morning! Have fun in the morning!

395
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:44,957
I'll give you something as a thank you!

397
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,660
It feels great.

398
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,825
Just like this, more and more

399
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,825
I wonder if I can increase my number of followers.

400
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,891
Huh?

401
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,891
There are no crosswalks here at all.

402
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,792
Ah, here it is

403
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,792
Just walk another 500 meters.

404
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey, don't jump out!

405
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:10,000
Even traffic rules!

406
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,726
Come on, hurry up!

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,726
Limited to 15 meals, they will sell out.

408
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:19,066
That guy... Ah~ Already!

409
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,165
Haha ➡

410
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:24,330
Hahahahahahaha….

411
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,825
I'm so bad

412
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,825
I've never done that.

413
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:29,363
What, seriously? Isn't it too serious?

414
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:33,264
Life seems boring.

415
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:33,264
No, that was bad.

416
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:37,231
Sometimes you have to break from the rules

417
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:37,231
There are some scenery you can't see➡

418
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:40,792
Young man.

419
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:40,792
Huh... what? that.

420
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,825
Hehe.

421
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:48,561
Hehehehe.

422
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,627
It's number 1 in the ranking.

423
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,528
Look, look, my name is written.

424
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,792
I understand now.

426
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,957
It might be the first time in my life that I've had a morning like this.

427
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:08,792
Hmm...

428
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:08,792
This was fun.

429
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,330
Isn't it okay once in a while?

430
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,330
This kind of thing is also new.

431
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,363
Let's play again.

432
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,858
Huh yeah.

433
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:26,033
≪I want to go viral, I want to stand out➡

434
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,660
I want to be loved➡

435
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,660
What's wrong with wanting it?

436
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,330
≪I am everything, everything, everything➡

437
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,363

Become a dark hero Tapako.

442
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,165
Eh, why dark hero?

443
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,660
Because he's an orthodox hero.

444
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,660
There's no buzz.

445
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,330
someone the police can't catch

446
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,330
I spread it...

447
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:07,363
Only when clothed in darkness

448
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:07,363
The world will eat it up.

everyone looks at me

459
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:26,000
You can get out from the bottom.

Popular actors too

Kusunoki Hayato!

465
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,825
It's finally here ~ the big one.

466

Looks like there's going to be a lot of buzz.

Seriously awesome photo

468
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:41,198
I took a picture, so take a look.

469
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:43,726
I stuck my tongue in and kissed you!

470
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:46,000
This looks like marijuana.

471
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:46,000
Huh!

472
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,363

Wow! More than I expected➡

Life may be a cakewalk.

00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,792
For Asano-san

477
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,792
What am I?

478
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,231
Well then

479
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,231
Would you like to have sex like a man and a woman?

480
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,561
more than this

481
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,561
Isn't it better not to overdo it?

482
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,099
Antis are also increasing.

483
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,099
It's okay.

484
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,429
Anyway, the story is priority now.

485
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:09,858
That's how you talk about it

486
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:09,858
That's already an addiction.

491
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,396

After all, isn't it obvious?

498
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:26,726
I think it's okay though.
