It feels so good

194
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,825
I didn't know.

195
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:23,099
The thief was arrested

196
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:23,099
Thank you to so many people.

197
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:26,660
This is my first time

198
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:26,660
We need to increase the number of registrants.

199
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,066
What is your goal?

200
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,066
1 million.

201
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,165
No, it's too much.

202
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,165
From now on, my face will be revealed➡

203
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,561
Let's be careful.

204
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:38,891
Be careful

205
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:38,891
Everyone shows their faces these days.

206
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:43,165
What I want to be popular about is

207
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:43,165
It's also for the money.

208
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:45,726
I buzz in order to survive.

210
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,759
Do you need that much money?

211
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,000
It's better to have money.

212
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,000
Is it that necessary?

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,198
Because I have debt.

214
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,330
Huh? Why?

215
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,561

No. Various things?

217
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:03,429

No, that's not true.

yeah? what?

381
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,297
Today at my part-time job➡

382
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,957
I drove drunk

383
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,957
The announcer's daughter came.

384
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:17,132
I think it's probably just a coincidence.

385
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:20,099
Oh, that's a lie.

386
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:20,099
📱 That's not a lie!

387
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,627
They also showed me family photos.

388
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,726
me without thinking

389
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,726
I started talking.

390
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:29,297
I even told you my name.

391
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:29,297
It's okay, right?

392
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,825
Is that really a coincidence?

393
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:35,297
perhaps.

394
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:37,726
I'm the one who took the video

395
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:37,726
If I knew➡

396
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,198
I wouldn't talk like that.

397
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,561
Tat tat

398
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:50,165

Among my followers➡

400
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:53,363
There might be a child today.

401
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:55,396
Scary.

402
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,429
📱 What kind of child was he?

403
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,132
Hmm, what a rich lady.

404
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,132
That's what it felt like.

405
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:04,759
He said he would come again.

406
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:04,759
Before you get weirdly missed➡

407
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,792
I have to quit my part-time job.

408
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,132
on the internet

409
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,132
I'm glad you didn't show your face.

410
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:14,429
my success story is

411
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:14,429
Don't let anyone get in your way.

412
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,528
Even if you don't show your face

413
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,528
I have to disguise myself.

414
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:27,363
With reflection

415
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:27,363
I might get found out.

416
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,627
Ah, maybe I should try changing my voice.

417
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,033
(in a slightly high-pitched voice) It's Tapako.

418
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:38,099

Sigh, it must be hard to be famous.

424
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,825
Yaho~ It's Tapako~.

long time no see~.

428
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,528
How was everyone doing?

429
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:14,231
📺 Yes!

430
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:14,231
What pink! Isn't it cute? ➡

431

Take the plunge

432
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,198
I got a makeover. ➡

433
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:20,330
I mean, there are many things in summer.

434
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:20,330
You want to try it, right? ➡

435
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,000
I tried pink for the first time.

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,066
What should I try next?

437
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:30,198
≪To become a buzz once

438
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:30,198

I'll find it again≫

447
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,528
Yeah, are you quitting?

448
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,528
No, it's too sudden.

449
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:53,000
sorry.

450
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:53,000
But I've already decided➡

451
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,231
Please do it by the end of this month.

452
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,231

Understood.

458
