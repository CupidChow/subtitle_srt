Become a dark hero Tapako.

3
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,726
(voice of the heart)

4
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,726
≪I want to go viral, I want to stand out≫

5
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:08,330
You're the one who's taking pictures, aren't you?

6
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:08,330
This is a crime.

7
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,363
What someone wants is ➡

8
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:12,396
It feels so good

9
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:12,396
I didn't know that.

10
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,429
We need to increase the number of registrants.

11
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,462
(Mami) The recent hit-and-run incident

12
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,462
Do you know?

13
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:20,264
📺(Announcer) Suspect Mikiyuki Tanaka

14
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:20,264
Suspected of causing injury due to dangerous driving➡

15
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,759
I was arrested.

16
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,759
(Mami) That announcer➡

17
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:25,099
He's my father.

18
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:27,957
What should I do? I exposed the video.

19
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:27,957
What if they knew who I was?

20
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:31,066
I drove drunk at my part-time job today.

21
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:31,066
The announcer's daughter came.

22
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:33,198
(Yuto Watanabe) Is that really a coincidence?

23
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:36,792
(Mami) Asano's voice

24
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:36,792
I feel like I've heard of it before.

25
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:39,330
After all, isn't it obvious?

26
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:39,330
It's okay.

27
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,528
Anyway, the story is priority now.

28
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:44,231
(Owner) Hayato Kusunoki! ➡

29
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,957
Happy 24th birthday!

30
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,957
(Kusunoki) Thank you!

31
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,660
absolute

32
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,660
I feel like I can figure out a big story.

33
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,693
Kusunoki-kun and Talent-chan

34
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,693
I stuck my tongue in and kissed you!

35

(Kusunoki) Party photos

36
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:59,297
I may have found out the culprit who leaked it.

37
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:02,000
In the near future

38
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm planning on purchasing some big stuff.

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,198
With Kusunoki-kun

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,198
Looks like I'll have to drink it with sashimi.

41
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,231
Sa... Sashi...

42
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,033
Kusunoki is playing.

43
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,033
If something happens...

44
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,726
it's okay.

45
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,726
i want you to stay.

46
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:14,660
why?

47
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:14,660
She's not Watanabe's girlfriend either.

48
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,330
(Kusunoki) It's Kanako-chan.

49
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,330
You have a really erotic body.

50
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,363
I have to take a shower

51
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,363
Because I can't do it.

52
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:24,363
I wonder what will come out.

53
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:27,627
1996?

54
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:27,627
Does that mean he's 29?

55
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:31,396
He's older.

56
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:31,396
(Kusunoki) I was completely defeated. ➡

57
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:34,660
Tapako, right?

58
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,726
You don't have to lie!

59
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:39,561
It's only painful if you keep running away.

60
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:39,561
(Kusunoki) Wow!

61
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,165
Give it back.

62
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,165
I absolutely hate it.

63
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,330
Even if someone hated me or looked down on me

64
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,330
I'll enjoy my life.

65
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,462
I cheated

66
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,462
Bring only delicious food.

67
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,858
Because that's my way of life.

68
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,429
Kusunoki-kun too

69
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,429
I was forced to lie about my age➡

70
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,132
He seemed to be suffering

71
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,132
Now open up➡

72
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:04,726
I'm glad it looks like you're working really hard.

73
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:07,957
Something

74
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:07,957
I suddenly became a distant person.

75
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:11,792
Somehow, I'm only Watanabe.

76
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:11,792
There's no one you can trust.

77
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,330
more than this

78
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,330
Isn't it better not to overdo it?

79
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,363
The number of antis has been increasing recently.

80
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,627
I was attacked online

81
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,627
In the real world➡

82
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:21,759
Physically, nothing will happen.

83
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:21,759
it's okay.

84
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,198
I like Asano-san.

85
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:27,792
