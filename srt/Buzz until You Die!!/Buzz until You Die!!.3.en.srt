00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,693
(Kanako Asano) Are you okay?

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,693
(Mami) The recent hit-and-run incident➡

3
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,726
Do you know?

4
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,726
📺 Freelance announcer ➡

5
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:08,165
Suspect Mikiyuki Tanaka was arrested.

6
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:10,198
(Mami) That announcer➡

7
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:12,957
He's my father.

8
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:16,330
What should I do? I exposed the video.

9
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:16,330
What if they knew who I was?

10
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,561
I drove drunk at my part-time job today.

11
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,561
The announcer's daughter came.

12
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,429
📱 I think it's a coincidence.

13
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,429
(Yuto Watanabe) Is that really a coincidence?

14
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,363
(Voice in my heart)≪I hope it will go viral once

15
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,363
If you have experienced it➡

16
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:29,099
I can't go back now≫

17
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,165
It's hard to be famous.

18
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,429
(Manager) Well, are you quitting?

19
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,429
No, it's too sudden.

20
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:39,462
sorry.

21
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:39,462
But I've already decided➡

22
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:41,726
Please do it by the end of this month.

23
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:45,165
(Manager) Well, but just

24
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:45,165
I'm glad we got a new kid.

31
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,231
I decided to work part-time!

32
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,891
≪What? ≫

33
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,000
(Mami) Ah, this was the other day.

34
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you for talking to me.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,561
Ah, like that

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,561
It's okay because it's not a big deal.

37
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,627
(Mami)

38
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,627

39
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:11,660
(Manager)

40
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:11,660
The two of you have become quite close.

41
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,693
I guess you could say we became good friends...

42
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,693
(Mami) The other day➡

43
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,957
when you came here

44
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,957
I became a fan of Asano.

45
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:18,396
(Manager) Haha.

46
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:18,396
But from Asano-san earlier➡

47
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,858
I heard that you will be resigning at the end of this month.

48
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,858
Is that so?

49
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,330
It's only for a short time, but thank you.

50
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,462
Yeah, really⁉➡

51
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:29,759
Please think again!

52

Ah~ Um...➡

00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,066
Can I go home with you?

62
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,099

There's something I was thinking about...

Yeah what?

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,429
Something➡

80
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:52,462
Asano's voice

81
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:52,462
I feel like I've heard of it before.

82
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,495
≪Did you find out? ≫

83
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,858
somewhere long ago

84
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,858
Have we met before?

85
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:59,198
No, I don't think so.

86
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:03,759
That's right.

87
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:03,759
Yes, that's right.

88
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,825
Is it just my imagination?

89
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,825
Yeah.

90
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:11,066
(Mami) So, Asano-san, why?

91
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:11,066
Are you going to quit your part-time job?

92
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,297
Ah~ Well, a lot of things happened.

93
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:21,660
(Mami) Me at that time

94
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:21,660
Mr. Asano spoke to me➡

95
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,957
I was very happy. ➡

96
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:28,660
So with Asano-san

97
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:28,660
I want to get along better➡

98
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,231
I also started working part-time...

99
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,231
That's right.

100
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,264
I'm kind of sorry.

101
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,759
Well, it's about time...

102
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,759

105
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:46,132
Yeah, sometime soon.

106
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:46,132
Is it true?

107
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:49,858
I'm a celebrity frequenter

108
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:49,858
I know of a members-only bar➡

109
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:54,660
Would you like to go with me next time?

110
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:54,660
What? A celebrity?

111

yes.

112
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,231
My high school was in the entertainment industry➡

113
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:01,495
I have a lot of friends who are selling well now.

114
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:05,924
Hey, that's right.

115
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:05,924
I might want you to take me to that store.

116
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:07,957

Watanabe House Good access.

Hmm, aren't you thinking too much?

138

189
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:28,000
Haha... Yeah.

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,165
Asano-san⁉ What happened?

191
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,693
Hahaha….

192
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,693
Or… hyperventilating? Are you okay?

193
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:34,891
Breathe out slowly!

194
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:34,891
Hahaha….

195
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:39,396
Ah~ Me... Hahaha...

196
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:39,396
When you meet your ex-husband➡

197
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:42,000
You might get killed! Hahaha….

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,231
Hahaha... goho goho.

199
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:53,825
Sigh… Sigh… Sigh….

200
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,924
Ah~ Sorry.

201
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,924
I felt a rush of blood all over my body.

202
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,594
That ex-husband

203
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,594
Is it that bad?

204
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:07,660
Ah... yeah

205
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:07,660
Anyway, I don't want to get involved anymore.

206
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
He's looking for me.

207
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,561
I have already paid back my debt.

208
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,561
why? Sigh….

209
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,594
Sigh.

210
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:24,132
I'm a police officer after all.

211
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:24,132
I'll follow up before anything happens.

212
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:27,165
If I'm here, you'll feel a little safer, right?

213
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:31,396
Eh, certainly. That's right.

214
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:36,462
Haha. About me for a while

215
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:36,462
You looked like you were reconsidering.

216
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:39,264
Huh? Especially.

217
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:44,528
Yeah, about 1mm.

218
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:44,528
You might have thought so.

219
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,693
1 mm?

Yeah~ Alcohol is good.

224
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:08,363
No. When it's hard

225
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:08,363
Drink something warm➡

226
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:11,924
It's best to go to bed early.

00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:34,066
to a celebrity

236
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:34,066
Will we ever meet up?

00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:39,033
No, that's what I mean

238
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:39,033
There are some weird people out there, so be careful.

239
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:43,264
I'm worried about my ex-husband and other things.

240
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:43,264
There's no way my true identity will be revealed➡

241
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:46,594
Something

242
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:46,594
I feel like I'm okay now.

Aren't they both so cute?

I wasted it.

299
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,726
It's rude to ask someone to call you.

300
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,792
Because, because

301
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,792
Even if you make a joke about it➡

302
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,825
There's no buzz.

303
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,033
Number of followers: Too small.

304
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,495
About people, by number of followers

305
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,495
Stop measuring.

306
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,825
I also have very few.

307
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:48,858
That's right though.

Ah~ah, I'm already on my own

309
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:53,627

323
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:44,429
This is going to go viral.

What, are you going to post that?

325
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,462
Huh?

326
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,462
Isn't this a great video?

327
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:53,066
why?

328
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:53,066
No, that's no good.

329
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:56,330
Look

330
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:56,330
Your daughter is also my friend, right?

331
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,561
Yeah

332
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,561
But hey, it can't be helped, right?

333
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,627
If this is true, it's adultery

334
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,627
Being forced is the worst.

335
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,825
No, that's why...

336
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,825
Gun (sound of putting down cell phone)

337
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,528
Freshness is the key to information.

338
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:11,264
Huh? What? Freshness?

339
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:11,264
Sa Watanabe➡

340
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:13,726

00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:13,726
Do you remember trending news?

Eh, no... Hmm, I guess I forgot.

See, that's what it is.

344
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,000
Everyone forgets quickly.

345
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,099
No, that's...

346
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:29,264
Who was arrested or killed?

347
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:29,264
Just the sounds of life.

348
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:32,627
What's the news?

349
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:32,627
Deep down, it doesn't matter.

350
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:36,528
Basically, I want new stimulation.

351
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:40,396
If I defeat the bad guy

352
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:40,396
Everyone feels refreshed➡

353
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:44,066
If everyone could look at me

354
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:44,066
Feels good.

355
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:47,033
Isn't this a win-win?

356
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:52,693
No, but if you raise something like that

357
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:52,693
Asano-san might get hit.

358
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,825
Watanabe is so kind.

359
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,429
But I was attacked online.

360
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,429
In the real world➡

361
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,792
Physically, nothing will happen.

362
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,792
it's okay.

363
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,726
No, why did you go that far...

364
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:09,396
My life is➡

365
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:12,462
Until now

366
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:12,462
There wasn't anything like that.

367
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,825
But when it went viral, the world changed.

368
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,957
If it goes viral

369
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,957
everyone looks at me

370
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:24,330
You can get out from the bottom.

371
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,429
All I have now is buzz.

372
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,825
Mr. Asano…

373
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,594
I'm going home.

374
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,594
I have to upload this story.

375
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:42,660
