00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,070
Hey, Odajima.

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,140
Something just jumped.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,040
Must be a fish. A flying fish.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,550
I didn't see it.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,830
Huh?

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,270
Hey, keep an eye on that area.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,740
Right.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,910
Boat ride, nice.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,270
Let's just ride this all the way to some southern island.

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,060
This island's in the middle of nowhere.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,000
This is hardly a southern island.

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,530
Let's go.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,990
Hey, where are we going?

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,010
Hey...

16
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
"The Journey to Kill You"

17
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,610
Hello.

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Hello.

19
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,560
Is this place full of old people?

20
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,730
That looks heavy.

21
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,400
By the way, you went to the hardware store
before we got on the boat, right?

22
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,080
What did you buy?

23
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,140
We'll use it later.

24
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,010
Hey, that's not an answer.

25
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,890
Hey.

26
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,770
More climbing?

27
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm a city boy. Hiking's not for me.

28
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,540
Ugh, another bug.

29
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,490
You're such a drama queen.

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Your shoulder...

31
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Huh?

32
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,970
There's a...

33
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,970
A stink bug.

34
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,930
Hey, hey, don't those stink?

35
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,000
Right? They stink, right?

36
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,170
Hey, get it off me.

37
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,700
Hey, come on, get it off!

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,260
Hey, get it off!

39
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,550
Hey, please, get it off me.

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,020
It stinks.

41
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,180
Please don't be mad.

42
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,910
No way.

43
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,600
You didn't get the bug off me.

44
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,790
We're almost there.

46
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,990
Please.

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,080
Jeez.

48
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
(Incoming Call: Kirii)

49
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,350
Are we finally here?

50
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,390
It's so hot.

51
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,480
Give me some water.

52
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,650
Why are we pulling weeds?

53
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,480
Damn it, I got another bite.

54
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,090
You haven't been bitten at all.

55
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,500
Yes, I have.

56
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,890
No way.

57
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,520
Look at my arm!
They're even biting me for you.

58
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm sure of it.

59
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
Kataoka-san.

60
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,230
Your body temperature is higher.

61
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
And I heard mosquitoes are
attracted to the smell of sweat.

62
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,510
That's probably why they go after you.

63
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,630
Body temperature?

64
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,770
You're really...

65
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,560
You're so cold.

66
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
Huh?

67
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,690
Let's keep going.

68
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,570
Can't I use you as bug repellent?

69
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,770
Argh, seriously.

70
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,660
How long do I have to do this?

71
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,370
It'll be over soon.

72
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,080
Hey, what are you up to?

73
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,030
Your parents?

74
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,970
No.

75
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,300
Please offer some incense for him.

76
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,890
He used to be in our crew.

77
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,890
His name was Asahi.

78
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,130
You're the one who killed him.

79
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,790
Hey guys, look.

80
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,490
Isn't it cool?

81
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,300
They're a matching set.

82
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,000
You guys are really close, huh?

83
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,870
The two of us...

84
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
are going to be the boss's right-hand men.

85
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,260
But, but, but...

86
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,800
We've only met him once.

87
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,200
It's just the line work for now.
We've got a long way to go.

88
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,500
- Go get them colored in.
- No, it's not that.

89
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,350
Well... we don't have the money.

90
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,340
So we can't get them colored yet.

91
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,720
Hey, spot them the cash.

92
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,440
You're our only hope, sir.

93
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,600
One day, we'll make big money.

94
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,980
And get them colored in then.

95
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,110
Yeah.

96
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Ahh...

97
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,280
I can't wait to show Kataoka-san.

98
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,290
Why do you like him so much?

99
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,450
Hmm.

100
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,010
I don't know.

101
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,070
If you hang out with him, maybe you'll get it.

102
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,230
Really?

103
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,890
Because of you...

104
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,020
Asahi is dead.

105
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,090
Is that so.

106
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,920
He was one of our own.

107
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,710
People like us...

108
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,780
shouldn't even exist.

109
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,830
I heard he couldn't be buried in his family plot.

110
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,480
They said having a gangster in the family was a disgrace.

111
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,940
And so...

112
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,930
his mother had to beg everyone...

113
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,170
just to get him a spot in this remote corner of the island.

114
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,490
Isn't that good enough?

115
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,020
He's lucky to even have a grave to rest in.

116
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,390
And someone like you to come visit.

117
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,520
It's a good place.

118
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,240
He can rest in peace.

119
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,260
The ocean view is nice, too.

120
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,300
Asahi?

121
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Asahi.

122
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,940
Asahi...

123
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Asahi...

124
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,520
Asahi...

125
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,800
Asahi!

126
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
He was my only...

127
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,070
family.

128
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,980
I see.

129
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,470
Let's go back.

130
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,990
Um...

131
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,970
Hmm?

132
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Ma'am?

133
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:35,900
Are you hitting on me?
N-No.

134
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,470
You're...

135
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,300
that boy's friend, aren't you?

136
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,840
The one who always sends money.

137
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Well...

138
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,750
I don't know.

139
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,230
Kumakura.

140
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,830
I have a brother, don't I?

141
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,040
The kid my old man had with another woman.

142
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,430
There's no such person.

143
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,560
Is that so.

144
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,180
Dad never mentioned it?

145
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,230
Poor Kataoka.

146
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,230
He's the eldest son, the heir to the family business.

147
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
The eldest son...

148
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,030
It's you.

149
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Kumakura.

150
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,630
Yes.

151
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,330
Was I wrong in how I raised him?

152
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,170
What do you mean by that, sir?

153
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,280
Why hasn't Odajima killed Kataoka yet?

154
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,940
Kataoka is popular with the younger guys.

155
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,400
Don't tell me Kataoka's won over Odajima too.

156
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,590
I don't think that's possible.

157
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,560
What about you, Kumakura?

158
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,890
Hey.

159
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,770
You're always beating around the bush.

160
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,340
I...

161
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,110
exist to serve the Fourth.

162
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,470
My life...

163
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,860
is dedicated to that purpose.

164
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,010
So a hired gun is the most reliable after all.

165
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,730
Fourth, if you make another move...

166
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,910
Shut up.

167
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Shut up!

168
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,850
Fourth.

169
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,140
My old man always... favored that guy.

170
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,700
It's been that way since we were kids.

171
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,200
Dad was always smiling when he was with him.

172
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,440
That guy is going to take everything from me.

173
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,810
Please.

174
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,390
Calm down.

175
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,600
The boat's not here yet.

176
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,510
By the way.

177
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,570
You said you killed two family members
in middle school, right?

178
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,780
My dad and...

179
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,020
My mom and sister.

180
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,180
The numbers don't add up.

181
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,270
No.

182
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,390
They add up.

183
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,750
You're waiting for him, aren't you? That fat bastard.

184
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,880
I'm not letting you go.

185
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,360
What are you looking at, huh?

186
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,910
Hmm.

187
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,290
Don't look, you little brat.

188
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Hey.

189
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Hey.

190
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,770
So gross.

191
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,760
Stop!
Shut up.

192
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,890
Are you looking down on me?

193
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,490
- You messing with me, asshole?
- Stop!

194
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,440
You're all the same! Every single one of you!

195
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
Kill me...

196
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,450
Please.

197
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,380
Kill me...

198
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,300
I...

199
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,630
I killed my father...

200
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,090
and my mother, who I regard as my older sister.

201
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,390
Is that right?

202
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I...

203
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,040
I should never have been born.

204
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,310
You talking about yourself...

205
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,910
This is a first.

206
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,060
Someone willing to listen to all this...

207
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,330
You're the second person.

208
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Mm.

209
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,190
Ah, thanks.

210
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,770
Ow!

211
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,050
You're incredible.

212
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,060
You took down all five of them.

213
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,520
It was an order from above.

214
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,030
Heartless and emotionless.

215
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,730
Just like a hitman,
you kept throwing punches with a vacant stare.

216
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,310
No way.

217
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,450
You're a good person.

218
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Do you...

219
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,930
have a family?

220
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,210
No.

221
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,800
I killed them.

222
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
I see.

223
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,010
In that case...

224
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,220
I'll be...

225
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
your family.

226
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,660
Was it the guy from the grave?

227
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
The other one.

228
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,250
You talked to him about your family.

229
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,110
Yes.

230
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,910
And then...

231
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,390
I killed him, and as a result...

232
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,530
Did I become the enemy of the one you loved?

233
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,510
You were obsessed with him, weren't you?

234
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,570
No, I wasn't.

235
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,990
No, you were in love with him.

236
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,450
That's not true.

237
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,150
Hey.

238
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,630
How was he?

239
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,660
- I don't know.
- You're lying.

240
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,820
- For real.
- I don't believe you.

241
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,430
I mean...

242
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,510
nobody knows about this.

243
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,850
Not a soul.

244
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,530
Whether it's a man or a woman...

245
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,630
I've never had sex with anyone.

246
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Huh?

247
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,900
Get out of here. You're kidding, right?

248
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
It's true.

249
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,270
Just kissing. Nothing more.

250
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,440
You're...

251
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,630
my first.

252
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,330
What's wrong?

253
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
No...

254
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
It's just...

255
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,810
Alright!

256
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,850
Let's get married.

257
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Huh?

258
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,760
The women I'm with... they've all been around.

259
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,630
I've never been with a virgin before.

260
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
But...

261
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,990
But...

262
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,820
I'm a man.

263
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,980
Let's get married.

264
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,580
I have to take responsibility.

265
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,730
Because I'm a man.

266
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,550
What a beautiful day.

267
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,360
Wake me when we get there.

268
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,890
What are you looking at?

269
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,790
The flowers.

270
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,870
You like flowers?

271
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah.

272
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,500
They look just like a woman's... you know.

273
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,210
Oh, stop it.

274
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Look.

275
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
So beautiful, aren't they?

276
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,140
You know me.

277
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,560
The more beautiful something is,
the more I want to destroy it.

278
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,250
(Next Episode)
Boss.

279
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,700
Someone wants that guy dead.

280
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,290
And they're making their move before you.

281
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,080
Kill him.

282
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,890
Then you'll be free.

283
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,310
Well then, let's end this.

284
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,630
The final release.

285
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,680
Aren't you going to kiss me?

286
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I...

287
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,160
can fall in love too.

288
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,640
It's only human to have hope, right?

289
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,430
My old man passed away.

290
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,790
Kataoka-san.

291
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,270
If you go, you'll die.

292
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,650
He finally came alive right before he died.

293
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,730
Screaming, "Where's Kataoka?"

294
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,470
Did you come here to take everything from me?
