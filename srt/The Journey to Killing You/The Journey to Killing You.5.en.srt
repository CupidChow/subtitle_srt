(25 years ago)
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,920
Look, look!

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,830
I leveled up.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,960
A black belt! That's amazing.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,280
Great job.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,930
He's really something, isn't he?

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Hey, karate isn't for fighting.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,280
Got it?

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,920
Fighting is just violence.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,790
Ah, you need to remember that.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,450
Ah...

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,640
You'll get it next time.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,540
Yes, sir.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,710
Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,140
Hey, you're really something.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,450
That's incredible.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,350
You leveled up just like that.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,500
Dad gave Kataoka a smile I'd never seen him give me.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,200
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,440
- Good work.
- Keep it up.

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,670
- Good work!
- You too!

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,380
All right, then.

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,820
Anyone who wants to hit up a hostess club for round two...

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,180
Yes, please!

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,480
What a bunch of idiots.

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,040
Kataoka-san, great work.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,580
You too.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,190
We've got some great new girls in today.

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,270
Maybe next time.

30
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,920
We'll be waiting for you.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,130
Kin-san~

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,690
- How've you been?
- Never better.

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,960
- Take care.
- You too.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,420
- Oh, Takuma.
- Sir.

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,660
How's your mom?

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,610
I haven't been back to see her lately...

37
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,830
You should go show your face every once in a while.

38
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,010
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,580
Here, take this.

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,020
Thank you so much.

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,130
All right, let's go.

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,920
- Good work.
- You too.

43
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,470
Even outside the family, I was always watching Kataoka.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,330
Kataoka.

45
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,720
Are you trying to take everything from me?

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,300
"The Journey to Killing You"

47
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
(Last Will and Testament)

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,140
As I'm sure you all know,

49
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,930
this family was built by the late boss himself.

50
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,500
He literally,

51
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,320
built it drop by drop with his own blood.

52
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,920
He put his life on the line to carve out this territory.

53
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,550
In here,

54
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,730
are his final words.

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
This family...

56
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,030
who is to inherit it...

57
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,720
it's all written clearly in here.

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,810
This guy...
He just transferred to our family.

59
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,030
What the hell! It's an assassin!

60
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,730
He infiltrated us!

61
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,920
He's after Kataoka!

62
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,520
Get him!

63
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,020
Kataoka-san.

64
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,660
I've been...

65
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,850
thinking about something.

66
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,520
Kataoka-san, you're so damn cool.

67
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,730
Odajima.

68
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,300
Use this to go get some sushi.

69
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,060
I've got the look, right? Just like Kataoka-san?

70
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,210
Not at all.

71
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
No, come on, look.

72
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,150
Don't I have that big-shot aura too?

73
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,990
Kataoka-san is just so cool.

74
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,070
Can I become like him?

75
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Tell me, can I?

76
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,720
Impossible.

77
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,370
Impossible? Why would you say that?

78
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,370
Why...?

79
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,570
There's no way you could ever be like him.

80
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,150
Odajima.

81
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,970
Kataoka-san said...

82
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,870
he wants me to join him on the job tonight.

83
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,660
Oh man, do you think he's got his eye on me?

84
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,670
If this job goes well,

85
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Odajima,

86
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,300
I'll put in a good word for you...
so he'll bring you along next time.

87
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,570
When we make it to the top,

88
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,410
let's build a house together.

89
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,150
Why Asahi?

90
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,680
Hey, are you even listening to me?

91
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,830
Stop! Don't run!

92
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,740
Asahi!

93
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,800
Something happened!

94
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,020
Something's happened!

95
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,290
Asahi!

96
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,220
Asahi!

97
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Asahi!

98
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,610
You said I was family...

99
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,500
but in your heart, is Kataoka that important?

100
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,590
Asahi!

101
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,050
You left me here.

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
But...

103
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
I finally understand.

104
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,880
Ah, so that's how it is.

105
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,990
You've got to be kidding me.

106
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,570
Boss.

107
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,240
So that's what this was all about...

108
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Asahi.

109
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,750
It's just that...

110
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,310
my body moved on its own.

111
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
That's all it was.

112
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,310
Kataoka-san?

113
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,970
Kataoka-san!

114
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,500
That hurts...

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,210
The wound in my stomach had just finished healing,

116
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,190
and now there's another hole in it.

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why?

118
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,880
Why did you protect me?

119
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,250
I had to protect you.

120
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,020
You're my...

121
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,030
beloved wife.

122
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,540
Come to think of it,

123
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,260
I think this is... our first kiss.

124
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
Kataoka-san.

125
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,990
Kataoka-san!

126
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,530
You bastard!

127
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,220
Are you kidding me?

128
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,390
Boss.

129
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,890
Kataoka-san.

130
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,220
The man who attacked Kataoka has been dealt with.

131
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,080
Kataoka's condition is still not looking good.

132
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,920
Did you find out who was behind it?

133
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,760
It would've been better if he'd just died.

134
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,790
Fourth Generation.

135
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,180
You're finally willing to tell your parents...

136
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,690
how you truly feel.

137
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,370
No.

138
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,540
Perhaps we were too hard on you.

139
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Keito.

140
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,680
I want you to read this carefully and take it to heart.

141
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,480
Understand how he's always felt about you.

142
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,170
That's not right.

143
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,810
Dad only ever had eyes for Kataoka.

144
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,490
He may have been clumsy,

145
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,250
but he was always watching over you.

146
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,470
But maybe he was just too clumsy about it.

147
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,830
(I, the testator Kirii Seizo, upon my death,
establish the following will

148
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,830
to maintain order in this family and peace among my clan.)

149
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,590
(Successor to Head of the Kirii Family,
Fourth Generation: Kirii Keito)

150
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,110
Kataoka is...

151
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,850
the son of my father's mistress, right?

152
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,620
That is absolutely not true.

153
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,960
Kataoka's father...

154
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,010
in a conflict...

155
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,300
sacrificed his life to protect the late boss.

156
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
His wife,

157
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,500
loved only her late husband.

158
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,410
The late boss...

159
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,570
was simply looking after
his best friend's orphaned son, Kataoka,

160
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,870
and his mother.

161
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,950
That's all there was to it.

162
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,900
I could never stand the guy.

163
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,950
He was better than me at everything.

164
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,880
And I could never figure out what he was thinking.

165
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,770
But Dad...

166
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,510
he cared more for that guy than for me.

167
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,390
Even so, the late boss...

168
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,030
was always watching over you.

169
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,090
And...

170
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,580
he wanted you to be his successor.

171
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,150
He said it all the time.

172
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,740
I never heard him say that.

173
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,030
We told you many times.

174
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,350
Many times.

175
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,660
It was you who...

176
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,530
refused to believe it.

177
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
Kataoka-san.

178
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Hm?

179
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,540
You'll die if you go.

180
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,650
Then let's do it one last time.

181
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,820
One last time.

182
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,650
You have to cherish your wife.

183
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,050
We'll talk more when I get back.

184
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,930
Kataoka-san.

185
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,960
Please wake up.

186
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Kataoka-san.

187
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Kataoka-san.

188
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Kataoka-san.

189
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,640
Kataoka-san! Someone!

190
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Somebody!

191
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,170
- Kataoka-san!
- What's wrong?

192
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,000
Kataoka-san.

193
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Kataoka-san?

194
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,270
Kataoka-san.

195
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,280
Can you hear me?
What's happening?

196
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Kataoka-san.

197
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,320
- Kataoka-san, Kataoka-san!
- Go get the doctor, quickly!

198
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,570
- We're going in. Excuse us.
- Right.

199
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
Kataoka-san...

200
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,830
That's Odajima.

201
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,370
He's been with my old man for a long time.

202
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,720
He's good with the books.

203
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,680
He's all yours. Take him with you.

204
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Yo.

205
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,310
Odajima.

206
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,060
You're always clumsy in the most unexpected ways.

207
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,080
Don't you dare mess this up.

208
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
Seriously...

209
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,020
You're so cold.

210
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
Let's get married.

211
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,360
I have to take responsibility.

212
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,470
Because I'm a man.

213
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:44,300
Please... don't die.

214
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Because...

215
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,080
you...

216
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,390
You're...

217
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,770
my...

218
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,240
reason...

219
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,970
for living.

220
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
(Final Episode)

221
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,800
I always

222
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,420
have the same dream.

223
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,610
A dream of flying through the air.

224
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,440
A world of pure white.

225
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
A completely empty sky.

226
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,220
Flying aimlessly everywhere.
