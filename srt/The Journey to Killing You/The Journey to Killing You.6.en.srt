00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,770
I keep having...

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,470
the same dream.

4
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,120
A dream where I'm flying through the sky.

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,510
In that pure white,

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,890
empty sky.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,300
I'm just flying aimlessly.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,620
Soon, I get exhausted.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,580
In the end,

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,800
I'm going nowhere.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Stop it.

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,740
Stop it.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,860
Hey.

14
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,400
You really went overboard.

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,730
Did I tell you to beat him half to death?

16
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,350
Dad's furious.

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,380
But whatever.

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,120
I already smoothed things over for you, so don't worry.

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,310
Hey.

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,520
Be ready. You come when I call.

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,320
Starting today, you're my kid.

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,250
Kids are supposed to listen to their parents, right?

23
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,690
Take it.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,580
I understand.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,530
You hate Kataoka, don't you?

26
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,580
He might as well have killed your friend.

27
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,090
Odajima.

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,530
Go kill Kataoka.

29
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,820
The doctor is here to see you.

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
He's out of the woods.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,420
He's a real fighter.

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,700
It'll still take some time for him to recover,

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,600
but we'll keep a close eye on him.

34
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,250
I'll be going now.

35
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,970
Kataoka-san.

36
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,050
Seven years ago,

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,010
Asahi died for you.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
Killing you...

39
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,510
became my only reason for living.

40
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
But...

41
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,740
I also...

42
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,260
did the same thing Asahi did.

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
And then...

44
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,830
you saved me too.

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Asahi.

46
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,110
I...

47
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,470
have to go now.

48
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
"The Journey to Kill You"

49
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,750
Good work, Fourth Generation.

50
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,230
I'm not officially the Fourth Generation yet.

51
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Odajima.

52
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,030
It's alright, Kumakura.

53
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Odajima.

54
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,000
What? Starting to miss your old man?

55
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,290
Where'd you run off to without a word?

56
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,410
What is the meaning of this?

57
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,480
Here's 200 million.

58
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,310
I want out of the organization.

59
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,220
It's all yours.

60
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,010
You've got some nerve.

61
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,890
You think this chump change is enough to let you walk away clean?

62
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Odajima.

63
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,760
Go kill Kataoka.

64
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,580
This is a recording of you ordering a hit.

65
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,710
Just as you're trying to consolidate your power,

66
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,710
you wouldn't want to lose the loyalty
of the younger members, would you?

67
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,090
I can't believe you'd stoop to this...

68
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,550
Go wherever you want.

69
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,330
And don't ever come back.

70
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,360
Next time I see you, I'll kill you.

71
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,860
So you don't even trust your own family anymore.

72
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
You either.

73
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Asahi.

74
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,080
I couldn't keep our promise.

76
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,910
Oh.

77
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,240
Over there.

78
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,130
I saw a bunch of tough-looking guys.

79
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,860
I was wondering what was going on...

80
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
You...

81
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,740
I never knew you could make a face like that.

82
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,730
What do you think?

83
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,910
My powers of recovery.

84
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,500
I figured I could probably walk on my own,

85
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,010
so I went for a little walk, and I'm totally fine.

86
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,550
The doctor said...

87
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,950
- you still need to rest.
- Honestly...

88
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,390
Where did you think I'd run off to?

89
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,500
There's no way I'd just run off

90
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,500
and leave my beloved wife behind.

91
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,010
What is it?

92
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,840
Feeling bold, are we?

93
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,330
Since you're all better now,

94
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,070
this shouldn't be too much for you, right?

95
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Of course. It's a piece of cake.

96
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,300
I've been holding back for a long time, too.

97
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,340
I won't go easy on you.

98
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,430
You're a really interesting guy.

99
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,280
Is this revenge for your friend?

100
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm...

101
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,400
someone who shouldn't have been...

102
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,580
born.

103
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,780
Forgive your sister...

104
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,160
Please forgive your mother.

105
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,720
Of course,

106
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,020
I had no reason to live.

107
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
But...

108
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,560
then I met Asahi.

109
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,060
I'll be your family.

110
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,670
But then Asahi died...

111
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,270
I convinced myself it was all your fault.

112
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,180
From that day on,

113
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,150
for seven years,

114
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,990
killing...

115
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,720
you...

116
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,010
became my reason for living.

117
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,570
Odajima.

118
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,600
Over here.

119
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,020
I told you, didn't I?

120
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,530
Don't miss.

121
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,520
Someone like me...

122
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,810
You...

123
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,890
Hey, Odajima.

124
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,220
We're free.

125
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,090
Hey, Odajima.

126
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,540
Here's your Tropical Mango Special,
super-sized!

127
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,390
Awesome!

128
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,110
For real, for real.

129
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,570
You don't seem like you're from Tokyo, old man.

130
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,390
Old man?

131
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,270
Huh? 'Cause you totally look like one.

132
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,540
I totally look like one?

133
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,750
Bro, bro.

134
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,920
My name's...

135
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,280
Jima-chan.

136
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,770
- Jima-chan?
- Let's take a picture!

137
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,830
Okay...

138
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,850
Let's take it together.

139
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,210
Come on, get in here.

140
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Ready?

141
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,050
Say cheese!

142
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,980
- See ya! That was fun!
- Thanks for coming.

143
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,860
Bye-bye, old man.

144
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
You know,

145
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,750
how come you're the only one getting all the attention?

146
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,410
You think so?

147
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,450
That Hawaiian shirt really doesn't suit you.

148
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,990
It doesn't?

149
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,010
It doesn't?

150
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,070
It suits you well,

151
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,110
Fourth Generation.

152
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,030
I,

153
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Kirii Keito,

154
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,870
succeeding my father,

155
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,030
do hereby,

156
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,700
as the Fourth Generation leader of the Kirii Group,

157
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,060
humbly accept this appointment.

158
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,010
Does it really look that bad on me?

159
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,550
It's a total mismatch.

160
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,450
By the way,

161
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,070
that old guy really is the president.

162
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,030
Is that old guy our new boss?

163
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,070
Man, you're so good at playing innocent.

164
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,210
Sorry.

165
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,610
Boss!

166
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,960
Oh, there you are, Eiji.

167
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes.

168
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,740
Boss, that's a cool Hawaiian shirt.

169
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
Right?

170
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Hello.

171
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Oh.

172
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,250
Uh...

173
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,890
Hm?

174
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,610
Sis!

175
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,750
I knew it, I can't!
No, no, no, no!

176
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,750
Hey.

177
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,000
See you later, boss.

178
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,020
I just couldn't bring myself to say it.

179
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,340
He's a cute kid, isn't he?

180
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,090
Right?

181
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,010
Sis.

182
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,490
It's Odajima.

183
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,130
Oh, is it Kataoka now?

184
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,470
Kataoka Ren.

185
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,060
Has a nice ring to it.

186
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,020
I keep having...

187
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,130
the same dream.

188
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,400
In a pure white sky,

189
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,750
birds are dancing.

190
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,240
For some reason, I'm flying too.

191
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,050
