00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,040
Let's get married.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,010
I have to take responsibility.

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,110
Because that's what a man does.

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,030
What a beautiful day.

6
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,510
Wake me when we get there.

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,090
Kataoka-san, wake up.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Let's go.

9
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
Take care.

10
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,620
Okay.

11
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,640
Thank you.

12
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,350
Thank you.

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,810
Take care.

14
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,150
Thank you.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,640
Thank you.

16
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,580
Odajima.

17
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,470
I'm thirsty.

18
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,680
I'll go get some coffee.

19
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,550
Okay.

20
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Boss!

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,980
Ow, that hurts!

22
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,840
Boss!

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
That's the guy.

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Hey! Stop!

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,930
Ow.

26
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,400
Boss! Boss, are you okay?

27
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,830
Boss, boss.

28
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,690
Boss, are you all right?

29
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,620
Boss!

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
(The Journey to Killing You)

31
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,480
Aren't you cute.

32
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,580
How old are you?

33
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,570
Ah, wait, let me guess.

34
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
You must be...

35
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,630
That's sexual harassment, boss.

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
That's right.

37
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,350
Keep making a scene and they'll transfer you.

38
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,740
My wife sure is a nag.

39
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,670
Please don't call me your wife.

40
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,790
Why not?

41
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,210
Aren't we married?

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
You seem to be in good spirits.

43
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,470
I'm not. My stomach is killing me.

44
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,230
The man who ran away...

45
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,690
I had the local police look into it.

46
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,070
But they're dragging their feet.

47
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,820
Is that so?

48
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,070
The medicine is kicking in.

49
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm so sleepy.

50
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,510
But this hospital is so boring.

51
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,720
All you do is eat and sleep.

52
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,420
Because that's what this place is for.

53
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,320
Who knows? I have no idea.

54
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
Is that so?

55
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,300
He's flashy, so he's made a lot of enemies.

56
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,540
Someone else might get to him before you do.

57
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't let someone beat you to the punch.

58
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,010
Don't let someone beat you to the punch.

59
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,310
If you don't hurry, someone else will kill him.

60
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Odajima.

61
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,570
Kill him.

62
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,960
Kill him.

63
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,080
Kill Kataoka.

64
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,130
Kill him.

65
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Don't you hold a grudge against Kataoka from seven years ago?

66
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,350
Do it.

67
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,550
It'll set you free.

68
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,350
Kill him.

69
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,020
What's wrong?

70
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
Aren't you going to kiss me?

71
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
You were awake?

72
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,010
The way you were breathing... anyone would've gotten their hopes up.

73
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,560
And I felt you staring at me.

74
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,840
You're imagining things.

75
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
No, I'm not.

76
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,300
That was a look of love.

77
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I...

78
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,920
will never love anyone.

79
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Kill me...

80
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,270
Please.

81
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,130
Kill me...

82
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,310
Kumakura.

83
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,950
Yes.

84
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,710
How many years have you been with us?

85
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,410
The Third took me in.

86
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,580
It's been 27 years.

87
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,730
That's a long time.

88
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,790
It went by in a flash.

89
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
My old man...

90
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,730
On his deathbed, he was still saying...

91
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,070
"Where's Kataoka?"

92
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,730
Even though I was right in front of him.

93
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,610
Kumakura.

94
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,550
Yes.

95
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,230
You...

96
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,070
Even if I get kicked out of the family...
will you still follow me?

97
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,370
The successor to the family...

98
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
is you.

99
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,210
The Fourth.

100
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,070
I didn't get to... take out Kataoka in time.

101
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,050
Kataoka-san.

102
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,490
You shouldn't be moving around.

103
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,350
Odajima.

104
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,220
A suit.

105
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,180
A black, double-breasted one.

106
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Get one for yourself, too.

107
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,970
The old man passed away.

108
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,610
Even if it's a cheap, off-the-rack suit...

109
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,100
it still looks pretty good on me.

110
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,460
It pays to be handsome.

111
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,230
Kataoka-san.

112
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,010
Hm?

113
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,770
They'll kill you if you go.

114
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,920
Then let's have one last round.

115
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,020
One for the road.

116
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,890
Gotta take good care of my wife.

117
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,330
We'll continue this when I get back.

118
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,470
Mr. Kataoka.

119
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,020
Do you have permission to leave?

120
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,550
Ah, if I stay here...

121
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,350
my wife gets terribly jealous.

122
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,960
No, but...

123
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,190
Sorry about that.

124
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,390
Hey, wait a minute.

125
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,080
Someone get a doctor, quick!

126
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,780
A doctor!

127
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Right.

128
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,550
Let's go.

129
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,290
Yes, sir.

130
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,320
- Yo.
- Haven't seen you since the boss's funeral.

131
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,170
How's business?

132
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,590
Not so good.

133
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Just between us...

134
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,040
Who's gonna be the successor?

135
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,060
Doesn't he have a son?

136
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
He's one of the lieutenants.

137
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,930
But...

138
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,430
aren't there rumors he has an illegitimate son?

139
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Sounds like trouble's brewing.

140
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,990
I hear he was the boss's favorite.

141
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,740
Speak of the devil.

142
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,290
Boss.

143
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,170
Boss.

144
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,050
Ma'am.

145
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,310
You're here.

146
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Come.

147
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,530
Have a look at his face.

148
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Darling.

149
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,320
Kinji is here.

150
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,740
Such a handsome, captivating face.

151
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,490
Ma'am.

152
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,090
Got any lipstick?

153
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Lipstick?

154
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,220
Let me borrow it.

155
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,880
Sure.

156
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,090
You! What do you think you're doing?

157
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,890
Hey!

158
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,330
Let me go! What's the big deal?

159
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,840
Let me stay a little longer.

160
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,520
This is my final farewell!

161
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Cut it out!
Let go.

162
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,730
I said let go, don't you understand?

163
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,050
Darling.

164
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,660
You're so popular.

165
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,840
A pretty boy suits you well.

166
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
Kinji.

167
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,000
Thank you.

168
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,730
Ow, that hurts.

169
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,210
Those old guys don't pull their punches.

170
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,720
I'll go get an iced towel.

171
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,850
Yeah.

172
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,640
- Boss.
- Boss.

173
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,530
Boss Kataoka.

174
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,300
Yo, you guys.

175
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,550
Doing all right?

176
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,750
Yes!

177
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,420
Boss, if you're gonna lay low, take me with you!

178
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,160
Why Odajima?

179
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,570
That guy's so gloomy and boring.

180
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,390
He's right behind you.

181
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Uh oh.

182
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh.

183
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,290
Oh, right.

184
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,150
This guy...

185
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,950
is my wife now.

186
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Wife?

187
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
No, I'm not.

188
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
You're...

189
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,590
Uh, uh, uh...

190
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,070
Ma'am...

191
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,120
I can't. I can't say it.

192
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,130
Yo.

193
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,520
Are you here to take everything from me?

194
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,210
He looks so peaceful.

195
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
The boss...

196
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,970
was very fond of me since I was a child.

197
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,620
I owe him a lot.

198
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Right.

199
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,160
So you're the "boss" now, are you?

200
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Huh?

201
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,070
Are you making fun of me?

202
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
What?

203
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah? What is it?

204
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,280
Thank you all for waiting.

205
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Everyone,

206
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
please have a seat inside.

207
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
(Last Will and Testament)

208
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,820
As I'm sure you all know,

209
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,520
the late boss built this organization
with his own two hands.

210
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,150
In the truest sense of the word,

211
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,070
he poured his own blood into it.

212
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,630
He risked his life to build this empire.

213
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,380
In here,

214
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,340
are his final words.

215
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,510
This organization...

216
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,560
and who is to inherit it...

217
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,270
it's all spelled out right here.

218
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
(Next Episode)
Odajima.

219
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Kataoka-san told me...

220
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,270
to go with him on tonight's deal.

221
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,850
Why Asahi?

222
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,030
Over me? The one he calls his family?

223
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,510
I guess Kataoka's just more important to him.

224
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,870
That Kataoka guy...

225
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,390
He's the son of the old man's mistress, isn't he?

226
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,150
You're finally...

227
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,650
telling me how you really feel.

228
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,370
You...

229
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
are my...

230
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,940
reason for living.

231
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Kataoka-san...

232
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,020
Please don't die.
