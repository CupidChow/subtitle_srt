00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
(Episode 1)

2
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,310
- Nice work.
- You too.

3
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,100
- Don't!
- Hey! Get over here!

4
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,820
Ow!

5
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,970
No!

6
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,080
Stop it!

7
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,750
Let go of me!

8
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,970
- Ow!
- Go make some more money!

9
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,990
Stop!

10
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,690
Get back in there, damn you!

11
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,300
Ow...

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,130
Or you could just make more money.

13
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,520
- You said this wasn't for real!
- Shut up. It's not like you'll lose a limb.

14
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,210
Speaking of which...

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,420
You haven't forgotten what you owe us,
have you, idiot?

16
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,280
Let go of the girl.

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,970
Huh? Who the hell are you?

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
Hey! You bastard!

19
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,990
Hey.

20
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,050
Oh, dear... Now what?

21
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,750
This was my favorite.

22
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,670
Stop it.

23
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,820
Go make some money.

24
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,300
No!

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,990
You son of a bitch.

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,520
If you do this...

27
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,350
You know who you're messing with, don't you...

28
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,850
Kataoka.

29
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,520
Why don't you go lie low at a hot spring for a while?

30
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh, sounds good. I can raise some hell at a hot spring.

31
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,170
I heard you messed up their young guys pretty bad.

32
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,120
I like to make a big splash.

33
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,570
We have our rules, and they have theirs.

34
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,580
Stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,350
Thanks to you, they're pissed off now.

36
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,170
You hanging around here
will only provoke them more.

37
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,230
But their fourth-generation boss
and I have known each other since kindergarten.

38
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,720
While you're away on your "trip"...

39
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,190
I'll handle things and smooth it over for you.

40
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,550
Hey!

41
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,410
Excuse me.

42
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,440
This is Odajima.

43
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,120
He's been with my old man for a long time.

44
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,430
He's useful for keeping the books and stuff.

45
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,290
I'm lending him to you. Take him with you.

46
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,140
What are you doing?

47
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,250
Kataoka-san.

48
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,180
Doing...?

49
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
You know, that thing.

50
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,260
By the way.

51
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,220
What was your name again?

52
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,350
My name is Odajima.

53
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,510
You...

54
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,850
You're pretty famous around here, aren't you?

55
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,990
That look of disgust on your face is priceless.

56
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,200
I'm hungry after that workout.

57
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,580
Let's get some breakfast.

58
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,130
I'm going to...

59
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,320
kill this man.

60
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
"The Journey to Kill You"

61
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,800
Odajima.

62
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,790
My back hurts.

63
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,840
Well, the car has a low ceiling.

64
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,830
Don't they have those big cars?
Uh... what are they called?

65
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,830
The one with a bed inside,
name sounds like a hunting cap.

66
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,600
You mean a camper van?

67
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,810
Yeah.

68
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Let's buy one.

69
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,360
- We don't have that kind of money.
- Didn't we just get a chunk of cash?

70
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,520
It's not enough. A camper costs at least ten million.

71
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,060
I gave my Mercedes to a hostess.

72
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,370
Let's steal one then.

73
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,510
It's too conspicuous. Please don't.

74
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,070
We're on the run, remember?

75
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
Aahh...

76
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,930
Welcome.

77
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,030
Boss, one kake soba.

78
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Coming right up.

79
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,220
Same for me.

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
You got it.

81
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,080
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.

82
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,250
Mmm.

83
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,450
This is delicious.

84
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Hey, boss.

85
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,410
How many years have you been running this place?

86
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,030
Well... I lost count a long time ago.

87
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,500
The broth is special. You use a good stock, right?

88
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,040
Nope.

89
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,610
No, no, no. You can't fool my taste buds.

90
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,650
This broth has the taste of time.

91
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,950
This is it.

92
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,840
Boss, an extra order of kinpira gobo.

93
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,470
Right away.

94
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Odajima.

95
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,740
You could at least crack a smile.

96
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,840
Sorry.

97
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,490
It's more embarrassing
when people don't laugh at times like this.

98
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,180
Sorry.

99
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,600
Thanks for the meal.

100
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,910
Oh, sorry.

101
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,450
Oh, crap.

102
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Aren't those guys yakuza?

103
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,100
Hey, I said I was sorry.

104
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,130
Yakuza from a backwater town like this...

105
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,500
are nothing to worry about.

106
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,490
Oh?

107
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,640
Full of piss and vinegar, aren't we?

108
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,490
Odajima.

109
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,330
That's enough.

110
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,220
Listen here.

111
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,290
Fighting is bad. Fighting is violence.

112
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,070
You've become more of a man.

113
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,230
Go have some sushi.

114
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,340
Let's go, Odajima.

115
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,430
Yes, sir.

116
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,240
- You want another beating?
- No, let it go.

117
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,480
Hey, kid, you need something else?

118
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
No...

119
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,110
Um...

120
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,290
Hm?

121
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,980
Please take us as your disciples!

122
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,410
We're begging you!

123
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,850
Whoa, I said "sushi," not "disciples."

124
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,710
Please!

125
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,980
- Wait up, Aniki!
- Aniki!

126
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,100
- Take us with you!
- Yeah!

127
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,900
Sorry.

128
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,620
- I don't need any followers.
- Come on! Just say yes!

129
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,610
- Please wait!
- Aniki, please wait!

130
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,260
- Wait up, Aniki!
- Take us with you!

131
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,290
Those idiots.

132
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,420
There's no way they can catch up on foot.

133
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,250
Just ignore them, please.

134
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,530
They've got spirit, though.

135
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,140
Just like you when the boss took you in.

136
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,000
(Winter 2016)

137
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,340
Had enough, kid?

138
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,180
Fighting's no good.

139
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,440
This fighting stuff...

140
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,930
it's just violence.

141
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,340
You've got spirit, though.

142
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,070
Kataoka-san.

143
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,740
Hm?

144
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,380
Did you see all that?

145
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,070
When the boss took me in.

146
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,050
Nope.

147
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,520
How'd it happen again?

148
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,430
Alright.

149
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,240
So, what's next? A bath or dinner?

150
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,830
We're like a married couple, you know?

151
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,070
Odajima.

152
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,290
It's rude to ignore people.

153
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,510
You make it seem like I'm talking to myself.

154
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,190
Huh?

155
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,230
Hm?

156
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250
Is that the boss's illegitimate child?

157
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
No way.

158
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,590
I don't think so.

159
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
Probably...

160
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,710
Then what's the deal?

161
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,630
Why is everything getting drawn to us?

162
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,800
How should I know?

163
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,530
Hey, kid, where's your mom?

164
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,450
Is she hot?

165
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
What?

166
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,110
Please don't make the kid cry.

167
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,420
It wasn't me.

168
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,100
Hey, kid, don't cry.

169
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,420
Okay? Hmm?

170
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,850
Hey, what's wrong?

171
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,070
Huh?

172
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm hungry.

173
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,440
I want to eat.

174
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,820
But both your hands are full.

175
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,060
You can just feed me.

176
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,320
Hey, you were just thinking, "What a pain," weren't you?

177
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,840
You totally were.

178
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,630
It's probably going to die.

179
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,780
That thing.

180
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,200
Taking in a dying bird...

181
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,490
what do you plan to do with it?

182
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,530
I had no choice.

183
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,480
He asked for my help.

184
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,480
Duty and honor are the yakuza way.

185
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,330
Odajima.

186
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,390
Have you ever killed anyone?

187
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,470
Not since I joined the family.

188
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,670
You skipped high school and went to prison, right?

189
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,060
So that means you killed someone
when you were in middle school.

190
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,590
That's pretty early.

191
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,980
I killed two people.

192
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,830
My father and...

193
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,680
my mother and sister.

194
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,530
Huh?

195
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,250
The numbers don't add up.

196
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,380
What about you, Kataoka-san?

197
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,630
Oh.

198
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,030
Back when I was a grunt, I did a lot of crazy stuff.

199
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,120
I stopped counting after ten.

200
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
And I didn't even do those with my own hands.

201
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,490
If you include the ones
I had my underlings take care of...

202
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,010
the number gets pretty high.

203
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,200
And in the end...

204
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,070
I can't even save a single life.

205
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,370
Hey, Odajima.

206
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,340
So this thing's just going to die?

207
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,210
Yes.

208
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,290
Even if we saved it,

209
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,270
once it has the scent of a human on it,

210
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,390
its parents will just abandon it anyway.

211
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,090
Parents, huh...

212
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,250
Once they abandon you, it's all over.

213
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,000
How does it feel, Odajima?

214
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,630
Enjoying the boss's "generosity"?

215
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,950
Odajima.

216
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,130
Go kill Kataoka Kinji.

217
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,140
You know,

218
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,970
the underboss of our family...

219
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,830
he's the old man's favorite.

220
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,880
I hear they're building an incinerator on Kataoka's turf.

221
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,450
When the old man gave him that land,

222
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,390
he didn't think twice—it was a dump with a few dive bars.

223
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,360
But now that it's a gold mine, things are different.

224
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,320
So, how should we do it?

225
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,210
An accidental death during his trip.

226
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,290
Just his bad luck.

227
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
Hey, Odajima.

228
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,560
You don't want to be stuck in this rut forever, do you?

229
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,070
I paid a fortune for you.

230
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,310
You understand, don't you, Odajima?

231
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
A son is supposed to protect his parents, right?

232
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,590
Go take him out.

233
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,110
- I got us some food.
- Alright.

234
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,340
Are you an idiot? I can't use either of my hands.

235
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,410
How am I supposed to eat ramen?

236
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Sorry.

237
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,900
Just give me the rice ball. C'mon, feed me.

238
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,760
There's salmon and tuna mayo.

239
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,270
Tuna mayo, obviously.

240
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,920
Excuse me.

241
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,150
The noodles are getting soggy.

242
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,680
Hey.

243
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,050
Let me have a bite.

244
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,220
It smells so good, I want some.

245
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,050
It's hot!

246
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,080
I told you to be careful!

247
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,210
Sorry.

248
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,940
You're clumsy in the weirdest ways.

249
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,860
Sorry.

250
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,070
Blow on it.

251
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,100
It's hot! It's still hot!

252
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,010
Sorry.

253
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,440
Blow on it some more.

254
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,070
Okay.

255
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,950
There.

256
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Ah, here.

257
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,000
Hey, kid, stop crying.

258
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
I already made it a grave, didn't I?

259
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,380
It's sad, I know.

260
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,100
But every living thing,

261
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,880
dies someday. It can't be helped.

262
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,070
Hey.

263
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,500
If you act like this,

264
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,780
how is it supposed to rest in peace?

265
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,050
Here, blow your nose.

266
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,710
There you go.

267
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Yeah.

268
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,670
We don't have incense, so this will have to do.

269
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,550
You did your best.

270
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,750
Rest in peace.

271
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,140
Is my fishing rod not ready yet?

272
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,230
Mine is still here.

273
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
Mine's gone.

274
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,700
Isn't that yours?

275
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,040
- Let's go together!
- No way.

276
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,380
- But I'm scared!
- So am I!

277
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,110
- That's why we should go together!
- I said no!

278
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,510
My fishing rod...

279
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,610
- Then go get it back!
- I'm scared!

280
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,770
I'm scared too!

281
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,530
- Let's go together!
- No!

282
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,290
Move aside.

283
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,850
- Let's go.
- No, my fishing rod!

284
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,860
B-but... that's scary.

285
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,210
A long time ago...

286
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,090
a hitman stormed our family's office.

287
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,780
The moment he got in,
he just started spraying bullets everywhere.

288
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,000
It was a total bloodbath.

289
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,590
Right in front of me...

290
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,200
the advisor's head got blown clean off.

291
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,250
But the old guy didn't die right away.

292
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,030
With his brains leaking out of his shattered skull...

293
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,610
he asked me to pick them up.

294
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,060
He said he'd die if I didn't put them back in.

295
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,310
That's what he said.

296
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,240
Pretty scary, right?

297
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,370
Not being able to die... that's the scariest part.

298
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,710
Odajima.

299
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,350
You're clumsy in the weirdest ways.

300
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,470
Don't you dare screw this up.

301
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,130
Oh, I got a bite!

302
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,600
Not yet.

303
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
There's still...

304
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,250
something I need to know.

305
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,240
(Next Episode)
Don't you have a seven-year grudge against Kataoka?

306
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,620
Plus, me and...

307
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,850
You have to live with us too.

308
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
Of course.

309
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,800
You're my family.

310
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,390
Odajima, what are you doing?

311
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,350
You're nothing but a tool to me.

312
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,380
Kataoka-san talked to us!

313
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,650
Asahi.

314
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,190
Don't die, Asahi.

315
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,410
Why, Asahi?

316
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,700
Why did you die?

317
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,930
If I say I don't want to, does that not count?

318
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,300
If you truly didn't want this...

319
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I wouldn't force you.

320
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,390
You know what he's really like, don't you?

321
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,300
You really are an interesting one.
