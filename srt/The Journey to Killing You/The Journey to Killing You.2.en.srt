00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,590
Odajima, what are you messing around for?

3
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,170
Isn't Kataoka dead yet?

4
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,210
I haven't had the right chance.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,510
Get it done.

6
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,430
Before this whole succession thing blows up.

7
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,770
Snatch his territory first.

8
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,910
Boss.

9
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,260
Is he not well?

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,480
Forget what I just said.

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,780
Forget it.

12
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,690
Just go take Kataoka out.

13
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,330
You're nothing but a tool to me.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,820
If you're a tool, you act like one.

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,580
Do what you're told.

16
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,610
Don't you hold a grudge against Kataoka
from seven years ago?

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,780
If you understand, then go bring me Kataoka's head.

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Odajima.

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
(Winter 2018)

20
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,570
Wait, hey!

21
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,790
Hurry up!

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you kidding me?

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,360
Stop right there! Hey!

24
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,790
This is bad.

25
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
Asahi.

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Asahi!

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,120
Asahi!

28
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,990
Are you okay?

29
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
Asahi.

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,140
You'll be okay, Asahi.

31
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,050
Let's go.

32
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,220
We...

33
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,550
Shut up, Asahi.

34
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,030
It's going to be okay.

35
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,550
Of course...

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,880
Hey, Odajima.

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Yeah.

38
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,050
We're the ultimate duo.

39
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,830
We can do anything.

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,650
Let's make it to the top together.

41
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,170
Just shut up.

42
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,090
We're going to the top, aren't we?

43
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,420
Asahi.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Asahi?

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,530
No... Don't die, Asahi.

46
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,510
Asahi!

47
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,520
Odajima...

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah?

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,170
We are...

50
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,350
free.

51
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,490
Asahi?

52
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,370
Asahi?

53
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,390
Asahi!

54
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
Asahi!

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Asahi!

56
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,890
Asahi!

57
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,970
Asahi!

58
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,460
Why, Asahi?

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,080
Why did you have to die?

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
"The Journey to Kill You"

61
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,150
Is that him?

62
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,360
I see.

63
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,430
Oh, Odajima.

64
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Beer, over here.

65
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,790
Oh yeah, this guy is Odajima.

66
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,670
It's hot, isn't it, kid?

67
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Here, have a drink.

68
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,030
We just met. Are you sure?

69
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Don't worry about it.

70
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,890
- Go on.
- Huh? Can I really take one?

71
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,430
Yeah.

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Alright.

73
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
You want one too?

74
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,960
No, I can't drink.

75
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,390
I have to drive.

76
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,540
What a buzzkill.

77
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
Alright.

78
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,530
Ready? And...

79
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Cheers!

80
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,250
Mister.

81
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,530
So you're walking across the country.

82
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,790
That's right.

83
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,190
I started from the southern tip of Kyushu.

84
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,070
And I'm heading for the northern sea.

85
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
That's amazing.

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,050
Hey, what's Fukuoka like?

87
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,200
- My mom lives there.
- Huh?

88
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,550
- Isn't Fukuoka in the northeast?
- What?

89
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,390
Hey, hey.

90
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,470
Did you really walk all the way from Kyushu?

91
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,340
Don't look down on me.
I'm a company president back home.

92
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Wow, that's impressive.

93
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,220
You guys, if you ever need a job,

94
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,650
- my company will hire you.
- Oh!

95
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,090
We'll be counting on you then, Mr. President.

96
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,300
And this young lady will be the president's wife.

97
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,430
Oh, stop it.

98
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,370
My husband will get jealous.

99
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,430
Oh, so you're a married woman.

100
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,320
That's even more enticing.

101
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
See that?

102
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,350
That big concrete building across the river.

103
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,880
My husband's doing time in there.

104
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,900
A prison.

105
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,340
Nope.

106
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,700
It's a detention center.

107
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,000
A detention center?

108
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
He's on death row.

109
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,550
I haven't seen his face in years.

110
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,280
He's refused all visits since he was sentenced.

111
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,360
Twenty thousand yen.

112
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,670
He killed two people.

113
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,050
And got the death penalty
for robbing someone of 27,080 yen.

114
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,830
Not worth it at all, huh?

115
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,660
He's just a guy with bad luck.

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,750
The death penalty for killing two people.

117
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,370
Then I should've been executed many times over.

118
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,680
Oh, stop.

119
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,030
Honey...

120
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,370
Why won't you see me?

121
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,990
♪ In the early morning, I'm all alone ♪

122
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,690
♪ Wandering by this seashore ♪

123
00:09:50,450 --> 00:10:02,020
♪ My heart can't help but recall the old days ♪

124
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,650
Miss, you know some old songs.

125
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,430
Well, my grandma raised me.

126
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,280
My parents abandoned me.

127
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,810
Hey, what's this song about?

128
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,270
Miss...

129
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,820
You must have had it rough.

130
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,450
Yeah, but stop it.

131
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,160
That's all in the past now.

132
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,790
Hey, mister.

133
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,680
That's gross! Don't blow your nose on my clothes!

134
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,460
(Sobbing)
Geez.

135
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
Oh, I should get to my shift at the bar.

136
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,040
Want me to give you a ride?
Really?

137
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,470
Yeah, and maybe I'll have another drink with you.

138
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,350
Yay!

139
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,660
Hey, Odajima.

140
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
Yes.

141
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,380
See you, Mr. President.

142
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,580
Live a long life.

143
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,310
You guys too.

144
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,120
Thanks for the beer.

145
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
Bye-bye.

146
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,030
You're quite the bargain.

147
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,020
What's that supposed to mean?

148
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,270
I mean that as a compliment.

149
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,090
Mama-san.

150
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,870
- I brought a customer!
- Huh?

151
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,520
Really?
Odajima.

152
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,280
Nice ass and boobs, right?

153
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,290
I'm not coming back tonight.

154
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,120
What are you doing?

155
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,370
Oh, I'm coming.

156
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,640
See ya, Odajima.

157
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,040
Odajima.

158
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,610
Hey.

159
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,370
Odajima.

160
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
It's so hot.

161
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,180
Odajima...

162
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,060
Let's go buy an air conditioner!

163
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,710
Where would we get the money for that?

164
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,330
Of course I know that.

165
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,910
You don't have to tell me.

166
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,850
So hot...

167
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,980
Sir.

168
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,370
Sir.

169
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,000
Sir.
Going up?

170
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Odajima.

171
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,890
It's Kataoka-san.

172
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,240
I heard he's only five years older than us.

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,820
But he's already the next in line to be underboss.

174
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,270
He's so cool.

175
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,750
- Sir.
- Yeah.

176
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,830
Yes, sir!

177
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,010
- Sir.
- Yeah.

178
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,870
- Sir.
- Yeah.

179
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,070
You're too loud.

180
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,430
You idiot.

181
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,140
But Kataoka-san talked to us.

182
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,870
Full of energy, aren't you, kid?

183
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,580
Go buy me a pack of smokes.

184
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,820
Yes, sir.

185
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,130
Keep the change.

186
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,490
Go get yourself some sushi.

187
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Thank you, sir.

188
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,250
How's this, Pompadour?

189
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,720
I look just like Kataoka-san, right?

190
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,790
It doesn't suit you at all.

191
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,700
One day, I'll be the kind of man
who can pull off this look.

192
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,170
The island I was born on...

193
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,820
was so small a child could walk
around the entire thing.

194
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,650
Everyone on the island knew each other.

195
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,170
Whether it was the cars,

196
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,250
the clothes,

197
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
or our homes, everything reeked of fish.

198
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,530
I spent every day looking out at the sea.

199
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,030
Is that so?

200
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,840
When I looked at the sea,

201
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,240
I felt like I could do anything.

202
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
I told myself,

203
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,840
one day I'd be like Kataoka-san
and make it big.

204
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,860
And then for my mom,

205
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,530
I'd build her a grand house.

206
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Is that so?

207
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
And then,

208
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,890
Plus me and...

209
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,860
you have to live with us too.

210
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,110
Me too?

211
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,680
Of course.

212
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,990
You're my family.

213
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,610
Just you wait and see.

214
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,180
Kataoka-san.

215
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,540
What took you so long?

216
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,510
I thought you weren't coming back tonight.

217
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,510
Yeah.

218
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,210
I was supposed to be out all night.

219
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,760
Did she run out on you?

220
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,970
Shut up. I let her go.

221
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,880
She had just taken off her clothes

222
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,460
when she started crying
and said doing this would let her husband down.

223
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,970
What was I supposed to do?

224
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,320
Since the fifth grade,

225
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,360
I've slept with over a thousand women.

226
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,210
But I've never forced anyone who wasn't willing.

227
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,120
So if I say no, does that not count?

228
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,810
If you truly didn't want it, I wouldn't force you.

229
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,160
Right here...

230
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,930
aren't you already biting down on me, refusing to let go?

231
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,860
You're really interesting.

232
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,300
You're always so sullen and quiet,

233
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,260
with that look like nothing in the world interests you.

234
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,060
But when it comes to this, you're unbelievably sexy.

235
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,460
That cold face of yours...

236
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,960
makes me want to pin you down

237
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,050
and take you completely...

238
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,180
ravage you until you're a mess.

239
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,470
Hey.

240
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,530
Um, why isn't it colored in?

241
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,920
Does it bother you?

242
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,020
When you get turned on,

243
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,890
your skin flushes,

244
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,520
and it makes the dragon tattoo
look like it's been colored in.

245
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,230
It's sexy.

246
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,390
Odajima.

247
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,710
You are my tool.

248
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,520
Kill him.

249
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,070
Kill him.

250
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,840
Hurry up and kill him.

251
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,990
Kill him!

252
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,210
Not yet.

253
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
There's still...

254
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,340
something I need to know.

255
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,050
Asahi.

256
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,200
Don't you die here.

257
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,560
Aren't we going to make it to the top?

258
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Together, we're going to...

259
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Why?

260
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,070
You left me behind.

261
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
Why isn't he dead yet?

262
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,090
Director...

263
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,800
It wasn't Dad.

264
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,080
It was that bastard Kataoka.

265
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,280
That guy Odajima, how many days
does he need to take care of one person?

266
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,470
If we don't find another way, this will never end.

267
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,970
We can't make too much of a scene over there either.

268
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,500
Don't let anyone in the family know.

269
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,290
That Kataoka guy is pretty popular, isn't he?

270
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,370
For a worthless piece of trash who came from the streets.

271
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,400
He's a frivolous guy.

272
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,410
So the younger guys probably find him approachable.

273
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,800
Hey, Kumakura.

274
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:40,750
Yes.

275
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,430
You know his background, don't you?

276
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,410
Well...

277
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,830
There's nothing about him that
would be of any concern to you, Director.

278
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,590
I'm going to Akasaka. Get the car ready.

279
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,360
Yes, sir.

280
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,890
And get me three women.

281
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,570
Yes, sir.

282
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,590
Fourth Generation.

283
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,570
This is a critical time for the family.

284
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,770
I urge you to reconsider.

285
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,340
Hey.

286
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,700
- Please hurry.
- What's the rush all of a sudden?

287
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,240
Where is it you want to go?

288
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,950
We're going to take a boat.

289
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Huh?

290
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,350
We're on the run.

291
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,280
Weren't you the one saying we shouldn't take any detours?

292
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,020
- There's something I want to show you.
- And what's that?

293
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
This way, please.

294
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,530
You really don't listen sometimes, do you?

295
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,820
What about the car?

296
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,110
We don't need it anymore.

297
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,150
Huh?

298
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,620
It's an island so small

299
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,310
even a child could walk around the whole thing.

300
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
That's what I heard.

301
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,520
(Next Episode)
What a godforsaken island.

302
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Hey.

303
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,900
What are you doing?

304
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,240
Please, offer some incense for him.

305
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,650
He used to be one of our family.

306
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,240
And you killed him.

307
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,740
You would know if you were there, wouldn't you?

308
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,800
You're pretty good at putting on an act.

309
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,990
That guy took everything that was mine.

310
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,210
I... should never have been born.

311
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,160
This is the first time I've ever heard

312
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,600
you talk about yourself.

313
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,630
Don't tell me you're starting to catch feelings.

314
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,810
No one knows...

315
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,850
You...

316
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,780
were my first.
