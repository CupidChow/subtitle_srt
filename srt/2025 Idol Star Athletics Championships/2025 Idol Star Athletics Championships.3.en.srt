1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,840
(Goyang Gym)

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,510
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,950
The dancesport event.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,110
(The audience was fired up
during the dancesport event.)

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,020
(Performing challenging moves
worthy of a dancing queen,)

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,790
(XIAOTING earned 26.5 points
out of 30 to take 1st place.)

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,260
(Starting
with a charismatic expression...)

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,830
(and nailing difficult moves,)

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,730
(E.JI earned 25.8 points out of 30,
placing a close 2nd.)

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,140
- XIAOTING remains...
- Yes.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,000
- on the throne.
- Yes.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,570
The next dancer...

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,710
is ready to show
a completely different side.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,480
- Is that so?
- Are you ready for that?

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,220
Here comes the third player in dancesport.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,150
JiYeon of tripleS.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,420
(JiYeon of tripleS, Partner: Kim Yun Ho)

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,120
- Those pink flowers...
- Yes.

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,690
suit her image very well.

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,390
- It's the perfect touch to the dress.
- Yes.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,260
She took third place last year.

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,970
She majored in ballet
for over ten years...

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,570
and was a strong favorite to win,

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,040
- but a small technical mistake...
- Yes.

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,270
- cost her the gold medal.
- Oh, no.

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,270
It means...

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,180
- she's determined to win today.
- Yes.

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,110
JiYeon said...

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,480
- Okay.
- she'd do anything to take first place.

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,380
She chose experimental, powerful music...

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,580
- rarely used in dancesport.
- She chose it herself.

32
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,650
She's going for gold...

33
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,020
with a new routine
stripped of ballet influences.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,860
A ballerina who doesn't dance ballet.

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,620
- Yes.
- I can't imagine what it'll be like.

36
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,030
What should we pay attention to the most,
Commentator Park?

37
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,560
Her last performance...

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,230
emphasized elegance and grace,

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,900
but this time, she's going for a new look,

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,000
which is sharp and energetic.

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,970
How different will it be?

42
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,480
We'll now watch the third performance
from JiYeon from tripleS.

43
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,780
(JiYeon from tripleS:
Samba and Cha Cha Cha)

44
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,380
- All right.
- It's "Dopamine."

45
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,550
It's a new challenge.

46
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,720
It...

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
is a challenge for her...

48
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,190
to perform dancesport to this music.

49
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,420
- They made a mistake.
- They made a small mistake.

50
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,230
- Did they make a mistake?
- Yes, but it's fine.

51
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,230
- It's a minor mistake. It's okay.
- It's okay. They can make up for it.

52
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,430
They should make up for it.

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,030
It's all right.

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,530
They're still on beat. It's fine.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
The key to samba is the bounce.

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,640
It's all about bending
and straightening the knees...

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,710
to the rhythm.

58
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,280
- That's the most important.
- Yes.

59
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,310
That's a stationary samba walk.

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,820
The way she puts her heart...

61
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,580
- into each movement is so beautiful.
- Yes.

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,620
- That's the basic Botafogo.
- Yes.

63
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,130
What's more important in dancesport...

64
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,290
is eye contact,
the way they look at each other.

65
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,930
Then the theme will change.

66
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,360
- The music has changed.
- Yes.

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,030
It's "Uptown Funk."

68
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,830
It's sung by Bruno Mars.

69
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,600
Side by side again.

70
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,740
Even her expression turned more
"cha-cha-like."

71
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,040
- She expresses the rhythm of the music...
- Charismatic.

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,480
- so well through her expressions.
- Yes.

73
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
- Cuban breaks. She's doing the wave.
- Oh, my.

74
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,020
That's the lock step.

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,360
The step she's doing now
is the cha cha cha.

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,130
It's a dance
where both feet move forward...

77
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,930
to the rhythm of the music...

78
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,230
- like cha-cha-cha.
- Yes.

79
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,430
- Oh, my.
- A lunge.

80
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,640
A lift again.

81
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,540
A rotational lift.

82
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,010
(In the New York step,)

83
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,680
The New York step.

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,840
(dancers hold hands and move their steps
in the same direction.)

85
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,580
Cuban breaks.

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
A ronde.

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,620
Back to the ronde.

88
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,720
Look at the male dancer's move.

89
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,090
(I love you, Ji Seo Yeon.)

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,860
Look at the male dancer's move.

91
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,500
(They executed the challenging move
with powerful energy.)

92
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,230
Nice. She's on beat.

93
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,470
You're right.

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,810
Nice. That was clean.

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,880
It's coming to an end.

96
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,020
Okay.

97
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,020
Another rotational lift.

98
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,870
All right.
Her steps were precisely on the beat.

99
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,810
Her performance is nearing the end.

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,080
There's the lunge.
That's the fan position.

101
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,150
She's executing many challenging moves.

102
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,690
Their partnership is excellent.

103
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,850
The difficulty level is quite high.

104
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,520
- Yes. The difficulty is high.
- All right. It's over.

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,620
(Precise movements and good energy
shone through in her performance.)

106
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,690
Great.

107
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,430
(Precise movements and good energy
shone through in her performance.)

108
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,730
- Her ending pose was solid.
- You were excellent!

109
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

110
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,600
Unfortunately, there were some errors...

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,070
because the difficulty level
was quite high.

112
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,830
- Yes.
- The choreography was fairly advanced.

113
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,200
- She stayed strong until the end.
- Yes.

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,510
I'd like to give her props
for executing her performance all the way.

115
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,410
- I agree.
- That's no easy feat.

116
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,510
- You're right.
- Right.

117
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,510
All right.

118
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,940
- She's channeling her emotions.
- She's channeling them.

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,750
She approached him
while conveying her emotions.

120
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,580
There's the lift.

121
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,850
It was right here.

122
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,350
She was supposed to gain momentum
from here and then...

123
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,150
Her feet got tangled with his.

124
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,790
They got tangled with his.

125
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,490
Okay. He lifted her up with his hands
after the knee action.

126
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,730
That's a difficult one to pull off.

127
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,330
You can't pull this off...

128
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,700
- Right.
- if your teamwork is even a little off.

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,970
Great timing.
I loved how she expressed herself here.

130
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,770
- Look at her facial expression.
- An excellent facial expression.

131
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,000
- She reminds me of Kim Yuna.
- Right.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,270
She exceptionally showcased
the charm of cha cha cha.

133
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,010
Great job.

134
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,410
(Will she be able to score
higher than 26.5 points?)

135
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,210
That was great. Nicely done.

136
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,740
- It's all right. Yes.
- They're sitting side by side.

137
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,110
- They did an amazing job.
- Their score will be revealed.

138
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,610
I bet they're nervous.

139
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,120
- They must be curious about their score.
- Right.

140
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,620
Yes. I wonder what their score will be.

141
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,220
(JiYeon of tripleS: 17.9 points)

142
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,650
- Nice job.
- It's 17.9 points.

143
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,060
- Nice try.
- As expected,

144
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,420
- the judges are very objective.
- Great job.

145
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,730
One can always learn
and grow more through one's mistakes.

146
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,200
- Don't you agree?
- I agree.

147
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,830
Here comes the fourth player
in dancesport.

148
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,370
NOVA of X:IN.

149
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,870
(NOVA of X:IN, Partner Kim Tae Hwan)

150
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,970
It's NOVA.

151
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,070
- My gosh. Look at her.
- Oh, my.

152
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,510
You know what?
Let me tell you a bit about her.

153
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

154
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,610
She's perceived as the strongest threat
to all the other dancers.

155
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,610
- Is that so?
- Yes.

156
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,580
- She's competing for the first time.
- Oh, my.

157
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,180
She comes with a splendid resume.

158
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,720
She took dancesport lessons
since she was four years old.

159
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,420
She's been dancing for 15 years now.

160
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,620
- She's a veteran dancer.
- Since four?

161
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,690
- Yes. What stands out is that...
- My gosh.

162
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,460
she specialized in Latin dance.

163
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,530
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

164
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,160
I observed her in the studio
while working on my choreography.

165
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Yes.

166
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,460
Let's just watch her.

167
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,630
She started taking dancesport lessons
at the age of four.

168
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,040
Even before making her debut,

169
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
being on our show had been her dream.

170
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,140
Let's watch the performance
by NOVA of X:IN.

171
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,880
(NOVA of X:IN: Samba and Cha Cha Cha)

172
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,380
The samba music is playing.

173
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Her performance has begun.

174
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,620
Check out her facial expressions.
They already look great.

175
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,820
- This feels like we're in a jungle.
- Yes.

176
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,230
It's like we're in the middle of a jungle.

177
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,760
Her spins are top-notch.

178
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,030
They are so neat, aren't they?

179
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,530
Oh, my gosh!

180
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,740
(Flinching)

181
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,910
Oh, my gosh!

182
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,580
There go the samba rolls.

183
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,180
Samba rolls are
a difficult technique to execute.

184
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,550
- They're so hard!
- Indeed.

185
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,420
There's a promenade pivot.

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,820
(Their eyes follow NOVA's movements.)

187
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,090
Check out her techniques.

188
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,590
- She's like a professional dancer.
- She is.

189
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,060
There are the scissors steps.

190
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,230
(Scissors steps: A technique that
resembles extended scissors)

191
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,500
(Scissors steps: A technique that
resembles extended scissors)

192
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,100
There's one more. That's a double turn.

193
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,830
I'm in awe.

194
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,310
Check out her skills.

195
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,380
Her pivot is exceptional.
Her spins are on another level.

196
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,450
All right. Shake it, and shimmy.

197
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,480
(Shimmy: A movement where dancers
shake their shoulders or upper body)

198
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,620
I'm digging her vibe.

199
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,220
She's doing a perfect job so far.

200
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,620
All right.

201
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,320
With the way he's leading her,
they look like real partners.

202
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Right.

203
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,890
I think they can even participate
in the Blackpool Dance Festival.

204
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,430
- Yes, they can totally qualify.
- Yes.

205
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,730
(Nervous)

206
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,200
Look how she's utilizing her muscles.
Excellent.

207
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,040
How can she be so flexible?

208
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh, my gosh.

209
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,780
Look how she's holding his hands
to follow his lead.

210
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,210
- Gosh, his leadership is precise.
- This is great.

211
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,810
And she's following perfectly.

212
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,790
(Impressed)

213
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,520
(Impressed)

214
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,260
That was the transition.

215
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,700
They're moving into cha cha cha.

216
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,770
A dress change.

217
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,630
Look at her moves.

218
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,740
Did you just see
the way she moved her toes?

219
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,800
- As expected.
- She's enjoying the stage...

220
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,170
like a professional
competing in a contest.

221
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,310
She's a professional.

222
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,310
- NOVA.
- All right. There go the lock steps.

223
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,050
She's in control of her movements
that she can enjoy the music.

224
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,460
Her timing and movements are just spot on.

225
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,990
- I have nothing to say right now.
- Indeed.

226
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,360
She's executing cha cha cha perfectly.

227
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,330
That's another technique right there.

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,540
- Check it.
- Seriously.

229
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,410
- There's a series of advanced techniques.
- Yes.

230
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,070
One after another.

231
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,380
All right, New York Action.

232
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,950
New York!

233
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,780
(New York Step: Partners execute
symmetric steps while holding hands.)

234
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,460
They're just having fun.

235
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Yes.

236
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,860
I have nothing to explain to you.

237
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,470
Brava!

238
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,040
XIAOTING ought to be nervous.

239
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,670
- Her performance could definitely...
- Oh, my.

240
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,310
- challenge the throne.
- Yes.

241
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,040
She's a new star of dancesport.

242
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,610
I can't wait to check her score.

243
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,680
She was indeed a supernova.

244
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,710
- Yes.
- Indeed.

245
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,350
XIAOTING in the Kiss and Cry Zone...

246
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,920
seems a bit nervous now.

247
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,990
- The way she expressed her emotions...
- Yes.

248
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,020
- was perfect with the theme.
- Right.

249
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,190
Watch this lift.
It's one of the hardest ones.

250
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,260
(Easily pulling off an advanced lift)

251
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,360
She's incredibly flexible.

252
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,700
- You know what?
- And their teamwork must be spot on too.

253
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,400
She has to be able to hold the pose
in the air too.

254
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Indeed.

255
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,740
- She still makes it look easy...
- You know?

256
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,640
- while executing such powerful moves.
- Yes.

257
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
It was this part here.

258
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,540
(Her power and flexibility stood out
with this pose.)

259
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,980
My gosh. Her performance was
full of advanced techniques.

260
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,580
- Seriously.
- This was really cool.

261
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,880
What an incredible performance.

262
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,050
(Shy)

263
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,750
- XIAOTING is nervous.
- She's nervous.

264
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,390
- XIAOTING is nervous.
- I can't wait.

265
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,860
Let's see if XIAOTING can...

266
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,060
- I can't wait to see her score.
- keep her throne.

267
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,360
(What will NOVA score out of 30 points?)

268
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,860
(NOVA of X:IN: 29.3 points)

269
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,770
(Partnership: 6, Stage composition: 5.3,
Technique: 6, Accuracy: 6, Proficiency: 6)

270
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,440
(Amazed)

271
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,270
(Clapping)

272
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,940
- NOVA of X:IN.
- Yes.

273
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,140
- NOVA of X:IN received...
- Oh, my!

274
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,880
- NOVA.
- NOVA of X:IN...

275
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,050
scored higher than XIAOTING
who was in first place...

276
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,620
- with the score, 26.5 points.
- Yes.

277
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,150
- The difference was 2.8 points.
- Her score was higher by 2.8 points.

278
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,590
So that puts her in first place.

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,360
NOVA of X:IN.

280
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,320
Please take the throne.

281
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,930
(It's the moment
a new dancer will claim the throne.)

282
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,370
In the history
of Idol Star Athletics Championships,

283
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,600
this is the highest score for dancesport.

284
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
- Yes.
- With the 0.1-point difference,

285
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,070
she set a new record!

286
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,210
Congratulations.

287
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,810
<i>Supernova</i>

288
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,210
Here's my take on her score.

289
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,550
Because she included
many bold techniques in her performance,

290
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,850
the judges gave her a high score.

291
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,250
Here comes the fifth player in dancesport.

292
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,050
JULIE of KISS OF LIFE.

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,030
The fifth dancer is entering now.

294
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,430
Will she be the one
to put a stop to NOVA's dominance?

295
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
This is JULIE of KISS OF LIFE.

296
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,270
Here's how I'd like to describe her.

297
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,800
- Considering the atmosphere, her outfit,
- Okay.

298
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,640
- the energy, and her attitude,
- Yes.

299
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,710
JULIE is definitely in the zone.

300
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,210
- Is that so?
- That's how I'd like to describe her.

301
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,440
She must feel like
a professional right now.

302
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,650
- Is that so?
- Yes.

303
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,250
She did ballet for ten years in Hawaii.

304
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,420
- That's what we know of her.
- I see.

305
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,050
I believe she could be a new dark horse.

306
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,590
In my opinion,
she's probably the most flexible dancer...

307
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,390
- of all the competing dancers.
- Yes.

308
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,530
Their choreography will depict
the love and conflict between two lovers.

309
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,630
Let's pay attention to their choreography.

310
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

311
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,330
This is the fifth performance.

312
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's watch the performance
by JULIE of KISS OF LIFE.

313
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,870
(JULIE of KISS OF LIFE: Rumba and Samba)

314
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,080
("Shallow,"
the soundtrack of "A Star Is Born")

315
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,810
They're starting off with rumba.

316
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,550
They're a couple in love.
And he will lead.

317
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,220
It's a slow rumba counted in 4-4.

318
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,890
Rumba usually begins on a slow tempo
like the one you're listening to now.

319
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,890
- Did you see her backbending?
- Yes.

320
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,460
- Oh, my gosh.
- After the attitude,

321
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,630
he lifted her.

322
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,500
All right.
This is the strength of Kim Min Je.

323
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,170
He's an excellent partner
in leading the female dancers.

324
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,500
He's a smart dancer.

325
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,700
- Yes.
- He's so experienced.

326
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,770
JULIE is doing a great job
following his lead.

327
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,210
She was very expressive with her face
with the hip movement.

328
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,410
A lift with the fan position.

329
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,610
There's the leg action.

330
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,510
Her facial expressions are incredible.

331
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,650
She's the perfect dancer for rumba.

332
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,520
You know what? Anything could happen
with the final scores now.

333
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,690
She's splendid.

334
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,760
Her performance has a very different vibe.

335
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,860
- Indeed.
- Yes.

336
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,930
(Lift: A technique where the dancer's feet
don't touch the floor for over 2 beats)

337
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,530
A solid lift.

338
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,300
(Han JULIE)

339
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,540
A solid lift.

340
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,080
My gosh. She's a professional too!

341
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,450
This is anyone's game now.

342
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,450
She could be a professional too.

343
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,620
All right. She did a lunge
after the open arm action.

344
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,250
Did you see her turn just now?

345
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,490
I did.

346
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,690
Did you see her emotions?

347
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,730
What a surprise.

348
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,870
This is the best rumba performance.

349
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,040
- Just now...
- The pose!

350
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,140
(Han JULIE)

351
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,510
(Transitioning into samba from rumba
with the dress change)

352
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,980
She's transitioning into samba.

353
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,780
There's a shift in their theme.

354
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,380
JULIE!

355
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,020
The backhold action.

356
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,090
- What a confident facial expression.
- That was so Latin.

357
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,960
Her face screams,
"I've already mastered this."

358
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,560
She's the queen of Latin dances.

359
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
Correct!

360
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

361
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,470
Her leg position was excellent.

362
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,110
A lunge.

363
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,540
Shake it.

364
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,510
You know what? She's a professional too.

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,070
I believe she might be the best dancer
to represent dancesport.

366
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,670
She perfected the bounce in samba.

367
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,370
I love the ending!

368
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,410
(JULIE showcased the charm of samba well.)

369
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,540
Brava!

370
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,280
Given the performance she just gave us,
NOVA can't lower her guard yet.

371
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,320
This could be anyone's game now.

372
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,880
If I were the judge,
I'd have such a hard time.

373
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,490
The dancesport rounds...

374
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,390
of 2025 Idol Star Athletics Championships
are no joke.

375
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,390
It's one of the best years yet.

376
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,060
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I want to learn dancesport.

377
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,160
Please come whenever
and take some lessons.

378
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Which one would you like to learn?
Rumba or samba?

379
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,630
I think I'm hooked on rumba now.

380
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,960
- Rumba?
- Rumba is great.

381
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,030
Rumba is great.

382
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,770
Her ten-year training
as a ballet dancer...

383
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,770
definitely came in handy here.

384
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,700
Totally. Let's check her clips again.

385
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,540
She spun around
and then there was the lift.

386
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,110
It was very stable.

387
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,480
Look how calm she was.

388
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,980
- She fully trusted him.
- Yes.

389
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,780
Kim Min Je's lift was excellent.

390
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,450
- I loved this part.
- Yes.

391
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,320
- Look at her facial expression.
- It was incredible.

392
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,350
(Her acting stood out.)

393
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,490
How could she be so expressive?

394
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,160
It seems JULIE gave us a performance
with her own story behind it.

395
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,520
She did an excellent job interpreting it.

396
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,830
But her skills were perfect too.

397
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,790
This choreography is also quite advanced.

398
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,800
- This was a very difficult one.
- Yes.

399
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,730
Look how confident she is.

400
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,240
She captured the essence
of the Latin dance perfectly.

401
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,400
Brava.

402
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,410
(Impressed)

403
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,040
I can't wait to see her score.

404
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,710
All right.

405
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,880
- What's JULIE's score?
- All right.

406
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,910
Thirty is the perfect score.

407
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,980
(What will she score out of 30 points?)

408
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,520
NOVA is nervous now.

409
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,420
Will there be a new queen on the throne?

410
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,420
What a surprise.

411
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,220
(JULIE of KISS OF LIFE: 21.1 points)

412
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
(Partnership: 4.3,
Stage composition: 4.6,)

413
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,260
(Technique: 3.6,
Accuracy: 4, Proficiency: 4.6)

414
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,030
Her score is 21.1 points.

415
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,960
She's in fourth place now.

416
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,030
How should we interpret this?

417
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,160
- Let me share my opinion.
- Okay.

418
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,430
The first half of the performance
was rumba.

419
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,640
- Yes.
- The most important technique of rumba...

420
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,040
- Yes.
- is the footwork.

421
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,070
- Okay.
- Footwork requires bending.

422
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,740
- It means you must bend your knees a lot.
- Yes.

423
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,740
So the judges
might have deducted points...

424
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,150
- I see.
- thinking her legs aren't straight.

425
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,610
- The judges are very objective.
- Yes.

426
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,180
- They are.
- Yes.

427
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,050
It's more than a performance
from a Chuseok holiday special.

428
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,750
They must consider this to be
an international competition...

429
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,450
- for dancesport.
- Yes.

430
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,290
Here comes the sixth player in dancesport.

431
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,590
NANA of woo!ah!

432
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,660
It's NANA of woo!ah!

433
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,730
(NANA of woo!ah!, Partner: Kim Min)

434
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,500
- Last year, she won second place...
- Yes.

435
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,100
with the theme for "The Greatest Showman."

436
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,800
- Yes.
- She's another strong participant.

437
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,910
She's determined
to win the gold medal this year.

438
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,270
She's so cool. Once again, she picked...

439
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,080
a soundtrack for a movie.

440
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,910
It's the soundtrack
of "KPop Demon Hunters."

441
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,480
- That's right.
- It's a famous song.

442
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,950
(Singing)

443
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,550
That's the one. It's "Golden."

444
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,180
(We're going to be golden)

445
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,920
(The hunters of 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships show up.)

446
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,790
- All right. This kind of song...
- Yes.

447
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,130
isn't common in dancesport.

448
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,300
It's a very unique song for this.
I can't wait to see it.

449
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,630
We'll now watch...

450
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,230
the performance by NANA of woo!ah!

451
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,940
(NANA of woo!ah!:
Paso Doble and Cha Cha Cha)

452
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,840
("River" by Bishop Briggs)

453
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,670
Looking at her long skirt,

454
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,180
she's starting off with paso doble.

455
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,510
Correct. She'll transition
from paso doble to cha cha cha.

456
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,310
That's her concept.

457
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,050
All right.

458
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,590
NANA is determined...

459
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,860
- to win this year.
- She picked the right music...

460
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,130
for the concept of her movements.

461
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,190
She's portraying a girl...

462
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,900
- who's persecuted by the world.
- Yes.

463
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,770
She's doing an excellent job
of expressing her emotions as expected.

464
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,980
He held her...

465
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,180
and then they did a twist turn.

466
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,350
There's another lift.

467
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,690
A chasse cape.

468
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,290
All right.

469
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,540
(Go for it, NANA!)

470
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,870
There will be a dress change.

471
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,210
I just know the song will suit her well.

472
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,710
It's "KPop Demon Hunters."

473
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,210
(A dress change)

474
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,410
You know what? This dance move...

475
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,880
suits the song perfectly.

476
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,180
- It's perfect.
- Yes.

477
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,480
- This is cha cha cha.
- Yes.

478
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,690
Who knew this song would be perfect
for cha cha cha?

479
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,190
- She's wearing a dress with spangles.
- Yes.

480
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,190
The spangles on her dress
will accentuate her movements.

481
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,230
She chose a great outfit for this.

482
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,230
She did.

483
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,130
The dress makes her movements look bigger.

484
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,160
Yes.

485
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,010
Her facial expressions are great.

486
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,910
The song, "Golden," is perfect
for cha cha cha.

487
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,080
- She's proving it with her dance.
- Shake it.

488
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
Great. Shimmy.

489
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,350
- Here comes the highlight.
- Here it goes.

490
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,220
(Rock steps: Steps where dancers
walk lightly as if trotting)

491
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,620
Cha cha cha, rock steps.

492
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,890
What a nice turn.

493
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,460
- This is a cha cha cha song.
- Yes, indeed.

494
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,060
- The beats are on point.
- Gosh.

495
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,000
Two, three.

496
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,640
All right. Slow down.

497
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,340
Basic steps after a body roll.

498
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,840
A lunge.

499
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,610
This part must be physically exhausting.

500
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,910
- But her facial expression is great.
- All right.

501
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,010
Rolling off the arm.

502
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,220
Here comes the ending.

503
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,490
There it is.

504
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,250
(Impressive)

505
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,460
Great.

506
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,360
So great. She was so elegant.

507
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,590
- Nicely done.
- NANA was so cool.

508
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,900
A body roll under his arm.

509
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,130
Her foot change was great too.

510
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,600
(NANA's facial expressions
were exceptionally good.)

511
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,070
What a nice, expressive face.

512
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,110
- A turn.
- Her turn was great.

513
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,640
Her performance left us amazed.

514
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
- How amazing.
- How amazing.

515
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,850
- NANA was amazing.
- Amazing.

516
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,650
She's so good.

517
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,180
- I loved this part.
- What a neat ending.

518
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,750
(A stunning ending
with an advanced technique)

519
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,150
- That was excellent.
- This is liberating.

520
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,320
I'm sure she's hoping
she'd receive a high score.

521
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,590
- All right.
- NANA.

522
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,560
- Good work.
- Good work.

523
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,860
- The judges are...
- Great job!

524
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,830
- definitely objective.
- Yes, they are.

525
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,770
- She's in 5th grade with 18.1 points.
- Yes.

526
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,600
- Supernova NOVA is in first place.
- Well done!

527
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,210
(NOVA still sits at the throne
in 1st place.)

528
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,910
- She just has one more performance to go.
- It's the last performance.

529
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,540
- Yes.
- She can win first place then.

530
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,510
But I hear that
she is the real dark horse.

531
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,950
Please look forward to it.

532
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,520
Here comes the last player in dancesport.

533
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,150
CHANELLE MOON of FIFTY FIFTY.

534
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,860
This handsome yet beautiful idol
has excellent dance skills.

535
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,290
It's CHANELLE MOON of FIFTY FIFTY.

536
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,400
- CHANELLE MOON recently did...
- Yes.

537
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,230
the Pookie Challenge.

538
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,870
- Yes.
- And so many people loved it.

539
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,040
(Go for it!)

540
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,240
I wonder how she prepared for this.

541
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,170
- Here's what I've heard.
- Yes.

542
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,040
- She's got an athletic body.
- Oh, my gosh.

543
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,380
Her sense of rhythm is extraordinary.

544
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,450
Her movements will be smooth
and her acting will be spot on.

545
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,220
- You can look forward to that.
- Okay.

546
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,320
Her performance will be
with old Latin pop.

547
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,550
- It's also called the antique pop.
- Antique pop.

548
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,590
Besides, she was born in the US.

549
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,020
So she's used to Latin pop.

550
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,760
- Great.
- Her acting will probably be...

551
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,490
on another level
from that of other dancers.

552
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,590
- Great.
- Okay.

553
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,060
This handsome yet beautiful idol
has excellent dance skills.

554
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,430
This is CHANELLE MOON of FIFTY FIFTY.

555
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,500
(CHANELLE MOON of FIFTY FIFTY:
Samba and Jive)

556
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,570
She'll transition from samba to jive.

557
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,750
- CHANELLE MOON.
- What's this?

558
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,280
Hold on.
I think this ought to keep NOVA on edge.

559
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,650
Her concept is so different
from other dancers'.

560
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,050
(A bold way of changing her costume)

561
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,420
Samba.

562
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,790
- I haven't heard this song in ages.
- Oh, my gosh.

563
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,590
- It's party time.
- Yes.

564
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,000
It's a very famous samba song.

565
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,740
Samba is a fast dance in quarter time.

566
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,470
(The samba bounce is a vertical movement
created by the flexing of the knees.)

567
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,410
Samba is all about the bounce.

568
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,510
- She brings out its charm perfectly.
- Yes.

569
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,320
The fans are a nice touch too.

570
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,490
They're in the promenade position.

571
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,320
A pivot.

572
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,760
- That's a difficult move.
- Yes.

573
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,300
- Okay. Bounce action.
- Bounce.

574
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,040
After a spin and a pivot,

575
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,540
- they're back to the hold position.
- Yes.

576
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,940
Inside promenade run. Shake.

577
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,540
- Oh, gosh.
- Perfect.

578
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,610
- It's perfect.
- The hold.

579
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,250
- That's hard.
- The samba roll.

580
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,250
- It's really hard.
- It's one of the hardest samba moves.

581
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,820
- Is it?
- It's one of the hardest moves.

582
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,490
That move allows you to show flexibility.

583
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,430
- I wonder how it'll change from samba.
- Yes.

584
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,860
- They're enjoying it.
- They're about to switch...

585
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,400
from samba to another genre. A turn.

586
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,100
- She didn't make any mistakes!
- Okay.

587
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,570
- She's doing great.
- Shake it.

588
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,440
Cruzado walk. A step.

589
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,440
- Look at her expression. Amazing.
- Okay.

590
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,950
NOVA is shaking.

591
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,820
They've started the stationary samba walk.

592
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,350
- Yes.
- I love the bounce.

593
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,290
- Oh, my gosh.
- My gosh.

594
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,320
- Oh, my gosh.
- My gosh.

595
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,530
And the finish!

596
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,660
(The atmosphere heated up
with their masterpiece performance.)

597
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,730
It's an old jive classic.

598
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,330
They switched to jive now.

599
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,800
Side by side.

600
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,140
It's been a long time.

601
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,810
I like the rhythm.

602
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,310
- This is jive.
- Here they change things up.

603
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,980
Her expressions
perfectly embody the mood of jive.

604
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,010
I like the foot action.

605
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,210
This song is a classic.

606
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,020
Perfect hand movements. So clean.

607
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,020
Nice turns.

608
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,650
The wave action.

609
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,420
- Okay.
- A lunge.

610
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,830
- Yes.
- Jive is such an exciting dance.

611
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,760
It's the fastest in Latin dance.

612
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,100
<i>Rolling</i>

613
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,640
- Jive is physically demanding.
- Right.

614
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,540
- But she's doing so well.
- Yes.

615
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,910
Until the end...

616
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,180
Okay. The finish!

617
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,320
Nice.

618
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,780
(Powerful)

619
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,690
- That was cool. Jive.
- CHANELLE MOON.

620
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,090
That was nice.

621
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,330
- It really was a masterpiece.
- Yes.

622
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,490
- Oh, my.
- It was a masterpiece.

623
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,230
It was powerful...

624
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,360
with big, dynamic movements.

625
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

626
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,740
NOVA looks a bit nervous.

627
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,970
True to her name, CHANELLE MOON
delivered a performance of pure class.

628
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,410
The theme she showed with the fans...

629
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,110
- suited samba so well.
- Right.

630
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,310
- I loved her detailed hip movements.
- It was nice. Yes.

631
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,780
You need great teamwork
for this kind of lift.

632
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,520
A lift by the male dancer doesn't
automatically mean the female dancer...

633
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,150
- will be lifted smoothly.
- Right.

634
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,850
It was a nice kick ball change.

635
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,790
- Yes. The hand movements here...
- Yes.

636
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,160
were so nice.

637
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,400
What are their scores?

638
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
(Will she be able to beat NOVA's score?)

639
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,300
There's clear tension between the two.

640
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,400
(CHANELLE MOON, win the gold medal.)

641
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,800
FIFTY FIFTY. Let's see.

642
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,570
How many points will she get out of 30?

643
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,470
NOVA is sitting on the throne,
looking nervous.

644
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,540
In dancesport,

645
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,180
no one can ever predict...

646
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,350
what the score will be
after a performance.

647
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,650
- That's true.
- Yes.

648
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,820
Will there be a plot twist?

649
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,520
Thanks for creating
this beautiful performance together.

650
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,020
- They appreciate each other's hard work.
- They worked hard.

651
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,390
(CHANELLE MOON of FIFTY FIFTY:
19.8 points)

652
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,030
The judges are quite strict.

653
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,200
NOVA is this year's winner.

654
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,770
Congratulations.

655
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,240
(NOVA of X:IN wins the gold medal
in the 2025 dancesport event.)

656
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,070
(The members of X:IN came
to congratulate NOVA, the winner.)

657
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,610
(NOVA, congratulations on your win.)

658
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,210
- Look at this. It's you.
- What's this?

659
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,610
Show it to the camera.

660
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,450
(The 1st place's signature song ceremony)

661
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,760
I've been wanting to do dancesport
in Idol Star Athletics Championships...

662
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,330
for a long time.

663
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,070
Even before coming to Korea,

664
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,370
I wanted to perform here.

665
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,870
I was so happy
that X:IN could be part of the show.

666
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,370
Feeling so happy,
I worked hard to prepare...

667
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,140
and truly enjoyed the performance.

668
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,480
Thank you.

669
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,580
I appreciate your hard work.

670
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,250
(The arena is on fire with their passion.)

671
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,720
Isn't it a bit hot here?

672
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,120
It's really hot.

673
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,030
- Is it refreshing?
- This is good when it's hot.

674
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,360
- Is it refreshing?
- Yes, it's so refreshing.

675
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,370
You got this!

676
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,500
Yes.

677
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,900
(Goyang Gym)

678
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,310
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

679
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,210
Now, we move on to the much-awaited...

680
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,410
mixed team pistol shooting event.

681
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,380
How does this event work?

682
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,090
The mixed team event features
four shooters per team,

683
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,190
two men and two women,

684
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,520
representing their companies.

685
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,430
Each team fires 20 shots in total,

686
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,900
all within 50 seconds.

687
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,370
Now, let's take a look at the bracket...

688
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,040
to see how the teams are matched up.

689
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,240
WAKEONE, SM,

690
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,540
and STARSHIP. I see familiar names.

691
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,510
Is there a company called Rookies, though?

692
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,480
- It's a very special combination...
- Okay.

693
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,820
you can only see...

694
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,620
in 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

695
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,190
- Among the idols who debuted this year,
- Yes.

696
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,190
we've brought together raw talents...

697
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,330
to create the new Rookies team.

698
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,700
I can't wait to see their shooting skills.

699
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,830
But tough opponents are waiting for them.

700
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,840
With every team fighting
for their company's honor...

701
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,310
and packed with ace members,
like the Avengers,

702
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,810
- it's going to be tough.
- Right.

703
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,150
Which team will claim the title
of "shooting powerhouse?"

704
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,380
Please watch with us.

705
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,680
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

706
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,020
The mixed team pistol shooting event.

707
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,550
The first semifinal match...

708
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,960
is between WAKEONE and SM.

709
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
All members of WAKEONE...

710
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,260
have never participated
in a shooting event.

711
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,330
The team features Kim Ji Woong
and Sung Han Bin of ZEROBASEONE...

712
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,470
and BANG JEEMIN and CHOI JUNG EUN of izna.

713
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,370
On the other hand,

714
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,810
- Team SM features some familiar faces.
- Yes.

715
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,110
WON BIN of RIIZE,

716
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,480
- who scored 9.6 in the men’s team event,
- Yes.

717
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,780
and SION of NCT WISH,

718
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,520
who consistently hit high scores,
have returned.

719
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,620
Joining them are two new members,

720
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,760
YUHA and A-NA...

721
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,460
from Hearts2Hearts.

722
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,890
- A slogan for the new team is important.
- Yes.

723
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,430
Have the members greeted each other
and come up with a slogan?

724
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,300
Let's check it out
with our reporter Kim Chae Hyun.

725
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,800
Yes. This is Kim Chae Hyun.

726
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,270
The mixed team pistol shooting event
is around the corner.

727
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,940
Please shout your team slogan
and show us your fighting spirit.

728
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,040
Two, three.

729
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,240
ZEROSE.

730
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,150
naya. Right in your heart.

731
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,510
- Bang!
- Bang!

732
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,120
Bang!

733
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,420
Team SM, it's your turn.

734
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,020
Okay. 2, 3.

735
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,820
- SM Town, we can do it!
- SM Town, we can do it!

736
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,990
You can do it!

737
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,700
I hope both teams achieve great results.

738
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,630
Let's begin the first match...

739
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,530
of the mixed team pistol shooting.

740
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

741
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,040
- Yes.
- Sung Han Bin from WAKEONE...

742
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,010
and SION from SM...

743
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,870
are the first shooters.

744
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,110
They must be extremely nervous.

745
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,450
(With the sound of the buzzer,
they get ready for their first shot.)

746
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,620
Sung Han Bin, 7.2.

747
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,360
SION, 6.2.

748
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,690
- Han Bin earns two points.
- Yes.

749
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,960
That was nice.

750
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,060
(Sung Han Bin from WAKEONE
takes the lead first.)

751
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,540
Okay. This is their second shot.

752
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,180
(How will they do on their second shot?)

753
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,190
Sung Han Bin, 6.7.

754
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,720
- SION, 9.7.
- He's catching up.

755
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,360
Yes. He's catching up.

756
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,530
He's leveled with his opponent.

757
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,660
- Each of them won two points.
- Yes.

758
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,000
It's usually the third shot
that makes a difference.

759
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,430
- Yes.
- This is their third shot.

760
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,100
(How will their 3rd shot go?)

761
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
- He looks focused.
- Yes.

762
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,540
Han Bin has a great posture.

763
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,740
Yes.

764
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,350
Sung Han Bin, 6.7.

765
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,180
SION, 4.9.

766
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,490
- The gap has widened again.
- SION had a nice posture too.

767
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,790
SION should catch up.

768
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,390
- You don't know until the end.
- This is their fourth shot.

769
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,230
- They're taking turns.
- Yes.

770
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,840
Sung Han Bin, 6.8.

771
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,810
SION, 8.3.

772
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,150
- He's closing the gap.
- Yes. Now...

773
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,420
- It's 4 to 4. They're tied.
- It's a tie.

774
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,020
- He earned points.
- Yes. This is going well.

775
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,790
The last shot. Here we go.

776
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,190
(The 1 last shot)

777
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,160
WAKEONE's Han Bin.

778
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,890
SM's SION.

779
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,760
When you're tied at the last shot,

780
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,400
- it's very nerve-racking.
- Yes.

781
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,470
They need to overcome the nerves.

782
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,500
That's very hard to do.

783
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,770
They kept their eyes on it.

784
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,040
SION, 6.2.

785
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,380
- Sung Han Bin, 7.9
- Sung Han Bin.

786
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,180
Yes, with that,

787
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,550
WAKEONE takes the first game.

788
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,990
(Han Bin, good job!)

789
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,620
The shaking of Sung Han Bin's gun...

790
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,090
was a bit more exact.

791
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,060
That got him the higher score.

792
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,630
WAKEONE, 6. SM, 4.

793
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,970
They are two points apart.

794
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,470
- This time, we have the women.
- Let's go!

795
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,500
(Next up is the women's match.)

796
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,240
SM's YUHA.

797
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,070
- WAKEONE's BANG JEEMIN.
- Let's go, YUHA!

798
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,340
Here are their first shots.

799
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,180
(WAKEONE is leading by 2 points.)

800
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,880
BANG JEEMIN...

801
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,850
had top-tier form and core balance.

802
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,620
- She already has good form.
- Yes.

803
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,920
YUHA, 6.4.

804
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,360
BANG JEEMIN, 7.2.

805
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,930
(WAKEONE is widening their lead.)

806
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,200
The point differences...

807
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,600
really go up and down.

808
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,440
(SM needs to catch up.)

809
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,470
Here we go.

810
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,570
YUHA, 4.9.

811
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,250
BANG JEEMIN, 7.3

812
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,980
WAKEONE is really pulling ahead.

813
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,520
They're really widening the gap.

814
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,920
They're really charging ahead.

815
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,990
The third shot.

816
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
(SM's YUHA doesn't have many chances.)

817
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,630
- The buzzer went off.
- Yes.

818
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,730
Currently, WAKEONE gains ten points.

819
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,060
SM has four points.

820
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,100
- They have a 6-point difference.
- A 6-point difference.

821
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,140
YUHA, 7.4.

822
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,740
BANG JEEMIN, 8.6.

823
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,910
(WAKEONE's BANG JEEMIN
gets the higher score 3 times in a row.)

824
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,640
That's very impressive.

825
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,750
She made a six-point difference
by herself.

826
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,720
The fourth shot. Here we go.

827
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,350
(They have two chances left.)

828
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,990
YUHA needs to remain calm.

829
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,090
Don't rush.

830
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,390
YUHA, 4.9.

831
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,330
BANG JEEMIN, 9.4.

832
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,870
That's a great cluster.

833
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,630
If you shoot that well in the military,

834
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,700
they let you take vacation.

835
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,340
Yes.

836
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,340
(izna's BANG JEEMIN could even get
an all-kill.)

837
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,770
If she wins the fifth shot too,
that would be very impressive.

838
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,080
The fifth shot. Here we go.

839
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,950
(YUHA needs to turn things around
with this last shot.)

840
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,560
YUHA, 9.9.

841
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,660
BANG JEEMIN, six.

842
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

843
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,470
She came back with this shot.

844
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,270
- She got one step closer.
- Yes.

845
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,430
With this,

846
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,470
the second match is over.

847
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,800
The third match.

848
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,840
SM's WON BIN...

849
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,980
and WAKEONE's Kim Ji Woong
will face each other.

850
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,150
WON BIN did well in the last group match.

851
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,280
He did great.

852
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,550
I hope he stays calm and does well
for this mixed team match too.

853
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,690
- I hope WON BIN can narrow this gap.
- Yes.

854
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,960
The first shot. Here we go.

855
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,490
(SM must end WAKEONE's lead.)

856
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,640
WON BIN, 8.2.

857
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,070
WON BIN took his shot.

858
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,610
Now, Ji Woong.

859
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,110
Kim Ji Woong, 6.6.

860
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,080
- They're catching up.
- They're catching up.

861
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,450
He already has good momentum,

862
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,120
so he can just keep going and catch up.

863
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,150
It's not only for their team.

864
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,320
- It's playing for their company.
- That's right.

865
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,620
This is more important.

866
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,760
Okay. The second shot. Here we go.

867
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,400
(The point difference is down to 6.)

868
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,430
(How will the second shot go?)

869
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,530
The fans must be so nervous too.

870
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,240
If they win on behalf of the company,

871
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,570
their company will do anything for them.

872
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,770
- Definitely.
- Yes.

873
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,280
(WON BIN looks disappointed.)

874
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,380
He doesn't look happy.

875
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,150
WON BIN looks disappointed.

876
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,620
WON BIN, 4.2.

877
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,960
Kim Ji Woong, 6.5.

878
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,400
With this, WAKEONE has 16 points,

879
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,460
and SM has eight points.

880
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,930
They have an eight-point difference.

881
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,640
Eight points. It seemed
like they were catching up.

882
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,070
- Right.
- Yes.

883
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,140
Here we go with the third shot.

884
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,510
WON BIN needs to be more calm.

885
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,480
I hope he shoots calmly...

886
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,310
at his own pace.

887
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,620
He looks disappointed again.

888
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,020
WON BIN, 3.3.

889
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,330
Kim Ji Woong, four.

890
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,090
By a slim margin,

891
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,730
Kim Jin Woong earns two points.

892
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,470
Okay, the fourth shot.

893
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,750
- Kim Ji Woong, 8.3
- Yes.

894
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,850
WON BIN, 8.7.

895
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

896
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,520
- Park Won Bin!
- They can catch up slowly like this.

897
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,820
That's right.

898
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,860
- An eight-point difference.
- Right.

899
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
The last shot. Here we go.

900
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,030
The last shot.

901
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,030
(How will the last shot go?)

902
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,100
WON BIN needs to get SM...

903
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,100
to 12 points here...

904
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,270
- for their hopes to stay alive.
- That's right.

905
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,210
Kim Ji Woong, 2.9.

906
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,610
WON BIN, 9.4.

907
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,880
With this,

908
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,680
SM has 12 points,

909
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,520
and WAKEONE has 18 points.

910
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,790
They have a six-point difference.

911
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,520
We have the last shooters left.

912
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,790
The last shooter
needs to win four shots...

913
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,860
to come back and claim victory.

914
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,900
She needs to do better on four shots.

915
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,160
- Four shots.
- Yes.

916
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,360
The last shooters.

917
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,570
CHOI JUNG EUN and A-NA.

918
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,600
CHOI JUNG EUN used to be
in a shooting club.

919
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,340
I hope she shows us those skills
during this match.

920
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,470
The left-handed sniper.

921
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,480
Okay, the first shot. Here we go.

922
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,850
(Nervously loading their first shots)

923
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,510
I have a feeling...

924
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,050
- CHOI JUNG EUN will be good.
- Right?

925
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,590
CHOI JUNG EUN, 7.9.

926
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,630
- A-NA, nine.
- Oh, my. A-NA.

927
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,900
- That was a nice shot.
- A-NA pulled through.

928
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,630
A-NA got a nine.

929
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,870
- If she gets 2 points 4 times,
- Yes.

930
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,630
- It'll be a comeback.
- it'll be a comeback.

931
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,840
The second shot. Here we go.

932
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,040
(WAKEONE needs to widen the gap.)

933
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,510
(Each shot is important now.)

934
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,610
Calmly.

935
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,750
- That's nice form.
- Yes.

936
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,620
A-NA, 8.5.

937
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,290
- That was nice.
- Will A-NA...

938
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,120
- do it again?
- CHOI JUNG EUN, seven.

939
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,630
A-NA is catching up.

940
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,130
- She's catching up.
- That was nice.

941
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,530
(Hearts2Hearts' A-NA won the points
2 times in a row.)

942
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,260
- It's a two-point difference now.
- Yes.

943
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,470
- The gap has narrowed.
- A two-point difference.

944
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,400
They came back from 10 points behind
to 2 points behind.

945
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,900
She's catching up very quickly.

946
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,940
The third shot. Here we go.

947
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,780
(This third shot could make them even.)

948
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,350
A-NA, 1.9.

949
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,050
A-NA made a mistake this time.

950
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,860
(Oh, my! The crowd is surprised.)

951
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,230
CHOI JUNG EUN, 10.3.

952
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,500
CHOI JUNG EUN.

953
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,270
CHOI JUNG EUN got a 10.3.

954
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,070
- That was impressive.
- That was great.

955
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,870
Okay, if A-NA...

956
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,870
takes four points, they'll be tied.

957
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,810
Okay. The fourth shot. Here we go.

958
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,310
(The shot will determine the victor.)

959
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,310
A-NA needs to pull through here.

960
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,750
- She needs to show us.
- She needs to show us.

961
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,880
(SM won't go to the finals
if they lose even one shot.)

962
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,890
- She doesn't look happy.
- She doesn't look happy.

963
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,190
A-NA, 2.1.

964
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,600
CHOI JUNG EUN, 6.3.

965
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,970
WAKEONE wins this match.

966
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,640
CHOI JUNG EUN pulled through.

967
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,510
(They move on to the finals,
thanks to CHOI JUNG EUN.)

968
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,110
A former shooting club member
really is different.

969
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,250
Next, we have the second match
of Mixed Team Pistol Shooting.

970
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,250
STARSHIP versus Rookies.

971
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,790
(STARSHIP versus Rookies)

972
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,120
Both teams are trying shooting
for the first time.

973
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,790
I'm excited to see Rookies...

974
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,690
because they're all
from different companies.

975
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,660
They're all from different agencies,

976
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,470
but they came together
because they were rookies.

977
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,100
- They must feel very loyal to this team.
- Right.

978
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,740
Compared to other teams,

979
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,440
they have less stage experience,

980
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
but they say...

981
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
they have the vigor
and competitive spirit...

982
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,080
of national team athletes.

983
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Yes, that's right.

984
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,550
Rookies all practiced so hard.

985
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,020
Out of the 25 training days,

986
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,620
they visited the shooting range 15 times.

987
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,820
HYERIN and Yihyun were so passionate...

988
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,060
that they even had training sessions
together to improve their teamwork.

989
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,730
Will they be the start
of a new phenomenon?

990
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,900
Let's check in with how things are going
in the arena.

991
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,300
Reporter Kim Chae Hyun.

992
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,640
Yes, this is Kim Chae Hyun.

993
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,410
Shall we do our team chants?

994
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,710
Two, three.

995
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,680
- STARSHIP!
- STARSHIP!

996
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,910
(Let's go, our company!)

997
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,180
Rookies,

998
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,680
let's get first place.

999
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,320
Let's go.

1000
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,390
(They're so cute.)

1001
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,520
Rookies definitely feels...

1002
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,920
put together at the last minute...

1003
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,760
It was so funny
that it fizzled out at the end.

1004
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,800
Yes.

1005
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,830
It was so cute.

1006
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,870
STARSHIP's MINHEE and Rookies' MINJE...

1007
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,870
will face each other in the first matchup.

1008
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,840
MINHEE tends to be impatient,

1009
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,210
so he shot quickly.

1010
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,310
The key to victory for him...

1011
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,350
will be to take his time.

1012
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,350
That makes sense.

1013
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,580
(Men's Pistol Shooting:
Semifinals, 1st series)

1014

(STARSHIP MINHEE, Rookies MINJE)

1015
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,950
Okay, here we go.

1016
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,450
The MINJE I saw in training...

1017
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,990
was full of talent.

1018
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,460
He improved with every shot.

1019
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,990
I could tell he really wanted to learn.

1020
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,960
And the scores?

1021
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,500
MINHEE, 5.1.

1022
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
MINJE, 6.1.

1023
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,640
- Okay.
- With a one-point difference,

1024
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,740
MINJE took two points.

1025
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,970
Yes.

1026
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,940
The second shot. Here we go.

1027
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,880
Both MINJE and MINHEE...

1028
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,250
have a great look in their eyes
and great form.

1029
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,450
They're charismatic.

1030
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,260
MINHEE, 4.8.

1031
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,890

MINJE, six.

1038
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,230
He made another Bermuda Triangle.

1039
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,400
(Get it together.)

1040
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,100

Let's go, Rookies.

1043
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,940
Okay, the fourth shot. Here we go.

1044
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,340
MINJE really seems to understand
how to shoot a gun.

1045
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,350
Yes.

1046
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,480
What points made you think so?

1047
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,150
Considering how his gun shakes,

1048
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,120
his shot is really good.

1049
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,420
He understands when exactly to shoot.

1050
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,420
MINJE, 6.3.

1051
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,090
MINHEE, 8.4.

1052
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,660
MINHEE won two points.

1053
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,230
The last shot. Here we go.

1054
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,600
(They have the last shot left.)

1055
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,040
(Will STARSHIP narrow the gap?)

1056
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,740
- They need to focus on this last shot.
- Yes.

1057
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,240
- They both have great form.
- They do.

1058
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,340
MINJE, 9.7.

1059
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,250
- MINHEE, 10.6.
- MINHEE, 10.6.

1060
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,520
He shot a 10.6
and got to a 2-point difference.

1061
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,990
Yes, that was a great shot.

1062
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,260
I think this is the highest score yet.

1063
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,260
(Our MINHEE is the best!)

1064
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,530
That might be the highest score
in the pistol shooting category.

1065
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,160
Yes, with this shot,
they caught up to a two-point difference.

1066
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,760
They caught up quickly.

1067
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,240
Okay, the women are up next.

1068
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,340
Yes.

1069
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,240
STARSHIP's LEESOL...

1070
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,310
and Rookies' Yihyun will face each other.

1071
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,350
LEESOL, you can do it!

1072
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,890
(The 2nd series begins
with a 2-point difference.)

1073
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,190
LEESOL and Yihyun.

1074
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,090
They're both very calm.

1075
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,160
- LEESOL has learned shooting...
- Nice form.

1076
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,390
- in high school before.
- I see.

1077
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,700
LEESOL, 2.9.

1078
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,300
- Yihyun, 9.9.
- What happened?

1079
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,300
I know.

1080
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,640
It says Yihyun consistently practiced...

1081
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,740
her form even when she was at home.

1082
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,240
- Really?
- That's showing...

1083
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,640
- in this match already.
- That's so impressive.

1084
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,980
- She's so cool.
- Okay.

1085
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
The second shot.

1086
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,420
(Rookies is leading by 4 points.)

1087
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,450
Ready.

1088
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,220
It's probably because Yihyun practiced
her form a lot,

1089
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,190
- but her gun doesn't shake much.
- Yihyun, 5.9.

1090
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,670
LEESOL, 5.2.

1091
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,500
By getting 0.7 points more,

1092
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,710
Yihyun...

1093
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,840
takes another two points.

1094
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,410
Okay, the third shot. Here we go.

1095
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,780
(It's the third shot.)

1096
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,550
(Will Rookies take
these two points again?)

1097
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,110
LEESOL needs to remain calm.

1098
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,320
- Yes.
- Calmly.

1099
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,090
You said having strength
when pulling the trigger...

1100
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,420
- was also important.
- That's right.

1101
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,890
It says LEESOL developed
a shooting method...

1102
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,490
- that personally suited her.
- Oh, my.

1103
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,030
Yihyun, nine.

1104
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,770
LEESOL, 9.5.

1105
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,100
- She's getting the feel for it.
- LEESOL!

1106
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,370
(STARSHIP's LEESOL of KiiKii
caught up by 2 points.)

1107
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,110
- LEESOL!
- Here we go.

1108
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,440
- LEESOL!
- LEESOL!

1109
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,340
(Will she continue this momentum?)

1110
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,280
(The 4th shot)

1111
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,860
LEESOL, 5.3.

1112
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,990
Yihyun, eight.

1113
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,100
(Disappointed)

1114
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,570
Yihyun won another two points.

1115
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,640
The last shot.

1116
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,140
(The last shot of the 2nd series)

1117
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,910
Yihyun is a shooter I want to teach.

1118
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,740
Also, the coaches predicted...

1119
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,080
she would be a strong contender
for first place.

1120
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,350
Her gun doesn't shake at all.

1121
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,620
- Right?
- Yes.

1122
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,320
- It doesn't shake, right?
- Right.

1123
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,420
LEESOL, 7.1.

1124
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,060
Yihyun, 7.1.

1125
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,330
(KiiKii's LEESOL
and Baby DONT Cry's Yihyun tied.)

1126
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,000
Rookies 13 points, and STARSHIP 7 points.

1127
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,560
- A 6-point difference.
- A 6-point difference.

1128
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,870
With a six-point difference,

1129
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,700
Rookies is getting away
from their opponent.

1130
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,800
STARSHIP's JIYU...

1131
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,670
and Rookies' Chihen.

1132
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,970
This time, it's a male-female match.

1133
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,280
- It is.
- Yes.

1134
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
(The first male-female match)

1135
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,680
Because male shooters have more strength,

1136
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,550
it will be hard for JIYU to keep up.

1137
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,220
But JIYU has a good understanding
of shooting.

1138
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,590
When she was taught how to shoot,
she learned very quickly.

1139
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,590
Yes.

1140
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,590
(The 3rd series
for Group 2 of Semifinals begins.)

1141
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,760
With good understanding,

1142
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,090
- people improve quickly.
- Right.

1143
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,160
I think shooting...

1144
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,130
may be a category...

1145
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,370
that isn't affected by gender or size.

1146
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,470
Yes.

1147
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,810
Chihen, 8.2.

1148
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,010
- JIYU, 9.9.
- JIYU.

1149
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,850
A 9.9.

1150
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,680
A nine. JIYU, why are you so good?

1151
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,750
That was a great shot.

1152
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,990
- JIYU is so good.
- Yes.

1153
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,290
With JIYU's win,

1154
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,290
Rookies has 13 points,
and STARSHIP has 9 points currently.

1155
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,090
- It's a four-point difference.
- That's right.

1156
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,930
(With a 4-point difference,
it's time for their 2nd shot.)

1157
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,000
They need to pull the trigger...

1158
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,830
- with confidence and no hesitation.
- Yes.

1159
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,000
That's right.

1160
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,240
Chihen of Rookies.

1161
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,410
JIYU of STARSHIP.

1162
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,270
Nice.

1163
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,380
Chihen, 4.2.

1164
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,440
JIYU,

1165
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,010
5.3

1166
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,510
JIYU...

1167
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,750
won four points for her team
all by herself.

1168
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,750
Yes.

1169
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,050
She did well.

1170
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,050
- She's catching up nicely.
- Yes.

1171
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,990
They have a two-point difference now.

1172
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,860
Let's stay calm.

1173
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,760
The third shot. Here we go.

1174
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,500
Chihen of Rookies, JIYU of STARSHIP.

1175
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,900
JIYU is doing very well,
one shot at a time.

1176
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,000
Yes, that's right.

1177
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,040
JIYU is showing us very stable shooting.

1178
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,440
- JIYU, 6.6.
- A 6.6.

1179
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,810
Chihen, 6.8.

1180
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,450
- Yes.
- With a difference of 0.2.

1181
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,120
Currently, Rookies has 15 points,
and STARSHIP has 11 points.

1182
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,250
It's a four-point difference.

1183
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,520
- A four-point difference.
- Yes.

1184
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,760
Their body sizes...

1185
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,390
don't matter at all.

1186
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,490
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right.

1187
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:00,800
It's about focus.

1188
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,600
Focus and mind control.

1189
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,670
(How will their 4th shot go?)

1190
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,770
Chihen's gun shook a lot just now.

1191
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,910
Chihen, 7.7.

1192
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,580
JIYU, 7.9.

1193
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,310
With 0.2 points,

1194
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,520
JIYU takes another two points.

1195
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,520
She's almost caught up.
A two-point difference.

1196
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,020
If she wins this, they'll be tied.

1197
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,460
If JIYU wins this one too,

1198
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,190
- they'll be tied.
- That's right.

1199
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,460
If so, the last two shooters left
will have to battle it out.

1200
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,530
- That will be so intense.
- Yes.

1201
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,400
If JIYU wins this one...

1202
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
with a nice shot, they'll be tied.

1203
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,510
They took their shots.

1204
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,840
(Which team will take
the last two points?)

1205
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,910
(STARSHIP?)

1206
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,450
(Rookies?)

1207
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,610
Chihen, 8.4.

1208
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,780
JIYU, 8.8.

1209
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,150
She made it a tie.

1210
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,660
- She made it a tie.
- A tie.

1211
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,160
STARSHIP caught up with Rookies...

1212
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,590
and made it a tie.

1213
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,860
The last shooters.

1214
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,330
We have HYERIN and JUNGMO left.

1215
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,540
(They're currently tied.)

1216
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,110
(STARSHIP's JUNGMO is hoping
to come back and win.)

1217
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,640
(Rookies' HYERIN wants to show
the strength of rookies.)

1218
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,480
(Shaking)

1219
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,350
His gun was shaking.

1220
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,020
His gun was shaking a lot.

1221
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,450
HYERIN's shot.

1222
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,260
You have to think
of simply laying the gun on your hand.

1223
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,990
- JUNGMO, five.
- You just need to support it.

1224
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,690
- HYERIN.
- HYERIN, 9.8.

1225
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,760
- A 9.8.
- Nice.

1226
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,300
Rookies' HYERIN is off to a good start.

1227
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,970
The second shot. Here we go.

1228
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,140
(STARSHIP needs to narrow the gap.)

1229
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,240
(Rookies needs to widen the gap.)

1230
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,380
- JUNGMO is shaking a lot.
- Yes.

1231
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,410
You need to keep looking at the target.

1232
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,750
He must've done well.

1233
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,930
JUNGMO, miss.

1234
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:13,960
(STARSHIP's JUNGMO misses.)

1235
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,300
- What? He missed.
- HYERIN, 9.2

1236
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,200
(What is he going to do?)

1237
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,100
I thought he had scored X-ten.

1238
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,670
- Yes.
- It's going well.

1239
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,670
(Rookies' HYERIN widens the gap
by scoring high consecutively.)

1240
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,780
(The last shot will determine the winner.)

1241
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,920
(STARSHIP will be over
if he does badly this time.)

1242
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,890
JUNGMO, 5.7.

1243
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,920
HYERIN, eight.

1244
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,230
HYERIN did incredibly well.

1245
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,230
That's right.

1246
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,870
Thus, Rookies advances to the final.

1247
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,040
Rookies advances to the final.

1248
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,110
Lastly, we have the final match
of Mixed Team Pistol Shooting.

1249
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:02,980
- That's right.
- Which team will shoot well...

1250
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,950
- and make their agency shine?
- Yes.

1251
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,720
It's the fateful match
of WAKEONE versus Rookies.

1252
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,480
Please stay with us until the end.

1253
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,160
Now, let's determine the champion
of Mixed Team Pistol Shooting.

1254
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,520
- Okay.
- The much-anticipated last battle.

1255
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,360
- The last battle.
- WAKEONE's Sung Han Bin...

1256
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,130
and Rookies' MINJE are...

1257
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,970
the first shooters.

1258
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:29,640
All right. Sung Han Bin's goal is x-ten.

1259
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,070
And MINJE...

1260
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,680
gained muscles for shooting.

1261
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,210
Since forearm muscles are
the most important in shooting,

1262
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,010
he'll show the power of forearm muscles.

1263
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,620
All right. Let's begin...

1264
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,220
with the first shot.

1265
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,860
(The first flow is important.)

1266
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,430
MINJE has fired.

1267
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,100
Both shooters have steady hands.

1268
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,810
- Sung Han Bin, 6.2.
- MINJE scored 10.2.

1269
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,240
MINJE, 10.2.

1270
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,780
Sung Han Bin faltered a bit...

1271
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,310
with the first shot.

1272
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,520
MiNJE fired...

1273
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,050
- and scored 10.2.
- It's impressive.

1274
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,790
- He took two points.
- Yes.

1275
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,220
The second shot.

1276
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,030
Sung Han Bin, 9.4

1277
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,830
(No way!)

1278
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,370
The audience is shocked.

1279
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,470
MINJE, 9.6.

1280
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,680
That's impressive. He's very good.

1281
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,180
He's nearly perfect.

1282
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,110
Rookies' MINJE takes another two points.

1283
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

1284
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,220
Currently, Rookies has four points...

1285
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,720
and WAKEONE has zero points.

1286
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,950
Okay. Points.

1287
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:52,950
(Rookies shows an incredible performance.)

1288
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,760
Four points versus zero points.

1289
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,960
(Calm)

1290
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,960
- Calmly.
- Calmly.

1291
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,470
Good. He kept his eyes
on the target until the end.

1292
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,670
MINJE, 7.6.

1293
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,140
Sung Han Bin, 9.4.

1294
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,480
- Han Bin.
- Yes.

1295
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,880
- Han Bin took the points.
- Yes.

1296
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,480
- Two points.
- He's improving slowly.

1297
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,750
- That's right.
- He's improving slowly.

1298
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,520
Now comes the fourth shot.

1299
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,960
Sung Han Bin was worried...

1300
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,730
that he wouldn't be able to focus.

1301
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,690
But his level of focus...

1302
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,260
- continues to improve.
- It keeps improving.

1303
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,460
He's doing well right now.

1304
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,200
- Yes.
- His focus is improving.

1305
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:40,800
I hope Sung Han Bin will continue on
with this flow...

1306
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,300
- and do well until the end.
- That's right.

1307
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,010
Even during practice,
Sung Han Bin rarely missed.

1308
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,640
- MINJE, 6.2.
- Yes.

1309
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,180
- Sung Han Bin, nine.
- He's catching up.

1310
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,780
(The 2 teams are tied
after taking 4 points each.)

1311
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,750
It's a tie.

1312
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,350
- What will happen?
- It's the last shot.

1313
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,420
Each two points are very precious.

1314
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,120
That's right.

1315
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,960
Rookies or WAKEONE.

1316
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,030
(The last shot of the 1st series)

1317
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,260
They must keep their eyes
on the target until the end.

1318
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,240
They need to do well now.

1319
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,200
Who will take the points?

1320
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,040
Sung Han Bin, ten.

1321
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,980
- MINJE, 10.6.
- It's 10.6.

1322
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,250
- He got 10.6 in a crucial moment.
- Yes.

1323
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,650
That's impressive.

1324
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,920
- MINJE scored six points.
- Ten.

1325
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,090
- He scored six points.
- That's right.

1326
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,920
Unfortunately, Rookies takes 6 points 1st.

1327
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,490
- Yes.
- Rookies is leading.

1328
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,460
The second match is...

1329
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,800
between WAKEONE's BANG JEEMIN...

1330
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,830
and Rookies' Yihyun.

1331
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,470
Earlier, Yihyun...

1332
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,200
fired shots very steadily.

1333
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,370
But BANG JEEMIN also showed
incredible shooting skills.

1334
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,310
That's right. She has an amazing form.

1335
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,410
(Who will intimidate the opponent
with the first shot?)

1336
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,050
- BANG JEEMIN, ten.
- Look at that.

1337
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:07,420
- Look at that.
- That's right. Yes.

1338
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,590
Yihyun, 9.5

1339
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,960
This is the match of the aces.

1340
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,100
The difference is 0.5

1341
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,540
BANG JEEMIN's form, core,
and balance are the top-notch.

1342
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,810
She scored 10 with her 1st shot.

1343
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:24,870
(WAKEONE's BANG JEEMIN
scores a tie with the first shot.)

1344
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,610
- Currently, it's a tie.
- That's right.

1345
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,880
Rookies has 6 points
and WAKEONE has 6 points.

1346
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,310
- It's a tie.
- Yes.

1347
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,020
Since it's the final match,

1348
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,620
- the shooters' skills are neck-and-neck.
- Right.

1349
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,990
BANG JEEMIN, 7.9.

1350
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,730
Yihyun, 5.8.

1351
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,760
She's in a downward spiral.

1352
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,800
(WAKEONE's BANG JEEMIN turns the tables!)

1353
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,230
That's right.

1354
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,270
Please work hard...

1355
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,870
to regain your pace.

1356
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,740
Here comes the third shot.

1357
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,210
(The 3rd shot is important.)

1358
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,980
(She aims with more caution.)

1359
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,990
(WAKEONE's BANG JEEMIN
suddenly lowers the pistol.)

1360
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,460
(Let's stay calm.)

1361
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,730
Yihyun, 8.7.

1362
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,130
BANG JEEMIN, 3.4.

1363
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,100
The score continues to be a tie.

1364
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,470
Since it's the final match,

1365
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,700
- the score continues to be a tie.
- It's cutthroat.

1366
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,940
(You can't predict the result
for the final match.)

1367
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,070
It isn't easy.

1368
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,210
- The fourth shot.
- Yes.

1369
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,610
The fourth shot.

1370
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,450
They're close in age too.

1371
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,820
That's right.

1372
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,420
JEEMIN and Yihyun are close in age too.

1373
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,760
- They're one year apart.
- Their pistols...

1374
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,560
- are so steady.
- Yihyun, 8.7.

1375
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,330
- BANG JEEMIN got 10.4.
- BANG JEEMIN, 10.4.

1376
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,030
WAKEONE...

1377
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,430
- takes the lead.
- Yes. It's 10.4.

1378
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,570
Thus, WAKEONE takes two more points.

1379
00:59:58,570 --> 00:59:59,570
They're two points apart.

1380
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:03,710
If Yihyun takes the points
with the last shot,

1381
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,110
- it'll end as a tie.
- Yes.

1382
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,370
Here comes the last shot.

1383
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,980
(What will become of the match?)

1384
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,290
BANG JEEMIN, 9.4.

1385
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,520
Yihyun, 9.6.

1386
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,290
Thus, it's a tie again.

1387
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:29,160
The shooting queens
end the series as a tie.

1388
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,730
That's impressive.

1389
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,430
It really is the final match.

1390
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,700
- It's so nice.
- It truly is the final match.

1391
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,040
- It's suspenseful and fun.
- Yes.

1392
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,140
The next match is
WAKEONE's Kim Ji Woong...

1393
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,780
- versus Rookies' Chihen.
- That's right.

1394
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,580
If this match also ends as a tie,

1395
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,280
we'll go insane.

1396
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,150
That's right.

1397
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,850
Here comes the first shot.

1398
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,960
I heard that Chihen was
always at the shooting range.

1399
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,090
That's right. He practiced hard.

1400
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,400
- He's incredible.
- He's incredible, really.

1401
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,400
That's right.

1402
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,100
- Kim Ji Woong, 4.8.
- Show us.

1403
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,130
- Kim Ji Woong.
- Chihen, show us.

1404
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,840
- Good.
- Chihen, 4.8.

1405
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,140
- It's a tie.
- It's a tie,

1406
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,040
so the teams take a point each.

1407
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,310
- Now,
- They keep being tied.

1408
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,980
- it's a tie again.
- Yes.

1409
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:22,280
They shouldn't keep being tied.

1410
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,420
It's going to drive us insane.

1411
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,060
- I know.
- The second shot.

1412
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:32,390
(The 2nd shot
will end the cycle of a tie.)

1413
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:37,900
(WAKEONE: 1, Rookies: 1)

1414
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,600
Kim Ji Woong, five.

1415
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,840
- Chihen, eight.
- Okay.

1416
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,810
Chihen.

1417
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,240
That's right.
Now, the teams are two points apart.

1418
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,510
Yes. Rookies stepped forward
in a crucial moment.

1419
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,180
- That's right.
- That's right.

1420
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,320
Now comes the third shot.

1421
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,380
The third shot.

1422
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,490
(The two teams chase and get chased.)

1423
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,060
Chihen should continue on
with this energy and do well.

1424
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,730
- Chihen, 9.8.
- Chihen did well.

1425
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:12,170
(Chihen is doing well.)

1426
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,810
Kim Ji Woong, 3.5.

1427
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,940
(He earns another precious 2 points.)

1428
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,410
They're going in the opposite directions,

1429
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,880
- Chihen's score keeps increasing.
- Yes.

1430
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,550
Chihen is doing very well.

1431
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,790
- Kim Ji Woong's score keeps decreasing.
- Yes.

1432
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,250
It's the fourth shot.

1433
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:39,330
(They still have two more chances.)

1434
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,360
Calmly.

1435
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,840
Kim Ji Woong, 6.9.

1436
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,610
Chihen, 8.4.

1437
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,240
All right. Now,

1438
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,910
- each team has one shooter remaining.
- Yes.

1439
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,450
They need to do a bit better...

1440
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:05,150
- to make things easier for the last ones.
- That's right.

1441
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,890
The teams are six points apart.
Here comes the last shot.

1442
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:15,630
If Chihen scores again,

1443
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,000
WAKEONE will need to win points
with all five shots...

1444
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,330
to turn the tables in the last match.

1445
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,540
Kim Ji Woong, 5.3.

1446
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,010
- Chihen, 8.4.
- He won with all 5 shots.

1447
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,410
(Rookies takes 2 points.)

1448
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,480
- All right. Now...
- He widened the gap.

1449
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,750
Rookies has 19 points
and WAKEONE has 11 points.

1450
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,820
The difference is eight points.

1451
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,850
It's the first shot of the last match.

1452
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:42,020
- Let's go.
- The ending is perfect...

1453
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,760
for shooting...

1454
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,630
- because both of them are good.
- Yes, it's the perfect finale.

1455
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:50,570
- HYERIN's skills surprised me.
- That's right.

1456
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,730
- All right.
- Let's go.

1457
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,070
(Rookies will win
if HYERIN wins with just 1 shot.)

1458
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,270
All right.

1459
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,240
- I'm nervous.
- Yes.

1460
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,380
HYERIN, show us what you can do.

1461
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,450
HYERIN has created...

1462
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:07,880
her own shooting routine
with her steady form.

1463
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,220
- Okay.
- HYERIN, nine.

1464
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:16,060
- CHOI JUNG EUN, 10.1.
- She's different from the start.

1465
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,260
(That's incredible.)

1466
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,030
HYERIN got nine...

1467
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,930
and CHOI JUNG EUN got 10.1.

1468
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,930
- She did an incredible job.
- They're neck-and-neck.

1469
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,770
- The 2nd shot.
- The 2nd shot.

1470
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,740
- All right. Let's see.
- Four shots remain.

1471
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,980
Do you agree that they rival
professional shooters?

1472
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,410
That's right. I thought
they'd struggle as time passed.

1473
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,180
But the shooters are improving...

1474
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,420
- with time.
- They come alive.

1475
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,820
- CHOI JUNG EUN is disappointed.
- CHOI JUNG EUN, 5.2.

1476
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,850
- She seems to be a bit embarrassed.
- WAKEONE.

1477
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,720
(The audience suddenly goes wild!)

1478
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,130
How did HYERIN do?

1479
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,430
- HYERIN, 10.5.
- It's 10.5.

1480
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,530
That's incredible.

1481
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,900
(Final score, WAKEONE: 13
versus Rookis: 21)

1482
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,040
(Rookies won.)

1483
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,070
That's impressive. Yes.

1484
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,940
The first winner of the shooting event
at Idol Star Athletics Championships...

1485
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,180
is Rookies.

1486
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:13,050
Congratulations.

1487
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,320
(Rookies, gold medal
at Mixed Team Pistol Shooting)

1488
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,890
It was so much fun...

1489
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,720
to prepare for the event together.

1490
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,990
I was very nervous
since I had never tried shooting before.

1491
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:24,930
But I could do well
thanks to the fans' support.

1492
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,260
Fans, you must be exhausted
from beginning the day so early.

1493
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,700
Thank you for rooting for us
until the end.

1494
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,930
I thank the teammates
who participated in the event with me.

1495
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,800
Again, congratulations. Thank you.

1496
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,640
(We congratulate Rookies' victory
for the 1st Mixed Team Pistol Shooting.)

1497
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,370
(Goyang Gym)

1498
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,110
We'll soon have the preliminary rounds...

1499
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,210
for the 400m relay.

1500
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,350
The top-notch idols are competing...

1501
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,850
for 2025 Idol Star Athletics
Championships, Chuseok Special.

1502
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,250
Now comes the event
that's the highlight of the show.

1503
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:52,750
It's the flower of track and field.

1504
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,120
The 400m relay will begin.

1505
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,720
Yes.

1506
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:00,260
- I've been waiting for this event.
- That's right.

1507
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,630
When you have a field day,

1508
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,960
- people do their own things.
- That's right.

1509
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,000
But when it's time for the 400m relay,

1510
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,140
people suddenly pay attention
and cheer for the runners.

1511
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,040
The relay is the flower of any field day.

1512
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:11,840
We recently heard good news.

1513
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,370
The Korean team...

1514
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,510
participated in the 400m relay
at the Summer Universiade.

1515
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,050
They became the first Korean team
in track and field to win gold...

1516
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,680
at an international event.

1517
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,950
(The first gold medal
in the history of Korean track and field)

1518
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,020
Because the runners had a good senior,

1519
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,620
- they brought a good result.
- How nice.

1520
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,590
- I was so proud.
- Yes.

1521
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,090
Please look forward
to the Asian Games next year.

1522
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:34,030
- Okay. We'll root for them.
- We'll look forward to that.

1523
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:36,330
Before the event begins,
we need to know the rules...

1524
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,970
- to enjoy the game.
- That's right.

1525
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,070
- Please explain.
- Okay.

1526
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,000
The rules are the same
for men and women in the 400m relay.

1527
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,810
Four runners make up a team.

1528
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,640
There will be 2 preliminary rounds
of 4 teams each.

1529
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,380
The 1st and 2nd places
of the preliminary rounds...

1530
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,780
can advance to the final.

1531
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,320
You need to be in the top two
to advance to the final.

1532
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,350
- Yes.
- Relay is...

1533
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,850
the only team event in track and field.

1534
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,890
- So, passing the baton is very important.
- That's right.

1535
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,730
Teamwork matters much more...

1536
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,890
than individual talent.

1537
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,230
Since each runner runs a lap each,

1538
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,000
the strength to beat the centrifugal force
is important too.

1539
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,030
- That's right.
- Yes.

1540
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:14,170
They should do their best
while staying safe.

1541
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,800
Now, let's begin
with women's preliminary rounds...

1542
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,240
- for the 400m relay.
- Okay.

1543
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,410
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

1544
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,640
Which team do you think will win?

1545
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,710
My guess is the team
that sadly came in second last year.

1546
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,310
It's Kep1er.

1547
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,480
I think they'll win gold this year.

1548
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,790
I personally think...

1549
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:35,390
Hearts2Hearts will be a dark horse.

1550
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,760
- I saw Hearts2Hearts in the hallway.
- Okay.

1551
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,860
- They ran to receive dinner.
- Okay.

1552
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,570
- Their speed was no joke.
- They're fast.

1553
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,500
- I was so startled.
- They're fast.

1554
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,900
They ran at the speed of light.

1555
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,340
- They become Usain Bolt before food.
- That's right.

1556
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,910
Group One
of the women's preliminary round...

1557
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:57,140
for the 400m relay will begin.

1558
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:59,450
On Lane One, PURPLE KISS.

1559
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,550
Na Go Eun won a bronze medal
for the 60m race...

1560
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,190
back in 2022.

1561
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,590
She could be an ace member.

1562
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,260
On Lane Two, Kep1er.

1563
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,360
It's Kep1er.

1564
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,690
They placed second last year.

1565
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,430
On Lane Three, Hearts2Hearts.

1566
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,770
On Lane Four, HITGS.

1567
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,370
SEOJIN.

1568
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,040
Mr. Kim, is there a better lane?

1569
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,940
- On your mark.
- The first runner stays in her lane.

1570
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,970
That's right.

1571
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,880
Thus, it's important to get ahead.

1572
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,050
It's important to get ahead.

1573
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,950
Get set.

1574
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,050
(They set off.)

1575
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,380
- It has begun.
- It has begun.

1576
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,020
- Yes.
- They need to stay in their lanes.

1577
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,150
That's right.

1578
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,750
- Lane Three.
- SEOJIN is fast.

1579
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,820
SEOJIN is fast.

1580
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,720
(JUUN takes 1st place.)

1581
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,460
JUUN gets ahead.

1582
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,160
- Yes.
- JUUN gets ahead.

1583
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,430
They need to be careful when they corner.

1584
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,700
- Many runners get hurt when they corner.
- That's right.

1585
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:53,100
- JUUN is doing well.
- She's fast.

1586
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,800
- Pass the baton.
- There goes A-NA.

1587
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,740
- A-NA.
- There goes A-NA.

1588
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,270
- A-NA took the inner lane.
- A-NA.

1589
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,240
It's A-NA of Hearts2Hearts.

1590
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,040
I told you that Hearts2Hearts was fast.

1591
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,350
- They're fast.
- They're fast.

1592
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,250
- They're fast.
- They took food at that speed.

1593
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,680
It's incredible speed.

1594
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,650
Another team might get ahead.

1595
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,390
- She's close behind.
- Huening Bahiyyih is close behind.

1596
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,620
She needs to run.

1597
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,620
- IAN runs.
- It's IAN.

1598
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,120
- She needs to run hard.
- Will she show us the IAN challenge...

1599
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,630
as a ceremony?

1600
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,290
- Be careful not to get hurt.
- Of course.

1601
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,260
- IAN.
- They need to run faster.

1602
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,000
- They're running.
- Yes.

1603
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,470
- Earlier...
- The others are following.

1604
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,630
They're doing their best.

1605
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,600
- Be careful.
- Second place will advance as well.

1606
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,640
- They need to do their best.
- The 2nd and 3nd places are close.

1607
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,740
- They're running after the 1st place.
- The 2nd and 3nd places are close.

1608
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,340
The fourth place has caught up a lot.

1609
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,480
It's a fight for second place.

1610
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,310
- Now...
- You never know.

1611
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,910
- Now...
- Yes.

1612
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,280
(CARMEN, Kim Da Yeon)

1613
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,250
- Run.
- Will CARMEN wrap up in a relaxed way?

1614
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,790
- Of course.
- In a relaxed way...

1615
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,120
- CARMEN is the last runner.
- She's smiling.

1616
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,090
Hearts2Hearts will come in 1st...

1617
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,030
- unless she makes a mistake.
- They'll come in first.

1618
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,530
They place first.

1619
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,100
The second place is...

1620
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,800
- The 2nd place is Kep1er.
- It's Kep1er.

1621
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,800
(Kep1er comes in 2nd.)

1622
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,440
- They ran well.
- Hearts2Hearts.

1623
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,440
- Didn't Hearts2Hearts have good teamwork?
- Yes.

1624
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,910
As soon as the 2nd runner got the baton,
she took Lane 1...

1625
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,510
and the remaining runners followed.

1626
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,950
- Yes.
- It was impressive.

1627
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,550
JUUN ran incredibly well.

1628
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,020
- The first runner.
- From the beginning to the end,

1629
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,450
she stayed ahead.

1630
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:20,250
- Yes. The first runner is important.
- That's right.

1631
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,590
The one who ran over to get food was JUUN.

1632
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,160
- I see. She didn't disappoint.
- She didn't disappoint.

1633
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,960
- She's the first runner.
- Yes.

1634
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,530
Hearts2Hearts took 1st place
with 1 minute and 16.87 seconds.

1635
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,770
Kep1er took 2nd place
and advanced to the final...

1636
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,900
with 1 minute and 19.04 seconds.

1637
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:40,310
It's Hearts2Hearts' first time
on Idol Star Athletics Championships,

1638
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,680
but they're doing incredibly well.

1639
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,580
- They're doing well.
- Yes.

1640
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,610
Group Two
of the women's preliminary round...

1641
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:49,820
for the 400m relay will begin.

1642
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,620
On Lane One, Queenz Eye.

1643
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,090
They received training from the manager...

1644
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,690
who was in special forces.

1645
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,090
On Lane Two, USPEER.

1646
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,530
They're rookies
who debuted in less than 100 days.

1647
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,530
They practiced passing the baton
at the Han River.

1648
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,570
They're determined to do well.

1649
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,570
On Lane Three, FIFTY FIFTY.

1650
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,970
I remember CHANELLE MOON from dancesport.

1651
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,370
- I bet she's incredibly fast.
- She's fast.

1652
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,380
On Lane Four, KIIRAS.

1653
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,780
KIIRAS.

1654
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:19,710
On your mark.

1655
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:22,750
(Which two teams
will advance to the final?)

1656
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,780
Get set.

1657
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,220
- Let's go.
- The first runner is important.

1658
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,420
- Here they go.
- The first runner is important.

1659
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,620
- All right.
- All right.

1660
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,960
- Let's go.
- They're running pretty well.

1661
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,430
- They're running well.
- They're running well.

1662
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,790
- CHANELLE MOON of FIFTY FIFTY.
- They're running well.

1663
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,860
- She fell down.
- That's bad.

1664
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,470
- She fell down. It's okay.
- A member of USPEER fell down.

1665
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,640
- CHANELLE MOON.
- They can do it.

1666
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,840
- She got ahead.
- Here they go.

1667
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,810
- She's getting ahead.
- She's getting ahead.

1668
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,010
- She took Lane 1. To get ahead,
- Lane 1.

1669
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,640
- Doyeon is fast.
- the straight part is the key.

1670
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,180
There goes Doyeon of KIIRAS.

1671
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,750
- Don't fall down!
- She fell down.

1672
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,890
Another runner got past her
when she fell down.

1673
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,320
- Let's go.
- They can turn the tables.

1674
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,620
- KYLIE of KIIRAS is fast.
- Be careful.

1675
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,830
- KYLIE is fast.
- Yes, she's fast.

1676
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:06,430
That's it. Be careful.

1677
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,860
KYLIE is fast.

1678
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:11,130
The players keep falling down,
unable to control their speed.

1679
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,470
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1680
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,070
- They're being carried away.
- Control is key.

1681
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,440
I wonder who will come in second.

1682
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,810
We can't see who it is on the monitor.

1683
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,140
Who will come in second?

1684
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,680
- HARIN has received the baton.
- HARIN.

1685
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,880
- Here she goes.
- FIFTY FIFTY is currently in third place.

1686
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,010
She's the last runner.

1687
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,350
HARIN is the last runner.

1688
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,750
KIIRAS is fast.

1689
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,580
It's great to see them
giving it their all.

1690
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,090
Don't give up.
The runners behind are chasing quickly.

1691
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,790
- All right.
- The runners are catching up fast.

1692
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,860
- Someone is closing in really fast.
- Exactly.

1693
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,830
They just need to finish in second place.

1694
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:38,830
(Won Chae of Queenz Eye)

1695
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:40,760
- They don't need to come in first.
- No.

1696
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,860
Okay, KIIRAS comes in first.

1697
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:46,670
Queenz Eye takes second place.

1698
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,700
Won Chae was the last runner.

1699
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,970
(Really happy)

1700
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,610
Let's look at the results.

1701
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:57,110
(However, everyone has grown restless.)

1702
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,850
(There must be a problem.)

1703
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,620
Before checking the records
for 1st and 2nd place,

1704
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,820
let's review the video to see...

1705
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,750
if there were any disqualifications...

1706
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,420
during the second runner's baton exchange.

1707
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,020
All right.

1708
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,390
(Video review)

1709
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,830
- Is this the one?
- Let's see.

1710
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,900
(KURUMI of KIIRAS)

1711
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,830
- Right here?
- I see.

1712
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,070
That's...

1713
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:20,200
(KIIRAS got in the way of Queenz Eye.)

1714
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,470
You shouldn't pass like that.

1715
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:24,970
She obstructed the runner in lane one...

1716
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,140
after passing the baton.

1717
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,280
Although it wasn't intentional,

1718
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,310
she has been disqualified.

1719
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,480
(KIIRAS got disqualified
for obstructing the path.)

1720
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,950
KIIRAS came in first,

1721
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,510
but because a member got in the way,

1722
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,350
they have been disqualified.

1723
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,380
Queenz Eye is now 1st, moving up from 2nd,

1724
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,820
and FIFTY FIFTY is now 2nd,
moving up from 3rd.

1725
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:43,160
With that, Queenz Eye and FIFTY FIFTY
have advanced to the finals.

1726
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,330
(Group 2 of Women's Preliminary Rounds
for the 400m Relay Result)

1727
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,560
One wrong move,

1728
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,300
and you can get disqualified
without meaning to.

1729
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,460
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1730
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,030
There are just too many variables.

1731
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,670
(Feeling bad)

1732
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,870
The men's preliminary rounds...

1733
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,270
for the 400m relay will begin soon.

1734
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,840
Here comes the men's relay.

1735
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,810
The men's race
is always an entertaining event.

1736
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,210
What should we watch for...

1737
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,110
in the men's group event, Jonathan?

1738
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,220
It's who can stop andTEAM from advancing.

1739
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,090
Last year,

1740
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,650
andTEAM dominated the relay race.

1741
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,390
They won the gold medal by a huge margin.

1742
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,630
We'll be keeping our eyes on...

1743
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:22,100
who can challenge andTEAM's lead.

1744
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,270
All the members of andTEAM
are practically professional athletes.

1745
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,600
Personally,

1746
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,670
I want to focus on KickFlip.

1747
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,570
Just look at the names
of the members. I can't help but expect...

1748
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,740
(Juwang of KickFlip)

1749
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,940
- Right.
- Juwang to zoom through...

1750
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:35,980
and Kyehoon...

1751
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,880
- to finish with a killer run...
- A killer run.

1752
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,880
to take first place.

1753
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,120
- I see.
- Zoom.

1754
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,950
Group One
of the men's preliminary round...

1755
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,490
for the 400m relay will begin.

1756
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,360
In lane one, AMPERS and ONE.

1757
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,560
All right, AMPERS and ONE
is running in lane one.

1758
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,200
In lane two, KickFlip.

1759
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,530
Keiju.

1760
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,700
In lane three, NEXZ.

1761
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:02,870
NEXZ.

1762
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,710
In lane four, CRAVITY.

1763
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:06,940
They've picked the right member.

1764
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,380
On your mark.

1765
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,410
(Which team will advance to the finals?)

1766
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:12,550
Get set.

1767
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,180
(Go.)

1768
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,180
- Okay.
- Here they go.

1769
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,280
- Let's see.
- That's it.

1770
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,550
(TAEYOUNG, YU, Keiju, Kim Seung Mo)

1771
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,120
- They're fast.
- CRAVITY.

1772
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,290
TAEYOUNG of CRAVITY is fast.

1773
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:22,620
Oh no, he fell.

1774
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,690
Runners always fall in relays.

1775
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:25,890
(TAEYOUNG, YU, Keiju, Kim Seung Mo)

1776
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,060
How fast.

1777
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,630
(What just happened?)

1778
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,830
(CRAVITY lost the baton.)

1779
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,170
- The first to fall down.
- Get up.

1780
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:34,270
(AMPERS and ONE
takes the chance to overtake.)

1781
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:35,340
Unbelievable.

1782
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,470
The previous runner must pick it up.

1783
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,110
Runners often fall
after rounding the corner.

1784
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:42,640
We need to check if the previous runner...

1785
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,740
picked up the baton
and passed it to the next runner.

1786
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,410
Exactly. That has to be verified.

1787
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,810
All right, he's overwhelmingly fast.

1788
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,350
Be careful.

1789
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,480
They're running.

1790
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,220
- Be careful, KYRELL.
- Because...

1791
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,590
- the fans are cheering,
- Yes.

1792
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,760
- they're getting pumped up.
- You get hyper.

1793
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,890
- He's super fast.
- Yes, incredibly fast.

1794
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:59,630
AMPERS and ONE is running fast.

1795
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:00,990
The last runner.

1796
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,300
(The last runner takes off.)

1797
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,430
The last runner.

1798
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:07,130
It's KAMDEN.

1799
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,570
- KAMDEN.
- Yes, KAMDEN.

1800
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,370
It's KAMDEN of AMPERS and ONE.

1801
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,610
- He's fast.
- KAMDEN.

1802
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,710
KAMDEN is running strong.

1803
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:17,910
He comes in first place.

1804
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,510
(AMPERS and ONE takes 1st place!)

1805
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:21,450
KAMDEN of AMPERS and ONE
is in first place.

1806
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:22,920
Second place is…

1807
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,380
Amazing.

1808
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:26,790
So many things have happened.

1809
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:27,920
Exactly.

1810
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,360
TAEYOUNG fell...

1811
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,330
while passing the baton.

1812
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,390
His legs gave way.

1813
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,690
He stumbled.

1814
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,730
(CRAVITY fell while passing the baton.)

1815
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,070
(He can't hide his disappointment.)

1816
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,500
TAEYOUNG is upset.

1817
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,840
I thought he might be hurt,
but he's just frustrated.

1818
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,340
He can't get over his anger.

1819
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,500
No recording, please.

1820
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,670
No, stop.

1821
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,740
(We must protect TAEYOUNG.)

1822
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,010
No, don't.

1823
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,380
He can't get over his anger.

1824
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,540
He's blaming himself.

1825
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,080
- But it can happen. Don't worry.
- It's okay.

1826
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,650
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1827
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:57,850
The results are in,
with no disqualifications.

1828
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,820
AMPERS and ONE and KickFlip
advance to the finals.

1829
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,060
The guys are truly fast.

1830
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,230
- There are so many variables too.
- Right.

1831
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,600
Group Two
of the men's preliminary round...

1832
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,270
for the 400m relay will begin.

1833
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,530
In lane one, LUN8.

1834
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,170
I'm excited to see if LUN8 can stop
andTEAM's dominance.

1835
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,840
In lane two, NOWZ.

1836
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,210
NOWZ.

1837
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,410
In lane three, andTEAM.

1838
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,210
andTEAM.

1839
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,410
- Look at how relaxed he is.
- Good.

1840
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,820
In lane four, P1Harmony.

1841
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,390
P1Harmony won a bronze medal
in the 400m relay in 2022.

1842
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,490
- On your mark.
- Can they...

1843
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,760
stop andTEAM's solo run?

1844
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,860
Let's watch with hope.

1845
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,300
Everyone is keeping andTEAM
in lane three in check.

1846
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,560
Exactly.

1847
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,000
andTEAM is a strong contender for the win.

1848
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,640
Get set.

1849
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,540
(What will be the result of Group Two?)

1850
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,370
(Go.)

1851
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,510
- It has started.
- They're off!

1852
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:55,840
- How fast.
- Two teams will go to the finals.

1853
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,740
- andTEAM is fast.
- The runners must widen the gap here.

1854
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,410
- andTEAM is indeed incredible.
- andTEAM.

1855
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,550
- As expected.
- Amazing.

1856
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,450
(andTEAM takes the lead in a flash.)

1857
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,090
As expected.

1858
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,460
- They must keep to their lanes.
- andTEAM.

1859
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,790
The baton pass of andTEAM was smooth.

1860
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,290
What is up with andTEAM?

1861
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,900
Is andTEAM a track team?

1862
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,200
Will nobody be able to beat andTEAM?

1863
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,670
- Can nobody beat andTEAM?
- NICHOLAS.

1864
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:24,140
- But you never know.
- Unbelievable.

1865
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,440
- Just look at the gap.
- We don't know yet.

1866
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,480
As long as the members don't fall down...

1867
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:33,210
It feels like the team
only has track-and-field athletes.

1868
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,950
- How can they be so fast?
- Right?

1869
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,520
- He has turned the corner.
- He's too fast.

1870
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,490
Is there no one who can stop
andTEAM's dominance?

1871
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:40,850
- They're just too fast.
- Right?

1872
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,660
The baton pass was smooth.

1873
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,060
- Their baton pass was perfect.
- The last runner is JO.

1874
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,730
(JO of andTEAM, Chael of LUN8)

1875
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,700
(Shocked)

1876
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,140
(andTEAM dropped the baton.)

1877
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:01,070
- What an upset.
- Pick it up fast.

1878
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,380
Chael.

1879
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:04,540
- What's this?
- What just happened?

1880
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,750
(LUN8 comes in 1st place.)

1881
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,210
LUN8 got lucky.

1882
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,980
That was like a scene from a drama.

1883
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,250
He dropped the baton, right?

1884
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,520
- Yes.
- For real?

1885
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,850
But he won't get disqualified.

1886
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,820
- No, right?
- JO picked it up.

1887
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,560
But either way, andTEAM only had...

1888
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,490
- to finish in 1st or 2nd place.
- True.

1889
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,960
- Even so, andTEAM still came in second.
- Yes.

1890
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,870
Chael was really fast in the 50m,
wasn't he?

1891
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:30,800
andTEAM widened the gap so much that
they still finished second...

1892
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,410
- despite dropping the baton.
- Exactly.

1893
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:34,410
They're incredible.

1894
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,410
Had he not dropped it,
he would've come in first place.

1895
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,750
Imagine if this were the finals.

1896
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,650
- He'd be full of regret.
- Right?

1897
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,550
- He wouldn't get a wink of sleep.
- No.

1898
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:44,050
- He'd go to bed with it on his mind.
- Really?

1899
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,020
He'd regret dropping it.

1900
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,390
- Of course.
- He'll have it in his arms.

1901
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:50,190
In 1st place is LUN8,
and in 2nd is andTEAM.

1902
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,660
- Yes.
- They've advanced to the finals.

1903
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,060
It's the finale of
the Idol Star Athletics Championships,

1904
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,500
the women's 400m relay finals.

1905
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,130
These are the 4 teams that came in
1st and 2nd...

1906
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,700
- in the preliminary rounds.
- Yes.

1907
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,340
Reporter BELLE of KISS OF LIFE...

1908
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,570
is waiting at the scene.

1909
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,380
Please say a word before the finals...

1910
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:11,080
of 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships Chuseok Special.

1911
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,380
I'm in no way going to lose.

1912
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,720
I will come in first place.

1913
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,950
- Let's go!
- Gosh.

1914
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:22,020
You'll regret competing...

1915
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,660
- in the finals today.
- Oh, dear.

1916
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,720
Be prepared.

1917
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,060
Goodness.

1918
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,330
Since Hearts2Hearts made it to the finals,

1919
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,300
we will go home as the winners.
Let's do this!

1920
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:33,700
Nice one.

1921
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,840
Since we've made it this far,
we'll also win.

1922
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,900
Let's do this!

1923
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,410
(Good luck!)

1924
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:40,240
All four teams...

1925
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:43,740
- have shown their great tenacity to win.
- That's right.

1926
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,210
In lane one, FIFTY FIFTY.

1927
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,150
In lane two, Queenz Eye.

1928
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,920
In lane three, Hearts2Hearts.

1929
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:01,060
In lane four, Kep1er.

1930
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,960
Yu Jin.

1931
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,200
On your mark.

1932
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
(Who will win
the women's 400m relay race?)

1933
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,510
All right, it's a single-round match now.

1934
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,010
The match between the first runners,
JUUN and Choi Yu Jin,

1935
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:16,280
will be interesting.

1936
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,540
- JUUN versus Choi Yu Jin.
- Yes.

1937
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,680
That's right. Lanes 3 and 4.

1938
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,280
- Personally, CHANELLE MOON.
- Same.

1939
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,780
- I have high hopes.
- She's far from ordinary.

1940
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,850
(A nerve-racking moment)

1941
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,720
Get set.

1942
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,860
(The women's final begins.)

1943
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,890
(JUUN of Hearts2Hearts,
Choi Yu Jin of Kep1er)

1944
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,300
They must turn the corner fast.

1945
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,330
- As expected, she's fast.
- They're off.

1946
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:40,070
- Choi Yu Jin is fast.
- Yes, she's fast.

1947
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,670
- CHANELLE MOON is fast.
- How fast.

1948
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:42,770
- JUUN.
- CHANELLE MOON.

1949
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:44,900
- Her strides are big.
- Amazing.

1950
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,810
- She outruns Yu Jin.
- CHANELLE MOON.

1951
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,010
JUUN is fast.

1952
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:51,480
It's a neck-and-neck match.

1953
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,110
Huening Bahiyyih is fast.

1954
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,950
- Kep1er is catching up.
- Huening Bahiyyih.

1955
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,820
- She's super fast.
- Huening Bahiyyih.

1956
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,120
Run.

1957
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,890
They must catch up on the straight course.

1958
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,250
- Right now.
- Huening Bahiyyih.

1959
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,290
Catch up to her.

1960
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:05,190
(Right now, Hearts2Hearts is in the lead.)

1961
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,590
She couldn't close the gap.

1962
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,830
They're still wide apart.

1963
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:10,130
- Here...
- They have caught up now.

1964
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,830
Here they go.

1965
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:14,470
- IAN is in the lead.
- Yes, be careful of IAN.

1966
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,770
- Hikaru...
- IAN is good at running.

1967
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,570
- Exactly.
- She's got long legs.

1968
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,810
- Her strides are...
- Right? It's her long legs.

1969
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,080
- And...
- She's on a roll.

1970
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,710
- She's running very calmly.
- She's calm.

1971
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,480
- IAN is always calm.
- Right?

1972
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,710
She was calm even during shooting.

1973
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:27,810
It's hard to maintain...

1974
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,680
- such a calm face during a 400m run.
- Exactly.

1975
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,280
- The last runners.
- Okay.

1976
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,290
(CARMEN, Kim Da Yeon)

1977
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:33,450
- CARMEN.
- CARMEN.

1978
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,450
She's fast.

1979
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,820
- As expected.
- Kim Da Yeon of Kep1er...

1980
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,960
- is also fast.
- Gosh.

1981
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,760
- Indeed.
- She's fast.

1982
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,890
- Run.
- CARMEN.

1983
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,630
As long as CARMEN doesn't fall down...

1984
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,630
- As long as she doesn't fall down...
- CARMEN.

1985
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,830
Catch up to her in the corner.

1986
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,270
- Don't fall down.
- CARMEN.

1987
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:50,540
- CARMEN.
- Hearts2Hearts wins.

1988
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,470
- CARMEN.
- CARMEN.

1989
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,510
Hearts2Hearts wins.

1990
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,910
(Hearts2Hearts wins the gold medal.)

1991
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:58,310
They've won.

1992
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,850
Congratulations.

1993
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,280
From heart to heart.

1994
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,380
They were always in the lead.

1995
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,220
(Congratulations.)

1996
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,090
Coming in at 1 minute and 15.42 seconds,

1997
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,160
Hearts2Hearts wins first place.

1998
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,790
("STYLE" by Hearts2Hearts
to celebrate their victory)

1999
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:17,500
Hearts2Hearts' song is playing.

2000
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,140
They're SM Entertainment's
perfect dance group.

2001
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,970
(A perfect dance group)

2002
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,110
They're a talented group.

2003
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:32,210
- Yes.
- Of course.

2004
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:33,380
Everyone is enjoying it.

2005
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,450
(Everyone enjoys
the Idol Star Athletics Championships.)

2006
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,290
A perfect dance group.

2007
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,060
- A perfect dance group.
- Great.

2008
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,560
Hearts2Hearts is such a cute group.

2009
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,560
Right?

2010
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,660
We came on
the Idol Star Athletics Championships...

2011
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,300
for the first time.

2012
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,130
Winning the gold medal in a relay race
makes me really happy.

2013
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,540
How is everyone feeling?

2014
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,540
- We're really happy.
- We're really happy.

2015
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,470
We love you, S2U.

2016
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:01,470
It's all thanks to S2U cheering for us.

2017
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,580
(Congratulations on winning
the women's 400m relay race.)

2018
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:09,880
Before we watch
the men's 400m relay finals,

2019
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:12,250
I heard there was a special event.

2020
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,590
A Fan Athletics Championships was held,

2021
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,650
where fans ran and experienced...

2022
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,620
the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

2023
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:17,690
The amazing Fan Athletics Championships,

2024
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,330
where gold, silver, and bronze medals...

2025
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,760
were decided based on the fans' records,

2026
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,400
and donations were made
under the artists' names.

2027
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:23,930
Here are...

2028
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,000
- the results.
- the results.

2029
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,070
(The 2025 1st Fan Athletics Championships
Final Results)

2030
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,400
(1st place: andTEAM)

2031
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,670
(Final total: 149,676,610)

2032
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:30,970
(andTEAM wins
the 1st Fan Athletics Championships.)

2033
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,340
(Congratulations, LUNE.)

2034
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,210
Here's the last event.

2035
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:38,650
We only have
the men's 400m relay finals left.

2036
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,650
That's right.

2037
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:42,320
As expected,
the forever front-runner andTEAM...

2038
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,450
is defending their place
in the finals line-up.

2039
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:50,020
- Yes.
- Which team do you predict will win?

2040
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:52,060
To beat andTEAM,
the runners must beat MAKI.

2041
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,930
If the first runners beat MAKI,
they might have a chance to win.

2042
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:55,930
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2043
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,730
- Is MAKI in good condition today?
- Yes.

2044
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:01,130
He's really doing his part
as the first runner.

2045
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,140
That's right.

2046
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,300
But then again,

2047
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,810
- Chael of LUN8...
- Yes?

2048
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,010
is as strong as MAKI,

2049
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,510
- isn't he?
- Chael?

2050
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,850
- Yes.
- He's strong and the new dark horse.

2051
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:13,780
I'm guessing he stood out to you, Eun Ji.

2052
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,550
Tell us...

2053
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:17,550
your resolve for the finals.

2054
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,120
Had we thought of losing,
we wouldn't have come this far.

2055
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:23,720
And if we win,

2056
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,930
the glory goes to ANDEAR.

2057
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,900
LUV8, I hope we make a good record...

2058
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,930
just as we practiced,
without getting hurt.

2059
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:34,670
Let's run with all our might. Come on!

2060
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,470
(Good luck.)

2061
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,740
andTEAM will win again without a doubt,

2062
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:44,240
so watch in peace, LUNE.

2063
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,150
Let's go.

2064
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,350
- In peace.
- Look at how relaxed he is. Such a swag.

2065
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,180
We'll give it our all. Let's do this.

2066
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,520
The men's finals...

2067
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,090
for the 400m relay will begin.

2068
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,290
In lane one, AMPERS and ONE.

2069
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,370
In lane two, LUN8.

2070
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,300
In lane three, andTEAM.

2071
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,010
MAKI is relaxed.

2072
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,610
In lane four, KickFlip.

2073
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,480
KickFlip is competing for the first time.

2074
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,910
It's their first appearance...

2075
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,220
- On your mark.
- on this show.

2076
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,520
- Okay.
- All right, let's go.

2077
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,820
The last event, the highlight of
the Idol Star Athletics Championships:

2078
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,550
It's the last event, the 400m relay.

2079
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,960
The men's finals.

2080
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,220
All of their expressions are...

2081
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,690
(Nervous)

2082
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:33,860
- I bet they're too nervous to focus.
- How serious?

2083
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,860
(Fired up)

2084
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,460
- He's picture-perfect.
- Right?

2085
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:38,700
- He reminds me of the Terminator.
- I'm scared.

2086
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,730
"I'll be back."

2087
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:41,000
How adorable.

2088
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:45,810
Get set.

2089
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,270
(The men's final...)

2090
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:48,540
(begins.)

2091
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,980
- Run.
- They're off.

2092
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,510
- How fast.
- He's fast.

2093
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,380
- MAKI.
- As expected of MAKI.

2094
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,850
(Keiju, MAKI, Jun Woo, Kim Seung Mo)

2095
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:59,550
(A fierce, finals-worthy match)

2096
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:02,020
- But Keiju of KickFlip is also fast.
- He's fast.

2097
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,090
- Keiju.
- Keiju is fast.

2098
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,790
- What'll happen to MAKI?
- MAKI.

2099
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:06,790
How fast.

2100
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:08,830
(They passed the baton at the same time.)

2101
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:12,400
- We don't know what's going to happen.
- No, we don't.

2102
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,700
(NICHOLAS takes the lead.)

2103
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,730
NICHOLAS.

2104
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,800
It's still too close to call.
They're still running.

2105
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,240
LUN8 is right there too.

2106
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,670
KickFlip is also fast.

2107
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,540
Good, he's closing the gap.

2108
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,940
- However...
- The tables could turn.

2109
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,110
- andTEAM.
- andTEAM.

2110
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,850
- They're still in the lead.
- If he falls,

2111
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,420
everything could change.

2112
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,850
(Jin Su of LUN8 drops the baton.)

2113
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:36,520
- He dropped the baton.
- He made a mistake.

2114
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,690
(The two leading teams
have pulled far ahead now.)

2115
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,160
How will the results be?

2116
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,960
- From now on...
- They've turned the corner.

2117
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,060
(The last runners are off.)

2118
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,230
- The baton pass...
- He's catching up.

2119
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,300
was clean.

2120
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,400
(JO, Dong Hyeon)

2121
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,240
Will he be able to catch up?

2122
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,140
- Okay.
- Wait.

2123
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,870
He's trying to catch up,
but will he succeed?

2124
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,180
- He's fast.
- Let's see.

2125
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,010
JO is...

2126
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:01,810
andTEAM wins.

2127
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:04,250
- andTEAM.
- andTEAM.

2128
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:06,490
The defending champions.

2129
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:11,090
Just as expected,
nobody could stop andTEAM's dominance.

2130
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:13,090
They finished in under a minute.

2131
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:15,430
Congratulations to andTEAM
on their victory.

2132
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:16,930
Congratulations!

2133
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,560
(Congratulations on winning again,
andTEAM!)

2134
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,070
("Yukiakari" by andTEAM
to celebrate their victory)

2135
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,130
Nice.

2136
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,970
Since andTEAM's song is playing,

2137
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,640
- it means there were no fouls.
- No.

2138
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,810
And no disqualifications. Congratulations.

2139
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,940
Congratulations.

2140
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:33,580
(andTEAM showed an amazing game.)

2141
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:43,990
(In total bliss)

2142
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,800
Winning the gold medal
in the relay race again...

2143
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,670
this year
at Idol Star Athletics Championships...

2144
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,570
makes us really happy.

2145
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:59,610
Thank you to LUNE
for cheering us on. We love you.

2146
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,740
(Fandom name)

2147
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:05,850
With this, all the events of
2025 Idol Star Athletics Championships,

2148
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,580
Chuseok Special, have come to an end.

2149
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:10,220
Thank you to all the idols...

2150
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,390
who practiced long hours,
sweating and crying,

2151
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:17,290
preparing for the games
with great passion.

2152
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:22,760
Thanks to everyone, we were able
to celebrate the 15th anniversary.

2153
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,100
We appreciate it greatly.

2154
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,200
Wishing you...

2155
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,770

2156
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:30,340

2157
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,800
Bye!
