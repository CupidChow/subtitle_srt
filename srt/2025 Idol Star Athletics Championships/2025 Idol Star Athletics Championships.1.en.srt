00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,400
will say hello.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
I'm the returning commentator

(Jun Hyun Moo, Commentator)

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,930
Hello.

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,670
I'm a new commentator
of the Idol Star Athletics Championships,

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,640
- My goodness.
- Lee Chang Sub of BTOB. Nice to meet you.

16
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,810
Until 2018, I entered the Idol Star
Athletics Championships as an athlete.

17
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,980
You entered the archery event.

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,450
Yes, I entered the archery event.

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,180
Before that, I did track and field.

20
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,950
I'm back as a commentator
after seven years.

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,490
Since I'm the only former athlete
among the commentators,

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,720
I'll provide vivid commentaries
that come from my experience.

23
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,460
Hello,

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,930
I'm a new commentator
of the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm Comedienne Lee Eun Ji.
It's nice to meet you.

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,700
(Lee Eun Ji, Commentator)

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,430
I absolutely love K-pop.

28
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,370
As someone who's crazy about K-pop,

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,070
I'll do my best to deliver...

30
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,970
the heated atmosphere of the stadium.

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,010
Thank you.

32
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,240
That's reassuring.

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,280
Let's go.

34
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,910
Hello, I'm the first foreign commentator
of the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

35
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,380
Are you a foreigner?

36
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,020
- Aren't you Korean?
- That's what it says on the script.

37
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,980
- You're Korean.
- But it says that I'm...

38
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,120
- the first foreign commentator.
- Really?

39
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,490
I'm Jonathan. It's nice to meet you.

40
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,290
You're the IM

41
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,430
What's "IM?"

42
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,630
"IM" stands for...

43
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,690
"Idol master."

44
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,130
- IM
- It's a well-known fact among my friends.

45
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,730
Hosting a show about idols
for four years...

46
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,340
made me knowledgeable.

47
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,640
I think I'll be able to help
with the commentaries.

48
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,410
I've prepared some tidbits of information,

49
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,510
so please look forward to them.

50
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,740
(Please look forward
to the tidbits of information.)

51
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,750
To celebrate the 15th anniversary,

52
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,420
we have the largest number of people
on Idol Star Athletics Championships.

53
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,320
- Usually, we have about 250 people.
- Okay.

54
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,390
Today, we have 374 people.

55
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,720
The largest number of idols
have entered...

56
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,160
the 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

57
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,630
Which events will we see?

58
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,460
Firstly, there is...

59
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,760
the flower
of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

60
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,070
It's the event that has given birth
to many stars,

61
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,170
track and field.

62
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,210
Look forward to the 60m race
and 400m relay.

63
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,280
Yes. And there's the event...

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,210
that has given birth
to many famous scenes...

65
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,480
with the fancy outfits
and passionate dance moves.

66
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,480
Look forward to dancesport as well.

67
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,820
Moreover,
ssireum will have the strongest idols...

68
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,720
compete against each other.

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,890
And penalty shoot-out...

70
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,060
will have the idols play
a 11m Russian roulette...

71
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,990
on the field.

72
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,890
The representative event...

73
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,200
of Idol Star Athletics Championships,
archery,

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,930
has been excluded this year.

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,770
Instead of archery,
we have a newly-formed event.

76
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,400
It's the event we're very excited about.

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
- That's right.
- Yes.

78
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,140
It's the event...

79
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,540
that gave us the world-renowned star,
Kim Ye Ji.

80
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,440
The new event is pistol shooting.

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,580
(It's something you can only see
on Idol Star Athletics Championships.)

82
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,850
The participating athletes...

83
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,820
have practiced diligently
at the shooting range...

84
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,320
over a long period of time.

85
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,350
So viewers, please look forward to it.

86
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,220
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special,

87
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,130
is aspiring to have a safe competition
without any injuries.

88
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,260
For the safety of the athletes
and audience members,

89
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,670
medical professionals
and medical devices have been prepared.

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,170
We'll work hard to eliminate any injuries
on Idol Star Athletics Championships.

91
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,970
That sounds good.
The athletes shouldn't get injured.

92
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,470
Even if it's a fun event,

93
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,340
there shouldn't be any injuries.

94
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,380
I agree.

95
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,380
To prevent injuries,

96
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,380
warming up the body is a must.

97
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,550
- That's right.
- Yes.

98
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,280
We prepared a special warmup exercise...

99
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,550
of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

100
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,520
To help the athletes
with the warmup exercise,

101
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,260
mascots
of Idol Star Athletics Championships...

102
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,130
will enter.

103
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,130
(Curious)

104
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,200
You'll have a warmup exercise...

105
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,430
with the small, but brave cookies...

106
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,830
who escaped from the oven!

107
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,400
We introduce GingerBrave and his friends!

108
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,440
GingerBrave and his friends!

109
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,640
(Cute)

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
(How cute!)

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,250
Oh, my!

112
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,780
(Everyone's attention is on the mascots.)

113
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,320
(Mascots enter to help
with the warmup exercise!)

114
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,620
Hello.

115
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,120
(They're so cute.)

116
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,760
(All of them are ready.)

117
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,560
- Let's copy them.
- Of course.

118
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,160
It's the national warmup routine.

119
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,760
It's the familiar melody.

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,470
- It's the familiar melody.
- It was around my time as well.

121
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,970
(Their bodies move automatically
to the familiar melody.)

122
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,270
What?

123
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,380
(Look at that!)

124
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,440
(Why is everyone surprised?)

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
(What?)

126
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
(Why is everyone surprised?)

127
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
What?

128
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,850
What's this?

129
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,120
(They suddenly transform.)

130
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,250
(Perfect angle)

131
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,720
Oh, my!

132
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,720
This isn't the national warmup routine.
It looks like a dance challenge.

133
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760
(It suits their taste.)

134
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,730
(A dance routine is more fitting
for the idols' festival.)

135
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,530
It's "Love Shot."

136
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,800
(Let's begin the warmup exercise
for Idol Star Athletics Championships!)

137
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,640
("Love Shot" by EXO)

138
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,240
I think warming up with a dance routine...

139
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,610
- will make your body more flexible.
- It's a fun exercise.

140
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,410
That's right.
You can control the strength.

141
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,010
Let's go.

142
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,250
There you go.

143
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,450
This is good.

144
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,920
(Winking)

145
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,790
Everyone is doing the dance.

146
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,220
(The response is explosive.)

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,860
(Highly satisfied)

148
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,470
(What will come
after the impactful first song?)

149
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,240
("Kick It" by NCT 127)

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,310
("Kick It" by NCT 127)

151
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,340
Let's warm up the legs.

152
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,580
(The dance is the perfect leg exercise.)

153
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,850
<i>Bruce Lee</i>

154
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,200
(What's the next song?)

155
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:07,570
("Whiplash" by aespa)

156
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,610
- It's the perfect neck exercise.
- You're right.

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,950
It's a very fascinating sight.

158
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,710
All the idols are dancing together.

159
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,180
I know.

160
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,920
(The atmosphere gets heated up.)

161
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,190
He's dancing very passionately.

162
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,600
(They warm up every part of their body.)

163
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
(Which song
will keep the atmosphere heated up?)

164
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,210
This song is "like JENNIE."

165
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,610
("like JENNIE" by Jennie)

166
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,310
This song will lead to
another fascinating sight.

167
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,110
The youngsters know all the dance moves.

168
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,050
- Of course.
- They'll dance in unison.

169
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,110
They'll dance in unison.

170
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,920
(Correct)

171
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,090
- Someone went up on the stage.
- Someone did that.

172
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,160
(An unexpected situation)

173
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,560
- Someone went up on the stage.
- Someone did that.

174
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,620
Someone went up on the stage.

175
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,530
(Who is this?)

176
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,600
- Someone did that.
- Someone went up on the stage.

177
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,230
HYEONGJUN went up on the stage.

178
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,230
(HYEONGJUN of CRAVITY)

179
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,040
HYEONGJUN went up on the stage.

180
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,540
(GingerBrave)

181
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,440
He's really good.

182
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,840
(Thanks to him,
the atmosphere gets heated up.)

183
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,340
HYEONGJUN!

184
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,280
Like HYEONGJUN!

185
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,410
(Powerful)

186
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,850
- He's good.
- This is nice.

187
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,320
(Group dance)

188
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,720
Everyone knows the dance.

189
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,590
All right.

190
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,360
(Everyone becomes one
through K-pop dance.)

191
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,460
It was great.

192
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,430
(What's this song with the introduction
that excites everyone?)

193
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,070
(No way)

194
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,970
("Soda Pop" by Saja Boys)

195
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,180
All of these incredible idols...

196
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,180
are doing a K-pop challenge
at the same place.

197
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,320
It's something you can only see
on Idol Star Athletics Championships,

198
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,620
in my opinion.

199
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,720
That's right.

200
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,590
(Their excitement level is at its max.)

201
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,460
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special,

202
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,730
- starts now!
- It starts now!

203
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,170
- All right!
- Let's go!

204
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,770
(Track and field)

205
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,470
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special,

206
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,810
will begin with an event
that's the root of the show.

207
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,280
Let's begin with the 60m race
of track and field.

208
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,620
We have a new face
on Idol Star Athletics Championships.

209
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,290
During the 2024 Summer Games in Paris,
he was MBC's track and field commentator.

210
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,520
He's Commentator Kim Kuk Young. Welcome.

211
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,930
- Welcome.
- Hello.

212
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,030
It's nice to meet you. Hello.

213
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,900
My name is Kim Kuk Young
and I'm a track and field commentator.

214
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,130
You need to find your footing here.

215
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,330
How does it feel to be here?

216
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,400
I've only watched
Idol Star Athletics Championships on TV,

217
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,700
and here I am today.

218
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Welcome.

219
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,770
So that I can return for ten years,

220
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,270
I'll work hard today.

221
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,310
That sounds good.

222
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,640
By the way, Kim Ku Young...

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,340
- It's Kim Kuk Young.
- Okay.

224
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,350
It isn't Kim Ku Young.

225
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,180
I struggle with the Korean language.

226
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,150
- You're Korean.
- I'm sorry.

227
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,680
Kim Kuk Young,

228
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,620
- you've only retired two years ago.
- Yes.

229
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,320
Sprints were your main event.

230
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,490
What's the charm of sprint?

231
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,030
It ends in a short amount of time.

232
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,760
Thus, the event is full
of suspense and liveliness.

233
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,060
It's like a short-form video.

234
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,770
- Okay.
- You get a dopamine rush.

235
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,940
(I understood fully.)

236
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,170
- Right?
- You're right.

237
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,770
I've entered...

238
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,440
that dopamine-filled event as an athlete.

239
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,810
- I remember. I was a commentator then.
- Okay.

240
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,510
He fell behind so much
that cameras couldn't film him.

241
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,350
(In the 2016 Idol Star
Athletics Championships,)

242
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,610
(Chang Sub entered a relay.)

243
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
The relay begins.

244
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,050
(He disappeared
as soon as the relay began.)

245
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,050
He's fast.

246
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,690
(Jimin of BTS ran fast.)

247
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,590
(Chang Sub could only see Jimin's back.)

248
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,490
Even when you tell yourself
that you won't overdo it,

249
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,290
- the fans' cheers...
- That's right.

250
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,730
and the teammates' gaze...

251
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,430
suddenly give you...

252
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,630
- a competitive streak.
- That's right.

253
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,870
And when you see a fellow runner's back,
you can't stand it.

254
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,970
You become annoyed.

255
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,670
I hope everyone will focus on
enjoying the competition...

256
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,470
and run safely.

257
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,910
That's right. They should focus on safety.

258
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,250
For the athletes' safety and fair results,
Idol Star Athletics Championships...

259
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,180
set up suitable tracks
for official competitions.

260
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,390
Medical professionals
and devices are always at hand.

261
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,790
Let's begin with the starting event
of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

262
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,530
We'll broadcast
the 60m race of track and field.

263
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,530
Watching the actual race...

264
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,000
will help the idols understand.

265
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,570
The Cookies will help once more.

266
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,570
The Cookies will run as a demonstration.

267
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,770
Get set.

268
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,670
(The Cookies' demonstrative run starts!)

269
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,540
GingerBrave is leading.

270
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,110
GingerBrave!

271
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,250
- GingerBrave!
- GingerBrave!

272
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,450
- GingerBrave...
- GingerBrave!

273
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,710
is leading.

274
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,050
They're running diligently.

275
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,620
- That's right.
- They're doing well.

276
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,390
The second runner wants to get ahead.

277
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,690
His hard work is paying off.

278
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,520
- He's relaxed.
- That's how you do it.

279
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,790
- He's relaxed.
- He's good.

280
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,790
(Cooke that placed 1st,
come into my mouth!)

281
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,930
(Strawberry Cookie)

282
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,700
(Let's do better next time.)

283
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,070
We'll soon begin...

284
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,670
women's preliminary rounds
for the 60m race.

285
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,340
What should we look forward to?

286
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,710
Women's 60m race of track and field...

287
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,610
is known as the gateway
to a successful career for rookie idols.

288
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,280
So, this year as well,

289
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,580
many new faces with incredible backgrounds
have entered the event.

290
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,020
Kaeun of Dalshabet made a record
that hasn't been broken in ten years.

291
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,190
Will we see a new talent
in track and field...

292
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,590
who will break the record of 7.69 seconds?

293
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,630
Which new records will we see this year?

294
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,400
That's what we should pay attention to.

295
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,570
- Okay.
- In that case, Commentator Kim,

296
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,770
is there an athlete who stands out?

297
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,870
- There is one.
- Who is it?

298
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,270
Is it an athlete you personally like?

299
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,740
- No.
- His wife is watching.

300
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,810
I'm sorry.

301
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,710
It's Nien of tripleS.

302
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,880
- Nien.
- Yes.

303
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,280
She placed first
in the preliminary rounds,

304
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,420
but won the silver medal
in the final rounds last year.

305
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Yes.

306
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,860
I bet she gritted her teeth
and practiced hard.

307
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,420
Then there's the idol who's entering
for the first time this year,

308
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,290
Kumi of Baby DONT Cry.

309
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,760
Apparently,
she did track and field in Japan.

310
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,530
Her goal is eight seconds, so...

311
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,800
- Oh, my.
- Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

312
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,700
Eight seconds is a very good result...

313
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
- for female runners.
- It's a very good result.

314
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
I'll look forward to it today.

315
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,570
(Who will be the dark horse today?)

316
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,640
Group One of women's preliminary rounds,
please enter the track.

317
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,040
(Group 1 of Women's Preliminary Rounds
for the 60m Race)

318
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,810
(CHAENA, Won Chae, BELLE,
Arin, RAHEE, NAGOMI)

319
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,650
This year, many teams are entering...

320
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,550
Idol Star Athletics Championships
for the first time.

321
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,920
Thus, we can look forward to seeing
new talent in track and field.

322
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,190
If I remember correctly,
BELLE is very tall.

323
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,090
BELLE is Shim Shin's daughter.

324
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,290
That's right.

325
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,030
On your mark.

326
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,660
It'll begin now.

327
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,800
(Nervous)

328
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,500
It must be the most nerve-racking moment.

329
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,400
(Nervous)

330
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,970
(Good luck.)

331
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,970
Get set.

332
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,510
- It'll begin now.
- There they go.

333
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,210
There they go.

334
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,380
She had a late start.

335
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,480
- She's fast.
- Arin.

336
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,750
- Arin is fast.
- All right.

337
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,780
- Won Chae.
- Arin.

338
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,890
- Won Chae.
- RAHEE.

339
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,590
- Won Chae, a bit more.
- RAHEE.

340
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,990
Won Chae, a bit more.

341
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,120
All right.

342
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,030
She finished first.

343
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,460
The idols with long limbs...

344
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,270
ran with long strides.

345
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,000
She was flawless
from the beginning to the end.

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,940
Her form was very stable.

347
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,040
That's right.

348
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,140
Due to the difference of 0.12 seconds,
Won Chae placed second.

349
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,310
That's heartbreaking.

350
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,410
Unfortunately,

351
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,050
only those who place first
can enter the final round.

352
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,620
We'll now begin the 60m race...

353
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,450
for Group Two
of women's preliminary rounds.

354
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
In Group Two as well,

355
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,190
only the first-place winner
will advance to the final round.

356
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,260
That's right.

357
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,930
- Group Two's race will begin now.
- Okay.

358
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,900
You should pay attention
to Harin of KIIRAS on Lane One.

359
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,600
She was a high jumper in fifth grade.

360
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,600
- High jump.
- Yes.

361
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,170
According to my research,

362
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,770
- Harin is...
- Okay.

363
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,210
- is very competitive.
- Okay.

364
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,240
In middle school,

365
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,180
she was the top of her class
in terms of grade.

366
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,280
She was the top of her class.

367
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,410
That continues on to today's event.

368
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,980
- That's right.
- How does it continue on?

369
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,320
- How...
- I'm talking about her mindset.

370
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm talking about her mindset.
That continues on.

371
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,520
- On your mark.
- On your mark.

372
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,530
- Her hands are shaking a bit.
- That's right.

373
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,460
- They must be very nervous.
- It's nerve-racking.

374
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,060
- It's a preliminary round.
- Yes.

375
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,900
Even if they get nervous,
I hope they won't sustain any injuries.

376
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,870
They need to be careful.

377
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,740
- Pay attention.
- Get set.

378
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,270
(The race begins.)

379
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,270
It has started.

380
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,710
- There they go.
- She started off fast.

381
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,740
- There they go.
- There they go.

382
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,340
- But...
- HANEUL.

383
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,640
(HANEUL takes the lead.)

384
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,450
HANEUL takes the lead.

385
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,110
- HANEUL is fast.
- HANEUL is fast.

386
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,350
- HANEUL.
- HANEUL is fast.

387
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,880
(HANEUL passes the finish line first.)

388
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,390
- HANEUL.
- HANEUL of KISS OF LIFE.

389
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,690
- She's a strong candidate.
- HANEUL of KISS OF LIFE.

390
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,460
HANEUL is fast.

391
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,230
- Of course.
- She was relaxed.

392
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,730
With a difference of 0.41 seconds,

393
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,030
HANEUL placed first.

394
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,870
Her record was 10.23 seconds.

395
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,930
I get jealous when I watch them.

396
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,300
Is there no Entertainer
Athletics Championships?

397
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,570
BTOB once transformed
Idol Star Athletics Championships...

398
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,240
- with laughter.
- Entertainer Athletics Championships.

399
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,210
- We transformed the show.
- That's right.

400
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,640
(In 2016, Seo Eun Kwang
transformed into a centaur.)

401
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,350
Seriously.

402
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,610
(His skills were top-notch!)

403
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,680
(Neighing)

404
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,820
(Good job.)

405
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,350
We'll now begin the 60m race...

406
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,490
- for Group Three...
- All right.

407
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,530
- of women's preliminary rounds.
- Group Three's race will follow.

408
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,560
Okay.

409
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,260
This time,
more than half of the runners...

410
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,970
- have done this before.
- I'm looking forward to Group Three.

411
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,900
WOOYEON of woo!ah! is on Lane Five.

412
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,670
Apparently, she's very good at copying
Bo Chan in "Crayon Shin Chan."

413
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,940
I really want to hear it.

414
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,780
I'm pretty good at it too.

415
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,210
Do you have time for it?

416
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,510
- No.
- Okay.

417
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,010
I hope she wins the gold medal.

418
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,350
The two of you should go outside...

419
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,850
- and talk it out.
- I think...

420
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,620
- I'll strangle him today.
- Yes.

421
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,820
I think it'll happen.

422
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,220
(We hope their friendship
will last forever!)

423
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,460
On your mark.

424
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,190
INA of BADVILLAIN
used to do artistic gymnastics.

425
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,490
(INA of BADVILLAIN
used to do artistic gymnastics.)

426
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,030
(Which runner will advance
to the final round?)

427
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
- Get set.
- This is nerve-racking.

428
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Let's go.

429
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,370
- It has begun.
- There they go.

430
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,440
- Lane Three...
- SHEON.

431
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,210
- didn't start quickly.
- SHEON.

432
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,870
- She fell down.
- She fell down.

433
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,080
- She fell down.
- She fell down.

434
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,380
- Is she hurt?
- Will ARIA place first?

435
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,610
(It's hard to tell
how the remaining runners will rank.)

436
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,180
Will ARIA place first?

437
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,620
Did ARIA place first?

438
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,590
- INA?
- Is it INA or ARIA?

439
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,120
I think it's ARIA.

440
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,420
(Who came in first?)

441
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,160
We'll check the video.

442
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes.

443
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,960
ARIA.

444
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,730
- It's ARIA, right?
- Yes.

445
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,600
- Her body entered first.
- Yes.

446
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,230
ARIA placed first.

447
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,970
ARIA placed 1st.
Her record is 10.18 seconds.

448
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,610
It's too bad for INA.
She was behind by 0.03 seconds.

449
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,910
We'll now begin the 60m race...

450
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,910
for Group Four
of women's preliminary rounds.

451
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,280
We'll introduce the runners.

452
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,450
(Sumin of DreamNote,
Kim Da Yeon of Kep1er, VV of HITGS)

453
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,920
(Nien of tripleS, SEOWON of UNIS,
Seohyeon of AtHeart)

454
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,460
A strong candidate,

455
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,690
- Nien of tripleS is in this group.
- Yes.

456
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,890
She was mentioned today.

457
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,000
She's on Lane Four.

458
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,030
From elementary school to middle school,

459
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,200
- Nien was a professional sprinter.
- I see.

460
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,840
She won 3 gold medals, 1 silver medal,
and 3 bronze medals.

461
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,270
She has a fancy background.

462
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,540
- It's impressive.
- Seriously.

463
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,640
Then we have SEOWON of UNIS on Lane Five.

464
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,310
She's 14 years old.

465
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,780
She's the youngest runner in the 60m race.

466
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,880
- That's right.
- She's the youngest runner.

467
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
Since she's going through a growth spurt,

468
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,250
I think her running skills
will also go through a growth spurt.

469
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,360
(Laughing)

470
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,290
I must be insane today.

471
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,590
- I'm sorry. I was so startled.
- He thinks he's a foreigner.

472
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,200
- Since I was introduced that way...
- Okay.

473
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
We have a strong candidate for victory,

474
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,270
- Nien of tripleS on Lane Four.
- Yes.

475
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,770
Will she advance to the finals?

476
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,070
Will we see another strong candidate?

477
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,440
Let's pay attention...

478
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,840
- to Group Four's race.
- Get set.

479
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,840
(The race begins.)

480
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,180
- It has begun,
- All right.

481
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,510
- Nien is fast.
- Nien.

482
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,820
- She's exceptional.
- Nien.

483
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,550
(Nien)

484
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,320
(Nien widens the gap.)

485
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,320
- I can't believe it.
- She's unrivaled.

486
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
(Unrivaled 1st place, Nien)

487
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,260
- She was a professional sprinter.
- She's unrivaled.

488
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,890
- Impressive.
- She proved her talent.

489
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,000
My guess for her record is
the latter part of nine seconds.

490
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
- That's my guess.
- The latter part of nine seconds.

491
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,340
- The latter part of nine seconds.
- You were right. You were precise.

492
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,370
Her record is 9.69 seconds.

493
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,840
She was very fast.

494
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,310
The height of her knees was different.

495
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,540
- The height of her knees.
- Yes.

496
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,980
The angle of her knees was different.

497
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,910
- I see.
- She moved her arms neatly too.

498
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,180
She slowed down toward the end.

499
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,820
She was relaxed.

500
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,420
In the final round,
she'll be able to get 9.5 or 9.4 seconds.

501
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,720
- Seriously.
- Yes.

502
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,030
Then she'll be able to override
the record of Kaeun of Dalshabet.

503
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,190
It's time for the new generation.

504
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,530
- Will we see a new record?
- I know.

505
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,600
So far, she's the strongest candidate.

506
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,730
(The strongest candidate, Nien)

507
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,000
We'll now begin the 60m race...

508
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,670
for Group Five
of women's preliminary rounds.

509
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,110
We'll introduce the runners.

510
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,440
(TAERIN of ifeye, Choi Yu Jin of Kep1er,
Kumi of Baby DONT Cry)

511
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,480
The runner Commentator Kim
looked forward to is in this group.

512
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,910
- She's Kumi of Baby DONT Cry.
- Kumi.

513
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,520
She's on Lane Three.

514
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,820
Is it possible to run 60m
in the 8-second range?

515
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,290
She wrote that her goal record
was eight seconds.

516
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,550
- It's her goal.
- Yes.

517
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,590
On Lane Five,
we have Chloe Young of BADVILLAIN.

518
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,330
- Yes.
- Her hobby is futsal.

519
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,300
- I'm good at soccer, right?
- Okay.

520
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,130
She looks like a midfielder
who charges forward.

521
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,070
I think she'll be a good runner.

522
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,000
- Does she seem like a midfielder?
- Yes.

523
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,940
- She does futsal.
- Yes.

524
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Get set.

525
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,740
- Good.
- The race has begun.

526
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,510
She's taking the lead.

527
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,750
(TAERIN slowly takes the lead.)

528
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,250
- TAERIN.
- TAERIN.

529
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,020
- TAERIN.
- TAERIN.

530
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,890
- TAERIN.
- ifeye.

531
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,560
- TAERIN.
- TAERIN was faster than I thought.

532
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,620
(TAERIN of ifeye
advances to the final round.)

533
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,230
No one mentioned TAERIN.

534
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,630
With a record of 10.18 seconds,

535
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,170
TAERIN of ifeye placed first.

536
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,470
We'll now begin the 60m race...

537
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,140
for Group Six
of women's preliminary rounds.

538
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,410
I think this group's race
will be a close one.

539
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,680
In Group 6,
we need to pay attention to Lane 3.

540
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,180
SUI of Candy Shop...

541
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,620
placed fourth
in the final round last year.

542
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,820
Her record was 9.88 seconds.

543
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,490
Let's go!

544
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm paying attention to Lynn of tripleS
on Lane Two.

545
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,060
She played tennis in middle school.

546
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,000
Tennis is a sport...

547
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,100
- that requires agility and power.
- That's right.

548
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,670
Thus, I think she'll have an advantage.

549
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,240
(Lynn, good luck.)

550
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,540
Let's pay attention to Lanes 2 and 3.

551
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,580
The runner on Lane 3 has
the record of 9.88 seconds.

552
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,450
The runner on Lane Two has
Commentator Kim's high expectations.

553
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,050
There's a high chance it'll be a match
between the two.

554
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,820
(Who will be the winner of this race?)

555
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,090
Get set.

556
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
- They set off.
- Come on.

557
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,930
- SUI.
- SUI.

558
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,430
- SUI.
- Lynn.

559
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,160
(Lynn, SUI)

560
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,470
- Lynn.
- Lynn.

561
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,170
- Lynn.
- Lynn.

562
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,170
- Lynn.
- Lynn is leading.

563
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,940
(Lynn finishes the race
well before the others and places 1st.)

564
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,210
Lynn.

565
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,380
She was powerful from the start.

566
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,450
Yes.

567
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,220
(The beginning and the end were perfect.)

568
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,620
Her record is 10.38 seconds.

569
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,750
She could hope for the gold medal
in the final round.

570
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,620
TripleS has good athletes.

571
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,720
(Lynn of tripleS advances
to the final round.)

572
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,530
The final round of the women's 60m race
will be between RAHEE and TAERIN of ifeye,

573
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,430
HANEUL of KISS OF LIFE, ARIA of X:IN,

574
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,800
and Nien and Lynn of tripleS.

575
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,940
Two members of tripleS
advanced to the final round.

576
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,570
There's a good chance
it'll be a fight between the teammates.

577
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,740
(Coming soon)

578
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,510
(The match of strength and techniques)

579
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,910
(Women's ssireum is cutthroat.)

580
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
(The new event of 2025, pistol shooting)

581
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,290
(It's the match of form, breathing,
and concentration.)

582
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,960
We'll soon begin the men's
preliminary rounds for the 60m race.

583
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,360
It'll be suspenseful.

584
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,860
Men's preliminary rounds
for the 60m race will begin.

585
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,100
What should we look forward to
in the men's 60m race?

586
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,700
What we should look forward to
in the men's 60m race...

587
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,710
is the rebellion of the underdogs.

588
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,280
- Everyone is growling.
- Yes.

589
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Everyone except for four athletes...

590
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,450
are entering the 60m race
for the 1st time.

591
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,380
According to the records
they've submitted ahead of time,

592
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,620
we have many underdogs
whose record for 50m...

593
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,020
is in the six-second range.

594
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,760
I think this team will carry...

595
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,320
the lineage
of the track and field idol group.

596
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,590
It's &Team.

597
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,990
Last year,

598
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,860
- FUMA and MAKI of &Team...
- Okay.

599
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,570
won the gold and bronze medals.

600
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
This year, TAKI of the same group
is entering the race.

601
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
They're a total track and field group.

602
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,970
They're a total track and field group.

603
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,640
Let's look forward
to their performances today.

604
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm looking forward to Choi Han of ARrC.

605
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,010
He has a very tall height of 184cm.

606
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,050
- Yes.
- His foot size is 290mm.

607
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,550
- Did you say 290mm?
- Did you say 290mm?

608
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,050
His foot size is 290mm.

609
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,150
Since he has big feet,

610
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,220
he'll gain more power when he runs.
It'll give him a big advantage.

611
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,790
Will he be able to carry on the lineage
of the track and field legends?

612
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,230
- Yes.
- Men's preliminary rounds..

613
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,630
for the 60m race will begin now.

614
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,530
We'll introduce the runners.

615
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,870
(BAEK JUN HYUK of IDID, LEW of TEMPEST,
Choi Han of ARrC,)

616
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,100
(Steven of AHOF, SUNGYUN
HYUN SIK of XODIAC)

617
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,170
It's going to be thrilling.

618
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,770
Men's preliminary rounds
for the 60m race will begin now.

619
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,880
(Steven of AHOF, SUNGYUN
HYUN SIK of XODIAC)

620
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,750
Judging by the way
Choi Han is warming up...

621
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,980
- Yes?
- He's the first-place winner.

622
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,950
- Can you tell from the way he warms up?
- Yes.

623
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,890
Gosh, Steven is very...

624
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,850
- What is it?
- He's handsome.

625
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,060
- Yes.
- That's right.

626
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,490
- Oh, my.
- All right.

627
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,730
His nickname is Australian Fox.

628
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,200
I like all things Australian.

629
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,030
- All things Australian.
- Idol Star Athletics Championships...

630
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,200
Eun Ji, you need to focus on the show.

631
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,400
I became the most excited.

632
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,100
- Eun Ji, calm down.
- Yes.

633
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,370
Gosh, Steven.

634
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,540
He has the face you see in webcomics.

635
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,610
On your mark.

636
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,180
AHOF!

637
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,050
(It's a nerve-racking moment.)

638
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,520
They must be nervous.

639
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
Get set.

640
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,690
(The race begins.)

641
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,790
There they go.

642
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,060
- Gosh, he's fast.
- Steven.

643
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,990
- Steven needs to win.
- Choi Han.

644
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,430
- Steven needs to win.
- Choi Han.

645
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,400
(It's a close match
between SUNGYUN and Choi Han.)

646
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,730
- Steven needs to win.
- Choi Han.

647
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,570
Steven needs to advance
to the final round.

648
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,140
Choi Han of ARrC.

649
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,740
Choi Han of ARrC won.

650
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,780
- He had a late start.
- He was slow.

651
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,880
Yes.

652
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,350
He sped up later.

653
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,650
He got the power from his feet.

654
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,150
That must be it.

655
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,220
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

656
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,090
All right.
The 1st-place winner in Group 1...

657
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,590
is Choi Han of ARrC on Lane Three.

658
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,020
With a record of 8.27 seconds,
he advances to the final round.

659
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,760
We'll now begin the 60m race
for Group Two of men's preliminary rounds.

660
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,200
We'll introduce the runners.

661
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,930
The average height is 180cm.

662
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,840
Everyone in Group Two is tall.

663
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,770
It's the group of death.

664
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,810
(So Geon of NEXZ, YOO SEUNGEON of EVNNE,
HYUNBIN of POW)

665
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,840
Except for Hwang Seong Bin on Lane Three,

666
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,910
everyone's record for 50m
is in the 6-second range.

667
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,040
Really?

668
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,350
The record of 6 seconds for 50m
rivals that of a professional runner.

669
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,980
- Really?
- Yes.

670
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,290
KYUNG MIN of 8TURN's record for 50m...

671
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,490
is 5.4 seconds.

672
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,760
That's incredible.

673
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
It's similar to my record.

674
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,020
- Really?
- Yes.

675
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,630
Didn't he measure it wrong?

676
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,060
- Hwang Seong Bin on Lane Three.
- Yes.

677
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,330
He has done hapkido for 3 years
and kendo for 1 year.

678
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,270
- He has a fit body.
- You're right.

679
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,770
Seong Bin, good luck.

680
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,840
- Is he your new favorite?
- Yes.

681
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,310
A woman's heart is fickle.

682
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,810
This is like "EXchange."

683
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,010
(Lee Eun Ji does commentaries
like she's on "EXchange.")

684
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,140
On your mark.

685
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,250
It's hard to guess
who the winner will be...

686
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,550
because this is the group of death.

687
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,580
Which one in this group...

688
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,620
will advance to the final round?

689
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,590
Get set.

690
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,190
There they go.

691
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,760
- Run.
- So Geon.

692
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
- So Geon.
- So Geon.

693
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,830
(So Geon takes the lead from the start.)

694
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,430
(With a steady form,
he continues to take the lead.)

695
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,560
(So Geon)

696
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,870
(So Geon reaches the finish line
as the 1st place.)

697
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,900
Oh, my So Geon.

698
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,970
(So Geon of NEXZ
advances to the final round.)

699
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,610
I see why his stage name is So Geon.

700
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,110
- Why is that?
- It means, "Young gun."

701
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,380
- "Young gun?"
- Yes. He's fast.

702
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,150
I'm curious about his record.

703
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,210
- It's 8.25 seconds.
- It's 8.25 seconds.

704
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,050
I think we'll see a record
in the seven-second range soon.

705
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,250
That's right. I think we'll see it.

706
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,820
When professional sprinters start.

707
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,620
they keep their heads down.

708
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,960
- Lifting the chin...
- Okay.

709
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,120
- doesn't help with acceleration.
- I see.

710
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,630
You get hit with the wind resistance.

711
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,000
His start rivaled
that of a professional sprinter.

712
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,500
- Really?
- It requires a great deal of agility.

713
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,000
I think he's very agile.

714
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,570
- He was fast.
- Very much so.

715
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,570
- He moved forward with power.
- Look at So Geon.

716
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,000
He's a strong candidate.

717
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,170
We'll now begin the 60m race...

718
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,810
for Group Three
of men's preliminary rounds.

719
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,250
We'll introduce the runners.

720
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,380
- This is Group Three.
- All right.

721
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,280
There are many athletes
who are good at track and field.

722
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,150
(GIHYEON of NouerA, Robin of n.SSign,
Song Seung Ho of CLOSE YOUR EYES)

723
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,820
I have my eyes on Lane Six
from CLOSE YOUR EYES.

724
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,360
<i>Close your eyes</i>

725
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,230
- It's Song Seung Ho.
- Yes.

726
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,530
He trained special ops martial arts
for seven years.

727
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,700
- Special ops martial arts?
- Really?

728
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,830
Special ops martial arts.

729
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,570
- No way. Exactly.
- That means his movements are light.

730
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,640
I have my eyes on Lane Three.
He's warming up right now.

731
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,570
It's LINGQI of Double 0ne.

732
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,440
Look at him. He pulled up his pants
all the way to the diaphragm.

733
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,010
- Yes.
- Right.

734
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,210
- This is...
- He's taking this seriously.

735
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,480
In my opinion, he can pull it up higher.

736
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,680
- A little higher?
- Should he pull it up higher?

737
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,280
I usually pull it all the way up
to this spot.

738
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
(This is how it's done.)

739
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,580
On your mark.

740
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,150
All right.

741
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,750
(GIHYEON)

742
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,590
Get set.

743
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,000
- They're running.
- They're off.

744
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,400
- Gosh, Song Seung Ho.
- Song Seung Ho is fast.

745
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
- Song Seung Ho.
- My gosh, Song Seung Ho.

746
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,830
- Let's go, LINGQI.
- Gosh, Song Seung Ho.

747
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,240
- Song Seung Ho.
- LINGQI.

748
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
- LINGQI.
- Song Seung Ho.

749
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,040
- LINGQI.
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.

750
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,210
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- LINGQI.

751
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,910
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- LINGQI.

752
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,780
(Song Seung Ho will advance
to the final match.)

753
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,150
It will be Song Seung Ho.

754
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,080
- Song Seung Ho of CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- It's Song Seung Ho.

755
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,520
- He was as light as a feather.
- That was close. Yes.

756
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,680
His record was 8.35 seconds.

757
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,820
(Group 3 of Men's Preliminary Round
for the 60m Race)

758
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,190
Seung Ho will advance with the record,
8.35 seconds.

759
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,090
- He managed to defeat Robin.
- Yes.

760
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,760
The difference was only 0.16 seconds.

761
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,430
- He was already ahead from the start.
- I see. Already?

762
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,700
- He had already taken the lead then.
- It was how it all began.

763
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,700
- He's running confidently.
- Yes.

764
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,900
I've noticed this common trait
from fast runners.

765
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,900
- All of them are leaning forward.
- Right.

766
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,910
I can't wait for the final match.

767
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,040
The 60m race for Group 4...

768
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,640
of Men's Preliminary Rounds
will begin now.

769
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,080
(Group 4 of Men's Preliminary Rounds
for the 60m Race)

770
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,580
This group has
all the good-looking members.

771
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,220
What a handsome group.

772
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,690
- All right. Group Four has entered.
- Yes.

773
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,920
Who has gotten your attention?

774
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,520
EUNCHAN of TEMPEST from Lane Four.

775
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,260
EUNCHAN's legs are 118cm long.

776
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,930
His arms are 77.5cm long.

777
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,100
- How is that possible?
- My gosh.

778
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,360
- I see.
- Given his physical traits,

779
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,630
people in the sports industry
might want to recruit him.

780
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,070
I have my eyes on Cha Woong Ki of AHOF...

781
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,710
- from Lane Three.
- Cha Woong Ki.

782
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,940
Do you know this historical drama,
"Lee San, Wind in the Palace?"

783
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,780
- It aired when I was a kid.
- Yes.

784
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,780
- He was in the drama as a child actor.
- I see.

785
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,280
Some people might be happy to see him.

786
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,120
I have no doubt that he will put on
a dramatic performance for us.

787
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,050
- All the good-looking ones are here.
- Yes.

788
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,850
I wonder which runner from Group Four...

789
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,420
will win the ticket to the final match.
Let's keep watching.

790
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,760
Get set.

791
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,160
Here they go.

792
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,160
- All right.
- Gosh, they're quite fast.

793
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,700
- I knew he'd be fast.
- EUNCHAN.

794
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,500
- EUNCHAN is taking the lead.
- EUNCHAN is fast.

795
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,270
- EUNCHAN is fast.
- EUNCHAN.

796
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,170
It's EUNCHAN.

797
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,910
- EUNCHAN.
- Yes.

798
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,310
EUNCHAN comes in first.

799
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,940
My gosh. He's got such long limbs.

800
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,180
Yes. EUNCHAN won...

801
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,480
(EUNCHAN put on
an impressive performance.)

802
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,580
- as expected.
- My gosh.

803
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,920
That was amazing.

804
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,320
- Gosh.
- They reacted so quickly to the signal.

805
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,850
- They reacted fast.
- Yes.

806
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,160
(EUNCHAN's speed of reaction
is on another level.)

807
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,760
It's his 118cm-long legs.

808
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,630
- He took the lead quite fast.
- Yes.

809
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,960
EUNCHAN from Lane Four
will advance to the final match...

810
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,200
with the record of 8.41 seconds.

811
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,170
He won first place.

812
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,600
(EUNCHAN of TEMPEST advances
to the final match.)

813
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,910
The 60m race for Group 5...

814
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,510
of Men's Preliminary Rounds
will begin now.

815
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,010
I'll introduce the runners for the race.

816
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,280
(Group 5 of Men's Preliminary Rounds
for the 60m Race)

817
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,910
Look at this group too.

818
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,480
- How come everyone's so tall these days?
- Right.

819
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,780
How fascinating.

820
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,390
I have my eyes on Thanatorn
of The Wind from Lane Four.

821
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,920
- Thanatorn.
- He used to be a taekwondo spar athlete.

822
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,230
Last year, he achieved an excellent record
of 7.87 seconds.

823
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, I'm looking forward to
his performance today too.

824
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,330
I have my eyes on Lane Six,
Hong Minsung of NEWBEAT.

825
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,870
His hobbies are boxing, jujutsu,
and mixed martial arts.

826
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,740
I've been boxing for 12 years now.

827
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,070
- For 12 years?
- Yes.

828
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,240
Could you show us some moves?

829
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,810
(Swinging)

830
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,250
(Impressive)

831
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,710
- It goes like this.
- That looks pretty good.

832
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,750
Actually,
I've been doing mixed martial arts too.

833
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,980
- You know?
- My gosh.

834
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,720
- Got it. Let's move on.
- Really?

835
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,890
Okay.

836
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,620
The race for Group Five will begin now.

837
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,960
On your mark.

838
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,130
- On your mark.
- I think Nam Seong Mo will do well.

839
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,500
Commentator Kim has his eyes
on Thanatorn from Lane Four.

840
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,740
Get set.

841
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,010
- Here they go. Gosh, he's fast.
- What a great start.

842
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,710
- Thanatorn.
- Thanatorn.

843
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,940
- Thanatorn.
- Thanatorn.

844
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,580
- Thanatorn.
- Thanatorn is fast.

845
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,680
- But hold on.
- He's fast too. He also has a shot.

846
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,620
- We can't be sure. Not yet.
- We can't be sure yet.

847
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,520
Hold on.
Hong Minsung slid past the finishing line.

848
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,120
- Is it Thanatorn?
- Gosh, it has to be Thanatorn.

849
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,260
- Is it Hong Minsung?
- It has to be Thanatorn.

850
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,990
- Is it Thanatorn or Hong Minsung?
- Is it Hong Minsung?

851
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,190
- Is it Thanatorn?
- I think it might be Hong Minsung.

852
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,560
- Hong Minsung was so fast.
- Hong Minsung...

853
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,860
Hong Minsung picked up the speed
very fast toward the end.

854
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,870
- Right.
- He did.

855
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,130
We must check the footage...

856
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,170
- to confirm the results.
- He was so fast.

857
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,870
- Thanatorn's start was amazing.
- Yes.

858
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,540
- Look at this.
- He tried to take the lead here.

859
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,510
- He picked up the speed here.
- It's right here.

860
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,580
Right here...

861
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,110
I'm not sure.

862
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,020
- I think Hong Minsung was faster.
- You think so?

863
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,080
- Watch.
- I see. I knew it.

864
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,920
- It's Hong Minsung.
- Hong Minsung turned the tables around.

865
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,530
- He did.
- He showed us a little slide at the end.

866
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,190
(Group 5 of Men's Preliminary Rounds
for the 60m Race)

867
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,400
- The difference was 0.04 seconds.
- My gosh.

868
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,830
- Their records...
- Both of their records are impressive.

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,800
He just set a new record
in the preliminary rounds.

870
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,870
(He's advancing to the final match
with an excellent record.)

871
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,040
He's athletic.

872
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,240
The 60m race for Group 6...

873
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,980
of Men's Preliminary Rounds
will begin now.

874
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,410
I'll introduce the runners for the race.

875
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,250
This is the last round
before the final match.

876
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,750
It means it's also the last chance.

877
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,890
- Yes.
- Let's begin the race for Group Six.

878
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,920
Chael of LUN8
won the silver medal last year.

879
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,260
He's on Lane Four.

880
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,160
- Yes.
- His last year's record was 7.97 seconds.

881
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,960
- But his recent record is 7.3 seconds.
- He shortened his record.

882
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,830
When he was a volleyball player,
he once hit 6.3 seconds.

883
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,070
Let's keep an eye on him
to see his record for today.

884
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,100
On your mark.

885
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,710
All right. The runner on Lane Four
won a silver medal last year.

886
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,450
Get set.

887
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,520
Will they begin? There they go.

888
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,290
- They're running now.
- There they go.

889
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,720
- My gosh. He's fast.
- He's very fast.

890
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,320
(Chael is taking the lead
at an incredible speed.)

891
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,030
- How can Chael run that fast?
- He's unbelievably fast.

892
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,490
(Chael of LUN8 from Lane 4)

893
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,500
- He's unbelievably fast.
- It's Chael.

894
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,660
- How is he so fast?
- My gosh.

895
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,430
(Chael comes in 1st as expected.)

896
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,100
- He was very fast.
- He's...

897
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,840
- Chael almost jumped over the wall.
- Yes.

898
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,740
What did Chael just do?

899
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,070
I can't believe this.

900
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,540
- That was impressive.
- I can see that he's determined to win.

901
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,750
Chael looks like a strong candidate
to come out on top.

902
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,720
- He's in the 7-second range.
- He finished in the 7-second range.

903
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,290
- We have a record in the 7-second rage.
- It's in the 7-second range.

904
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,760
We got a record in the seven-second range
from a preliminary round.

905
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
(Chael is the only one to finish
in the 7-second range.)

906
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,060
- Chael's start was amazing.
- Yes.

907
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,300
Siyun did a great job too.
But toward the end,

908
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,070
there was a huge gap.

909
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,330
The bounce in Chael's steps
is quite impressive.

910
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,540
- He almost jumped over the wall.
- Yes.

911
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,370
He almost jumped over it
like it was a vaulting horse.

912
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
He's a strong candidate...

913
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
- to win the final match.
- Yes.

914
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
(Chael, a strong candidate
at the final match)

915
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
You're watching
2025 Idol Star Athletics Championships.

916
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,180
Let me introduce the runners
for the final match of the men's 60m race.

917
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,380
Choi Han of ARrC, So Geon of NEXZ,

918
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,080
Song Seung Ho of CLOSE YOUR EYES,

919
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,220
EUNCHAN of TEMPEST,

920
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,550
Hong Minsung of NEWBEAT,

921
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,590
and Chael of LUN8 will compete
in the final match.

922
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,360
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

923
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,690
This is the final match
of the women's 60m race.

924
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,370
They're representative girl groups
of 2025.

925
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,300
- The star runner will be born today.
- Let's see. The star runner.

926
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,800
The athletic idol.

927
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,270
This match will decide the winners
and the color of their medals.

928
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,510
I can't wait...

929
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,140
to see which one of them
will win first place.

930
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,080
Watching the final match of the 60m race
is making me nervous.

931
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,520
Everyone except for 1 runner
finished in the 10-second range.

932
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,550
Nien from Lane 3 is the only runner
who finished in the 9-second range.

933
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,390
Nien was incredibly fast.

934
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,490
Looking at the records,
Nien will easily win the final match.

935
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:52,160
The other runners could have saved energy
during the preliminary rounds.

936
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,030
- I see.
- It might not have been their best.

937
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,930
- You know, for the final match.
- I sensed that...

938
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,000
- from HANEUL of KISS OF LIFE.
- Really?

939
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,740
- She saved some energy from that round.
- Yes.

940
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
- She reduced her speed.
- She reduced her speed.

941
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,840
She could perform better...

942
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,880
- than she did in the preliminary round.
- Right.

943
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,880
And more importantly,

944
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,680
two members from Ifeye are
in the final match.

945
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,480
There are two members
from tripleS as well.

946
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
- This is fascinating too.
- Indeed.

947
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,320
They're competing against
their own member.

948
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,820
- Let's go!
- Who will come out on top?

949
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,990
On your mark.

950
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,660
Gosh, I'm so nervous for this match.

951
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,520
(They must compete against their member.
Who will win the gold medal?)

952
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,290
There must be a generational transition
with this match.

953
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,230
There's determination in everyone's eyes.

954
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,360
I bet they're nervous.

955
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,500
(Nervous)

956
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,900
- Everyone's gaze looks different.
- Get set.

957
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,540
- There they go.
- They're running.

958
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,870
- It has begun.
- Run.

959
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,400
- All right.
- Run.

960
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,770
(Everyone is off to a quick start
as this is the final match.)

961
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,780
- All right. Nien is taking the lead.
- Run.

962
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,980
- Nien.
- Great.

963
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,110
- Nien.
- It's Nien.

964
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,410
- Keep running.
- My gosh.

965
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,520
- It's Nien.
- She's taking the lead.

966
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,350
- Nien.
- It's Nien.

967
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,290
- It's Nien.
- My gosh.

968
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,490
- No one...
- There was no twist.

969
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,520
- No one can stop her.
- She won easily.

970
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,460
Toward the end, she actually slowed down.

971
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,500
(The winner's signature song ceremony)

972
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,700
A song by tripleS is playing now.

973
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,910
This is the benefit of the winning team.

974
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,470
("Are You Alive" by tripleS)

975
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,780
How nice.

976
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,310
(Enjoying her moment to the fullest)

977
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,750
- Congratulations, Nien.
- Congratulations.

978
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,690
I'm curious about her record.

979
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,490
- It's 9.7 seconds.
- It's 9.7 seconds.

980
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,860
- It's 9.7 seconds.
- Isn't that a difference of 0.2 seconds?

981
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,360
It's only a 0.01-second difference.

982
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,670
The final match of the men's 60m race
will begin now.

983
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,800
Here are the runners for the final match.

984
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,500
I have no idea
who's going to win this match.

985
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,710
(Final Match of the Men's 60m Race)

986
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,040
(EUNCHAN of TEMPEST, Choi Han of ARrC,
Chael of LUN8,)

987
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,270
(Hong Minsung of NEWBEAT, So Geon
of NEXZ, Song Seung Ho of CLOSE YOUR EYES)

988
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,580
I just know
this match will be a close one.

989
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,410
- It's the final match.
- It's the final match.

990
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,580
It is.

991
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,580
- Commentator Kim.
- Yes.

992
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,220
In your opinion,
who do you think will win first place?

993
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,720
I think Chael of LUN8 from Lane 3
will win 1st place.

994
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,760
- Just as expected.
- Yes.

995
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,460
- Chael of LUN8 which he mentioned...
- Yes.

996
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,160
finished in 7.79 seconds.

997
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,730
He's the only runner who finished
in the seven-second range.

998
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,900
- He's the strongest candidate to win.
- Yes.

999
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,000
Hong Minsung of NEWBEAT
is his strongest opponent.

1000
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,200
I'd say Hong Minsung from Lane Four
poses as the biggest threat to Chael.

1001
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,610
- That's right.
- He's a real underdog.

1002
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,710
- He turned the tables around.
- As you said, he could've finished...

1003
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,980
in the seven-second range...

1004
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,380
- had he been a little faster.
- Right.

1005
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,110
- His record was eight seconds.
- Yes.

1006
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,010
That should be considered finishing
in the seven-second range.

1007
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,680
- It will be between Lanes 3 and 4.
- That's right.

1008
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,250
That's just my prediction.

1009
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,250
- Song Seung Ho...
- Yes.

1010
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,520
of CLOSE YOUR EYES...

1011
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,090
- was quite fast too.
- Right.

1012
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,590
- So Geon of NEXZ was very fast too.
- He's a fast runner.

1013
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,730
- So Geon could be a threat too.
- For real.

1014
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,860
- Yes.
- On your mark.

1015
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,100
(Who will be the new star runner
and win the gold medal?)

1016
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,130
(Nervous)

1017
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,370
I'm getting nervous.

1018
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,700
- It's a nerve-racking moment.
- I'm nervous. Yes.

1019
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,770
You know how they feel right now
better than anyone.

1020
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,170
That's when your lips get dry too.

1021
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,210
(Who will win the gold medal?)

1022
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,910
- Get set.
- There they go.

1023
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,650
- Go.
- There they go.

1024
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,050
- They're running.
- My gosh.

1025
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,850
- Here it goes.
- There they go.

1026
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,950
- Everyone is fast.
- They're running.

1027
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,280
- Seung Ho's start was slow.
- They're running.

1028
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,250
- They're running.
- Hong Minsung and Chael.

1029
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,320
- Hong Minsung.
- My gosh.

1030
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,620
(Hong Minsung is taking the lead
at a crazy speed.)

1031
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,120
- Will Chael overtake Hong Minsung?
- Hong Minsung and Chael.

1032
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,460
- He's fast.
- Chael.

1033
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,130
(They're neck and neck.)

1034
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,130
- They're running.
- Hong Minsung and Chael.

1035
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,160
- It's Chael.
- Chael.

1036
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,430
(At that moment, Chael takes the lead.)

1037
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,900
Hong Minsung and Chael. It's Chael.

1038
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,600
- Chael.
- It's as expected.

1039
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,270
It's Chael of LUN8.

1040
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,340
(Chael wins the gold medal.)

1041
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,070
Hong Minsung is upset.

1042
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,310
(Disappointed)

1043
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,350
(The winner's signature song ceremony)

1044
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,120
- Their song is playing now.
- LUN8.

1045
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,480
("WHIP" of LUN8)

1046
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,650
Let's get it.

1047
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,160
- Go, Chael.
- Go, Chael.

1048
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,760
(Happy)

1049
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,130
LUN8.

1050
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
They debuted in June 2023.

1051
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,400
Congratulations.

1052
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,770
- Chael.
- Chael.

1053
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,940
(Chael of LUN8 becomes the star runner
among the male idol stars.)

1054
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,270
My gosh. Seriously.

1055
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,710
- Wasn't it a close match?
- Seriously.

1056
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,480
- His record is 7.79 seconds.
- It's 7.79 seconds.

1057
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,710
It's 7.79 seconds.

1058
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,550
It's the same record as the one
from the preliminary round.

1059
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,310
Hong Minsung ran faster in this round.

1060
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,350
His record is 7.86 seconds.

1061
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,350
Let's rewatch the beginning.

1062
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,920
- Hong Minsung was off to a faster start.
- I see.

1063
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,690
- Right.
- But Chael overtook him halfway through.

1064
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,360
He kept the momentum
and finished with the lead.

1065
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,430
The bounce in his steps is incredible.

1066
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,860
If he can feel it while running,

1067
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,260
it means it's really strong.

1068
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,360
Right.

1069
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,130
- That was so close.
- It was super close.

1070
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,300
Congratulations on your gold medal.

1071
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,570
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1072
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,470
I worked really hard to win first place.

1073
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,910
Last year, I lost to FUMA.

1074
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,280
I won second place.

1075
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,380
I pushed myself even more
to win first place this year.

1076
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,720
So it feels rewarding.

1077
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,320
Thanks to your support,

1078
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,220
- I was able to win first place.
- Well done!

1079
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
Thank you.

1080
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,390
You're watching 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

1081
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,360
This sport has returned after five years.

1082
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,400
We'll continue with
the group matches for ssireum.

1083
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,930
It's ssireum!

1084
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,930
When we think of ssireum
on Idol Star Athletics Championships,

1085
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,070
idol groups that excelled in ssireum
naturally come to our mind.

1086
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,670
He's on the panel with us, isn't he?

1087
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,910
Okay.

1088
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,180
I lost, so I wasn't going to say anything,
but you caught me.

1089
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,110
I went up against Jung Kook of BTS
back then.

1090
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,880
He practically threw me.

1091
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,180
- Really?
- Yes.

1092
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,980
(9 years ago, Jung Kook)

1093
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,580
(Looking youthful)

1094
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,990
- Jung Kook goes for the outer leg.
- Jung Kook.

1095
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,750
- The outer leg.
- The outer leg.

1096
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,160
Jung Kook's body...

1097
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,460
is as hard as a rock.

1098
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,030
If you bump into him, you could be
as badly hurt as in a car crash.

1099
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,700
Gosh, that isn't easy.

1100
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,930
Many athletic idol stars
competed in this sport.

1101
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,700
They soaked up good energy
from the sand...

1102
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,870
and became mega stars.

1103
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,900
So we're looking forward to the future
of the idol stars...

1104
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,410
who will compete in this sport this year.

1105
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,740
The legendary ssireum wrestler
has returned...

1106
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,140
- as ssireum made it back to the show.
- He's a legend.

1107
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,540
He has the highest number of wins...

1108
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,810
and accumulated the largest amount
of prize money.

1109
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,380
The man with the 32-game winning streak.

1110
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,750
- My gosh.
- Commentator Lee is joining us today.

1111
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

1112
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,990
- Nice to meet you.
- The legend on the sand.

1113
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,250
I'm the exclusive commentator
of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1114
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,090
I'm Lee Tae Hyun.
Hello. Nice to meet you all.

1115
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,690
I heard you personally coached
the idol stars...

1116
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,130
- who would participate in the matches.
- Yes.

1117
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,000
I was deeply moved by
how hard they all worked.

1118
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,700
(Despite their busy schedules,)

1119
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,070
(the idol stars
took the lessons seriously.)

1120
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,240
(The clips will be revealed shortly.)

1121
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,280
You're watching 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

1122
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,540
Let's proceed with the preliminary rounds
for women's ssireum.

1123
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,880
(Women's ssireum bracket)

1124
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,480
I hear the placement in the bracket
is so important.

1125
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,980
Of course. Your luck with the placement
matters the most.

1126
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,050
The matches will start
from the quarterfinals.

1127
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,860
The format will be best 2 out of 3.

1128
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,160
The match will last a minute.

1129
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,330
When it's tied,
an overtime of 30 seconds will be given.

1130
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,230
If it's still tied after overtime,

1131
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,300
the wrestler with the lighter weight
will win.

1132
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,270
And the team with the gold medal...

1133
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,770
will win the Korean beef set
to help them recharge energy.

1134
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,300
(The winning team
will win the Korean beef set.)

1135
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,610
- Today is the Korean beef day.
- It is indeed.

1136
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,640
The first match...

1137
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,480
of the women's group ssireum preliminaries
will begin now.

1138
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,010
We'll introduce the wreslers.

1139
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,550
It's Hearts2Hearts versus SAY MY NAME.

1140
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,690
For Hearts2Hearts, their power is the key.

1141
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,560
They are strong and powerful.

1142
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,860
I coached them to be aggressive
with their offense.

1143
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,760
How would you describe the skills
of SAY MY NAME?

1144
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:12,000
I coached to be more defensive
rather than offensive when playing.

1145
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,670
It could be techniques or movements.
You just name it.

1146
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,270
They made everything I taught them
into theirs.

1147
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,380
Hearts2Hearts would focus on offense.

1148
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,910
Then SAY MY NAME would focus on defense.

1149
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,650
- Did I understand you correctly?
- That's right.

1150
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,980
Here's the first match.

1151
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,290
From Hearts2Hearts,
JIWOO will participate in this match.

1152
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,260
From SAY MY NAME,
of JUNHWI will compete in this match.

1153
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,000
(Who will take the glory
of winning the first round?)

1154
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,940
They began.

1155
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,410
She hooked the outer leg.

1156
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,840
(JUNHWI ambushes her
with the outer leg hook.)

1157
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,580
(SAY MY NAME is off to a great start.)

1158
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,750
JUNHWI actually played for offense.

1159
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,650
While training,
JIWOO didn't show any weaknesses.

1160
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,890
But today, she fell toward the end.

1161
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,290
Let's watch it.

1162
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,620
What just happened?

1163
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,860
JUNHWI tried to shake her balance.

1164
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,230
And then she hooked the outer leg
right away.

1165
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,530
- "Did you think I'd only play defense?"
- Right.

1166
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,970
"Get my outer leg hook."

1167
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,570
- "Get my outer leg hook."
- She hooked it.

1168
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,800
- "I must defeat you."
- This is the perfect example...

1169
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,140
of losing the match psychologically first.

1170
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,240
- That was reverse psychology.
- Right.

1171
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,780
SAY MY NAME is leading with 1 to 0.

1172
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,980
(Observation Notes: She has a small build,
but is very powerful.)

1173
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,080
(STELLA, you got this!)

1174
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,750
(She has a small build and weak.)

1175
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,750
(The only play she has
is to avoid contact.)

1176
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,760
(The fans cheer for them zealously.)

1177
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,960
(Hearts2Hearts is
at risk of getting eliminated.)

1178
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,000
You know what?
It's harder to predict the results...

1179
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
- for women's ssireum.
- Right.

1180
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,630
- It's harder to predict their results.
- Yes.

1181
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,100
All right. So KANNY...

1182
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,870
- What?
- What just happened?

1183
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,240
(Surprised)

1184
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,970
(The match begins.)

1185
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,910
- What?
- What just happened?

1186
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,920
- What?
- What just happened?

1187
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,280
(What just happened?)

1188
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,690
- What just happened?
- What was that?

1189
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,720
What is this?

1190
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,260
It looks like she missed her footing
when she was moving around.

1191
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,960
Did she just trip herself?

1192
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,460
- Hitomi of SAY MY NAME.
- Right.

1193
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,760
That was quite anticlimactic.

1194
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,200
(The shortest match
in the history of the show)

1195
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,530
That was so close.

1196
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,330
(Puzzled)

1197
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,740
Hitomi is a weak wrestler.

1198
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,410
I told her to avoid contact.

1199
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,940
She was trying to avoid contact
too quickly.

1200
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,710
That's when her legs got entangled.

1201
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,810
- She just squatted down.
- Yes.

1202
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,280
(She fell on her own
while trying to avoid contact.)

1203
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,680
She must've misunderstood your tactic.

1204
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,250
(YE-ON of Hearts2Hearts
versus KANNY of SAY MY NAME)

1205
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,260
This is what the coach said
about KANNY of SAY MY NAME.

1206
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,860
"She's the strongest of the three."

1207
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,130
Here comes KANNY,
the ace wrestler of SAY MY NAME.

1208
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,630
I hear that when KANNY starts working out,

1209
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,370
she works out
at least for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

1210
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,900
She was the last to stay
until the end of training.

1211
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,440
YE-ON is very powerful,

1212
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,040
- but she doesn't know how to use it.
- She doesn't know.

1213
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,410
I always say that
hard work never betrays you.

1214
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,510
I can't wait to see this match.

1215
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,480
(How will the match end?)

1216
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,980
- Let's go, YE-ON.
- Let's go, YE-ON.

1217
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,180
- Let's go!
- My gosh.

1218
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,250
- KANNY.
- There's the bear hug throw.

1219
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,450
There she turns!

1220
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,250
(KANNY's bear hug throw)

1221
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,420
There's the bear hug throw.
There she turns!

1222
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,760
The match goes to KANNY!

1223
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,060
- Let's go!
- She easily won this match.

1224
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,630
- All right.
- It was an easy win for KANNY.

1225
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,630
What happened was...

1226
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,900
(Bear Hug Throw: A technique where
a wrestler lifts the opponent...)

1227
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,070
(and throws them down)

1228
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,600
She was the youngest,
but still the strongest one.

1229
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,710
That was so close.

1230
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,920
SAY MY NAME advanced to the semifinals.

1231
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,290
(Women's ssireum bracket)

1232
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,120
We'll now begin the second match...

1233
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,860
of the women's group ssireum
preliminaries.

1234
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,290
FIFTY FIFTY versus UNIS.

1235
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,060
How do you expect this match to go,
Commentator Lee?

1236
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,370
Both teams show great spirit
and a strong desire to win.

1237
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,170
The stronger their desire to win,

1238
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,410
the more likely they are to make mistakes.

1239
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,940
So it's tough to predict the winner.

1240
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,110
But you're a professional.
You need to make predictions.

1241
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,410
(Laughing)

1242
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,520
Every time I say a certain team will win,
they end up losing.

1243
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,320
That's why I can't say anything.

1244
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,650
All right then.

1245
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:28,520
YEWON may be small,
but she's strong and fiercely competitive.

1246
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,760
ELISIA.

1247
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,360
ELISIA.

1248
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,460
ATHENA of FIFTY FIFTY...

1249
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,130
learned jujitsu.

1250
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,970
FIFTY FIFTY...

1251
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,600
- has an ace member on the team,
- Yes.

1252
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,900
so I think that gives them an advantage.

1253
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,970
You got this!

1254
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,040
(YEWON of FIFTY FIFTY
versus ELISIA of UNIS)

1255
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,480
- Take her down!
- Outer hook throw!

1256
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,880
What was that?

1257
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,520
- Take her down!
- Outer hook throw!

1258
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,580
(YEWON wins.)

1259
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,750
- ELISIA.
- Look at that.

1260
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,420
- Oh, my goodness.
- What just happened?

1261
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,560
YEWON takes the victory.

1262
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,890
Both players tried the outer hook throw
at the same time.

1263
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:08,760
But YEWON's right leg
touched the floor first,

1264
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,430
which made ELISIA fall backward.

1265
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,030
It was a matter of speed.

1266
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,300
(Speed is the key to victory.)

1267
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,210
If the first move succeeds,
then it's game over.

1268
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,970
- Yes. Especially for female players,
- Right.

1269
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,110
it seems to be the case.

1270
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,410
- A single attack has a huge impact.
- Yes.

1271
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,220
Right. ATHENA and NANA.

1272
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,920
ATHENA said...

1273
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,890
- she would help her lie down comfortably.
- Okay.

1274
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,290
To lay her down gently,

1275
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,490
she has to be a lot better than her.

1276
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,090
I'm excited.

1277
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,570
Yes. ATHENA is the ace member
of FIFTY FIFTY.

1278
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,800
(NANA attacks first.)

1279
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,970
- A bear hug throw.
- Okay.

1280
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,070
- She's holding out.
- Go, ATHENA!

1281
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,400
They're...

1282
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,410
She held out.

1283
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,140
- ATHENA is holding out.
- ATHENA is holding out.

1284
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,510
- She avoided it.
- They're spinning.

1285
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,040
- Is that a triple Axel?
- She's waiting for a chance.

1286
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,710
- She pulled her.
- It worked.

1287
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,720
(ATHENA's sudden waist pull
was successful.)

1288
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,450
(Waist Pull: Pulling the opponent's satba
and twisting the waist.)

1289
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,520
She spun to make her opponent dizzy...

1290
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,120
and took her down.

1291
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,860
It's a new technique.

1292
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,590
(ATHENA's strategy
was to spin to the right.)

1293
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,000
She got dizzy and flopped down.

1294
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,100
- NANA landed on her bottom.
- She still looks dizzy.

1295
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,700
(ATHENA's effective strategy)

1296
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,610
FIFTY FIFTY advances to the semifinals.

1297
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,670
We'll now begin the third match...

1298
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,910
of the women's group ssireum
preliminaries.

1299
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,440
Billlie versus tripleS.

1300
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,850
- Oh, my.
- It's the third match.

1301
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,550
Tsuki of Billlie is an ace.

1302
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,190
I know that.
She's been practicing so much.

1303
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,620
That's right.

1304
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,090
During practice,

1305
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,390
I could see her competitive spirit...

1306
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,090
behind that smile.

1307
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,360
She once beat Yun Sung Bin
in a squat match.

1308
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,770
- What?
- She's extremely competitive.

1309
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,440
- It's unbelievable.
- Tsuki is no joke.

1310
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,310
The members of tripleS are tall.

1311
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,810
If they make good use of their height,

1312
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,940
they could be the perfect team.

1313
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,310
I'm excited to see
if they'll show it today.

1314
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,620
Nien is a great runner.

1315
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,350
She excelled in track and field events.

1316
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,750
An unpredictable match between two teams.

1317
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,520
You should see for yourself.

1318
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,060
(Tsuki of Billlie versus Nien of tripleS)

1319
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,760
- How will it go?
- Look at Tsuki.

1320
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,830
- Look at Tsuki.
- Okay.

1321
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,630
- How will it go?
- Look at Tsuki.

1322
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,100
- I knew it.
- Waist pull.

1323
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,430
- Oh, my gosh.
- Tsuki.

1324
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,040
Did you see that? Did you see Tsuki?

1325
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,010
(She pushed her.)

1326
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,410
She's the most competitive
girl group member I know.

1327
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,650
Yes. She's extremely determined to win.

1328
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:42,050
(Well done, Tsuki.)

1329
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,090
Su Hyeon is very determined.

1330
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,960
Even if I get lifted lightly
like a butterfly,

1331
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,660
I'll grit my teeth
and go for the outer leg hook.

1332
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,430
It means she'll do her best.

1333
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,130
I think she's the tallest player.

1334
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,870
The members of tripleS,

1335
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,100
JIWOO and Lynn are as tall as 172cm.

1336
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,740
They're the tallest
female ssireum players.

1337
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,580
(Su Hyeon of Billlie
versus Lynn of tripleS)

1338
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,680
(If she wins,
Billlie will make it to the semifinals.)

1339
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,720
(tripleS is on the verge of
being eliminated in the preliminaries.)

1340
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,750
- You got this!
- You can do it!

1341
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,520
(Which team will win?)

1342
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,090
- Block her!
- Good luck!

1343
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,090
(The game begins.)

1344
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,760
- You can do it!
- Go!

1345
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,430
- Okay. She's holding out.
- She's going for the outer leg hook!

1346
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,400
- Okay. She's holding out.
- She's going for the outer leg hook!

1347
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,500
(Billlie wins by a clean 2 to 0.)

1348
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,200
Billlie.

1349
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,740
- Su Hyeon takes the victory.
- Billlie.

1350
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,210
Billlie is no joke.

1351
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,840
(Even the opponent acknowledges them.)

1352
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,810
Actually, I was curious about Sua.

1353
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,410
- Me too.
- Yes.

1354
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,010
I was told Sua's aunt...

1355
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,180
- was a ssireum player.
- Exactly.

1356
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,750
I wanted to see if she got the gene.

1357
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,950
- No.
- But they won 2 to 0.

1358
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,290
Okay. Billlies defeat tripleS 2 to 0...

1359
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,590
- Yes.
- to reach the semifinals.

1360
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,960
(Women's ssireum bracket)

1361
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,060
We'll now begin the fourth match...

1362
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,100
of the women's group ssireum
preliminaries.

1363
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,630
PRIMROSE versus DreamNote.

1364
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,110
It's the final match of the women's
group ssireum preliminaries.

1365
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,670
PRIMROSE versus DreamNote.

1366
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,210
Yes. Their preparation stood out
from the start.

1367
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,710
- Yes.
- As for PRIMROSE,

1368
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,050
their company director
used to be a ssireum player.

1369
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,480
Their company director.

1370
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,490
They got private coaching...

1371
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,320
and great support in their practice.

1372
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,560
But DreamNote is just as good.

1373
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,060
They learned a variety of techniques
in a short time.

1374
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,400
Both have excellent posture.

1375
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,570
(RUBY of PRIMROSE
versus MISO of DreamNote)

1376
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,100
They're turning.

1377
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,200
- They're turning.
- Okay.

1378
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,210
- She tried lifting her.
- All right.

1379
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,410
- RUBY.
- One more time.

1380
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,170
She's spinning her around,
but she doesn't fall.

1381
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,040
- She doesn't fall.
- RUBY is holding out.

1382
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
She's resisting well.

1383
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,580
- MISO tried a move, but...
- She's holding her ground.

1384
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,420
- This is intense.
- MISO and RUBY.

1385
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,080
This is the most intense match ever.

1386
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,950
- RUBY. She just has to make her fall.
- Hook her leg.

1387
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,260
Now...

1388
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,360
MISO is just as good.

1389
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,860
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my gosh.

1390
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,760
- Now...
- MISO is just as good.

1391
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,260
(MISO wins.)

1392
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,160
MISO wins.

1393
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,130
- DreamNote.
- Oh, my gosh.

1394
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,230
She tried a move, and it was working.

1395
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,300
If she had tried it more calmly...

1396
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,410
When RUBY tried the inner leg hook,

1397
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,280
she tried to hold her ground with her
left foot but lost her balance and fell.

1398
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,580
Instead of going for the hook right away,

1399
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,810
she should've stepped back once
before attempting it.

1400
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,350
That was so close.

1401
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,050
They had quick footwork
and spun around a lot.

1402
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,090
What's amazing about Hayun...

1403
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,190
is that she does the stepmill...

1404
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,420
for 30 to 40 minutes every day.

1405
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,630
I also do it for 45 to 50 minutes.

1406
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,100
Send us the video as proof.

1407
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,770
- Proof?
- Yes.

1408
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,200
(Do I need to submit the video as proof?)

1409
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:49,700
BoNi of DreamNote looks extremely nervous.

1410
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,240
- BoNi, you got this!
- BoNi, you got this!

1411
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,210
(DreamNote is leading 1 to 0.)

1412
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,210
(PRIMROSE is on the verge of elimination.)

1413
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,080
(How will this match end?)

1414
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,120
Ready.

1415
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,520
(Hayun of PRIMROSE
versus BoNi of DreamNote)

1416
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,220
Waist pull!

1417
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,760
(Hayun's waist pull)

1418
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,300
Waist pull!

1419
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,330
Commentator Lee,
what do you think about this?

1420
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,400
- Hayun just beat BoNi.
- Yes.

1421
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,000
I thought BoNi was an ace.

1422
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Me too.

1423
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,640
- As Hayun's left foot stepped forward,
- Yes.

1424
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,410
she shifted her weight and power onto it,

1425
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,480
- Yes.
- causing BoNi to lose balance.

1426
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,950
- Right.
- Yes.

1427
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:35,120
She made good use
of her strength and balance.

1428
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,750
You don't know
what will happen in ssireum.

1429
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:43,090
RAINIE of PRIMROSE
and EUNJO of DreamNote came out.

1430
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,990
I can tell
both teams practiced ssireum a lot.

1431
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,060
Absolutely.

1432
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,230
- RAINIE!
- EUNJO!

1433
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,730
(EUNJO's waist pull)

1434
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,070
EUNJO!

1435
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,300
- EUNJO did it.
- Waist pull.

1436
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,070
(Jumping up and down)

1437
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,040
What technique did she use to win?

1438
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,180
As RAINIE pushed to the right,

1439
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,980
EUNJO shifted direction,

1440
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,220
using one foot to redirect her momentum
in that direction.

1441
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,420
Then she pulled her and took her down.

1442
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,850
- Waist pull.
- Yes.

1443
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,660
DreamNote advances to the semifinals.

1444
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,430
(Women's ssireum bracket)

1445
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:25,930
We'll now begin the first match
of the women's group ssireum semifinals.

1446
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,800
SAY MY NAME versus FIFTY FIFTY.

1447
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,870
This is the first match of the semifinals.

1448
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:37,280
(Nervous)

1449
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,650
(JUNHWI of SAY MY NAME
versus YEWON of FIFTY FIFTY)

1450
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,120
(They've been locked in a power play
even before the match started.)

1451
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:51,230
(Neither of them is backing down.)

1452
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,060
The game begins.

1453
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,170
- Okay. She lifted her.
- YEWON.

1454
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,000
Waist pull!

1455
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,800
- Okay. She lifted her.
- YEWON.

1456
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,540
(JUNHWI's waist pull was successful.)

1457
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,010
(SAY MY NAME earns their first win
in the semifinals.)

1458
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,450
YEWON was holding her ground.

1459
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,280
(YEWON clenched her teeth.)

1460
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,320
That was so close.

1461
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,690
(YEWON's inner leg hook)

1462
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,360
(But it was followed...)

1463
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,620
(by JUNHWI's waist pull.)

1464
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,330
They didn't just use any technique.

1465
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,230
Everyone applied what they had practiced.

1466
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,130
They're showing more precise techniques
in the semifinals...

1467
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,700
than they did in the quarterfinals.

1468
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,900
It makes me happy.

1469
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,510
(KANNY of SAY MY NAME
versus ATHENA of FIFTY FIFTY)

1470
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,640
They're locked in an intense satba battle.

1471
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,410
- Look at how firmly they're holding on.
- Yes.

1472
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,380
It's a power play.

1473
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,050
(An intense satba battle)

1474
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:51,590
KANNY was chosen as an ace
by her SAY MY NAME teammates.

1475
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,690
That's amazing.

1476
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,160
(A showdown with no room to back down)

1477
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,830
- Bear hug throw! She did it!
- KANNY.

1478
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,040
- Bear hug throw! She did it!
- KANNY.

1479
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,940
- It was so close.
- KANNY takes the victory.

1480
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,010
I feel bad for FIFTY FIFTY.

1481
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,280
(Impressed)

1482
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:21,020
KANNY moved just a beat ahead of ATHENA.

1483
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,550
She stayed close to her,

1484
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,990
and successfully executed
the bear hug throw.

1485
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,120
They won 2 to 0.

1486
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,160
Winning 2 to 0,
SAY MY NAME advances to the finals.

1487
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
- It's 2 to 0.
- Congratulations.

1488
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,000
(Women's ssireum bracket)

1489
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:38,830
We'll now begin the second match
of the women's group ssireum semifinals.

1490
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,370
- It's Billlie versus DreamNote.
- Yes.

1491
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,370
Yes.

1492
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,170
- Sua hasn't competed in a match yet.
- Right.

1493
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,740
- Her aunt was a ssireum player.
- Yes.

1494
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,250
- Sua is the third player again.
- Yes.

1495
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,650
- They're saving her.
- They're really saving her.

1496
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,850
BoNi of DreamNote.

1497
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,260
I want to see what she got this time.

1498
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,360
BoNi is an ace.

1499
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,530
Yes. In her earlier preliminary round,
she didn't perform as well as expected.

1500
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,530
(Su Hyeon of Billlie
versus BoNi of DreamNote)

1501
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,170
- They're holding onto the satba tightly.
- Oh, my.

1502
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,900
- Look at them.
- BoNi of DreamNote.

1503
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,340
- She pulled the satba.
- Oh, my gosh.

1504
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,710
Yes.
Su Hyeon is holding the satba perfectly.

1505
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,980
She's doing amazing.

1506
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,610
BoNi is probably already a bit tired.

1507
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,250
- Right. She's keeping a lower stance.
- You got this!

1508
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,620
- Okay.
- You got this!

1509
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,350
Outer leg hook! Counter throw!

1510
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,820
(Su Hyeon's successful counter throw)

1511
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,190
(Counter Throw: a technique that
neutralizes the opponent's attack...)

1512
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,430
(and turns it back to overpower them)

1513
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,230
Su Hyeon wins.

1514
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,300
(So excited)

1515
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,040
(Billlie is the 1st to get their 1st win.)

1516
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,110
It really comes down to
how you hold the satba...

1517
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,810
and how you stand up at the start.

1518
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,880
Su Hyeon kept her stance...

1519
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,810
when her opponent hooked her leg
from quite a distance.

1520
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,380
Su Hyeon pulled her
and executed the counter throw.

1521
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,420
- Oh, my. That was incredible.
- Yes.

1522
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,520
It was amazing.

1523
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,420
(A brilliant technique that uses
the opponent's momentum against them)

1524
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,930
Su Hyeon is doing so well.

1525
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,100
She's a good student.

1526
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,030
- "A good student."
- She's doing exactly what she was taught.

1527
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,730
- Su Hyeon of Billlie.
- Oh, my.

1528
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,070
(Su Hyeon of Billlie is a top student.)

1529
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,640
Tsuki is here.

1530
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,510
Tsuki is serious now.

1531
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,740
(Tsuki is known to be strong.)

1532
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,480
Tsuki and MISO.

1533
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,780
- How will it go?
- Look at Tsuki.

1534
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,550
(Powerful Tsuki controls the game.)

1535
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,150
MISO is just as good.

1536
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,990
(MISO of incredible strength)

1537
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,750
(This match
is expected to be a tight one.)

1538
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,490
The members of Billlie have great posture.

1539
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,760
- Look at her posture.
- Her posture is amazing.

1540
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,460
- Her body is parallel to the ground.
- Exactly.

1541
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:52,700
(There's only one ticket to the finals.)

1542
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:57,210
(Tsuki of Billlie
versus MISO of DreamNote)

1543
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,580
Tsuki is maintaining a low stance
with her lower abdomen down.

1544
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,580
She's doing well.

1545
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,910
- MISO also has good posture.
- Okay.

1546
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,250
Good.

1547
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,080
- Did you see how she stood up?
- All right.

1548
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,150
The step!

1549
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,020
- Did you see how she stood up?
- All right.

1550
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,020
- The step!
- Tsuki!

1551
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,660
The step!

1552
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,360
Tsuki!

1553
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,960
Tsuki won.

1554
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,360
She fell after MISO's knee
touched the mat.

1555
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,600
- Really?
- She did?

1556
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,600
- Did Tsuki win?
- Yes.

1557
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,300
MISO's knee touched the mat
before Tsuki fell.

1558
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,840
She thought she was winning,

1559
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,440
but her knee touched the mat,
which means she lost.

1560
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,570
- Right here.
- She kneeled while throwing her.

1561
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,440
(MISO's knee touched the mat first.)

1562
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,310
It was very close for MISO.

1563
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,320
I know. It was so close.

1564
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,550
(Unfortunately, MISO lost.)

1565
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,690
Billlie made it to the finals.
Congratulations.

1566
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,760
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1567
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,120
(Women's ssireum bracket)

1568
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,560
(SAY MY NAME, Billlie)

1569
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,730
2025 Idol Star Athletics Championships,
Chuseok Special.

1570
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,800
I'm Kim Gyu Vin from ZEROBASEONE,
reporting live from the ssireum finals.

1571
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,570
If you win the gold medal,

1572
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,370
is there anything
you'd like to ask of your CEO?

1573
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,240
Please send all of us...

1574
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,410
on a trip together!

1575
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,050
We'll do our best.

1576
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,350
(Send us on a trip.)

1577
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,650
Producer Kim Jae Joong,

1578
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:20,820
since we have one more member now,

1579
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,060
please buy us another car!

1580
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,230
(Hitomi is the best.)

1581
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,030
We'll now begin
the women's group ssireum finals.

1582
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,330
- SAY MY NAME versus Billlie.
- Okay.

1583
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,700
I feel more nervous
since it's the final match.

1584
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,910
JUNHWI of SAY MY NAME.

1585
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,680
Su Hyeon of Billlie.

1586
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,410
JUNHWI is the team's ace,

1587
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:46,050
chosen by the coaches, not by the members.

1588
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,650
- It's legit then.
- It's legit.

1589
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,450
(JUNHWI has an attacking instinct.)

1590
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,860
(The new powerhouse in women's ssireum)

1591
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,560
And Su Hyeon.

1592
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,960
(Su Hyeon has solid fundamentals.)

1593
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:01,600
(A perfect blend
of strength and technique)

1594
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,400
Look at Su Hyeon's lower body.

1595
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,340
It's stuck on the mat.

1596
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,970
It's anchored.

1597
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,710
- Yes.
- JUNHWI's stance is low as well.

1598
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,880
Yes.

1599
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,640
(Since it's the final match,)

1600
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,580
(there's tension in the air.)

1601
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,880
- Su Hyeon, you got this!
- Su Hyeon, you got this!

1602
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,750
(The fans are cheering passionately.)

1603
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,820
- JUNHWI!
- JUNHWI!

1604
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,090
- JUNHWI!
- Who will win? It's the final match.

1605
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,820
- JUNHWI lifted her.
- Outer leg hook!

1606
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,260
- Outer leg hook.
- It didn't work.

1607
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,360
- It's not working.
- It's okay.

1608
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,430
(The result is impossible to predict.)

1609
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,000
- JUNHWI lifted her.
- Outer leg hook!

1610
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,130
- Outer leg hook.
- It didn't work.

1611
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,130
It's not working.

1612
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,700
(It's a fierce battle
worthy of the finals.)

1613
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,110
A pushing throw!

1614
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,510
- She did it!
- Oh, my gosh!

1615
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,510
A pushing throw!

1616
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,910
- She did it!
- Oh, my gosh!

1617
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,180
(JUNHWI's reverse bear hug throw
was successful.)

1618
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,250
- There you go! It's the bear hug throw!
- Who was it?

1619
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,650
- What was it?
- A bear hug throw.

1620
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,520
JUNHWI won.

1621
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,190
JUNHWI sed her opponent's strength...

1622
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,520
and won with a bear hug throw.

1623
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,160
(Shocked)

1624
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,190
- I think it was the highlight.
- Yes.

1625
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,660
It was the most memorable moment today.

1626
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:11,500
When Su Hyeon turned,

1627
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,170
JUNHWI used a bear hug throw against her.

1628
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:16,840
It's a technique that uses rotational
force to overpower the opponent.

1629
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,440
- She turned and...
- Yes.

1630
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,710
You can see this technique a lot
in the official matches.

1631
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,080
- Right.
- Yes.

1632
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,650
- Can we finally see Sua?
- It was so cool.

1633
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:29,350
Can we finally see her?

1634
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,490
- We can.
- We can.

1635
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,750
There's no other choice.

1636
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,820
- If KANNY wins, it's over.
- Right.

1637
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,060
(Sua can compete only when Tsuki wins.)

1638
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,030
- You're right.
- If KANNY wins, it's over.

1639
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,830
Her true ability will stay hidden.

1640
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:47,240
(Just one step away from victory)

1641
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,540
(Her opponent is Tsuki,
who possesses incredible power.)

1642
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,380
They're serious.

1643
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,510
They're very serious.

1644
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,750
(Hitomi who landed on her bottom)

1645
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,850
(Her opponent will be Sua,
the final boss.)

1646
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,320
(I really don't want to face her.)

1647
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,390
- Tsuki, you got this!
- Tsuki, you got this!

1648
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:16,130
(No one can predict the result.)

1649
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,740
(Who will the deity of victory favor?)

1650
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,740
(KANNY of SAY MY NAME
versus Tsuki of Billlie)

1651
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:26,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

1652
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,980
- She's holding her ground.
- She's pushing.

1653
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,240
- Tsuki.
- It has begun.

1654
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,580
(A fierce power struggle)

1655
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,910
- Oh, my.
- She's resisting.

1656
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,480
- KANNY is strong.
- Tsuki!

1657
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,280
- She's a little worn out.
- This is an epic match.

1658
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,520
- Bear hug throw! One more time!
- Hold out!

1659
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,450
Hold out! Okay.

1660
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,690
She turned!

1661
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,130
- Bear hug throw! One more time!
- Hold out!

1662
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,860
Hold out! Okay.

1663
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,830
(KANNY's powerful bear hug throw)

1664
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,000
They won.

1665
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,040
Tsuki lost.

1666
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,310
Gosh. I got goosebumps.

1667
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:04,610
I think it was the highlight
of today's women's ssireum event.

1668
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,810
I got goosebumps just now.

1669
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,120
KANNY has incredible core strength.

1670
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,750
Yes. KANNY pushed out
from her core into her legs,

1671
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,020
and Tsuki couldn't resist the force.

1672
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,360
- She turned her over.
- Yes.

1673
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,490
Her upper body was pushed back.

1674
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,600
And she got taken down
by her opponent's bear hug throw.

1675
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,700
(KANNY's move that determined the winner)

1676
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:29,240
SAY MY NAME wins the gold medal.

1677
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,710
(SAY MY NAME wins the gold medal.)

1678
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,440
I'm sure Jae Joong is crying right now.

1679
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,340
He must be checking out loan options.

1680
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:38,710
- But what really matters...
- Yes.

1681
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,010
is that we'll never be able...

1682
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,620
- to verify her true ability.
- It's a shame.

1683
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,920
Sua has never grabbed a satba.

1684
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,990
Right.

1685
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,490
(The 1st place's signature song ceremony)

1686
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,410
By defeating...

1687
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,440
- the strong opponent Billlie,
- Yes.

1688
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,750
SAY MY NAME won the 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special,

1689
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,020
women's group ssireum.

1690
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,450
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1691
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,290
(Shooting)

1692
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,990
All right, this game is a new event
to celebrate...

1693
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:25,530
the 15th anniversary
of the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1694
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,360
And it's pistol shooting.

1695
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,360
Gosh.

1696
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,970
(Pistol shooting)

1697
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:35,800
(The event that found
the best Olympic star)

1698
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,100
Following archery,

1699
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,370
which has been the Idol Star Athletics
Championships' favorite event,

1700
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:44,010
let's see if pistol shooting
can win the hearts of viewers.

1701
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:45,650
- I'm excited.
- Yes.

1702
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,280
Here we have the gold medalist
in shooting...

1703
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,120
at the 1999 Bangkok
and the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games,

1704
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,850
and the legendary shooter,

1705
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,360
Commentator Kim Jung Mi.

1706
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,960
Hello, I'm Commentator Kim Jung Mi...

1707
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,760
for the pistol shooting event
at the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1708
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,830
He's Korea's first Olympic medalist
in rapid fire pistol.

1709
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:10,100
(Cho Yeong Jae)

1710
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,240
The silver medalist...

1711
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,510
in the 2024 Paris Olympics
rapid fire pistol,

1712
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,510
Cho Yeong Jae.

1713
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,580
- Welcome.
- Hi.

1714
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:17,610
I'm Commentator Cho Yeong Jae...

1715
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,450
for the pistol shooting event
at the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1716
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:20,950
Good. Nice to meet you.

1717
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,190
How will the group pistol shooting
proceed?

1718
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,190
Right.

1719
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,150
(How will the pistol shooting proceed?)

1720
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,320
In the men's and women's group events,

1721
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,460
three members from each team will compete.

1722
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,660
Each player will shoot 5 shots,
for a total of 15 shots per team.

1723
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,070
According to International Shooting
Sport Federation regulations,

1724
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,040
each shot must be a single shot
and completed within 50 seconds.

1725
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,210
After the beep,
the 50-second countdown will start.

1726
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,040
It's a perfect 10.9.

1727
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,350
Without waiting for your opponent,

1728
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,020
both players will shoot simultaneously.

1729
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,850
If the first shooter scores high,

1730
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:02,190
the following player is bound to
feel anxious and pressured.

1731
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,360
- They say it makes you a nervous wreck.
- Right.

1732
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,530
You become a nervous wreck.

1733
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,890
That's right. Staying calm...

1734
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:10,100
and controlling your mindset
can determine the outcome.

1735
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,830
Like in archery,

1736
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:14,670
is the winner decided by the total score
in pistol shooting?

1737
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,270
Yes.
In the Idol Star Athletics Championships,

1738
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,870
this event will be scored based on points.

1739
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:20,440
The player who scores higher...

1740
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,380
will earn two points.

1741
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,150
If players tie down to the decimal points,

1742
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,580
they will each receive one point.

1743
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,050
The team with the higher total score
will win.

1744
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,590
It shouldn't be dangerous, right?

1745
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,160
- No, you see...
- What?

1746
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,590
- Oh, gosh.
- Why do you have one?

1747
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,490
- What's going on?
- Why not put it down first?

1748
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:40,730
Calm down, everyone.

1749
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,600
The pistols used here are laser pistols,

1750
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,200
just like those used
in actual international competitions.

1751
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:47,970
Modified to fire lasers
instead of live bullets,

1752
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,570
these air pistols
keep the players completely safe.

1753
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,840
- Shall I demonstrate?
- No, wait.

1754
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,740
It's safe, right?

1755
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,150
This one is the women's pistol,
while this one is for men.

1756
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,620
- Do you see the difference?
- Is it much heavier?

1757
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,820
- Yes.
- Even the size is different.

1758
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,020
- There is a difference in length...
- Yes.

1759
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,890
- and weight for about 400g.
- I see.

1760
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,520
It's clearly heavier.

1761
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,430
The men's pistol weighs around 1.2kg.

1762
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,530
Alright. At the 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships,

1763
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,730
Chuseok Special,

1764
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:19,470
we will now begin the men's group
pistol shooting event.

1765
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,570
(Men's group pistol shooting bracket)

1766
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:23,770
The boy groups performing worldwide...

1767
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,410
- are taking on pistol shooting.
- Yes?

1768
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,940
The line-up is serious business.

1769
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,080
The first match is
ZEROBASEONE versus RIIZE.

1770
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,880
Who's got the strongest forearms?

1771
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,150
ZEROBASEONE is a global boy group,

1772
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:42,120
formed with the love of fans
from 180 countries.

1773
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,330
Conquering the Billboard charts,

1774
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:47,660
RIIZE is rising like crazy,
living up to their group name.

1775
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,870
I never imagined these two groups
would face off on the shooting range.

1776
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,070
Really, wouldn't you call this
a battle between stars?

1777
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:56,800
- What's more, both teams...
- Yes?

1778
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,110
- debuted in 2023.
- Gosh.

1779
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,040
From earning the title
of monstrous rookies,

1780
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,940
they each won the Rookie Award
and Best Artist Award,

1781
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,450
establishing a rivalry.

1782
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:07,520
That's right.

1783
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,220
If they were first-generation idols,

1784
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,450
- Yes?
- it would be H.O.T. versus SECHSKIES.

1785
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,120
It's me, Kim Chae Hyun.

1786
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:18,560
We're about to start
the men's group pistol shooting.

1787
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,600
If you were to advance to the finals
and win the gold medal,

1788
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,330
what would be your winning pledge?

1789
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,640
If we win the gold medal,

1790
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,870
all of our members...

1791
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:33,770
will show off our abs
on the upcoming tour.

1792
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,480
(Is RIIZE intimidated?)

1793
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,550
They made a bold pledge.

1794
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,980
You can't lose, can you?

1795
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:44,020
Don't score one, ZEROBASEONE.

1796
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,520
I hope you don't.

1797
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,190
- Good luck.
- Okay.

1798
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,030
Although we both debuted in the same year,

1799
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:55,330
you do know ZEROBASEONE
appeared on this show first, right?

1800
01:09:58,470 --> 01:09:59,630
His words hit hard.

1801
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,140
- Yes.
- This is serious business.

1802
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,240
(Neither backs down in the power play.)

1803
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,340
The first players from ZEROBASEONE
and RIIZE are up.

1804
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:10,440
Kim Tae Rae and Anton
will take the first shots.

1805
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,450
(Kim Tae Rae of ZEROBASEONE
versus Anton of RIIZE)

1806
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,180
It seems like the players
are already ready.

1807
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,720
Maybe not.

1808
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,520
They're taking aim.

1809
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,720
What we call natural aiming is about...

1810
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,830
positioning yourself
before picking up the gun.

1811
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,330
This is the key difference
between professionals and amateurs.

1812
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,530
Amateurs pick up the gun first,

1813
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,830
while professionals set
their natural aim first.

1814
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,640
(Before their first pistol shooting game,)

1815
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:43,910
(the idols learned
the basics of shooting.)

1816
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,980
All right then.

1817
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,820
- They're now taking their first shots.
- Yes.

1818
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:02,100
Is it because this is the men's game?

1819
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,770
I feel like their pride
is on the line too.

1820
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,470
True.

1821
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,940
- They've taken their shots.
- They fired at the same time.

1822
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,070
(Glancing)

1823
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,170
(The monitor shows their scores.)

1824
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,810
(They can only see their own scores.)

1825
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,680
Kim Tae Rae, 6.4.

1826
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,150
- Kim Tae Rae, 6.4.
- Anton, 6.9.

1827
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,420
Anton, 6.9.

1828
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:28,190
Both players started off with scores
in the six-second range.

1829
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,860
You can do it.

1830
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,690
You'll do better next time.

1831
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,530
- Anton takes the first two points.
- Right.

1832
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,930
- Yes.
- They took the first shots with ease.

1833
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:40,470
Now, they should forget the first shot...

1834
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:42,440
and focus on the second.

1835
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,210
(Kim Tae Rae of ZEROBASEONE aims first.)

1836
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,680
- Tae Rae has his pistol aimed straight.
- Yes, he does.

1837
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,150
- Nice.
- Kim Tae Rae, 7.

1838
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,990
- He looks confident, no?
- Yes.

1839
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,790
- Okay.
- Anton, 8.8.

1840
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:08,730
(Anton of RIIZE takes another 2 points.)

1841
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:13,030
Anton's pistol shakes much less.

1842
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:14,540
- Yes.
- You're right.

1843
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:18,010
Tae Rae's is shaking a lot more.

1844
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:23,480
With his tall frame,
Anton is maintaining proper posture.

1845
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,280
- Anton is a former swimming athlete.
- I see.

1846
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,410
During practice,

1847
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:31,490
Kim Tae Rae showed steady breathing.

1848
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:32,490
- That's great.
- Right.

1849
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:35,490
But due to the tension,
he's quite unsteady.

1850
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,220
Here comes the third shot.

1851
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,330
(The following 3rd shot)

1852
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,430
The coach said that
if Anton zeroed the sights well,

1853
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:46,370
- he would do great in the match.
- Exactly.

1854
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,040
Kim Tae Rae has taken the shot.

1855
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,840
Kim Tae Rae, 7.

1856
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,210
Anton, 8.2.

1857
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,610
Anton takes up to six points.

1858
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:58,780
The gap is widening.

1859
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:01,720
- I can't aim well.
- It looks like Kim Tae Rae is shaken.

1860
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,750
He's impatient, and his pride is hurt.

1861
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:06,320
- That's a technical term.
- Yes.

1862
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,120
It's important for Kim Tae Rae
to keep his cool.

1863
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,520
He must stay calm until the end.

1864
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,990
Don't let Anton's momentum get to you.

1865
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:15,330
That's right.
Concentrate on your own shots.

1866
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,630
- Kim Tae Rae, 4.2.
- All that matters is yours.

1867
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:21,440
Anton is fully using his 50 seconds.

1868
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,570
Anton, 9.1.

1869
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,740
Anton earns a total of eight points.

1870
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,740
Anton's scores keep improving steadily.

1871
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,950
Exactly.

1872
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:35,150
Meanwhile,
Kim Tae Rae's scores are slipping.

1873
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:39,890
(Shoot me down first.)

1874
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:44,220
Kim Tae Rae currently has 0 points,
while Anton has 8 points.

1875
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,230
The final shot.

1876
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:47,430
(They only have one chance left.)

1877
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,900
All right.

1878
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:51,970
It’s best for Kim Tae Rae...

1879
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,370
- to stay focused until the very end.
- Stay calm.

1880
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,710
Anton is calm.

1881
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,840
(Who will take the final points?)

1882
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,580
Anton, 7. Kim Tae Rae, 8.

1883
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,680
I see.

1884
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:12,620
Kim Tae Rae takes the last two points.

1885
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,490
(Anton of RIIZE delivered
an overwhelming performance.)

1886
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:22,360
With that, ZEROBASEONE earns 2 points,
while RIIZE takes 8 points.

1887
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,570
RIIZE wins the first match.

1888
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,500
Watching the screen makes me feel...

1889
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,470
- all warm and happy.
- Exactly.

1890
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,770
- That again?
- Gosh.

1891
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,640
- Really.
- You've been saying that the whole time.

1892
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,010
Nice.

1893
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,850
Isn't it like a scene from a movie?

1894
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,310
(Bringing joy...)

1895
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,750
I'm in total bliss.

1896
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,080
(through the scoreboard)

1897
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,850
The second match is between...

1898
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:50,620
Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE
and SHOTARO of RIIZE.

1899
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,460
- Zhang Hao made an incredible pledge.
- Yes.

1900
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,730
- If they win the gold medal,
- Yes?

1901
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,760
he'll appear on this show every year.

1902
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,770
- He'll be on this show for life.
- Yes.

1903
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,740
Let's watch the first shot.

1904
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,740
(The first shot
for a lifetime of appearances)

1905
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:10,440
(Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE
needs to make up 6 points.)

1906
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,380
- They shot almost at the same time.
- Yes.

1907
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,550
- SHOTARO, 4.8.
- Okay.

1908
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,250
Zhang Hao, 6.6.

1909
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,460
This time,

1910
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,890
Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE takes two points.

1911
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,190
- Yes.
- That's right.

1912
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,830
(The gap has narrowed to 4 points.)

1913
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,130
(I can't see well.)

1914
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:31,930
(Lower it.)

1915
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,330
- Come to think of it...
- The screen.

1916
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,500
- SHOTARO didn't have his screen down.
- No.

1917
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,510
- He has it down now.
- Yes.

1918
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,710
Earlier, he didn't.

1919
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,970
Imagine how nervous he must have been.

1920
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,840
That's called a screen.

1921
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,510
It covers one of your eyes,

1922
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,480
allowing you to shoot with both eyes open.

1923
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:48,280
- You use it in real life, right?
- Yes.

1924
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,720
Let's watch the second shot.

1925
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,450
(With a 4-point gap, the 2nd shot)

1926
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,020
Focus.

1927
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,290
Deep breaths.

1928
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,430
- He has good posture.
- Right?

1929
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,500
- SHOTARO,
- SHOTARO?

1930
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,870
- He got 3.8.
- And Zhang Hao?

1931
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:07,870
- Zhang Hao, 10.3.
- Zhang Hao, 10.3.

1932
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,670
- That's the highest score yet.
- Yes.

1933
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,840
- That's right.
- Good.

1934
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:14,440
(Zhang Hao is chasing RIIZE
at a frightening pace.)

1935
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,280
The current scores are
six points for ZEROBASEONE...

1936
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,080
and eight points for RIIZE.

1937
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,420
- There's a 2-point gap.
- A 2-point gap.

1938
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,820
- ZEROBASEONE is closing in.
- SHOTARO.

1939
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,820
(Calm down.)

1940
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,150
Here goes their third shot.

1941
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,790
(The 3rd shot will be
an important turning point.)

1942
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,060
SHOTARO can’t help but get nervous...

1943
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,360
as Zhang Hao closes in.

1944
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,060
His hand is trembling.

1945
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,900
SHOTARO, 7.6.

1946
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,470
Zhang Hao, 6.2.

1947
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,740
(Smiling)

1948
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:48,080
This time, SHOTARO gains two points.

1949
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:51,980
Only if Zhang Hao scores higher
on the next two shots...

1950
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,180
- will they tie.
- That's right.

1951
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,190
- The crowd will go wild if they tie.
- Right?

1952
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:59,550
- They'll go wild.
- Yes.

1953
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,750
(The crowd will go wild if they tie.)

1954
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,820
As the event progresses,
the athletes perform even better.

1955
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,630
They must remain calm.

1956
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,830
Zhang Hao, 8.7.

1957
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,930
SHOTARO, 4.3.

1958
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:17,370
- If Zhang Hao scores higher again,
- Yes?

1959
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,740
- they'll tie.
- A tie.

1960
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:21,940
The third match will be a must-watch.

1961
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,680
- Unbelievable.
- Nice.

1962
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,710
All right.

1963
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:27,850
Don't let your guard down
until the very end.

1964
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,050
- No, don't.
- Focus.

1965
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,250
- They must wrap it up.
- Yes.

1966
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,150
The last shot.

1967
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:35,820
If Zhang Hao earns the points,
the two groups will tie.

1968
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:38,060
- Zhang Hao simply has to do his job...
- Yes.

1969
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,060
- and not let the score affect him.
- Exactly.

1970
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,960
Zhang Hao's hand is shaking.

1971
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,900
Zhang Hao, 9.3.

1972
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,640
SHOTARO, 9.5.

1973
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,740
(SHOTARO shakes off Zhang Hao
with a high score of 9.5.)

1974
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,910
- A high score.
- Yes.

1975
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,080
(Relieved)

1976
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,420
- SHOTARO has taken a step further.
- Yes.

1977
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,350
- RIIZE has 12 points,
- SHOTARO!

1978
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,160
- while ZEROBASEONE has 8 points.
- SHOTARO!

1979
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,690
- But who knows what'll happen?
- Exactly.

1980
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,830
- It's not over until the last shot.
- No, it's not.

1981
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:16,000
Normally, it's easier to chase someone
in shooting.

1982
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,830
- I think ZEROBASEONE has the advantage.
- I see. Nice.

1983
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:21,770
Han Yu Jin of ZEROBASEONE...

1984
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,270
- versus WON BIN of RIIZE.
- Yes.

1985
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,440
(Han Yu Jin versus WON BIN)

1986
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:30,110
(An intense fan cheer
befitting the final series)

1987
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,710
- They must be dead nervous.
- Yes.

1988
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,180
(Nervous)

1989
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,550
WON BIN.

1990
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,720
(WON BIN.)

1991
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,290
(Oh, right!)

1992
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,790
(The last step
that will decide the winner)

1993
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,260
Are they down?

1994
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,160
Yes, they both have their screens down.

1995
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,230
(The first shot of the last series)

1996
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:49,730
Deep breaths, calm down.

1997
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,730
- They've lowered the pistols.
- Good luck, ZEROBASEONE and RIIZE.

1998
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,170
Okay.

1999
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,840
- They've fired.
- Han Yu Jin, 3.8.

2000
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,640
WON BIN, 8.8.

2001
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,040
He needs to catch up.

2002
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,510
- The gap has widened again.
- Yes, he needs to catch up.

2003
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:07,550
Every point counts for ZEROBASEONE.

2004
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,350
- That's right.
- The second shot.

2005
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,750
(The 2nd shot with a 6-point gap)

2006
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,750
(If WON BIN wins again,
RIIZE takes the victory.)

2007
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,120
They need to stay relaxed.

2008
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:22,360
(Meanwhile, Han Yu Jin must win
all 4 remaining shots.)

2009
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:26,730
Han Yu Jin has taken the shot.

2010
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,340
- Okay.
- Both have fired.

2011
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,670
(And the results?)

2012
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,610
Han Yu Jin, 6.9.

2013
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:41,010
WON BIN, 7.6.

2014
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:44,950
RIIZE has advanced to the finals.

2015
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,350
(RIIZE has won.)

2016
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,920
- WON BIN was stable.
- WON BIN...

2017
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,420
has great concentration.

2018
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,830
RIIZE has advanced to the finals.

2019
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:59,100
(Men's group pistol shooting bracket)

2020
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:02,340
It's now the second match
of the men's group pistol shooting event.

2021
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:06,210
The match is between
P1Harmony and NCT WISH.

2022
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,680
- This is another big one.
- Yes.

2023
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,750
NCT WISH,
with their refreshing and pure charm,

2024
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,610
has captured the hearts of the ladies.

2025
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:14,780
Meanwhile, P1Harmony...

2026
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,250
is striking straight at
the hearts of the fans...

2027
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,090
with their mature and decadent charm.

2028
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:23,090
It's a showdown between two groups
with completely different vibes. Wait.

2029
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:29,260
So it's either the younger guy
or the older guy who controls you.

2030
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,330
- You look very happy, Commentator Kim.
- Yes, thank you.

2031
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:35,240
Who do you prefer?
Younger guys or older guys?

2032
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,740
- Since...
- Yes?

2033
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:37,940
I'm quite old,

2034
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,770
I'd say I prefer younger guys.
That's right.

2035
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:42,140
- Nice.
- Yes.

2036
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:45,110
Which group will advance to the finals?

2037
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:49,150
KEEHO of P1Harmony and RIKU of NCT WISH...

2038
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:51,250
are the first players.

2039
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:56,720
(The first shot that will set
the tone of the match)

2040
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:04,360
- RIKU, 6.6.
- Yes.

2041
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,770
KEEHO,

2042
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:07,130
- miss.
- Oh, KEEHO.

2043
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,040
He missed.

2044
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,610
(He fired while lowering his pistol.)

2045
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,680
KEEHO, relax.

2046
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,820
The members cheer him on.

2047
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,150
The second shot.

2048
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,490
(Will he make up for it in the 2nd shot?)

2049
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,420
KEEHO needs to stay calm...

2050
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,990
- and build momentum.
- Yes.

2051
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,900
RIKU, 7.7.

2052
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,030
RIKU.

2053
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,930
- KEEHO, 7.7.
- Great.

2054
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:42,170
With that,

2055
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:44,670
- each group takes one point.
- Yes.

2056
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,440
But overall,

2057
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,880
- NCT WISH has more points.
- Yes, that's right.

2058
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,280
- RIKU has earned three points.
- Exactly.

2059
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,050
The third shot.

2060
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:59,390
(The 3rd shot will decide the winner
between the 2 neck-and-neck players.)

2061
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,950
Okay.

2062
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:03,460
RIKU, 8.9.

2063
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,760
- His hand trembled badly.
- Yes, it's shaking.

2064
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,930
KEEHO, 8.1.

2065
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,200
- Despite that,
- Nice one.

2066
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,000
- Despite that, he lands a solid shot.
- Right?

2067
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,300
KEEHO did well,

2068
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,000
- but RIKU did even better.
- Exactly.

2069
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,470
- Yes.
- Scoring 0.8 higher,

2070
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:21,010
- RIKU takes the points.
- That's right.

2071
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:23,180
All right, the fourth shot.

2072
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,680
(There's already a 4-point gap.)

2073
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,420
KEEHO, 6.4.

2074
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,560
- Both have fired.
- RIKU, 6.3.

2075
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:43,160
KEEHO takes two points...

2076
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,930
with just a 0.1 difference.

2077
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,070
- If KEEHO shoots...
- Yes?

2078
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:51,370
- closer to the bullseye,
- Yes?

2079
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:53,540
- he can finish the match in a tie.
- True.

2080
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:55,740
Here comes the final shot.

2081
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,810
(The last shot that will put an end...)

2082
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,310
(to the close game)

2083
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:03,080
- This could end in a tie.
- Yes.

2084
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:06,720
RIKU.

2085
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,290
- That was fast.
- He fired quickly.

2086
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,590
He has to stay calm.

2087
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,090
Even with his hand trembling,
he shoots well.

2088
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:15,430
- KEEHO, 6.9.
- That is so close.

2089
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,660
RIKU, 7.8.

2090
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,430
- With that...
- That widens the gap to four points.

2091
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,470
(RIKU wins the neck-and-neck match.)

2092
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:24,200
- NCT WISH has seven points.
- Yes.

2093
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,410
- P1Harmony has three points.
- Right.

2094
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,910
A four-point difference.

2095
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,280
The second players are
JONGSEOB of P1Harmony...

2096
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,950
- and RYO of NCT WISH.
- That's right.

2097
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,010
JONGSEOB...

2098
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,250
needs to take the 1st 4 points...

2099
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:41,820
- to tie it up.
- Exactly.

2100
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,990
The first shot.

2101
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,990
JONGSEOB was the ace during practice.

2102
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,160
- Really?
- He was calm and had great focus.

2103
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,500
I hope he can carry that into the match.

2104
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,300
Right.

2105
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,440
(RYO lowers his pistol?)

2106
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,940
- As for RYO, if he can't aim,
- Yes?

2107
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,510
he shifts his shoulders.

2108
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:03,910
- Does he have a habit?
- Yes.

2109
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,450
- That's cute.
- It's heavy.

2110
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,980
- That pistol is too heavy for RYO.
- True.

2111
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,120
RYO, 7.4.

2112
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,820
- Nice.
- 7.4.

2113
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,390
- Good job.
- Yes.

2114
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,020
JONGSEOB, 6.2.

2115
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,060
- Good.
- Nice.

2116
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,860
RYO acted like he lacked confidence.

2117
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,360
- Exactly.
- RYO...

2118
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,260
is known as
the King of Timing in Shooting.

2119
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,130
He's in the process of finding
the right timing.

2120
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,370
The gap has widened to six points.

2121
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,600
RYO looks extremely nervous.

2122
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:36,310
That is how RYO tries to relax.

2123
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,080
- Like that?
- Yes.

2124
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:41,250
- JONGSEOB can do it.
- Yes, he can.

2125
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,380
Six points. He can catch up quickly.

2126
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,120
- Just like earlier,
- Yes.

2127
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,120
he lowers his pistol.

2128
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,790
- JONGSEOB, 7.2.
- It's okay.

2129
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:52,730
JONGSEOB fired early.

2130
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,960
RYO, 3.1.

2131
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,760
All right.

2132
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,470
NCT WISH scored 9 points,
and P1HARMONY scored 5 points.

2133
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:05,040
That means JONGSEOB
has to score four more points.

2134
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,040
Let's see if he'll be able to.

2135
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,940
Here comes the third shot.

2136
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,080
(The 3rd shot of the 2nd series)

2137
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,140
Let's begin.

2138
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:14,450
(JONGSEOB is closing in,
and RYO has to stay ahead.)

2139
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,150
JONGSEOB gives off...

2140
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,120
- the vibe of a lone assassin.
- You're right.

2141
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,450
That's spot on.

2142
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,760
RYO, 8.7.

2143
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,930
- JONGSEOB, 8.6.
- He's definitely...

2144
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,190
the King of Timing.

2145
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,500
He is the King of Timing.

2146
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,730
Goodness. Unbelievable.

2147
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,160
He knows when the right timing is.

2148
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,770
With just a 0.1 difference,

2149
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,770
- RYO won two points.
- Yes.

2150
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:38,070
(Current score)

2151
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,710
The fourth shot.

2152
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,210
(The gap shows little sign of narrowing.)

2153
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,510
He's glaring at the target.

2154
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,510
Yes.

2155
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,050
"I'm a lone assassin."

2156
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,620
"My target is in the dark."

2157
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,550
- "Into the darkness in a circle."
- They raise their guns.

2158
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:55,050
Bang.

2159
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,460
JONGSEOB, 7.8.

2160
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,730
RYO, 6.4.

2161
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:01,590
- All right.
- Okay.

2162
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,900
Nice.

2163
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,230
- JONGSEOB scored two points this time.
- Yes.

2164
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:08,170
NCT WISH has 11 points
and P1Harmony has 7 points.

2165
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,170
They're four points behind.

2166
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,770
Here comes the final shot.

2167
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:13,140
(This is their final chance.)

2168
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:18,240
- JONGSEOB has to score points this time.
- Yes.

2169
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,910
But it's important not to be hasty...

2170
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,980
- or greedy.
- RYO, 7.3.

2171
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,420
JONGSEOB, 8.2.

2172
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,760
- That's 2 points.
- That's 2 points.

2173
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,130
- He narrowed the gap.
- He narrowed the gap.

2174
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,430
- P1Harmony has nine points,
- Yes.

2175
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:36,330
and NCT WISH is in the lead
with 11 points.

2176
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:37,330
With just a two-point difference,

2177
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,930
- the tables can turn at any moment.
- Right.

2178
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:40,930
- Yes.
- That's right.

2179
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,240
This puts a lot of pressure...

2180
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
- on the final players.
- Yes.

2181
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,540
We have INTAK from P1Harmony
and SION from NCT WISH.

2182
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,880
(INTAK of P1Harmony
versus SION of NCT WISH)

2183
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,150
INTAK from P1Harmony...

2184
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:55,110
is a left-handed shooter.

2185
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:57,720
Does being left-handed
give him a disadvantage?

2186
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,890
No.

2187
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:00,190
Not many shooters are left-handed,

2188
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:01,620
but that doesn't mean it's a disadvantage.

2189
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,060
A good example is Kim Cheong Yong,

2190
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,830
who won two gold medals
at the Asian Games.

2191
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:07,690
(Two-time Asian Games gold medalist
Kim Cheong Yong is also left-handed.)

2192
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,500
(Will the left-handed shooter
be able to tie the score?)

2193
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,700
- Left-handed shooters are good.
- Let's go.

2194
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,500
SION from NCT WISH...

2195
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:16,700
has taken the shot.

2196
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,970
- Wait. There's no way.
- INTAK from P1Harmony has taken the shot.

2197
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:22,540
What is it? What is that face?

2198
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:26,080
SION, 2.7.

2199
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,620
INTAK, 8.6.

2200
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,520
- They're tied already.
- They're tied already.

2201
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,950
The score is tied now.

2202
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,660
Yes. The score is currently tied
at 11 to 11.

2203
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,330
They're tied.

2204
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:42,230
This could shift the momentum
in P1Harmony's...

2205
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:44,900
- to their favor.
- favor. Yes.

2206
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,800
Time for the second shot. Let's begin.

2207
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
(This 2nd shot could change
who has the upper hand.)

2208
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,940
He's left-handed like Kim Cheong Yong.

2209
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,540
- Slowly.
- Left-handed shooters are good.

2210
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,740
- Yes.
- Let’s take it slow.

2211
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:56,940
His hand is noticeably shakier
compared to the first shot.

2212
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,510
- They fired almost simultaneously.
- Yes.

2213
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:04,420
- SION, 5.3.
- Gosh, INTAK.

2214
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:07,090
- He turned the tables.
- INTAK, 8.8

2215
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:08,820
P1Harmony overtakes NCT WISH.

2216
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,720
P1Harmony catches up and takes the lead.

2217
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

2218
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,990
Commentator Cho.
How are the scores looking?

2219
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,160
P1Harmony turned the tables
with 13 points.

2220
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,560
NCT WISH is at 11 points,
so it's a 2 point-difference.

2221
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,230
- This match could go either way.
- Right.

2222
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,370
P1Harmony already turned the tables.

2223
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:25,340
I'm so curious to see what happens next.

2224
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,170
SION was really good during practice,

2225
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,980
but he seems to be quite nervous
right now.

2226
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:31,240
- I see.
- His hand is very shaky.

2227
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,880
- It is.
- Yes.

2228
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,650
SION, 3.8.

2229
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,080
INTAK, 6.9.

2230
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,220
They're in trouble.

2231
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,190
(SION failed to score a point again.)

2232
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,720
- Yes.
- That's too bad.

2233
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:45,530
SION from NCT WISH...

2234
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,430
has practically drawn a Bermuda Triangle.

2235
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:48,430
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2236
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,130
- That's too bad.
- They now have a four-point difference.

2237
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:54,600
If INTAK wins just one more time,

2238
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,370
P1Harmony's place in the finals
will be secured.

2239
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,640
He has to win points here.

2240
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:58,940
Here comes the fourth shot.

2241
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,480
If they win points one more time,

2242
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,310
P1Harmony will advance to the finals.

2243
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:06,780
- Yes.
- They're steadying their breaths.

2244
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,750
The two are steadying their breaths.

2245
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,880
- They're nervous.
- They must be nervous.

2246
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,350
This is what you expect from a big match.

2247
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,860
- Gosh.
- Yes.

2248
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,930
Okay.

2249
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,630
- INTAK looks disappointed.
- He looks unhappy.

2250
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:22,860
One more shot...

2251
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,330
- will take us to the finals, right?
- Yes.

2252
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:26,300
- Yes.
- Let's see.

2253
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,270
INTAK, 0.

2254
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:35,740
- SION, 6.3.
- He missed.

2255
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,980
He missed.

2256
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,350
This is such an important moment
and he missed.

2257
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:41,010
With only one shot left,

2258
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,680
SION won two points.

2259
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,650
With the score at 15 to 13,
they're now at a 2-point difference.

2260
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:48,920
Now, if SION wins again,

2261
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,590
- they'll be tied, right?
- Right.

2262
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:52,930
- This can go either way.
- Yes.

2263
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:54,560
This can really go either way.

2264
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,030
- With 1 shot left, will they be tied,
- Only 1 shot left.

2265
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,230
or will P1Harmony move up to the finals?

2266
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:59,570
That is the question.

2267
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,570
(The final shot that will decide
the fate of both teams)

2268
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:05,470
Scoring as high as possible is the key.

2269
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:06,470
That's right.

2270
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:10,980
Holding the gun for too long
for a high score can be detrimental.

2271
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:13,710
- They just have to focus.
- Yes.

2272
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,380
His gun is well-aligned.

2273
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:17,620
- Nice.
- Just like that.

2274
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,150
- Focus.
- He fired.

2275
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:20,150
This is going to be difficult.

2276
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:21,820
- INTAK fired a bit late.
- He fired.

2277
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:23,820
- And the results?
- INTAK, 2.2.

2278
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:26,690
SION, 8.9.

2279
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:28,230
- This means they're tied.
- They're tied.

2280
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:30,760
- They're tied. This is amazing.
- Amazing.

2281
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,330
- He did it.
- They're tied.

2282
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,230
They're tied.

2283
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,940
I didn’t realize getting to the finals
would be this hard.

2284
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:40,940
If the score is tied,

2285
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:43,180
- each player fires one shot at a time,
- Yes.

2286
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:46,250
and the points are added
to determine the winner.

2287
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,250
(Shoot-out: Each player fires one shot.
The total points determine the winner.)

2288
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,480
It's like a penalty shoot-out in soccer.

2289
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,120
- That's right.
- That's right.

2290
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,580
They must be really nervous.

2291
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:57,190
RIKU and KEEHO are the first players.

2292
01:30:57,190 --> 01:30:58,790
(Relaxed)

2293
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:00,590
- He's relaxed.
- Yes.

2294
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:03,060
The first and last shot.

2295
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,230
(The first shot of the shoot-off
is important.)

2296
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:06,030
- A shot from his soul.
- Yes.

2297
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,730
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2298
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:12,100
(RIKU had the edge in the previous match.)

2299
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,210
It's like a penalty shoot-out in soccer.

2300
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:15,610
(He came out on top of the 1st series
by 3 to 7.)

2301
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,680
They must be nervous
since this is the only shot.

2302
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,050
- Right.
- Yes.

2303
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:22,420
- He lowers it.
- He lowered his gun.

2304
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:23,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

2305
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,520
KEEHO has yet to raise his.

2306
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,750
Calm and steady.

2307
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,190
- Yes. He is...
- Shooting quickly might be better.

2308
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,320
- KEEHO seems relaxed.
- Yes.

2309
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,590
He makes a quick shot.

2310
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:34,430
The look on his face...

2311
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:36,700
The look on his face...

2312
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,130
What happened?

2313
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,370
- RIKU, 2.5.
- He got 2 points.

2314
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:43,700
- KEEHO, 8.9.
- KEEHO.

2315
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,140
P1Harmony takes the lead by two points.

2316
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:48,610
It's okay. They still have a chance.

2317
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:49,840
- Yes.
- Two more shots.

2318
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,980
- Yes.
- RYO and JONGSEOB...

2319
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,980
- are up next.
- You got this.

2320
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:55,620
The cheerful and sunny-faced assassin...

2321
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:58,150
and a tormented, lone assassin.

2322
01:31:58,150 --> 01:31:59,250
- That's right.
- Yes.

2323
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,290
This is between the two assassins.

2324
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,290
- I'm nervous as well.
- Yes.

2325
01:32:04,490 --> 01:32:06,530
- The two players are nervous.
- Let's go.

2326
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:07,590
- Right.
- Yes.

2327
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:09,660
This feels like the finals.

2328
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,570
- It practically is the finals.
- Yes.

2329
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:14,170
- For the players...
- All they have to do is focus...

2330
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:16,000
- as they fire.
- Right.

2331
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,570
RYO lowered his gun again.

2332
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:22,580
I can't read that look on RYO's face.

2333
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,010
- Right.
- Yes.

2334
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,850
He fired in a calm manner.

2335
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:29,320
- JONGSEOB fired 1st.
- It's just 1 shot.

2336
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,620
- Right.
- This one shot will decide who wins.

2337
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,990
- Gosh.
- All right.

2338
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:34,290
What happened?

2339
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,260
- The look on his face...
- RYO, 7.7.

2340
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,820
JONGSEOB, 9.2.

2341
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,890
- P1Harmony.
- That means...

2342
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,560
they've secured their place in the finals.

2343
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,800
That was close.

2344
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,200
This was such an intense semifinals.

2345
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,700
It was so fun.

2346
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:51,970
NCT WISH versus P1Harmony.

2347
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:54,010
P1Harmony has advanced to the finals.

2348
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,940
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2349
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:58,950
Who will become the first sniper
of the pistol shooting finals?

2350
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:01,780
We’ll be bringing you the live coverage
of the finals right now.

2351
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,620
P1Harmony versus RIIZE.

2352
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:08,990
Who will be claiming the title
of "Idol Sniper?"

2353
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,590
This is the final showdown.

2354
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:14,090
Anton of RIIZE and KEEHO of P1Harmony...

2355
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,960
are the first players.

2356
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:18,430
(The first shot
of the long-awaited finals)

2357
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,330
Anton has perfect posture.

2358
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:21,370
- Yes.
- That's right.

2359
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,770
I heard KEEHO...

2360
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:25,570
- has been committed to his practice.
- Yes.

2361
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:27,440
- He's diligent too?
- Yes.

2362
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:29,940
- Gosh.
- KEEHO, nine.

2363
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:32,240
- Anton, 10.1.
- Anton.

2364
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,780
- Anton.
- Amazing.

2365
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,510
- He's so good.
- He's incredible.

2366
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:36,920
He's amazing.

2367
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,190
Anton won the first shot,

2368
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,750
taking the lead 2 to 0.

2369
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,890
He's doing it textbook-style.
This is amazing.

2370
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:46,630
- Anton kept his pistol remarkably steady.
- That's right.

2371
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:48,560
- He had a solid stance,
- Right.

2372
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,460
and he shot a 10.1.

2373
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:57,440
KEEHO also did great at the semifinals.

2374
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,470
- He's not an easy match.
- He is definitely not.

2375
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:02,680
KEEHO.

2376
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:06,480
(Gosh)

2377
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:08,580
Anton, 7.8.

2378
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:11,550
- This time, KEEHO shot a 10.6.
- KEEHO, 10.6.

2379
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,520
Isn't 10.6 the highest shot yet?

2380
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,160
- That's almost a perfect score.
- Yes.

2381
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,830
- What did you say the perfect score was?
- It's 10.9.

2382
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,330
The perfect score is 10.9,

2383
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,430
and he shot a 10.6.

2384
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:30,440
- Yes, it's 0.3 shy of a perfect score.
- Gosh.

2385
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:32,840
I knew KEEHO could do it.

2386
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,010
- That's right.
- Yes.

2387
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:38,980
(Even Anton, the shooting ace,
is taken by surprise.)

2388
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:43,820
Here comes the third shot.

2389
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:46,820
(The 3rd shot in a tied situation)

2390
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,020
It’s remarkable how these idols...

2391
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:53,090
are showing such skill
in such a short time.

2392
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,500
- They have to keep the momentum going.
- Anton fired first.

2393
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:02,100
- He looks unhappy.
- The look on his face.

2394
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,270
Anton, 8.2.

2395
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,610
KEEHO, 0.

2396
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:10,480
(No!)

2397
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:13,750
- Anton shows no change...
- Yes.

2398
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:17,280
- in expression.
- I heard Anton...

2399
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,720
- is the best at shooting within RIIZE.
- Yes.

2400
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:22,620
Alright.

2401
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,890
They're both doing well.

2402
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:26,360
- Here comes the fourth shot.
- Yes.

2403
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,800
- Being calm is key.
- Yes.

2404
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,330
Anton is maintaining a proper stance.

2405
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:34,470
Anton, 8.1.

2406
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:38,500
KEEHO, 7.5.

2407
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:41,840
- Amazing.
- Anton doesn't miss.

2408
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,950
- Anton scores another two points.
- That's right.

2409
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,880
Here comes the final shot.

2410
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,650
(The final shot of the 1st series
at the finals!)

2411
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,580
They should do their best
until the very end.

2412
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,620
(Will Anton dominate
all the way to the finish?)

2413
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:54,850
- Deep breaths.
- Yes.

2414
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:56,160
Slowly.

2415
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,720
They're aiming their pistols.

2416
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,500
Anton, 6.8.

2417
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,970
KEEHO raises his pistol again
after lowering it.

2418
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:08,200
P1Harmony probably used up...

2419
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,600
- a lot of their strength.
- That's right.

2420
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,540
KEEHO, 0.

2421
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,280
- That's too bad.
- KEEHO hit a zero.

2422
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,880
Anton.

2423
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,080
Commentator Cho mentioned that...

2424
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,850
it all came down to concentration
and stamina.

2425
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,220
- Right.
- He was right.

2426
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,150
After Anton won consecutively,

2427
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:27,590
they're now at 8 to 2.

2428
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,460
(Intermediate Score)

2429
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,020
Yes, the players are here.

2430
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,830
SHOTARO of RIIZE

2431
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,730
JONGSEOB of P1Harmony.

2432
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,470
- RIIZE is ahead in points for now.
- Yes.

2433
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,730
JONGSEOB's calmness...

2434
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:44,840
might lead him to victory.

2435
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,910
- I see.
- All right.

2436
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,680
JONGSEOB, 9.7.

2437
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,210
SHOTARO, miss.

2438
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:53,350
- He missed.
- He missed.

2439
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:55,480
(Where's my bullet?)

2440
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,250
JONGSEOB won the first shot.

2441
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,720
Currently, the score is 8 to 4.

2442
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,090
(This is the second shot.)

2443
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:02,350
All right.
Let's catch up on those four points.

2444
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,220
Here comes the second shot.

2445
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,390
Let's go.

2446
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,030
(SHOTARO, stay calm.)

2447
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,860
RIIZE must maintain their lead.

2448
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:13,830
Just like you said earlier,
catching up is easier.

2449
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:15,000
- Right.
- That's right.

2450
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,900
Both mentally and psychologically,
catching up is easier.

2451
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:20,610
- JONGSEOB, 6.4.
- That's right.

2452
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:23,280
SHOTARO, 3.2.

2453
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,180
- Yes.
- Nice. He's narrowing the gap.

2454
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:26,450
He's narrowing the gap.

2455
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:28,680
JONGSEOB won both shots so far.

2456
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

2457
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:33,290
RIIZE has 8points,
and P1Harmony has 6 points.

2458
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,720
- It's 6 points.
- One more shot, and they'll be tied.

2459
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,120
That's right. They're two points behind.

2460
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:39,490
This point system...

2461
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,890
is so entertaining.

2462
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:43,500
JONGSEOB is on a roll.

2463
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

2464
01:37:44,530 --> 01:37:47,600
Maybe that's why SHOTARO seems so nervous.

2465
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,870
- Right.
- Right.

2466
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:51,240
The team that is being pursued
can't help but be nervous.

2467
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,110
- That's right.
- Definitely.

2468
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:56,710
- JONGSEOB, 7.9.
- With a solid stance,

2469
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:58,940
JONGSEOB just fired.

2470
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:02,550
SHOTARO, 8.5.

2471
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,050
(SHOTARO cut off JONGSEOB's chase.)

2472
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:07,950
- Yes.
- That makes the difference four points.

2473
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,590
They're now apart by four points.

2474
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:11,390
They're now 10 to 6.

2475
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:13,430
This feels like the true finals.

2476
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:14,490
- Yes.
- Right.

2477
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:16,030
It's not over yet.

2478
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,370
- Here comes the fourth shot.
- All right.

2479
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:24,040
JONGSEOB, seven.

2480
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,270
SHOTARO, miss.

2481
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:29,810
Goodness.

2482
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:31,640
They now have a two-point difference.

2483
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,010
The gap has narrowed again. Goodness.

2484
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:37,350
(I'm sorry.)

2485
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:40,250
- Hold your breath and pause.
- Just do one more. Don't stress.

2486
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:43,260
JONGSEOB, just do one more. Don't stress.

2487
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:45,120
Here comes the final shot.

2488
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:47,430
- Goodness.
- Let's see what happens.

2489
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:49,090
Here comes the final shot. Let's begin.

2490
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,960
(This final shot will decide
the fate of the two teams.)

2491
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,670
Will the lone assassin...

2492
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,270
complete his mission?

2493
01:38:57,070 --> 01:38:58,340
Will they be tied?

2494
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:01,740
(The last thing SHOTARO wants is a tie.)

2495
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,510
- Goodness.
- It doesn't look good.

2496
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,180
- This isn't good.
- What happened?

2497
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:10,120
- But it's not over yet.
- Right.

2498
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,580
He should have won.

2499
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,050
- It's not over yet.
- He has to make a tie.

2500
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:16,160
- He makes his shot.
- It's not looking good.

2501
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,390
Who made the bad call?

2502
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:20,790
JONGSEOB, miss.

2503
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:23,460
- He doesn't make it.
- SHOTARO, 3.1.

2504
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,930
Gosh, JONGSEOB missed.

2505
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:27,030
He just happened to miss.

2506
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,270
RIIZE has 12 points,

2507
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:31,570
P1Harmony has 8 points.
They're 4 points behind.

2508
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:34,610
They can still catch up.

2509
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,140
That's right. By two shots.

2510
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,810
Two shots are more than enough
to catch up.

2511
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:39,280
It's more than enough to catch up.

2512
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:43,280
WON BIN and INTAK are the final players.

2513
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,450
They are the ones who embody
composure for their teams.

2514
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,320
Who will be able to keep their composure?

2515
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:53,330
- Calm and steady.
- Raising their pistols.

2516
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:55,590
P1Harmony needs to win 3 shots.

2517
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,830
- Pull the trigger, nice and slow.
- He's ready.

2518
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:58,960
All right.

2519
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,430
INTAK, 6.7.

2520
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,740
WON BIN lowered his pistol.

2521
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,600
- Let's go!
- Calmly.

2522
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,540
Stay calm!

2523
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,910
All right. WON BIN, 5.8.

2524
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:16,880
P1Harmony's INTAK takes 2 points.

2525
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,350
- All right.
- He needs to win...

2526
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:21,420
- Yes.
- one more shot to tie the game.

2527
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,820
Here comes the second shot.

2528
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,520
Here comes the second shot.

2529
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,630
They must be feeling so much pressure.

2530
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:30,500
They have to remain calm
even under pressure.

2531
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,560
That's true.

2532
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:37,800
- Slowly.
- Yes.

2533
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,410
- WON BIN fired his shot.
- Nice.

2534
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,240
- I feel like it was a good shot.
- It was rather quick.

2535
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:43,840
- No, I guess it wasn't.
- I see.

2536
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:47,410
- It's hard to tell by his expression.
- INTAK fired as well.

2537
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:49,520
WON BIN, six.

2538
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:51,280
INTAK, nine.

2539
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,320
- This means...
- INTAK!

2540
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:55,490
They are now tied.

2541
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,690
(The left-handed shooter tied the game.)

2542
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:59,320
There are now three shots left, right?

2543
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,490
- Yes.
- WON BIN and INTAK.

2544
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:03,600
If INTAK wins again,
he'll be turning the game around.

2545
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,400
He'll be turning the game around.

2546
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,600
Here comes the third shot.

2547
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,040
INTAK is the hero taking the lead.

2548
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,670
- He did that earlier too.
- Right.

2549
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:16,040
- He did that earlier too.
- That's right.

2550
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,410
- Can he create another miracle?
- Right.

2551
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:21,050
That would make him the icon
of turning the tables.

2552
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,850
- Let's see.
- WON BIN fired his shot.

2553
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,990
- The two of them are exhausted,
- Yes.

2554
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:29,690
- both physically and mentally.
- Of course.

2555
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,360
- He's moving his pistol more.
- Yes.

2556
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,530
He fired his shot.

2557
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,530
- INTAK, 6.3.
- He scored a 6.

2558
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:42,370
WON BIN, 8.2.

2559
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:44,470
He's now two points further ahead.

2560
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:45,700
(WON BIN is pulling ahead.)

2561
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,910
Stay calm.

2562
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:49,610
- INTAK wasn't able to turn the tables.
- No.

2563
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,940
INTAK has to win
the remaining two shots...

2564
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:54,410
- for him to get ahead.
- That's right.

2565
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:57,220
WON BIN is busy pulling ahead,

2566
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,980
while INTAK is busy trying to catch up.

2567
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,850
- Right.
- Here comes the fourth shot.

2568
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:04,320
Can INTAK catch up?

2569
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:06,230
Or can WON BIN shake him off?

2570
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:09,460
Nice.

2571
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,000
(The shots were fired.)

2572
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:15,270
(And the result?)

2573
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:18,340
- INTAK, 3.
- WON BIN is in the 9-second range.

2574
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,610
WON BIN, 9.6.

2575
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:23,280
WON BIN pulled further ahead.
It's too bad for INTAK.

2576
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,350
That secured RIIZE's victory.

2577
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:27,780
- Yes.
- That's right.

2578
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,180
RIIZE's victory is secured.

2579
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:31,380
RIIZE wins.

2580
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:36,990
The results of
the men's pistol shooting finals.

2581
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,430
P1Harmony, 12 points.

2582
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,900
RIIZE, 18 points.

2583
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,430
RIIZE wins.

2584
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:46,000
(RIIZE wins the gold medal.)

2585
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,930
The men's pistol shooting finals.

2586
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:51,670
RIIZE takes the crown.

2587
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,070
- RIIZE.
- RIIZE.

2588
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:56,940
(The 1st place's signature song ceremony)

2589
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:22,070
To be honest, we were hoping to win.

2590
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:24,340
I'm so glad we actually won.

2591
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,570
Thanks, BRIIZE. We won first place!

2592
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,340
- Bang!
- Bang!

2593
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:33,350
(Penalty shoot-out)

2594
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:36,080
Hello. Welcome to 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships,

2595
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,720
Chuseok Special.

2596
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:41,050
We're now set for the penalty shoot-outs.

2597
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:43,720
Let me introduce today's special guest.

2598
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:46,530
We have Korea's top soccer commentator,

2599
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:48,490
Park Moon Sung here with us!

2600
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,460
Hello.

2601
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:53,970
- Penalty shoot-outs are nerve-racking.
- They are.

2602
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,670
Korean football heroes,
such as Cha Bum Kun...

2603
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:57,940
- Right.
- and Park Ji Sung...

2604
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:00,840
- Right.
- didn't do penalty kicks either...

2605
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:03,180
- because they were too nervous.
- Seriously.

2606
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:07,010
The distance from the goal
for penalty kicks is 11m.

2607
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:09,280
Because it's so nerve-racking,
they call penalty kicks...

2608
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,580
the "11m roulette."

2609
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,850
- Like a Russian roulette?
- Yes.

2610
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,660
That's right. In penalty shoot-outs,
a single shot determines the results.

2611
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:21,230
That's why they are so nerve-racking.

2612
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:24,660
More than the penalty shoot-out,
I'm excited to see...

2613
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,330
some legendary moments
of our players on camera.

2614
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:30,270
- Eun Ji is so full of love. I like it.
- Camera directors,

2615
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:32,270
please get lots of nice shots
of our players.

2616
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,710
- Right. On the teams playing today,
- Please.

2617
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:37,480
we have many players
who truly love soccer.

2618
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,080
We have players who used to play soccer.

2619
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:42,110
We have players who practiced hard
for this penalty shoot-out.

2620
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:44,850
I'm excited to see some great shots...

2621
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:48,190
and some great blocks.

2622
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:50,960
We'll take a look
at the tournament bracket...

2623
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,560
of the 2025 Idol Athletics Championships
Penalty Shoot-Out Quarterfinals...

2624
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:56,130
and introduce to you the lineup.

2625
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,600
(Penalty shoot-out bracket)

2626
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,200
I just can't take my eyes
off of the lineup.

2627
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,500
- We have a total of eight teams.
- Yes.

2628
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,870
Today, we have teams of three.

2629
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:09,270
- Teams of three.
- Yes.

2630
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:10,510
So two will be kickers,

2631
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:12,480
- and one will be the goalkeeper.
- Okay.

2632
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,610
The 2 kickers will take turns
to shoot 5 times.

2633
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,650
If both teams get five goals,
they are tied.

2634
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:21,650
Then, the goalkeepers
will take the sixth shot.

2635
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:23,220
(If the teams are tied,
the goalkeepers will shoot.)

2636
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,060
- This is fun.
- Oh, my goodness.

2637
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:28,590
- It's a lot of pressure for everyone.
- Right.

2638
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:31,930
The players who are kicking and blocking
must feel pressure,

2639
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:34,100
but for those of us who are watching,
it can't be more fun.

2640
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,370
- Seriously.
- It's super fun.

2641
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:40,570
We will now get started
with the shoot-out.

2642
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:42,840
- Here we go.
- Let's go. Play ball!

2643
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:47,680
We will begin the first game
of the penalty shoot-out quarterfinals.

2644
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:50,480
RIIZE versus CLOSE YOUR EYES.

2645
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:57,920
(The arena is already heating up
for the first game.)

2646
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:00,130
It has now begun.

2647
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:03,360
I'm so excited to see the first game
of the penalty shoot-out quarterfinals.

2648
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,500
It's a match
between RIIZE and CLOSE YOUR EYES.

2649
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,070
This is the first Idol Star
Athletics Championships for RIIZE.

2650
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:12,840
- Really?
- Even while busy with their concert,

2651
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:15,870
they made the time to go
to a futsal stadium to practice.

2652
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:19,310
That's how sincere
they are about this penalty shoot-out.

2653
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:22,680
I'm excited to see
their great shot and blocks...

2654
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,180
- in today's match.
- Yes.

2655
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:27,620
This is the first entry
for CLOSE YOUR EYES as well.

2656
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:30,920
They have members
who played futsal every week.

2657
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,260
- They're serious.
- Yes.

2658
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:34,430
Notably, SEO KYOUNGBAE...

2659
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,600
- has the most experience with sports.
- Right.

2660
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:37,760
Nine years of Taekwondo.

2661
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,560
- Seven years of volleyball.
- Yes.

2662
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,370
Four years of badminton.
Two years of swimming.

2663
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:42,430
He is very skilled.

2664
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:43,840
(An all-rounder idol athlete)

2665
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,770
Does this have anything
to do with soccer, though?

2666
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:47,440
(Well...)

2667
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:50,710
It can be helpful to have experience
playing sports.

2668
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:54,680
I saw that SUNGCHAN of RIIZE
used to be on a soccer team.

2669
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,680
(SUNGCHAN played soccer
when he was in middle school.)

2670
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,380
He played soccer throughout middle school.

2671
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:59,520
- He's getting ready to shoot now.
- Yes.

2672
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,890
His nickname is Lewandowski
of Nonhyeon-dong.

2673
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,360
Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong.

2674
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,190
This is already fun.

2675
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:08,230
(SUNGCHAN)

2676
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,130
The first kicker
will be SUNGCHAN of RIIZE.

2677
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:15,030
Judging by the way SUNGCHANG is standing,
he's right-footed.

2678
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:16,540
- Right-footed.
- Right.

2679
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:22,040
(How will the penalty shoot-out begin?)

2680
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,480
(Will he score?)

2681
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,280
(Will he block the ball?)

2682
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,580
- It's getting started.
- Here we go.

2683
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:29,510
Here goes Lewandowski of Nonhyeong-dong.

2684
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:31,420
- Yes, will SUNGCHAN...
- SUNGCHAN!

2685
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:33,790
- be able to score?
- Here we go.

2686
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:40,530
(RIIZE's SUNGCHAN,
Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong, scores.)

2687
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:42,830
Nice! That was so cool.

2688
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:44,960
- This...
- Even if KYOUNGBAE knew...

2689
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,530
where the ball was coming,
he couldn't have blocked it.

2690
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:49,800
Since he has experience playing soccer,

2691
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,600
he made great impact
with the inside of his foot.

2692
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:55,040
- That gave the ball speed.
- Speed.

2693
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:57,680
- Speed. It was really fast.
- Yes.

2694
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:00,450
Now, JEON MINWOOK will shoot.

2695
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,850
JEON MINWOOK only uses his left foot.

2696
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,720
From the Korean national team,
Lee Kang In is like that.

2697
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:06,890
- He's left-footed.
- Right.

2698
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,390
Lee Kang In
of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

2699
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:10,820
- The left-footed magician.
- Yes.

2700
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:15,030
EUNSEOK's nickname is Song Heung Min.

2701
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:18,600
- Song Heung Min. That's impressive.
- Song Eun Seok plus Son Heung Min.

2702
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:19,660
(Song Heung Min guarding the goal,
EUNSEOK of RIIZE)

2703
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:22,470
(A match between idol star Lee Kang In
and Song Heung Min)

2704
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:24,000
- They blew the whistle.
- Here he goes.

2705
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,540
MINWOOK.

2706
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:31,710
(JEON MINWOOK of CLOSE YOUR EYES
is Lee Kang In of Idol Championships.)

2707
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:32,910
What did you think?

2708
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:34,950
- They're all good kickers.
- Yes.

2709
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:36,820
(They both got one goal.)

2710
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:40,250
- Up next is SOHEE of RIIZE.
- That's right.

2711
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,850
I'm curious about his nickname.
What is his nickname?

2712
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,050
He's Neheemar.

2713
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,860
- That won't work.
- Neheemar.

2714
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:46,790
It's SOHEE plus Neymar.

2715
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:48,490
- Neheemar.
- Neheemar.

2716
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:51,600
- Yes, Neheemar.
- Let's see his awesome kick.

2717
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,600
(How is Neheemar's shot?)

2718
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:02,040
(SEO KYOUNGBAE of CLOSE YOUR EYES
blocks the shot.)

2719
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,170
He blocked the shot.

2720
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:04,340
Neheemar!

2721
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,410
- Neheemar!
- Neheemar.

2722
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:06,710
- Neheemar couldn't score.
- Today,

2723
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:10,250
Neheemar got his penalty kick blocked.

2724
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,250
(Neheemar missed.)

2725
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:14,550
JANG YEOJUN.

2726
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:17,460
- He's Neymar of Sintanjin.
- Neymar is so popular.

2727
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,960
If Neymar of Sintanjin scores,

2728
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,890
we'll give the Neymar nickname...

2729
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:22,260
- to JANG YEOJUN.
- Right, we'll give it to him.

2730
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:23,760
- That's only fair.
- It is. Yes.

2731
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:29,970
He blocked it.

2732
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,040
(Song Heung Min blocked it!)

2733
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,670
- He blocked it.
- What's wrong with our Neymars?

2734
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:38,710
Is this Neymar's curse? What's going on?

2735
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,880
You either have to kick low to the ground
or way up high.

2736
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:43,980
That middle spot that the goalkeeper
can easily reach...

2737
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:46,480
- is the most dangerous.
- Exactly.

2738
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:56,560
- SUNGCHAN is back.
- SUNGCHAN's shot was nice.

2739
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,500
Which way will he kick this time?

2740
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,170
Nice. That was sharp. Nice speed.

2741
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:07,310
- Oh, my!
- How could this be?

2742
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:09,240
- It didn't go in.
- Wait.

2743
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:10,880
- How could this be? Now...
- Wait.

2744
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,440
He made a mistake
because he tried to kick too hard.

2745
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,310
- He overdid himself.
- Yes.

2746
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:15,780
- He went too hard.
- That's right.

2747
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,850
Okay.

2748
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,650
Okay, JEON MINWOOK.

2749
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:22,550
(Will Idol Star Lee Kang In
grab this chance?)

2750
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:23,960
Here goes JEON MINWOOK.

2751
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:28,690
Here goes JEON MINWOOK.

2752
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:31,700
Here goes JEON MINWOOK.

2753
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,930
(He scored.)

2754
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:34,030
Nice.

2755
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:37,500
He kept his nickname,
Left-Footed Magician.

2756
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:41,270
I think MINWOOK confused EUNSEOK
with his rhythm.

2757
01:50:41,370 --> 01:50:42,610
- That's exactly right.
- Right.

2758
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:44,780
Also, just kicking like that
makes it hard to block.

2759
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:47,180
You just have to shoot
in a certain direction.

2760
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:49,580
Making the ball go too high
from trying to kick too hard...

2761
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:51,250
or kicking the ball into the middle.

2762
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:52,880
- You just have to avoid these things.
- Yes.

2763
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,550
That was great. Neheemar.

2764
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,420
- SOHEE didn't score last time.
- Right.

2765
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:58,960
If he doesn't score again this time,
I'll just call him Nehee.

2766
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,630
- Nice.
- Neheemar.

2767
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:03,360
- How will Neheemar do?
- Neheemar.

2768
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,700
- Neheemar.
- Neheemar.

2769
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:09,570
- Neheemar.
- Neheemar.

2770
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,140
- Nice, it went in.
- Nice!

2771
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,970
- He kept his nickname, Neheemar.
- Nice.

2772
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:17,480
It went in. Neheemar.

2773
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,580
What a relief.

2774
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,850
- If SOHEE missed here,
- Yes.

2775
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,920
it would've put RIIZE
at a great disadvantage.

2776
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,920
- That's right. Yes.
- Yes.

2777
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,690
JANG YEOJUN is preparing to kick.

2778
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:36,690
- JANG YEOJUN, Neymar of Sintanjin.
- Yes.

2779
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:39,360
If he scores here,
I'll let him keep his nickname.

2780
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,500
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

2781
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:44,540
(His nickname, Neymar of Sintanjin,
flew far away.)

2782
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:47,410
- JANG YEOJUN!
- Oh, this is...

2783
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,410
(His nickname, Neymar of Sintanjin,
flew far away.)

2784
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,710
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2785
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,450
- This is the fifth kick.
- Yes.

2786
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:56,920
They're tied with 2 goals each,
and this is the 5th kick.

2787
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,120
If one goes in and the other doesn't,
it's over.

2788
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:59,880
(Nervous)

2789
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:03,190
- SUNGCHAN has great speed.
- Will he go from Lewan...

2790
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:05,790
of Nonhyeon-dong back to Lewandowski?

2791
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:07,090
- That's right.
- Okay.

2792
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:09,130
- Here he goes.
- Yes.

2793
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:11,160
Oh, my!

2794
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:14,430
(RIIZE's SUNGCHAN scores
with a strong kick.)

2795
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:15,830
- This is...
- This is new!

2796
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:19,040
- Oh, my.
<i>- Power</i>

2797
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,840
<i>- I got the power</i>
<i>- Power </i>

2798
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:22,310
(This is fun.)

2799
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:25,280
- Nice.
- Because SUNGCHAN used to play soccer,

2800
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:27,280
his ball is so fast,
as long as he hits it right.

2801
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,950
It went a bit to the middle,
but that was a great shot.

2802
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,480
- That's high praise.
- I saw it.

2803
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,920
It hit the goalkeeper's hand,

2804
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,490
- but it still went in.
- Exactly.

2805
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:37,590
- Yes.
- Yes, he gets his nickname back.

2806
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:39,160
Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong.

2807
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,590
- Right.
- Okay. Nice.

2808
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:42,430
I agree
he is Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong.

2809
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:44,560
If JEON MINWOOK misses here, it's over.

2810
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,560
If he scores,
the goalkeepers need to kick.

2811
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

2812
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:50,100
Here he goes.

2813
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:52,240
- I'm nervous.
- The Left-Footed Magician.

2814
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:55,510
- He needs to score.
- He's waiting a bit...

2815
01:52:56,610 --> 01:52:58,010
He blocked it.

2816
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:59,840
He's waiting a bit...

2817
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:02,850
(Song Heung Min blocked it.)

2818
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:04,050
He blocked it!

2819
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,380
No!

2820
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:07,850
We have a victor.

2821
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,120
With this result,

2822
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:13,290
- RIIZE goes to the semifinals.
- They go to the semifinals.

2823
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:16,090
- They must be so disappointed.
- But they were still so cool.

2824
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:18,430
- They fought so well.
- Yes.

2825
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:21,970
We will begin the second game
of the Penalty Shoot-Out Quarterfinals.

2826
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:23,670
EVNNE versus NOWZ.

2827
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,270
- It's EVNNE versus NOWZ.
- EVNNE versus NOWZ.

2828
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:34,680
The goalkeeper, Jinhyuk,
has the nickname Zlatan Style.

2829
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,750
(The goalkeeper, NOWZ's Jinhyuk,
has the nickname Zlatan Style.)

2830
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,420
Zlatan came up.

2831
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:38,720
Jinhyuk.

2832
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:42,920
LEE JEONGHYEON's nickname
is Galma-dong's Maestro Lionel Leejeong.

2833
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,220
- It's long.
- It's majestic.

2834
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:45,320
Hold on.

2835
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:46,360
What was the nickname again?

2836
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:48,860
It's Galma-dong's Maestro Lionel Leejeong.

2837
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:51,030
That's a good nickname.

2838
01:53:56,230 --> 01:53:57,300
- Nice.
- Yes.

2839
01:53:58,170 --> 01:54:00,710
- He blocked it.
- He blocked it.

2840
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:02,310
(Galma-dong's Maestro Lionel Leejeong's
first shot was blocked.)

2841
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:04,580
- Oh, that...
- Oh, my.

2842
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:08,810
(Let's go NOWZ!)

2843
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,550
Next up is Yeonwoo.

2844
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:12,020
He's called Shadow Striker.

2845
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,420
(NOWZ's Shadow Striker, Yeonwoo)

2846
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,650
- Shadow Striker?
- Yes.

2847
01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:17,460
It means he's so fast
that you can't even see him,

2848
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:20,020
- like a shadow.
- It's a bit cringey.

2849
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:23,830
He must've made that nickname
in elementary school.

2850
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,700
Shadow Striker shoots.

2851
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:28,800
- It went in.
- It went in.

2852
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,000
- That was close.
- It..

2853
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,470
- It went in.
- went in.

2854
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:33,500
It hit the goalkeeper and went in.

2855
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,170
Okay, KEITA.

2856
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:38,140
His nickname is
"I Only Kick to the Right."

2857
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,780
His nickname is
"I Only Kick to the Right?"

2858
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:43,980
(Left, Right)

2859
01:54:45,450 --> 01:54:48,090
(The ball went to the middle.)

2860
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:50,190
- I think it was supposed to be a trick.
- Yes.

2861
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,390
He said he only kicked to the right,

2862
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:54,230
- but he intentionally changed directions.
- Yes.

2863
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:55,390
But the goalkeeper wasn't fooled.

2864
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:56,830
He wasn't.

2865
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,800
Do you know
what NOWZ's Yoon's nickname is?

2866
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,930
- What is it? That's it.
- Kylian Yoonbappe.

2867
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,070
That's amazing.

2868
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:06,200
- Not Mbappe but Yoonbappe.
- Mbappe.

2869
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,310
Kylian.

2870
01:55:07,410 --> 01:55:09,670
If it doesn't score this time,
he'll be called Kylian Yoon.

2871
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:11,280
- Oh, no!
- He missed!

2872
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,040
What's going on?

2873
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,950
We'll call him Kylian Yoon from now on.

2874
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:18,280
(I'm sorry.)

2875
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:22,550
It's Galma-dong's Maestro Lionel Leejeong.
Let's go!

2876
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:24,020
Oh, nice!

2877
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,890
- That was a nice shot.
- Yes.

2878
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,130
- Galma-dong's Maestro...
- Yes.

2879
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:29,430
- Lionel Leejeong.
- Yes.

2880
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,830
Our Shadow Striker.

2881
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:32,960
- Yeonwoo.
- Yes.

2882
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:39,670
That was nice.

2883
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:41,570
Right now, EVNNE has one point,

2884
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:42,770
and NOWZ has two points.

2885
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:43,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

2886
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:47,110
Since EVNNE, who went first, is behind,

2887
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:49,150
this fourth kicker is very important.

2888
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:51,920
Commentator Park says
the fourth kicker is important.

2889
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,180
- I Only Kick to the Right.
- Here he goes.

2890
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,020
Kicking to the right would be...

2891
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:56,950
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

2892
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,090
It...

2893
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:00,830
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

2894
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:01,890
It went in.

2895
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:03,160
He should've blocked this.

2896
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:05,160
- He should've blocked this.
- Thank you...

2897
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,200
for the air kick.

2898
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,700
That was a disappointing block
from the goalkeeper.

2899
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:09,270
I think he thought it would be easy...

2900
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,370
- to block a low shot.
- Yes,

2901
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:12,040
the fourth kicker is very important.

2902
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,140
It's 2 to 2 right now.

2903
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:15,010
- Yoonbappe.
- The previous shot was so disappointing.

2904
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:16,170
Kylian Yoonbappe!

2905
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:18,440
- That was nice.
- Good job.

2906
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:20,140
- That was very stable.
- That was a nice shot.

2907
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:23,180
- Now, it's 3 to 2.
- Yes.

2908
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:25,680
It's 3 to 2, and this is the last kicker.

2909
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,750
- Yes.
- If he misses this one, it's over.

2910
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,950
(If EVNNE's LEE JEONGHYEON misses,
they lose.)

2911
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:30,520
- If he misses, it's over.
- He needs to score.

2912
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:31,790
(How will Galma-dong's Maestro
Lionel Leejeong's shoot go?)

2913
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:33,830
Galma-dong's Maestro Lionel Leejeong.

2914
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:38,000
He blocked it.

2915
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,130
NOWZ moves on.

2916
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:41,300
It's 3 to 2.

2917
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,400
Seeing things like that
hurts my heart so much.

2918
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:45,300
Can I be the coach? Can I go down there?

2919
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:47,510
Can I get in there?

2920
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:48,940
(They're getting emotionally invested
in the penalty shoot-outs.)

2921
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:51,310
Penalty Shoot-out Quarterfinals,
EVNNE versus NOWZ.

2922
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:54,480
NOWZ wins and moves on to the next round.

2923
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:58,350
We will now begin the third game
of the Penalty Shoot-out Quarterfinals.

2924
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:00,250
AHOF versus LUCY.

2925
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:03,450
- AHOF versus LUCY.
- Yes.

2926
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:04,720
AHOF versus LUCY.

2927
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:08,330
AHOF debuted on July 1 of this year.

2928
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:10,260
- To give you a short introduction,
- Yes.

2929
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:14,930
I was one of the producers of AHOF.

2930
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:17,400
They are like my sons.

2931
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,040
- Oh, our sons.
- They're my sons.

2932
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,040
This match is interesting...

2933
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:25,440
because they have played soccer
in the military.

2934
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:26,980
- That's right.
- Yes.

2935
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:29,010
At the goal,

2936
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:31,050
we have CHOI SANG YEOP.

2937
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:32,620
His nickname is Crazy for Soccer.

2938
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:35,290
(Crazy for Soccer)

2939
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:37,090
Jeong Woo's nickname...

2940
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,720
is Alien Potato Shoot Dori.

2941
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,260
(Kicker Jeong Woo of AHOF
has the nickname Alien Potato Shoot Dori.)

2942
01:57:41,330 --> 01:57:42,490
- Jeong Woo.
- Will it go in?

2943
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:44,130
He blocked it.

2944
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:46,500
- SANG YEOP jumped for the ball.
- Yes.

2945
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:47,930
Even nowadays,

2946
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:49,400
he plays futsal once or twice every week.

2947
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,770
This is true.

2948
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:55,770
(LUCY's CHOI SANG YEOP, Crazy for Soccer,
blocks the shot with a big jump.)

2949
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:58,880
- SHIN YE CHAN!
- SHIN YE CHAN!

2950
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:01,950
(LUCY's SHIN YE CHAN
is getting ready to kick.)

2951
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,680
Block it!

2952
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:13,390
(A powerful shot)

2953
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:14,860
That was incredible.

2954
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:19,900
- He's such a great kicker.
- He kicked it right to the top.

2955
01:58:21,070 --> 01:58:22,530
His nickname is Deity Ye Chan.

2956
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,070
- Because...
- Right.

2957
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:25,070
he's up there.

2958
01:58:25,070 --> 01:58:27,470
- Like how they call Lionel Messi.
- Yes, a deity.

2959
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:28,610
Deity Messi.

2960
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,540
Next kicker up is Park Han.

2961
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:33,740
AHOF's Ultra Fire Shot, Park Han.

2962
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,210
(AHOF's Ultra Fire Shot, Park Han)

2963
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:36,380
Fire Shot, Park Han.

2964
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:37,980
It's like from an animation.

2965
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:39,720
Ultra Fire Shot, Park Han!

2966
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:43,520
Ultra Fire Shot, Park Han!

2967
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:44,990
Oh, you shouldn't shoot like that.

2968
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:46,860
It wasn't a fire shot.

2969
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,090
(Sadly, his shot didn't become fire.)

2970
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:49,660
That wasn't a good shot.

2971
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:51,960
LUCY and AHOF's match.

2972
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,930
CHO WON SANG.
His nickname is Triangle Feet.

2973
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:57,130
- That means he's a bad kicker.
- That means he's a bad kicker.

2974
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,170
(Triangle Feet means a bad kicker.)

2975
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:02,470
That's right.

2976
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:04,610
- Oh, my!
- He blocked it.

2977
01:59:04,610 --> 01:59:06,440
- Did he block it with his knee?
- He blocked it.

2978
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:07,650
- He blocked it.
- He blocked it with his knee.

2979
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:09,710
Joo Won saved the team.

2980
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:10,980
- Yes.
- He did.

2981
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,950
If he didn't block this,

2982
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:14,290
- and the score became 2 to 0,
- Yes.

2983
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:16,150
- that would've been a bad start.
- Right.

2984
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,560
- They're still at 1 to 0.
- Right.

2985
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,390
This is AHOF's third kicker,

2986
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:22,230
- and no one has scored yet.
- Right.

2987
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:24,930
If he doesn't score here,
instead of Alien Potato Shoot Dori,

2988
01:59:24,930 --> 01:59:26,560
- I'll call him just Alien Potato.
- Right.

2989
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,430
- Oh, my. He needs to be Shoot Dori.
- I...

2990
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:29,930
I didn't know that these kids...

2991
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:31,600
I worked so hard with
were such bad kickers.

2992
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,740
(AHOF's dad Chang Sub is welling up.)

2993
01:59:36,110 --> 01:59:37,880
- Oh, goodness.
- Oh, my.

2994
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:40,110
He jumped for the ball again.

2995
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:41,680
- Our goalkeeper, CHOI SANG YEOP.
- Jeong Woo...

2996
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,980
From now on, Jeong Woo...

2997
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:45,080
- is just Alien Potato.
- Right.

2998
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,120
CHOI SANG YEOP is a talented goalkeeper.

2999
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:48,920
He always jumps for the ball.

3000
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,920
- He blocks the ball so well.
- Yes.

3001
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:54,060
SHIN YE CHAN is preparing to kick again.

3002
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,330
They blew the whistle.

3003
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:58,760
So strong!

3004
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,460
- He's so cool.
- SHIN YE CHAN.

3005
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:02,570
He's the best so far.

3006
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:04,600
- He shot the ball to the top earlier.
- Yes.

3007
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,240
This time, he shot the ball
to the left corner.

3008
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:08,040
Did you just hear that?

3009
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:09,470
The goalkeeper said,

3010
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:10,540
"It's too fast."

3011
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:13,180
(It's too fast...)

3012
02:00:13,310 --> 02:00:15,580
- It's 2 to 0.
- If he doesn't score here, it's over.

3013
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:16,810
Because no one has scored so far.

3014
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:18,720
- Yes.
- Park Han needs to score.

3015
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,780
- He needs to score.
- If he blocks this one...

3016
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:22,090
AHOF's Ultra Fire Shot, Park Han.

3017
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,450
- Okay.
- Nice.

3018
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:25,360
- Don't bother him.
- This is nerve-racking.

3019
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:26,720
- Okay.
- Here he goes.

3020
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,130
- Okay.
- Ultra Fire Shot, Park Han!

3021
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:31,460
(His Ultra Fire Shot went in!)

3022
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:32,530
It went in.

3023
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:34,530
The fire was kept alive.

3024
02:00:35,070 --> 02:00:36,430
It went in.

3025
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:39,070
- He made it 2 to 1, but the problem is,
- Yes.

3026
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:43,070
- if LUCY's CHO WON SANG scores here,
- Yes.

3027
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:44,140
it's over.

3028
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:46,210
He needs to block it.

3029
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:48,480
Will CHO WON SANG score or not?

3030
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,820
Will Park Joo Won block this shot?

3031
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:54,090
Park Joo Won has Super Ultra Spider Hands.

3032
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:55,890
CHO WON SANG needs to score,

3033
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:58,290
and Park Joo Won needs to block this.

3034
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:05,430
It went in!

3035
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:06,800
(With his Triangle Feet shot,
LUCY goes to the semifinals.)

3036
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,400
LUCY moves on to the semifinals.

3037
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,170
LUCY moves on to the next round.

3038
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,470
(AHOF, Sad)

3039
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:16,810
(Penalty shoot-out bracket)

3040
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:21,010
We will now begin the fourth game
of the Penalty Shoot-Out Quarterfinals.

3041
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:24,420
ZEROBASEONE versus NCT WISH.

3042
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:28,450
Yes, first of all,

3043
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:30,590
- SAKUYA is the goalkeeper.
- SAKUYA. Yes.

3044
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:31,790
Golden Left Foot.

3045
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:34,530
It says he played soccer
for nine years when he was young.

3046
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:39,060
The first kicker of this match
is ZEROBASEONE's Seok Matthew,

3047
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:41,530
and the second kicker is NCT WISH's YUSHI.

3048
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,510
- Okay, Seok Matthew shoots.
- Go!

3049
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:49,470
(The ball went way over the goal.)

3050
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:51,040
- It's a home run.
- Come on.

3051
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,080
(The ball went way over the goal.)

3052
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:54,410
His nickname was...

3053
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:55,610
Straight Ahead.

3054
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:58,750
Like his nickname,
his ball went straight over the goalpost.

3055
02:02:01,990 --> 02:02:03,390
Goalkeeper Kim Gyu Vin.

3056
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:04,790
His nickname is Gyusquets.

3057
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:07,090
Gyusquets. Why is that so funny?

3058
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:08,660
"Gyusquets?"

3059
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,730
YUSHI will shoot next.

3060
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,570
- Yes.
- YUSHI Ball.

3061
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:16,200
(NCT WISH's YUSHI's nickname
is YUSHI Ball!)

3062
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,500
- Is that his nickname?
- Yes, it's YUSHI Ball.

3063
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:19,870
- Oh, YUSHI Ball.
- When you play soccer,

3064
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:21,910
- you say, "Ball!" a lot.
- Right.

3065
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:24,740
YUSHI Ball! Like this?

3066
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:26,710
- Will Gyusquets block the ball?
- That makes sense.

3067
02:02:26,910 --> 02:02:28,750
(The ball went over the goal again.)

3068
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,210
- What's going on?
- They're the same.

3069
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:31,720
- They're the same.
- Over the goal.

3070
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,420
- What's going on with everyone?
- What's going on?

3071
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:36,790
They both kicked up to the sky.

3072
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:38,360
(This is so funny.)

3073
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:39,590
(Please control your power.)

3074
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:41,560
They all failed to score.

3075
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:45,260
- I think everyone is very nervous.
- Yes.

3076
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:48,130
Ricky will shoot next.

3077
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:50,300
His nickname is so straightforward.

3078
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:52,040
- His nickname is Ronaldo.
- Just Ronaldo.

3079
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:53,970
- My name is...
- Will he score...

3080
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:55,410
- and go, "Siu!"
- Oh, this thing. "Siu!"

3081
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:56,770
(Siu)

3082
02:02:56,770 --> 02:02:58,710
- I look forward to his Ronaldo ceremony.
- Let's go, Ricky.

3083
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:00,480
- Let's go, Ricky!
- Here he goes.

3084
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:03,280
- Oh, my
- It went in.

3085
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,120
(The ball shot sharply into the corner.)

3086
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,750
(Standing up)

3087
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:11,220
- Siu!
- Siu!

3088
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,090
I wish he did it.

3089
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:14,160
He should've done it!

3090
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:15,530
He should've gone, "Siu!"

3091
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:17,060
- Siu!
- He should've after he scored.

3092
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:18,400
That's too bad.

3093
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,530
Next up is JAEHEE.
Do you know what his nickname is?

3094
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:22,030
- What is it?
- It's Jaerard.

3095
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:23,770
- Instead of Gerard,
- Jaerard.

3096
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:25,540
it's Jaerard. The spelling is different.

3097
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:26,970
Everyone has a nickname.

3098
02:03:26,970 --> 02:03:28,440
That's what's fun.

3099
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:29,740
Their nicknames are all world-class.

3100
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:32,510
It's a competition
to make the funniest nickname.

3101
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:35,610
It says he was a defensive midfielder
in his middle school soccer team,

3102
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:37,620
so he must have a great kick.

3103
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:39,280
Nice. Here he goes, Jaerard.

3104
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,420
(NCT WISH's JAEHEE's shot
went quickly into the goal.)

3105
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:42,490
- Oh, my.
- JAEHEE!

3106
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:43,490
That was a nice shot.

3107
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:44,560
(NCT WISH's JAEHEE's shot
went quickly into the goal.)

3108
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,960
- I could hear it from here.
- JAEHEE.

3109
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,530
- He didn't disappoint.
- It was powerful.

3110
02:03:48,530 --> 02:03:49,930
- So,
- It's a tie.

3111
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:51,930
if you've played professionally
until middle school,

3112
02:03:51,930 --> 02:03:53,260
- you're on a different level.
- I see.

3113
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:55,030
- JAEHEE is incredible.
- Definitely.

3114
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:56,800
- It's 1 to 1. It's very neck-and-neck.
- Yes, it is.

3115
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,600
It's 1 to 1.

3116
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,370
Seok Matthew. Straight Ahead.

3117
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:02,840
Straight Ahead again.

3118
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,240
He sent the ball to the sky earlier.

3119
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,340
This time,

3120
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,310
- which way will he go straight?
- There's no explanation.

3121
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:08,980
- Straight Ahead is so funny.
- Straight Ahead.

3122
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:11,420
- Matthew, good luck.
- Which way will he go straight?

3123
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,190
Left or right? Up or down?
That's the important question.

3124
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:16,490
(Good luck!)

3125
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:21,790
Which way will he go straight?

3126
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:23,830
(The ball went straight to the goal!)

3127
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:24,860
It was a nice shot.

3128
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,660
- It was a nice shot.
- It was a very nice shot.

3129
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,870
- It was a proper shot.
- It's 2 to 1.

3130
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:30,200
- Focus.
- He needs to score.

3131
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,340
He needs to score a goal for a tie.

3132
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:33,240
- Score a goal for a tie.
- YUSHI, score a goal.

3133
02:04:33,570 --> 02:04:34,740
Okay, that's good.

3134
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:36,840
- It's a tie.
- Well done.

3135
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:38,880
It's 2 to 2.
This match is the most neck-and-neck.

3136
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,240
- Ronaldo.
- Ronaldo.

3137
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,650
This time, go, "Siu!"

3138
02:04:41,650 --> 02:04:43,410
- Ronaldo.
- It won't count otherwise.

3139
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:44,720
Do the Ronaldo ceremony.

3140
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,180
- This time, go, "Siu!"
- We'll look forward to it.

3141
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:49,450
Good.
Will Ronaldo be able to score a goal?

3142
02:04:49,450 --> 02:04:50,690
- All right. There he goes.
- Score a goal.

3143
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:52,820
- All right.
- It's a goal!

3144
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,130
All right.

3145
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:56,490
(It's a goal!)

3146
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:58,830
- "Siu!"
- "Siu!"

3147
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:00,000
"Siu!"

3148
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:01,470
He isn't doing it.

3149
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,400
- I guess he doesn't want to.
- It says here...

3150
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:04,900
- that he can do the ceremony.
- Exactly.

3151
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:06,140
He didn't do the ceremony.

3152
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:08,370
- It says so right here.
- Why isn't he doing it?

3153
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:10,040
I want to go down there.

3154
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:11,410
Go down there and talk to him.

3155
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:12,640
What? Can I really do that?

3156
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:14,950
- Can I...
- Now comes Jaerard.

3157
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,250
He needs to score to have a tie of 3 to 3.

3158
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:19,350
Jaerard.

3159
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:22,250
(The strong shot couldn't be stopped.)

3160
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:23,250
It was fast.

3161
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:25,760
- It was so nice.
- It was so nice.

3162
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:28,260
I have no comments
because the shot was so clean.

3163
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:29,760
It's the fifth one. The last one.

3164
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,430
If the fifth one
doesn't determine the result,

3165
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:34,730
- Okay.
- goalkeepers need to come out.

3166
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:37,470
- It's Straight Ahead's turn.
- It's Straight Ahead's turn.

3167
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,870
Which way will he go straight?
I can't wait to find out.

3168
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:40,910
Straight Ahead.

3169
02:05:41,210 --> 02:05:42,310
I can't tell.

3170
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:43,810
- This is nerve-racking.
- There goes Straight Ahead.

3171
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:45,040
Don't send the ball up.

3172
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:47,880
Okay.

3173
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:49,780
(The goalkeeper couldn't even touch
the powerful shot.)

3174
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:51,950
- It was a nice shot.
- He's really good.

3175
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:53,680
The goal he scored just now
was really cool.

3176
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:55,590
- He sent it to the top.
- Yes.

3177
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:58,290
That's the goal Hong Myung Bo scored
in the 2002 soccer competition.

3178
02:05:58,290 --> 02:05:59,490
- He sent it to the top.
- Yes.

3179
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:01,430
It was great.

3180
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:03,430
- I can't stay seated.
- I can't stay seated either.

3181
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:05,600
Still, we need to sit down.

3182
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,530
- We're commentators.
- You're right.

3183
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:08,770
Let's stand up when someone scores a goal.

3184
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,600
The last player of NCT WISH,

3185
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:13,670
YUSHI needs to score a goal.

3186
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:15,070
- He needs to score a goal.
- Otherwise, the match will end.

3187
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:16,140
- If he scores,
- If he fails...

3188
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,210
the goalkeepers will come out.

3189
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:18,310
He needs to score a goal.

3190
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:19,740
There he goes.

3191
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:21,180
- Let's go.
- YUSHI Ball.

3192
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:27,350
(What will be the result?)

3193
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:28,820
- Let's go.
- YUSHI Ball.

3194
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:30,690
Okay! He scored a goal!

3195
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:32,160
- The goalkeepers will come out.
- YUSHI Ball.

3196
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:35,430
- It's 4 to 4.
- The goalkeepers will come out.

3197
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:36,560
It's a match between the goalkeepers.

3198
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,060
It's a match between the goalkeepers.
This is something else.

3199
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:41,530
Good luck!

3200
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,510
(Shocking)

3201
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:49,610
Oh, no!

3202
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:51,080
(If SAKUYA scores a goal, NCT WISH
will advance to the semifinals.)

3203
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:52,440
It went up in the air.

3204
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,440
(What are they going to do?)

3205
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,550
(What are they going to do?)

3206
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:55,750
The impact was quite nice.

3207
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:57,010
- Yes, the impact was nice.
- Yes.

3208
02:06:57,010 --> 02:06:58,550
They need to block the ball.

3209
02:06:58,550 --> 02:07:00,420
- It's SAKUYA's turn.
- Golden Left Foot.

3210
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,790
Does he have potential as a striker?

3211
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:04,890
Does he only have potential
as a goalkeeper?

3212
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:06,960
- Yes.
- Let's find out.

3213
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:08,890
Golden Left Foot.

3214
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:10,660
It's the right foot!

3215
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,660
Golden Left Foot.

3216
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:15,600
(Did he shoot the ball
with his right foot?)

3217
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:17,870
Did he do it on purpose?

3218
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:20,100
It's the right foot!

3219
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:22,440
(It's a goal.)

3220
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:25,310
Did he do it on purpose?
It was very impressive.

3221
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:29,150
Thus, NCT WISH won.

3222
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:31,120
- They advanced.
- It's too bad.

3223
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:33,580
The quarterfinals are over,

3224
02:07:33,580 --> 02:07:35,320
so the semifinals will begin.

3225
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:36,390
(What will be the result
of the much-anticipated semifinals?)

3226
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:38,990
(The semifinals
of the penalty shoot-out follow.)

3227
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,790
(The team that has SUNGCHAN,
a former professional)

3228
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:44,060
(RIIZE is a strong team.)

3229
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:46,530
(NCT WISH is serious about soccer.)

3230
02:07:47,230 --> 02:07:48,730
(He's really good at shooting the ball.)

3231
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:50,530
(Will the final round be...)

3232
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:52,600
(a match between the SM groups?)

3233
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:55,110
(But LUCY refuses to back down.)

3234
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:59,710
(Which team will hold up the trophy?)

3235
02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:05,520
(All the strong idols have gathered
for the men's ssireum.)

3236
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:08,820
(Who will be the ssireum champion
among idols?)

3237
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:13,590
(Women's pistol shooting shows
an array of sharpshooters.)

3238
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,990
(Who will be the first shooting queen
of Idol Star Athletics Championships?)

3239
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:18,200
(2025 Idol Star Athletics Championships,
Episode 2 will air tomorrow.)
