1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello, this is the 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,010
We're broadcasting the penalty shoot-out.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,480
We'll now begin the first match
of the penalty shoot-out semifinals.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,620
Which team will seize
the ticket to the final match?

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,090
The first kicker is SUNGCHAN of RIIZE.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,360
The second kicker is Yeonwoo of RIIZE.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,760
Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
(High expectations for SUNGCHAN,
Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong)

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,830
Here he goes.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,470
- SUNGCHAN.
- SUNGCHAN.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,730
Lewandowski.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,840
He blocked it.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,900
He blocked it.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,740
He blocked it like this.

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,240
With a little concentration,
he could block it right away.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,510
He blocked it.

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,810
- SUNGCHAN's shot got blocked.
- It must be Jinhyuk's specialty.

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,150
He blocks with one foot.

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,250
This time, Yeonwoo will shoot the ball.

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,690
He's Shadow Striker.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,020
- Shadow Striker.
- Yes.

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,330
- Is he a striker in hiding?
- Shadow Striker.

23
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, no.

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,800
- Oh, no.
- That's too bad.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Both teams missed a shot.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,470
- That's too bad.
- Why did he kick to the center?

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,270
We don't know what will happen.

28
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,240
- It's hard to score a goal.
- The next shooter is SOHEE.

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,180
He's Neheemar.

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,950
In a relaxed way, he shoots the ball.

31
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,450
He shoots the ball.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,250
(It's a goal.)

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,290
It went in.

34
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,020
- It went past the goalkeeper.
- It was fast.

35
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,790
- It was fast.
- It was a nice shot.

36
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,930
- It's too bad.
- He threw his body for the ball.

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,700
Now comes Kylian Yoonbappe.

38
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,660
(Kylian Yoonbappe provokes
Song Heung Min in a romantic way!)

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,400
- The nicknames...
- He's number ten...

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,730
- of Real Madrid CF.
- Yes.

41
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,140
Kylian Yoonbappe.

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,140
He must be nervous.

43
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,310
How will Kylian Yoonbappe shoot the ball?

44
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,210
(He succeeds in scoring.)

45
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,610
It was short.

46
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,210
- He did it easily.
- It's a goal.

47
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,050
- It was very nice.
- Yes.

48
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,520
- All right. It's 1 to 1.
- It's 1 to 1.

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,820
It's 1 to 1. It's a tie.

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,490
He just needs to kick to a corner.

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,360
Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong,
don't send it beyond the goal.

52
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,330
(The powerful shot
of Lewandowski of Nonhyeon-dong)

53
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,530
- It went in.
- It was neat.

54
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,430
He controlled his power this time.

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
- He did very well.
- He controlled his power.

56
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,430
Seriously, it was...

57
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,770
a powerful shot.

58
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,670
It was very powerful.

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,010
Up next is Yeonwoo.

60
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,480
- Yes.
- Shadow Striker.

61
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
- There he goes.
- Shadow Striker is warming up.

62
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,010
- Yes. He approaches like a shadow...
- The referee blew the whistle.

63
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,010
and shoots.

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,950
- It got blocked.
- It got blocked.

65
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,290
- It's too bad.
- EUNSEOK.

66
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,350
- It was EUNSEOK's save.
- It got blocked.

67
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,060
I can't believe he blocked it.

68
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,520
He's Song Heung Min.

69
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,860
NOWZ members' faces fell.

70
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,560
Song Heung Min blocked it.

71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,300
- Again,
- It's too bad.

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,870
- Neheemar is the shooter.
- Yes.

73
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,000
- SOHEE.
- Neheemar.

74
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,640
Jinhyuk, let's go.

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,670
- There he goes.
- All right.

76
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,740
Neheemar.

77
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,280
He could've blocked it.

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,010
RIIZE is beginning to do well.

79
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,350
SOHEE became confident about...

80
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,220
- sending the ball to the corner.
- Yes.

81
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,250
(SOHEE scored consecutive goals.)

82
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,150
Kylian Yoonbappe.

83
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,620
- Let's go.
- Will he get past Song Heung Min?

84
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,420
- It was a nice shot.
- It went in.

85
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,860
- It went in.
- It's 3 to 2.

86
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,530
If SUNGCHAN scores, the match will end.

87
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,060
- That's right.
- If he scores,

88
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,760
- RIIZE will advance to the finals.
- That's right.

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
- All right.
- That's why he needs to score.

90
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,270
- This shot must be blocked.
- Yes.

91
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,970
Jinhyuk will throw his body.

92
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Zlatan Style, let's go.

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,140
- Here comes Lewandowski's killer shot!
- He made a powerful shot earlier.

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,010
(The match ends with a score of 4 to 2.)

95
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,410
He put an end to the match.

96
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,650
RIIZE advances to the finals.

97
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,780
- RIIZE.
- The final score is 4 to 2.

98
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,690
With the final score of 4 to 2,

99
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,790
- RIIZE advances to the finals.
- That's right.

100
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,820
Congratulations.

101
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,190
RIIZE advances to the finals.

102
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,360
Why is the penalty shoot-out so much fun?
This is amazing.

103
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,830
We'll now begin the second match
of the penalty shoot-out semifinals.

104
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,930
LUCY versus NCT WISH.

105
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,670
In your opinion,

106
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,070
which teams are the strong candidates?

107
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,340
While LUCY did well earlier,

108
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,710
I'm expecting to see...

109
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,210
the final match
between NCT WISH and RIIZE.

110
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,350
Then it'll be a match
between the SM groups.

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,220
It'll be the most entertaining match.

112
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,450
Oh, my.

113
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,360
Will SAKUYA be able to block the shot?

114
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,090
SHIN YE CHAN will shoot soon.

115
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,040
- He scored a goal.
- It went in.

116
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,140
(SHIN YE CHAN's goal
goes in with sharpness.)

117
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,110
- SHIN YE CHAN kicked well.
- SAKUYA is disappointed.

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,740
- SHIN YE CHAN!
- SHIN YE CHAN!

119
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,080
(From the start, the suspense
makes people hold their breath.)

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
YUSHI.

121
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,350
Goalkeeper CHOI SANG YEOP...

122
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,280
threw his body earlier.

123
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,820
YUSHI's shots are impactful.

124
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
That's right.

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
You know...

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,990
You know, he shoots really well.

127
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,200
- His skills are unrivaled.
- He shoots really well.

128
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,930
- I think...
- He showed a different level.

129
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,630
his body is fully warmed up.

130
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,270
All the players are fully warmed up.

131
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,440
Now comes Triangle Feet.

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,810
Perhaps his nickname is Triangle Feet...

133
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,310
because his shots go in sharply.

134
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,940
(Triangle Feet, CHO WON SANG,
is expected to give a sharp shot.)

135
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,610
- There he goes.
- All right.

136
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,110
That's...

137
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,780
- He's Triangle Feet.
- That's Triangle Feet.

138
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,520
- That's Triangle Feet.
- That's Triangle Feet.

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,050
- My goodness.
- That's Triangle Feet.

140
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,890
That's Triangle Feet.

141
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,220
- I see.
- That's Triangle Feet.

142
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,260
Now comes Jaerard.

143
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
- All right.
- There he goes.

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,830
- He's nervous.
- JAEHEE, don't be nervous.

145
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,530
Here comes Jaerard.

146
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,700
Don't be nervous. The shooter is JAEHEE.

147
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,570
- He couldn't block it.
- He couldn't block it.

148
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,870
You can't block a shot like that.

149
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,840
- You can't see it.
- Timing and power.

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,610
It looks like we'll really see a fight
within the same agency.

151
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,880
- That's right.
- The score is 2 to 1.

152
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
SHIN YE CHAN must score this time...

153
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
- for LUCY.
- That's right.

154
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,450
SHIN YE CHAN.

155
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,820
What kind of cool shot will he show us?

156
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,520
- SHIN YE CHAN!
- SHIN YE CHAN!

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,860
- Yes.
- There he goes.

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,430
All right.

159
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,530
- It went in.
- Yes.

160
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,760
All right.

161
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,400
(A powerful shot)

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,770
- SHIN YE CHAN did well as always.
- The goalkeeper made a prediction...

163
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,840
and moved,
but the ball went the other way.

164
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
- The ball went the other way.
- But his movements were good.

165
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,910
- For LUCY and NCT WISH,
- Yes.

166
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,310
we could use this expression.

167
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,210
"The final match that happened too soon."

168
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,610
- That's right.
- These two teams...

169
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,680
have the skills that suit...

170
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,350
- the final match.
- They have the skills.

171
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,350
Everything you say...

172
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,750
- is full of romance.
- I agree.

173
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,050
- Is that so?
- They met too soon.

174
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,220
- I agree.
- "They met too soon."

175
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,790
"We met too soon."

176
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,260
- YUSHI's shots are powerful.
- There he goes.

177
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,360
YUSHI Ball!

178
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,770
YUSHI Ball!

179
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,070
(The ball hits the goalpost.)

180
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,340
- The goalpost.
- It hit the goalpost.

181
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,670
- YUSHI Ball hit the goalpost.
- It hit the goalpost.

182
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,570
Now,

183
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,110
- it's a tie.
- The score is 2 to 2.

184
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,780
- It's a tie.
- It's a tie.

185
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,310
This really is the final match
that happened too soon.

186
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,050
I can't believe it.

187
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,920
- It's neck-and-neck.
- It's so much fun.

188
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,890
CHO WON SANG,

189
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,650
make a sharp shot!

190
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,860
(His shot got blocked!)

191
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,190
It went to the center.

192
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,790
It got blocked.

193
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,660
It got blocked.

194
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,300
This is incredible.

195
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,130
Now, JAEHEE's role became important.

196
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,500
That's right.

197
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,100
- CHOI SANG YEOP must be nervous.
- There he goes.

198
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,170
- JAEHEE, shoot.
- JAEHEE, calm down.

199
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,270
He must be really nervous.

200
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,910
Okay!

201
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,980
- It went in.
- It went in.

202
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,750
- He didn't even hesitate.
- JAEHEE of NCT WISH...

203
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,480
- scored a goal.
- He believed in his kick.

204
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,950
- That's right.
- He believed in his kick.

205
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,220
- He kicked with certainty.
- It went in.

206
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,290
All right.

207
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,960
- The current score is 3 to 2.
- Yes.

208
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,590
If SHIN YE CHAN...

209
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,960
of LUCY fails to score,
the match will end.

210
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,160
He must be really nervous.

211
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,300
This really is the final match
that happened too soon.

212
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,040
- All right.
- There he goes.

213
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
(LUCY comes back to life.)

214
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,140
He put his everything into the shot.

215
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,880
- It couldn't be blocked.
- No.

216
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,410
- Seriously.
- He put his everything into the shot.

217
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,010
Power and speed.

218
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,980
It couldn't be blocked.

219
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,320
SHIN YE CHAN and JAEHEE belong...

220
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,620
- to a different class.
- They're on another level.

221
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,690
- SHIN YE CHAN!
- SHIN YE CHAN!

222
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,290
Everything depends on YUSHI's kick.

223
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,030
(If he scores,
NCT WISH will advance to the finals.)

224
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,030
He's under a lot of pressure.
There he goes.

225
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,300
He scored a goal!

226
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,300
(It went in!)

227
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,770
NCT WISH advances to the finals.

228
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,610
- Then...
- NCT WISH...

229
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
advances to the finals.

230
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,810
- It's a fight within SM Entertainment.
- It's a fight within the same agency.

231
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,250
- It's a fight within the same agency.
- The final score is 4 to 3.

232
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,250
NCT WISH advances to the finals.

233
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,790
Yes.

234
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,020
Fans, are you enjoying yourselves?

235
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,220
- Yes!
- Yes!

236
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,030
Two teams...

237
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,930
rose above the matches
that were as heated as these cheers.

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's meet them right away.

239
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,370
You advanced to the finals.

240
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,170
Please tell us how it feels.

241
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,540
It's an honor to make it to the finals...

242
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,770
with the group
from the same agency, NCT WISH.

243
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,710
We hope we'll have a good result.

244
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,150
Before we began, EUNSEOK asked me...

245
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,180
to go easy on him
because his wrists were bad.

246
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,720
So, we'll go easy on him.

247
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,090
That never happened.

248
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,020
Even if you do your best, we'll win.

249
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,960
(The tension is thick
even before the match begins.)

250
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,930
(The onlookers have fun.)

251
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,600
That was cool.

252
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,700
You've listened to HYEONGJUN of CRAVITY.

253
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
(Let's look forward to the fight
within SM Entertainment.)

254
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,200
We'll now begin
the penalty shoot-out finals.

255
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,440
- It's SAKUYA...
- Yes.

256
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,670
- SUNGCHAN.
- versus SUNGCHAN.

257
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,740
- Yes.
- That's the match.

258
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,680
- All right.
- SUNGCHAN kicks the ball well.

259
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,810
(They exchange looks
before starting off the finals.)

260
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,080
(Glaring)

261
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,320
- SUNGCHAN, you got this. Let's go.
- Here comes SUNGCHAN.

262
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,420
The timing is good.

263
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,550
(A powerful shot that suits the final)

264
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,290
- It was a nice shot.
- He made an impressive shot.

265
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,290
He's really good.

266
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,160
It was so nice to see.

267
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,460
- Look at JAEHEE. He covered his mouth.
- Yes.

268
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,400
- His jaw dropped.
- Yes.

269
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,230
SUNGCHAN kicked really well.

270
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,100
YUSHI went, "There are no seniors
in the world of soccer."

271
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,500
"Block it if you can."

272
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,210
That was...

273
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,280
(YUSHI's goal goes in easily.)

274
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,450
That was a mockery.

275
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,150
In my opinion, that was a mockery.

276
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,750
He played with the rhythm.

277
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,350
He kicked the ball well.

278
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,020
- He stuck out his tongue.
- He stuck out his tongue.

279
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,190
"Oh, my! I kicked it gently,"

280
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,860
"but it still went in!"
That was what he did.

281
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,160
Is it necessary to do that?

282
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,130
- SAKUYA.
- What's that?

283
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,000
Is it psychological warfare?

284
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,730
- Is it psychological warfare?
- Will he kick toward SAKUYA?

285
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,630
Will he kick toward the open space?

286
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,000
- There he goes.
- Neheemar.

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,110
- He kicked it well.
- There he goes.

288
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,540
Neheemar.

289
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,310
(The strategy failed.)

290
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,980
- He became annoyed.
- Yes.

291
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,610
Neither team has made a mistake so far.

292
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,820
Will the goalkeeper block the ball?
Will he allow a goal?

293
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,720
EUNSEOK is doing the same.

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
(Open)

295
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,360
The fact that he kept
the goal wide open annoyed JAEHEE.

296
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,920
(I won't go easy on him.)

297
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,930
- He won't go easy on JAEHEE.
- Let's see what happens.

298
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,830
Will the goalkeeper block the ball?
Will he allow a goal?

299
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,230
Jaerard.

300
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,700
(Jaerard scores a goal
without hesitation.)

301
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,640
JAEHEE of NCT WISH.

302
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,140
No one is making a mistake.

303
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,140
Both teams deserved to
advance to the finals.

304
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
- Seriously.
- This is incredible.

305
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,710
The final is no joke.

306
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,340
SUNGCHAN is using psychological warfare.

307
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,580
- He's going, "I'll kick that way."
- Yes.

308
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,910
- I bet he'll actually kick that way.
- Yes.

309
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,280
- All right.
- Watch.

310
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,850
Both of them are using
psychological warfare.

311
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,090
SAKUYA is saying
that he'll block the area.

312
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,250
- Yes.
- Let's begin.

313
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,360
I'd actually kick to the right.

314
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,490
- The center.
- That's...

315
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,730
(The shot went straight to the center.)

316
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,930
- I'd actually kick to the right.
- The center.

317
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
That's...

318
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
That man didn't do as he said.

319
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,500
With a score of 3 to 2, RIIZE is leading.

320
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,810
But they're on the third shooter.

321
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,810
- If he scores, it'll be a tie again.
- That's right.

322
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,780
Here comes YUSHI.

323
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,280
YUSHI.

324
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,010
He did the same.

325
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,680
- He didn't use much energy.
- YUSHI.

326
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,450
- He didn't use much energy.
- He kicked in a relaxed way.

327
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,850
He kicked in a relaxed way,

328
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,850
- but the ball went to the corner quickly.
- That's right.

329
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,720
YUSHI seems like a very smart player.

330
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,290
It's hard to aim well
even if you look at the corner.

331
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,430
(Since it's the final,
people cheer passionately.)

332
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,830
One, two, three!

333
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,430
- SOHEE, let's go!
- SOHEE, let's go!

334
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
What will happen?

335
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,600
The fourth shooter.

336
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,000
- What will happen?
- There he goes.

337
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,440
(SOHEE of RIIZE becomes cautious.)

338
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,910
- It's psychological warfare.
- Neheemar, let's go.

339
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,180
Don't put too much force into it.

340
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,190
(SOHEE fails.)

341
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,690
That's the problem.

342
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,690
- It got blocked.
- What happened?

343
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,560
- It got blocked.
- What happened?

344
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,530
What is Neheemar going to do?

345
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,830
Now comes Jaerard with good kicks.

346
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,030
- That's the worst timing.
- Why did it have to be Jaerard?

347
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,340
If he scores, it'll be 4 to 3.

348
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,240
Why did it have to be him?
There goes Jaerard.

349
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,610
JAEHEE, shoot.

350
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,310
(It's a powerful shot.)

351
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,480
- The sound was incredible.
- JAEHEE and SUNGCHAN are...

352
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,290
- Right.
- confident. "Block it if you can."

353
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,420
- They have certainty.
- Yes.

354
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,120
If SUNGCHAN fails to score,
the match will end.

355
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,630
If he scores, they'll have another round.

356
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,860
That's right.

357
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,430
(Please)

358
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,530
SUNGCHAN, you can do it.

359
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
- There he goes.
- He's backing off.

360
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,740
The referee blew the whistle.

361
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,910
There he goes.

362
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,910
(Everyone focuses on SUNGCHAN's shot.)

363
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
SUNGCHAN.

364
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,980
He shoots well.

365
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,880
How did it go so fast
even though it hit the ground?

366
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,680
- He kicked well.
- I see.

367
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,520
- It couldn't be blocked.
- It happens when you kick well.

368
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,150
- The ball moved very fast.
- Yes.

369
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,590
It was a difficult shot to block.

370
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,560
- The location and height were perfect.
- Yes.

371
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,690
- You should either send it low or high.
- That's right.

372
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,860
It shouldn't be an awkward height.

373
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,530
If YUSHI scores, the match will end.

374
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,500
NCT WISH hasn't failed to score once.

375
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,600
- That's right.
- You're right.

376
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,100
(Will the shooter score?
Will the goalkeeper block?)

377
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,340
(We'll keep our eyes and ears covered.)

378
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,040
Will NCT WISH win?

379
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,710
There he goes.

380
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,340
YUSHI!

381
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
YUSHI!

382
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,490
There he goes.

383
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
YUSHI!

384
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,230
He scores a goal!

385
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,630
It went in.

386
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,800
- NCT WISH won.
- NCT WISH.

387
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,830
Yes.

388
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,400
They won the penalty shoot-out.

389
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,740
NCT WISH, congratulations on winning.

390
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,870
All right.

391
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,780
(The 1st place's signature song ceremony)

392
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,100
(Which event will follow?)

393
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,830
"Section TV Entertainment News" is back
after five years.

394
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,840
I'm Reporter Jun Hyun Moo.

395
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,900
For the 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships,

396
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,810
the Chuseok Special,

397
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,340
the idols are warming up
before the matches.

398
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,650
I'll cover the story quickly.

399
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,080
Which group is first?

400
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,780
CRAVITY, it's nice to meet you.

401
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,980
Hello.

402
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,980
Aren't you overexerting yourself?

403
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,350
I don't want to get injured
during a match.

404
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,160
That's why I'm warming up.

405
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
- Is that so? That's good.
- Yes.

406
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,920
- JUNGMO.
- Hello.

407
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,630
- You seem to be struggling.
- You know,

408
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,730
I got a good exercise
even though I haven't used it for long.

409
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,730
- Is that so?
- Yes.

410
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,470
Since it was small,
I didn't think that I'd get exhausted.

411
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,830
But I'm so exhausted right now.

412
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,240
- It's very effective.
- You're exhausted.

413
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,470
BELLE of KISS OF LIFE.

414
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,940
You have a strong core.

415
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,540
Because there are no handles,

416
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,280
- it strengthens my abs.
- You're right.

417
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,350
It strengthens my core.

418
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,550
Please say a few words to your dad.

419
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,650
Dad, I got defined abs.

420
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,850
(BELLE's dad, Shim Shin)

421
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,820
- HANEUL.
- Hello.

422
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,760
You can sing while exercising, right?

423
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,790
Of course.

424
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,290
(Her voice doesn't waver
even as she exercises.)

425
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,360
(Dancing)

426
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,470
I can't believe it.

427
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,740
You have solid singing skills.

428
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,470
We'll look forward to...

429
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,580
the cool matches they'll show
with their overflowing will.

430
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,910
This is the Goyang Gym.

431
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,410
MBC.

432
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,050
(Goyang Gym)

433
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,090
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

434
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,090
Let's check the bracket...

435
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,260
for men's ssireum preliminaries.

436
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,630
For men's ssireum preliminaries,

437
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,100
we have teams that are trying ssireum
for the first time...

438
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,970
and teams that have the spirit
of the ssireum champion.

439
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,140
A total of 24 idols will enter.

440
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,340
All right.

441
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,510
The referees are here.

442
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,310
Group one of the preliminary rounds...

443
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,210
is CRAVITY versus AMPERS and ONE.

444
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,980
Since the two teams practiced
on the same day,

445
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,350
they've gone against each other
a few times...

446
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,720
as if it was an actual match.

447
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,790
During practice,

448
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,860
CRAVITY beat AMPERS and ONE
with unrivaled ssireum skills.

449
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,820
AMPERS and ONE became highly motivated...

450
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,360
and practiced more,

451
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,430
so you can look forward to them today.

452
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,330
Since they've both worked out diligently,

453
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,000
they aren't very different...

454
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,970
when it comes to stamina, basic skills,
and the way they use their bodies.

455
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,970
They know each other well.

456
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,410
Rise.

457
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,240
Rise.

458
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,680
(Will AMPERS and ONE get back
for the losses during practice?)

459
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,010
Get ready.

460
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,220
(The match begins.)

461
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,750
- The match has begun.
- Yes.

462
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,290
SERIM of CRAVITY and...

463
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,950
Bear hug throw.

464
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,290
- It's important to hold out.
- the strength to hold out.

465
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,430
- SERIM is very strong.
- This is his specialty.

466
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,760
- Yoon Si Yun!
- He's very strong.

467
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,270
You should know how to use
the opponent's strength to your advantage.

468
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,540
Bear hug throw. He's down.

469
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,600
He did it.

470
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,170
(CRAVITY takes 1 win.)

471
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,380
- He did it.
- SERIM.

472
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,510
The coach said that he was very strong.

473
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,080
- Yes.
- He had good strength, right?

474
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,420
On top of being strong,

475
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,850
he has good steps from playing soccer.

476
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,220
He spun the opponent...

477
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,990
by pushing in one foot
and turning the body.

478
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,460
- He's smart too.
- The spin was very cool.

479
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,730
He used the left bear hug throw.

480
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,500
- Left bear hug throw.
- Left bear hug throw.

481
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Ssireum has pretty technique names.

482
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,000
- They're all Korean.
- Yes.

483
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,740
- It's ALLEN versus Choi Ji Ho.
- Yes.

484
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,100
ALLEN is a tough opponent.

485
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,040
- He's incredibly agile.
- That's right.

486
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,980
Coach said this about ALLEN.

487
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,810
"I expected him to be the weakest,"

488
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,980
"but he was very strong
during the actual match."

489
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,550
He has the man's tenacity.
I was so surprised.

490
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,180
Oh, my. This is ALLEN's promise
for the gold medal.

491
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,820
As soon as the gold medal
is around his neck,

492
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,850
he'll show his abs on the podium.

493
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,950
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

494
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,790
How is it that you only see such things?

495
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,060
- It was the only information in bold.
- I see.

496
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
But Ji Ho isn't an easy target.

497
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,530
- That's right.
- Coach said,

498
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,860
"His movements are different."

499
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,900
- "You can tell that he has worked out."
- Yes.

500
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,600
- Really?
- He learns incredibly fast.

501
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,900
- It has begun.
- The war of nerves.

502
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,070
The war of nerves after the war of satba.

503
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,170
He lifted ALLEN up.

504
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,770
- No!
- ALLEN.

505
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,180
- ALLEN held out.
- ALLEN held out.

506
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,010
- ALLEN...
- Ji Ho is attacking him fiercely.

507
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,650
They're attacking and defending.

508
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,350
There he goes.

509
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,920
(AMPERS and ONE's Choi Ji Ho wins.)

510
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,750
- He won.
- Choi Ji Ho won.

511
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,060
- He lost his balance.
- Yes.

512
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,760
It was fierce.

513
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
(Choi Ji Ho brings a tie.)

514
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,200
Coach said, "You can tell
that he has worked out."

515
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,530
- I could definitely tell.
- Yes.

516
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,430
The moment ALLEN
went for the bear hug throw,

517
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,100
Ji Ho put his weight on his right leg.

518
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,270
That was why the one
who attempted the attack,

519
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,240
ALLEN, fell to the pushing throw.

520
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,810
It's 1 to 1. Choi Ji Ho won.

521
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,240
TAEYOUNG and...

522
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,580
- MACKIAH.
- MACKIAH.

523
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,650
(Everything depends on one match.)

524
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,050
(Group 1 of the Preliminary Rounds,
the 3rd match)

525
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,820
(TAEYOUNG of CRAVITY
versus MACKIAH of AMPERS and ONE)

526
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,790
MACKIAH is 19 years old.

527
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,060
Before he became an idol,

528
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,130
the combined weight for the big 3
was a little under 350kg.

529
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,860
If he has strong muscles,

530
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,360
he'll be able to use his strength well.

531
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
(Will TAEYOUNG be able to win?)

532
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,530
You're right.

533
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,500
(The two teams' fate
depends on the last match.)

534
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,070
TAEYOUNG versus MACKIAH.

535
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,610
- All right.
- TAEYOUNG.

536
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,810
They need to win this match
to advance to the next round.

537
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,810
TAEYOUNG.

538
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,050
- Outer hook throw.
- MACKIAH isn't an easy target.

539
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,120
(AMPERS and ONE wins.)

540
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,090
MACKIAH.

541
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,350
How did this happen?

542
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,520
The combined weight for the big 3
was a little under 350kg.

543
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,090
That was impressive.

544
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,800
MACKIAH is very strong.

545
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,430
- Here, MACKIAH...
- He didn't fall over.

546
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,270
- At that moment...
- He used the outer leg throw.

547
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,600
When he used the outer leg throw,

548
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,140
he didn't lift his right leg and hook it
on the opponent's leg.

549
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,870
- He stepped on the ground.
- Yes.

550
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,440
More strength went to that foot,

551
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,880
- so the opponent fell.
- You're right.

552
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,250
Had he hooked the leg,
he would've gotten the counter throw.

553
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,780
He did exactly as I taught him.

554
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,020
- So, it's thanks to Lee Tae Hyun.
- Yes.

555
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,150
- He bragged about himself in the end.
- I know.

556
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,460
During practice, AMPERS and WIND...

557
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,360
lost both times.

558
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,060
But the actual match was different.

559
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,260
They must've learned a lot
through practice.

560
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,270
I'm so happy right now.

561
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,200
- I see.
- Yes.

562
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,270
He was so happy
that he called them AMPERS and WIND.

563
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,370
They're AMPERS and ONE.

564
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,270
AMPERS and ONE. I'm sorry.

565
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,340
Winning 2 to 1, AMPERS and ONE...

566
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,350
moves on to the next round.
Congratulations.

567
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,250
They're an unrivaled band in Korea.

568
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,280
It's a match between LUCY and TEMPEST.

569
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,550
I know a lot about the band, LUCY.

570
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,360
They have so much power
and testosterone inside.

571
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,630
(Earlier, during the penalty shoot-out)

572
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,660
(The cannon shot shook up the goal.)

573
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,100
Testosterone.

574
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,130
They're incredibly manly inside.

575
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,300
- Really?
- They have so much energy...

576
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,170
on the stage,
so I'm looking forward to them.

577
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,740
I'm excited to see the players...

578
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,510
lead the team with their strength.

579
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,410
This match is between SHIN YE CHAN...

580
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,420
and TEMPEST's HYUK.

581
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,650
(HYUK)

582
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,650
(Baby Kang Ho Dong)

583
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,290
(The match begins.)

584
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,690
- Okay.
- Bear hug throw.

585
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,730
- He needs to step out of it.
- YE CHAN didn't go out.

586
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,030
- He got out of it.
- Let's go.

587
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,900
- They keep attacking.
- Inner leg hook!

588
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,970
- Yes!
- He won!

589
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,370
That was impressive.

590
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,200
He came back from behind.

591
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,470
(His agility stood out in this match.)

592
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,270
He was in danger at first.

593
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,810
HYUK came in with two bear hug throws...

594
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,410
- in a row.
- Yes.

595
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,510
But he got out of it with a waist pull...

596
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,080
and used his opponent's power against him.

597
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,220
- I see.
- Now, the score is 1 to 0.

598
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,290
I would've had a hard time staying calm,

599
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,890
- Same.
- but he remained calm.

600
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,890
I see.

601
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,190
Now we have TAERAE,
the athlete of TEMPEST.

602
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,360
He has a great physicality.

603
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
And we have CHOI SANG YEOP.

604
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,800
CHOI SANG YEOP promised to...

605
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,300
donate 100,000 dollars
if he won the gold medal here.

606
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
(CHOI SANG YEOP's gold medal pledge:
Donate 100,000 dollars.)

607
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,140
So he doesn't plan to get the gold medal.

608
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,540
- He'll lose on purpose?
- CHOI SANG YEOP is the main vocalist.

609
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,750
He has great high notes.

610
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,050
I hope he goes up high
in this tournament too.

611
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,450
(Round 2 is very important for TEMPEST.)

612
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,650
Okay.

613
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,590
- Oh, my. Did you just see that?
- That power.

614
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,990
- Oh, my. Did you just see that?
- That power.

615
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,130
- Did you just see that power?
- I did.

616
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,160
A battle of strength.

617
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,960
- Oh, my! TAERAE!
- CHOI SANG YEOP is strong too.

618
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,260
This is a battle of strength...

619
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,730
(TEMPEST's TAERAE wins.)

620
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,930
CHOI SANG YEOP is strong too.

621
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,910
(TEMPEST's TAERAE
dominated with his strength.)

622
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,210
As expected, TEMPTEST's ace,

623
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,640
- TAERAE takes the victory.
- He is insanely strong!

624
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,950
- That's a battle of two strong guys.
- Yes.

625
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,680
The power play started here.

626
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,220
SANG YEOP has good core strength,

627
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,290
but his core balance went up.

628
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,890
When your core balance goes up,
it's hard to overpower your opponent.

629
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,420
On the contrary,

630
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,730
TAERAE went from below
to flip his opponent.

631
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,400
It's 1 to 1 right now.

632
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,730
- I'm a bit worried about LUCY.
- Yes.

633
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,340
CHO WON SANG is a bit skinny.

634
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,970
- Weight gives you an advantage, right?
- Right.

635
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,410
But it could be an even match
because TEMPEST's HYEONGSEOP...

636
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,810
was told this by his coach.

637
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,610
"He's so weak
that he can't balance himself at all."

638
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,350
CHO WON SANG's manager said
he was like a paper doll.

639
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,350
(LUCY's CHO WON SANG's nickname
is paper doll.)

640
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,590
- A paper doll versus a balloon doll.
- Yes.

641
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,920
It's a match between paper and balloon.

642
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
(Group 2 of the Preliminary Rounds,
the 3rd match)

643
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
(CHO WON SANG of LUCY
versus HYEONGSEOP of TEMPEST)

644
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,090
This will be neck and neck.

645
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,130
- Neck and neck in another way.
- Exactly.

646
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,100
(HYEONGSEOP, you can do it!)

647
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,900
There we go. They need to win this match
to move on to the next round.

648
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay.

649
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,440
- I'm nervous.
- They're tied 1 to 1.

650
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,170
- Okay.
- Oh, my!

651
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,310
- Wait.
- Wait.

652
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,350
What just happened?

653
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,610
- I'm nervous.
- They're tied 1 to 1.

654
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,680
- Okay.
- Oh, my!

655
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,450
(Are you okay?)

656
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,590
- Wait.
- Wait.

657
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,760
What just happened?

658
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,860
- Wait.
- What just happened?

659
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,560
- Wait. What was that?
- What just happened?

660
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,960
Did he just win by luck?

661
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,530
What did I say about HYEONGSEOP?

662
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,630
"He's so weak
that he can't balance himself at all."

663
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,640
- He basically just walked, right?
- The paper doll versus the balloon doll.

664
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,770
The paper doll won.

665
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,010
Yes, the balloon flew away.

666
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,440
Wasn't that a pushing throw?

667
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,880
Yes, the name of the technique
is called pushing throw.

668
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,210
But it wasn't a pushing throw.
It was just pushing.

669
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,980
He went down so easily.

670
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,720
- What is this?
- Are you okay?

671
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,350
- Look at his face.
- Are you okay?

672
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,660
It was so romantic.

673
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Winning 2 to 1,
LUCY moves on to the next round.

674
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,690
Group 3 of the preliminary rounds
is 82MAJOR versus...

675
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,030
n.SSign.

676
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,170
Just going off of their practice,
82MAJOR seemed strong.

677
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,140
They quickly understood ssireum as well.

678
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,680
n.SSign really practiced a lot.

679
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,040
They really enjoyed ssireum.

680
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,480
They kept practicing
even when others were resting.

681
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,150
I'm excited about this matchup.

682
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,950
I think these two teams...

683
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,790
might be gold medal contenders.

684
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,860
(Group 3 of the Preliminary Rounds,
the 1st match)

685
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,890
(Kim Do Gyun of 82MAJOR
versus SUNGYUN of n.SSign)

686
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,960
It says that SUNGYUN
is good at lifting heavy things.

687
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,660
- Really?
- That means he has good core strength.

688
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,100
- Right.
- He works out his biceps...

689
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,300
with 70 to 80kg weights.

690
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,270
No way.

691
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,140
Can you believe that? That's amazing.

692
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,400
Kim Do Gyun...

693
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,570
- did judo for 3 to 4 years.
- That's right.

694
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,610
- He trained to become a professional.
- That means he's strong too.

695
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,710
- Yes.
- Even if you work out your biceps...

696
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,810
with 70 to 80kg weights,

697
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,650
- a judoka will be hard to beat.
- Right.

698
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,450
- Okay.
- Here we go.

699
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,550
I can already feel the tension.

700
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,620
- The blue satba is the judoka.
- Yes.

701
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,920
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

702
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,460
(82MAJOR's Kim Do Gyun wins.)

703
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,430
(How could this happen?)

704
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,660
- Okay.
- 82MAJOR!

705
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,800
That was impressive.

706
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,070
Do Gyun lost many times in ssireum...

707
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,170
because of his judo technique.

708
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,370
- Because of his judo technique?
- Yes.

709
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,610
But judging by his axis and spin,

710
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,440
I think he really understands ssireum now.

711
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,980
- That was 1 win for 82MAJOR.
- Yes.

712
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,950
This is a match
between Cho Seong Il and KAZUTA.

713
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,950
Yes, KAZUTA.

714
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,750
It seems his main technique
is the inner leg hook.

715
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,660
Cho Seong Il...

716
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,660
is 185cm tall.

717
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,660
He's the tallest person
in this ssireum tournament.

718
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,500
Personally, I'm looking forward to
seeing Yoon Ye Chan.

719
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,200
- Yoon Ye Chan.
- Yoon Ye Chan.

720
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,170
- You already got a look.
- Ye Chan.

721
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,140
Okay. I understand.

722
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,210
Ye Chan. I'm here.

723
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,840
- He's not listening to you.
- He's not.

724
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,380
That's too bad.

725
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,150
They're getting started.
A match between KAZUTA and Cho Seong Il.

726
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,780
What's it going to be? Power versus speed.

727
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,520
Oh, my.

728
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
- Ready.
- Yes.

729
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,360
- Rise.
- The match has begun.

730
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,460
- Okay. Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

731
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,260
Outer leg throw. What is this?

732
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,300
(82MAJOR's Cho Seong Il wins.)

733
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,500
Okay, Cho Seong Il takes the victory.

734
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,340
Cho Seong Il with the strong lower body.

735
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,540
Power wins over speed and technique.

736
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,710
I see there's some risk
in attacking right off the bat.

737
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,450
If KAZUTA had gone in with his attack
a second later with more strength,

738
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,150
he would've had the advantage,

739
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,650
but he only got his leg in halfway,

740
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,990
so his opponent could push him down.

741
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,420
- I see.
- That's how you go down.

742
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,000
Winning 2 to 0,
82MAJOR moves on to the semifinals.

743
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,830
Okay, Group Four of the preliminary rounds
is NEXZ versus NouerA.

744
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,740
- Both teams practiced a lot.
- All right.

745
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,510
Especially Sierra, no, NouerA...

746
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,570
- NouerA...
- "Sierra."

747
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,380
I'm sorry, but Sierra...

748
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,110
- is the name of a nice car.
- Oh, right.

749
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,550
- I'm not used to their team name.
- Sierra is a nicely designed car.

750
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm making many mistakes today.

751
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,090
I'm sorry, fans.

752
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,050
The last match
of the men's group ssireum preliminaries.

753
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,620
NEXZ's Yu...

754
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,030
and NouerA's JUNPYO.

755
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,500
NEXZ's Yu was selected by his members
as the team's ace.

756
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,900
The coach said that JUNPYO
was a defensive type...

757
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,500
that was good at holding his ground.

758
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,770
- It's better at defense than offense.
- Yes.

759
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,010
This could be a match...

760
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,710
- between spear and shield.
- That's right.

761
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,740
(Nervous)

762
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,910
Yu versus JUNPYO.

763
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,810
How will he break
through JUNPYO's defense?

764
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,280
- Let's see.
- It's neck and neck.

765
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,720
- Oh, my.
- They flew up in the air.

766
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,690
- Oh, my.
- They flew up in the air.

767
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,220
It's neck and neck.

768
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,260
- Oh, my.
- They flew up in the air.

769
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,490
Okay, inner leg...

770
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,430
JUNPYO!

771
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,160
(NouerA's JUNPYO wins.)

772
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,730
JUNPYO wins.

773
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,340
That was an impactful ceremony...

774
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,000
- by JUNPYO.
- Greet each other.

775
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,740
All right.

776
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,280
He really got in the right position...

777
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,750
before making his attack on Yu.

778
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,380
- That was incredible.
- His body understands ssireum now.

779
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,820
- I was really surprised.
- That's so impressive.

780
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,490
- I think Yu attempted a bear hug throw.
- Yes.

781
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,420
- But he wasn't able to flip JUNPYO over.
- Right.

782
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,990
JUNPYO's counter-attack
got the better of him.

783
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
- A win for NouerA.
- MIRAKU.

784
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,700
- So Geon.
- So Geon.

785
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,270
MIRAKU. Show us a miracle.

786
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,370
(So Geon of NEXZ versus MIRAKU of NouerA)

787
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,670
- Okay.
- Shall we get started?

788
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,770
How will this go?

789
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,770
(NouerA is in the lead.)

790
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,940
(If NEXZ loses, they're eliminated.)

791
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,210
- Rise.
- The match has begun.

792
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,980
- Waist pull.
- So Geon.

793
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,780
- Okay.
- Inner leg hook!

794
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,050
- Lift him up!
- Inner leg hook!

795
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,150
- MIRAKU!
- Oh, my.

796
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,560
He really did practice a lot.

797
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,090
- Right.
- I saw them practice.

798
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,360
People really do change
when they practice a lot.

799
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
(NouerA moves on to the semifinal round.)

800
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,300
Winning 2 to 0, NouerA easily beats NEXZ
and moves on to the next round.

801
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,640
Ssireum is so fun.

802
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,000
It really is so fun.

803
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,470
(Heating up)

804
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,950
(Let's go!)

805
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,850
I guess he was thirsty.

806
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,890
It's peach flavor.

807
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,890
It is.

808
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,420
It's so tasty.

809
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,920
That's so refreshing.

810
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,100
We'll now begin the first match
of the men's group ssireum semifinals.

811
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,730
The first match
of the men's group ssireum semifinals...

812
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,770
is between AMPERS and ONE and LUCY,

813
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,930
who came up from the preliminaries.

814
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,740
- It's Yoon Si Yun versus SHIN YE CHAN.
- Yes.

815
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,980
I'm excited to see which team...

816
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,310
will go to the finals.

817
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,310
(AMPERS and ONE came back
from behind to win the preliminaries.)

818
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,410
(Previously,
LUCY had shown monstrous strength.)

819
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,120
Yoon Si Yun and SHIN YE CHAN.

820
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,550
You can already feel the strength
as they stand up.

821
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,790
- Yes.
- You can feel their strength.

822
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,720
Yoon Si Yun seems to have a better form.

823
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,820
- Really?
- Yes.

824
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,990
His shoulders are lower.

825
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,360
It looks like he's rooted to the ground.

826
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,470
Having your shoulders lower
gives you an advantage, right?

827
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,030
- Closer to the ground.
- Okay.

828
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,800
- Let's see.
- Here they go.

829
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,370
- The match has begun.
- They're feeling things out.

830
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,500
Okay.

831
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,270
- They're feeling each other out.
- They're feeling each other out.

832
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,740
Will it be strength or speed?

833
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,010
Will it be speed or strength?

834
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,010
- LUCY...
- This is impressive.

835
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,280
- versus AMPERS and ONE.
- Their opponent...

836
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,580
They're taking time before they attack.

837
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,750
Si Yun just checked
that he could lift his opponent.

838
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,490
They're neck and neck.

839
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,590
- What is this?
- Si Yun won't go down easily.

840
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,190
Go in. Attack.

841
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,920
- They're careful.
- I don't see any chances.

842
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,730
- They're both strong.
- Focus.

843
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,130
Someone needs to attack now.

844
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,500
This is Cheongdo Bullfighting.

845
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,460
- What should they do now?
- They can't attack easily right now.

846
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,340
They did their first round
without knowing much,

847
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,200
but now that they have experience,
they're more careful.

848
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,410
- I get it now.
- Yes.

849
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,440
- They're being careful...
- Right.

850
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
- because they want to win.
- I see.

851
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,410
- They're waiting.
- Yes.

852
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,080
- I see it.
- They're getting started.

853
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,580
- Come on.
- Here they go.

854
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,820
- They need to attack now.
- Si Yun is holding out.

855
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,280
- SHIN YE CHAN.
- SHIN YE CHAN.

856
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,890
I think they can attack now.

857
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,750
- He made another attempt.
- Si Yun is starting...

858
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,560
- to make some slight moves.
- If either one of them...

859
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,760
- There was some movement.
- loses strength,

860
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
the other player will go in right away.

861
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,930
(The match was stopped.)

862
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,560
- What's going on?
- Okay.

863
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,730
Time ran out.

864
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,430
- Yes, because one minute passed,
- Right.

865
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,540
- they'll take a 30-second break,
- Yes.

866
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,600
and then they'll have 30 seconds
of overtime.

867
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,340
Is that how they do it in real ssireum?

868
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,280
Yes. If one minute goes by
without either player...

869
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,650
taking their hands off
of their opponent's satba,

870
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,580
they go into 30 seconds of overtime.

871
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,850
If they’re still tied
after 30 seconds of overtime,

872
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,320
the player
with the lower body weight wins.

873
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,490
I see.

874
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,560
This is a tough match.

875
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,030
- That could be a strategy.
- If they keep going this way.

876
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,430
So the smaller player...

877
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,590
can keep running away...

878
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,460
to tire out their opponent.

879
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,470
From SHIN YE CHAN's perspective,

880
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,600
- taking time could be a strategy.
- Right.

881
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,170
- Get a tie and win by body weight.
- Right.

882
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,910
- Right.
- That could be the case.

883
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,610
- Okay.
- He needs to end this.

884
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,110
A 30-second match.

885
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,940
But he could be attacked
while waiting for the clock to run out.

886
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,150
- He needs to finish it.
- Right here.

887
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,750
Si Yun needs to finish it.

888
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,620
Si Yun needs to end it here.

889
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,820
Okay. He's starting to attack.

890
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,050
We're seeing many attacks.

891
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,190
They're using many techniques.

892
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,960
If SHIN YE CHAN holds out...

893
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,420
All he has to do is hold out.

894
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,660
- Don't hold out.
- Bear hug throw!

895
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,860
- Yoon Si Yun!
- Done!

896
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,430
(AMPERS and ONE's Yoon Si Yun wins.)

897
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,930
- Don't hold out.
- Bear hug throw!

898
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,270
(The match ended 10 seconds
before the end of overtime.)

899
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,970
Victory.

900
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,000
(A roar of victory)

901
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,640
- He only had seconds left...
- Seriously.

902
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,810
- before he won.
- Yes.

903
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,040
If SHIN YE CHAN hung on
for a few more seconds,

904
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,810
- he would've had the advantage.
- Exactly.

905
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,480
Yoon Si Yun attempted endless attacks.

906
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,880
(With Yoon Si Yun's victory,
AMPERS and ONE takes the lead.)

907
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,550
He knew he couldn't win
with his body weight.

908
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,090
Exactly.

909
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,820
He needed to end it in 30 seconds.

910
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
(Shaking his head)

911
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,060
- Oh, no.
- He's tired.

912
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,660
- He's tired.
- He must be.

913
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,800
Good work.

914
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,000
The second match is between Choi Ji Ho...

915
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,540
and CHOI SANG YEOP.

916
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,440
A match between a 21-year-old
and a 31-year-old.

917
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,240
- They're ten years apart.
- Yes.

918
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,570
(Choi Ji Ho, 21, CHOI SANG YEOP, 31,
A match with a 10-year age gap)

919
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,740
The older player needs to show them.

920
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,210
Yes, he needs to show them.

921
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,180
They're both strong.

922
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,810
- They're both aces.
- Yes, that's right.

923
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,820
(Seasoned skill or young vigor?)

924
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,180
(Choi Ji Ho)

925
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,790
Like the vocalist he is,
CHOI SANG YEOP has great core strength.

926
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,520
But his weakness...

927
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,760
- is that he keeps raising his core...
- Like earlier.

928
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,160
- instead of lowering it.
- Earlier,

929
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,360
- you mentioned that in the preliminaries.
- Yes.

930
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,360
- Outer leg throw!
- Outer leg throw right away.

931
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,900
- They're going in right away.
- Bear hug throw!

932
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,470
Yes. He's holding out. Nice.

933
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,240
He's going for the side space.

934
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
- He's turning around...
- His leg...

935
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,340
- Oh, my!
- Pushing throw!

936
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,740
- He's going for the side space.
- He's turning around...

937
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,540
- Oh, my!
- Pushing throw!

938
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,950
- No.
- What?

939
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,510
- It was invalid.
- They went out of the ring.

940
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,550
Why is it invalid?

941
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,150
If the attacker's foot
is outside the line...

942
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,350
when the deciding move is made,
it's invalid.

943
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,620
(If the attacker's foot is out,
the win is invalid.)

944
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,260
It didn't count.

945
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,360
- It was out.
- The attack always needs to happen...

946
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,520
- inside of the ring.
- Inside, I see.

947
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,830
- That's too bad.
- CHOI SANG YEOP...

948
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,260
- must be so sad.
- Yes.

949
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,730
He brought his opponent down.

950
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,830
- Of course, he's sad.
- Right.

951
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,600
But since they were out of the ring,
it's invalid.

952
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,370
After a player...

953
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,340
goes down once like this,

954
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,300
- their mind starts to weaken.
- Right.

955
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,440
Yes, totally.

956
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,210
- He needs to use this strength.
- Yes.

957
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,840
How will he overcome this and win?

958
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,210
I'm excited to see how Choi Ji Ho does.

959
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,950
In the preliminaries,

960
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,220
- Choi Ji Ho got a taste of victory,
- Rise.

961
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,990
so he must be extra nervous.

962
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,260
- Bear hug throw!
- Wait.

963
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,690
- Will there be a twist?
- Choi Ji Ho.

964
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,630
(AMPERS and ONE's Choi Ji Ho wins!)

965
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,830
We got a plot twist.

966
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,470
Of course, we got a plot twist.

967
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,270
(AMPERS and ONE moves on to the finals.)

968
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,310
(Good job.)

969
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,440
So sadly,

970
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,740
his attack was counted as invalid.

971
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,050
- It was invalid.
- That's so sad.

972
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,120
It's AMPERS and ONE's victory.

973
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,220
They go to the finals.

974
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,420
Congratulations, AMPERS and ONE.

975
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:28,090
We'll now begin the second match
of the men's group ssireum semifinals.

976
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,460
Oh, hello, Ye Chan.

977
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,530
82MAJOR has a lot of swag.

978
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,830
(Full of confidence,
82MAJOR has a lot of swag.)

979
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,970
- Seriously.
- They're so cool.

980
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,370
Performance.

981
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,830
Showmanship.

982
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,300
- Hey, MAJOR.
- All right.

983
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,440
NouerA. They're calmer.

984
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,740
Yes, I think...

985
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,280
- NouerA is more introverted.
- Yes.

986
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,410
- Since Chang Sub and I are introverts,
- Yes.

987
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,410
we'll root for NouerA.

988
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,280
- I see.
- I'll root for NouerA.

989
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,750
The world for introverts must come.

990
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,350
The first match...

991
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,950
is between Cho Seong Il and JUNPYO.

992
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,460
(Cho Seong Il of 82MAJOR
versus JUNPYO of NouerA)

993
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,530
- Cho Seong Il is the ace of his team.
- Greet each other.

994
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,030
He has both power and technique.

995
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,800
Out of the eight teams today,

996
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,470
I believe he has the best physicality.

997
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,800
- Perfect for ssireum.
- Yes.

998
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,870
I want to coach him.

999
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,770
- You want to coach him.
- Yes.

1000
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,310
You like Cho Seong Il's physicality.

1001
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,310
(Commentator Lee Tae Hyun
is eyeing this ssireum talent.)

1002
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,410
What about JUNPYO?

1003
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,580
JUNPYO...

1004
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,510
- plays well.
- Plays well.

1005
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,810
- He plays well on the sand.
- He plays well.

1006
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,950
- He tries a lot of things.
- I see.

1007
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,050
He tries a lot of things...

1008
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,720
- but ends up lying on the sand.
- That's right.

1009
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,050
- He attempts many things.
- Yes.

1010
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,320
Let's see if those attempts
will work today.

1011
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,960
- We've gotten many surprises today,
- That's right.

1012
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,160
so we don't know what will happen.

1013
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,260
- Earlier...
- It's totally possible.

1014
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,700
Earlier in the preliminary round,

1015
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,700
- JUNPYO held on and won.
- That's right.

1016
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,470
All right.

1017
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,900
- Oh, my.
- Bear hug throw!

1018
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,110
(82MAJOR's Cho Seong Il wins.)

1019
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,880
(82MAJOR's Cho Seong Il
really is the ace.)

1020
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,550
He dominated with his power.

1021
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,550
That was impressive.

1022
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,710
- He used his strength to...
- He has a good balance...

1023
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,750
of power and technique.

1024
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,990
I would carefully say
that Cho Seong Il will be...

1025
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,320
the MVP of the ssireum tournament.

1026
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,420
Right.

1027
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,330
His physicality is perfect for ssireum.

1028
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,900
He pulled his opponent's satba up,

1029
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,530
got him close to his hips,

1030
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,030
and held him tight
so his upper body couldn't get away.

1031
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,740
He has the strength...

1032
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,440
and the control over his movements.

1033
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,970
He even has the intuition for ssireum...

1034
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,710
that allows him to balance on his foot...

1035
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,240
and bring his opponent down with impact.

1036
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,150
(Next up is the 2nd match
for Group 2 of the semifinals.)

1037
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,150
- Okay.
- Oh, my.

1038
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,580
- Now...
- Ye Chan.

1039
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,350
Lee Eun Ji's man, Ye Chan.

1040
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,350
MIRAKU.

1041
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,520
- And MIRAKU.
- Let's go.

1042
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,720
- If MIRAKU wins here,
- Greet each other.

1043
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,620
he really deserves his name.

1044
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,760
- It'll be a true miracle.
- Miracle!

1045
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,360
MIRAKU surprised us...

1046
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,930
- in the previous round...
- Right.

1047
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,630
by beating NEXZ's So Geon.

1048
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,830
That's right.

1049
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,070
We don't know what will happen here.

1050
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,540
(But his opponent is 82MAJOR,
a favorite for the gold medal.)

1051
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,780
Since MIRAKU is a bit smaller,

1052
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,150
I taught him to use the inner leg hook
after running away a bit.

1053
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,880
- After running away.
- Totally...

1054
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,820
"When your opponent is using power,
run away and tire them out."

1055
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,350
- "Then, when they stop, you attack."
- Yes.

1056
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,890
- That's what I taught him.
- You built him a strategy.

1057
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,360
- Will he follow that?
- Right.

1058
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,620
I'm excited to see it.

1059
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,290
- He went in 1st.
- He went in 1st.

1060
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,060
- He was lifted up.
- He was lifted up.

1061
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,030
(He was lifted up.)

1062
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,160
He was lifted up.

1063
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Oh, gosh.

1064
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,500
The difference in their physiques
was too big.

1065
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,570
MIRAKU won just now.

1066
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,740
- What?
- MIRAKU won.

1067
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,610
When he was falling down,

1068
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,150
Yoon Ye Chan, in the blue satba,

1069
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,420
touched his knee to the ground first.

1070
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,080
- What?
- He touched his knee to the ground...

1071
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,150
to get MIRAKU down.

1072
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,790
Let's watch the slow-motion video again.

1073
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,920
Let's watch it again.

1074
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,090
- Okay.
- He lifted him up.

1075
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,590
- Yoon Ye Chan lifted him up.
- Yes.

1076
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,590
- Here...
- He was trying to throw him down.

1077
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,830
He held on, and Ye Chan put his knee down.

1078
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,460
- His left knee.
- He touched the mat first.

1079
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,000
- That's right.
- Gosh.

1080
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,800
This was a victory by MIRAKU,

1081
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,400
- who fully understood ssireum.
- Yes.

1082
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,370
- Ye Chan let his guard down too much.
- That was so close.

1083
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,880
When he saw his opponent falling,

1084
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,540
his protective instincts kicked in.

1085
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,880
(Good job.)

1086
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
- What a surprise.
- He must be so sad.

1087
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,280
In ssireum,
your knees and anything below...

1088
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,750
- can't touch the ground.
- That's right.

1089
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,050
He tried to protect MIRAKU
so he wouldn't get hurt.

1090
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,220
How sad.

1091
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
He has a kind heart.

1092
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,320
I thought you were his mom.
You look so sad.

1093
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,990
My son...

1094
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,960
Okay. The last match...

1095
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,730
between Kim Do Gyun and Hyun Jun
will begin now.

1096
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,800
- Rise.
- They're tied 1 to 1.

1097
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,940
(Kim Do Gyun of 82MAJOR
versus Hyun Jun of NouerA)

1098
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,440
(NouerA came back from defeat.)

1099
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,670
The morale of 82MAJOR members
has fallen a bit.

1100
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,710
- Right.
- I think so.

1101
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,540
- They could have won, but they didn't.
- Right.

1102
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,910
But the result could cause...

1103
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,150
- their spirit to fade.
- They seem sad about it.

1104
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,410
In contrast,

1105
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,450
NouerA must be
filled with fighting spirit.

1106
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,380
NouerA is showing us many twists.

1107
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,390
Exactly.

1108
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,820
(However, the opponent is Kim Do Gyun,
a former judo athlete.)

1109
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,960
Beat him!

1110
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,820
(The last match decides the finalist.)

1111
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,360
- If Do Gyun becomes impatient,
- Yes?

1112
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,500
he might end up using the wrong technique.

1113
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,300
He must stay patient.

1114
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,970
- Meanwhile, Hyun Jun...
- What?

1115
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,830
An outer leg throw. Here he goes!

1116
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,070
- Meanwhile, Hyun Jun...
- What?

1117
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,070
An outer leg throw. Here he goes!

1118
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,170
(Kim Do Gyun of 82MAJOR ends it quickly.)

1119
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,110
Kim Do Gyun wins.

1120
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,610
A clean match.

1121
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,910
That was a clean match.

1122
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,320
- NouerA's era ends here.
- Right.

1123
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,780
That was a really clean match.

1124
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,620
(What a relief.)

1125
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,690
82MAJOR...

1126
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,190
advances to the finals, winning 2 to 1.

1127
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,630
After fierce matches,

1128
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,360
only two groups have made it
to the finals.

1129
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,360
Please give some intimidating words...

1130
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,170
to your opponent.

1131
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,340
Starting with AMPERS and ONE.

1132
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,470
82MAJOR,

1133
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,810
we will end with a major win.

1134
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,410
"We will end with a major win."

1135
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,750
That was a punchline.

1136
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,550
We will show you how bright
the lights of this gym are.

1137
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,780
(Shocked)

1138
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,920
That means he'll throw you down.

1139
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Nice one.

1140
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,720
(Satisfied)

1141
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,190
That wraps up the ssireum arena.

1142
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,000
Reporting was Park Gun Wook
from ZEROBASEONE.

1143
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,700
All right,
only the strongest have survived.

1144
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,230
- From what I see, both teams...
- Yes?

1145
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,370
rely more on physique than technique.

1146
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,410
- I see.
- For sure.

1147
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,470
- It's a battle of strength.
- Right.

1148
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,880
- A clash of spears.
- Exactly.

1149
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,340
AMPERS and ONE, wearing the blue satba,

1150
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,950
seemed weak at first.

1151
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,350
I had never seen them win.

1152
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,820
But today,

1153
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,920
they showed a completely different charm
in the real match...

1154
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,520
compared to their practice.

1155
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,990
82MAJOR were strong even in practice.

1156
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,100
I look forward to the match
between 82MAJOR,

1157
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,800
the team that has always been strong,

1158
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:48,100
and AMPERS and ONE,
the team that rose from weak to strong.

1159
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,210
Like you have said, if AMPERS and ONE win,

1160
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,210
- it will be an underdog uprising.
- Yes.

1161
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,480
- Totally.
- That's right.

1162
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,480
- Here they come.
- They're here.

1163
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,050
The first players are
MACKIAH of AMPERS and ONE,

1164
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,590
and Cho Seong Il of 82MAJOR.

1165
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,620
- Yes.
- They're the first to fight.

1166
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,460
Cho Seong Il has crushing power.

1167
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,460
- Yes.
- He does.

1168
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,990
- He has that one punch.
- Yes.

1169
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,600
(The idol with the number 1
overwhelming physique)

1170
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,870
(Cho Seong Il of 82MAJOR
has both strength and technique.)

1171
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,480
He must win this match
to advance to the next round.

1172
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,280
- MACKIAH.
- An outer leg throw.

1173
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,280
(The ace started
the revolt of the underdog.)

1174
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,690
(The ace started
the revolt of the underdog.)

1175
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,820
What a surprise.

1176
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,520
(MACKIAH of AMPERS and ONE
went head-to-head using his strength.)

1177
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,830
MACKIAH is surprisingly strong.

1178
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,760
- They both have similar physiques.
- True.

1179
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,330
- Earlier, he won using just his strength.
- Right?

1180
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,230
Judging by how both keep their shoulders
as low as possible,

1181
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,670
they already have a know-how.

1182
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,740
- Yes.
- Right?

1183
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,400
Their shoulder fight...

1184
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,670
- must also be intense.
- Right.

1185
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,110
The moment the shoulders rise,

1186
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,510
- you're at a disadvantage.
- I see.

1187
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,510
MACKIAH's outer leg throw...

1188
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,110
- from the earlier match.
- Yes?

1189
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,610
Will it work on Cho Seong Il?

1190
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,980
Cho Seong Il uses bear hug throws
powered by his strength.

1191
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,920
A bear hug throw. Here he goes.

1192
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,490
He's done it.

1193
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,660
(Cho Seong Il of 82MAJOR
ends the game in a flash.)

1194
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,030
Did you see how he got up?

1195
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,560
MACKIAH. That was close.

1196
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,500
As I mentioned earlier,

1197
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,900
Cho Seong Il might become the MVP.

1198
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,200
- Yes.
- Exactly.

1199
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
He's just too strong.

1200
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,740
He has deep knowledge...

1201
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,070
- of ssireum techniques.
- Is that so?

1202
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,610
- Just now, he pushed his body...
- Yes?

1203
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,180
against the opponent's
and turned with precise footwork.

1204
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,510
After lifting MACKIAH up,
he went down smoothly.

1205
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,780
Had their bodies been apart,

1206
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,380
- the opponent could have escaped.
- I see.

1207
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,620
But he stayed close,
and they went down together.

1208
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,120
That's the charm of the bear hug throw.

1209
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,290
Bear hug throw.

1210
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,360
- Even before MACKIAH could do anything,
- Exactly.

1211
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,160
- he got attacked.
- Cho Seong Il lifted him up.

1212
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,360
All right, the second players.

1213
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,000
The match is between
Kim Do Gyun and Choi Ji Ho.

1214
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,840
Ji Ho said,
"We will end with a major win."

1215
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,570
And Do Gyun said,

1216
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,170
"We will show you how bright
the lights of this gym are."

1217
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,310
- If Choi Ji Ho loses this match,
- Yes?

1218
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,950
they'll go home with a major loss.

1219
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,920
- True.
- They're already down 0 to 1.

1220
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,180
- Take a look.
- ALLEN...

1221
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,320
(He was rated as an underdog,)

1222
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,320
(but he was a clutch player
who showed a turnaround.)

1223
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,130
(Choi Ji Ho of AMPERS and ONE,
the miracle maker,)

1224
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,230
(who even reversed dangerous situations)

1225
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,530
(An underdog who knows
how to use the opponent's strength)

1226
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:38,510
(Overwhelming power
from the very first match)

1227
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,110
(No match has lasted more than 5 seconds)

1228
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,050
Kim Do Gyun wins.

1229
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,350
(Kim Do Gyun of 82MAJOR,
a former judo athlete)

1230
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,550
(A showdown between strong contenders)

1231
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,320
(Who will take
the ssireum champion title?)

1232
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,730
(This could be the final match.)

1233
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,540
- Come on.
- Nice.

1234
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,470
(Kim Do Gyun wins in an instant.)

1235
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,210
- He wins.
- With this...

1236
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,210
(That was close.)

1237
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,410
The winner has been decided.

1238
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,850
(82MAJOR wins ssireum by 2 to 0.)

1239
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,190
So he executed a hook.

1240
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,190
Yes, using the leg hook throw technique,

1241
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,660
- he changed direction.
- I see.

1242
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,660
- He used his knees to pivot,
- Right.

1243
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,930
stayed close to his opponent,

1244
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,260
and drove him to the ground.

1245
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,800
82MAJOR wins.

1246
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,240
Congratulations.

1247
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,370
(Gold medalist: 82MAJOR)

1248
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,540
Okay, AMPERS and ONE is...

1249
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,770
(The 1st place's signature song ceremony)

1250
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:46,910
Here's their song.

1251
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,680
("TAKEOVER" by 82MAJOR)

1252
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,950
It's Yoon Ye Chan, the popular guy.

1253
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,520
- Ye Chan has so many charms.
- Right?

1254
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,460
He has so many charms.

1255
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,590
- Isn't he?
- Yes.

1256
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,630
Thank you for rooting for us.

1257
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,660
We love you!

1258
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,570
Thanks to Coach Lee Tae Hyun
for teaching us the techniques.

1259
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,740
(Thumbs up)

1260
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,470
The final winner...

1261
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,610
- Thank you.
- of the men's group ssireum...

1262
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,410
- Thank you.
- is 82MAJOR.

1263
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,280
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1264
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,610
82MAJOR!

1265
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,810
(Shooting)

1266
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,520
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

1267
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,150
The upcoming event is pistol shooting.

1268
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,820
(The women's pistol shooting event
is starting now.)

1269
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,860
(They are very nervous.)

1270
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,860
All right, we're now beginning...

1271
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,500
the women's group pistol shooting.

1272
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,200
- Here we go.
- Bang.

1273
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,700
How will the group pistol shooting
proceed?

1274
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,470
In the men's and women's group events,

1275
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,680
three members from each team will compete.

1276
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,780
Each player will shoot 5 shots,
for a total of 15 shots per team.

1277
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,280
According to International Shooting
Sport Federation regulations,

1278
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,220
each shot must be a single shot
and completed within 50 seconds.

1279
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,360
After the beep,
the 50-second countdown will start.

1280
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,790
(The perfect score is 10.9.)

1281
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,260
Like in archery,

1282
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,100
is the winner decided by the total score
in pistol shooting?

1283
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,430
Yes.
In the Idol Star Athletics Championships,

1284
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,340
this event will be scored based on points.

1285
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,910
The player who scores higher
will earn two points.

1286
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,780
If players tie down to the decimal points,

1287
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,650
The team with the higher total score
will win.

1288
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,520
The line-up is intense
right from the start.

1289
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,460
All the girl groups representing K-pop
are competing in pistol shooting.

1290
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,520
- You're right.
- Yes.

1291
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,190
- Commentator Kim.
- Yes?

1292
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,190
If there's something
we should watch for...

1293
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,530
in the women's group pistol shooting,
please tell us.

1294
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,700
Sure. Muscular strength
is actually very important in shooting.

1295
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,200
Compared to men,

1296
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,470
- women players have weaker arm muscles.
- Right.

1297
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,470
- If they hold the pistol for too long...
- Yes?

1298
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,240
while gripping it hard,

1299
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,680
- they'd miss the time to aim.
- I see.

1300
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,580
- So you should look out for...
- Yes?

1301
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,720
- short, bold shots.
- Right.

1302
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,520
That'll decide the winner.

1303
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,820
Will the queen of shooting be born today?

1304
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,190
Let's start the event.

1305
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,530
- Start.
- Let's go.

1306
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,230
I bet it'll be fun.

1307
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,260
Women's group pistol shooting semifinals.

1308
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,630
Here are the players.

1309
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,930
ILLIT versus Hearts2Hearts.

1310
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,070
Good. The women's group pistol shooting
semifinals have begun.

1311
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,410
The first match is between ILLIT
and Hearts2Hearts.

1312
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,640
Commentator Kim, was there a player
who stood out during practice?

1313
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,450
- Yes, JIWOO really stood out to me.
- I see.

1314
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,420
Posture is everything in shooting.

1315
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,250
Apparently, JIWOO did ballet
when she was young.

1316
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,690
That could be why,
but her posture was very stable.

1317
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,790
During practice,
she even scored 10.8 out of 10.9.

1318
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,830
That's amazing.

1319
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,060
All the members
of Hearts2Hearts participated...

1320
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,860
in their own preliminaries,

1321
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,300
and the most skilled were drafted.

1322
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,870
- They're very serious about it.
- Absolutely.

1323
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:04,310
I wonder how ILLIT's shooting skills are.

1324
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,240
In last year's group archery,

1325
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,440
ILLIT won the silver medal.

1326
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,350
With that experience and know-how,

1327
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:14,580
I believe they'll play a big role
in today's game.

1328
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,690
Yes. The pistol shooting event
is thrilling from the beginning.

1329
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,920
I'm Kim Chae Hyun of Kep1er,
in charge of the pistol shooting report.

1330
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,690
The first match of the pistol shooting
is about to begin.

1331
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,900
Let's meet the players right away.

1332
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,500
If you were to advance to the finals
and win the gold medal,

1333
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,640
what would be your winning pledge?

1334
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,780
If we were to advance to the finals
and win the gold medal,

1335
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,080
all the members of Hearts2Hearts
will do bungee jumping.

1336
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,020
Gosh, all the members will?

1337
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,550
Did the members agree to it?

1338
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,990
I'm not sure.

1339
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,920
All right. What would be...

1340
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,960
your winning pledge, ILLIT?

1341
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,890
If we win the gold medal,

1342
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,600
all the members will do an archery pose...

1343
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,930
in our next comeback...

1344
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,030
on "Show! Music Core."

1345
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,370
That was witty.

1346
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:11,010
Nice. I hope both teams get good results.

1347
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,010
Iroha of ILLIT
and JUUN of Hearts2Hearts...

1348
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,410
are the first shooters.

1349
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,520
After the beep,
please take 1 shot within 50 seconds.

1350
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,850
No pressure, Iroha.

1351
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,350
(The game begins.)

1352
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,590
It has begun.

1353
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:34,360
I bet shooting at the same time
must be a lot of pressure.

1354
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,960
- Yes, you're right.
- Right?

1355
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,000
- With the beep, you have to shoot...
- Yes?

1356
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,430
- at the same time as your opponent.
- Right.

1357
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,640
The players may feel the pressure...

1358
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,470
- From the time limit?
- Yes. Having to shoot...

1359
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,510
within 50 seconds...

1360
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,740
- may put pressure on them.
- Right.

1361
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,010
JUUN, 10.4.

1362
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,220
Iroha, 3.5.

1363
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,890
- Gosh.
- Nice.

1364
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,960
JUUN scored 10.4 on her 1st shot.

1365
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,190
(JUUN earned the first points.)

1366
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,230
- It's okay.
- Oh, dear.

1367
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,900
Scores from 10.4 to 10.9...

1368
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,930
are called X-ten. That's right.

1369
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,370
JUUN shot a 10.4 X-10.

1370
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,540
- Iroha.
- Come on.

1371
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,610
Turn your head a bit more.
Your hips should be in the center.

1372
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Good.

1373
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,180
Good luck, JUUN.

1374
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,980
(Continuing with the 2nd shot)

1375
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,120
They must be more nervous
as they're the first players...

1376
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,890
of the first shooting game.

1377
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,590
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1378
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,090
Their expressions are nice.

1379
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,560
Iroha, 7.6.

1380
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,300
- What just happened?
- JUUN, 6.3.

1381
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,870
- All right. Iroha scored 7.6,
- Good job!

1382
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,900
- Yes?
- while JUUN scored 6.3.

1383
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,070
Each group has two points now,
making it a tie.

1384
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,680
- A tie.
- Yes.

1385
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,550
- A tie with two points each.
- That's right.

1386
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,980
JUUN.

1387
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,680
Pull the trigger slowly.

1388
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,820
She said, "Pull the trigger slowly."

1389
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:07,460
(Continuing the game while giving advice
and keeping each other in check)

1390
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,730
(The 3rd shot)

1391
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,500
What do players think about
before shooting?

1392
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,360
It's best for players...

1393
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,270
to stop thinking about anything.

1394
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,940
- That's hard.
- It's the hardest thing to do.

1395
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,870
- That's right.
- It's hard.

1396
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,170
JUUN, nine.

1397
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,210
Iroha, 8.9.

1398
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,950
- Iroha got 8.9.
- Iroha shot 8.9.

1399
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,620
- JUUN got nine.
- Nine.

1400
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,980
With that,

1401
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,990
- JUUN earns two points again.
- Yes.

1402
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,890
JUUN currently has 4 points,
while Iroha has 2 points.

1403
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,560
- I see.
- Right.

1404
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,290
- JUUN is two points ahead of Iroha.
- Yes.

1405
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,270
This will be Iroha and JUUN's fourth shot.

1406
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,070
The look on their faces
as they concentrate is so cool.

1407
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,180
JUUN, 10.1.

1408
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,820
Iroha, 9.8.

1409
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,320
With JUUN shooting 10.1,

1410
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,360
she earned another two points.

1411
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,990
- You're so good at it.
- How are you so good?

1412
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,300
This is Iroha and JUUN's last shot.

1413
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,460
- The last shot?
- Yes.

1414
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,070
Since it's the last shot,
they must put in more effort.

1415
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,870
I doubt I could even breathe...

1416
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,270
- Exactly.
- if I were next to them.

1417
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,880
Both of them...

1418
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,950
- They've fired.
- What?

1419
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,080
- What happened? They don't look happy.
- They don't look happy.

1420
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,980
- Iroha's expression doesn't look good.
- Iroha, seven.

1421
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,150
- Yes, 7 and 4.2.
- JUUN, 4.2.

1422
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,120
JUUN has earned...

1423
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,660
six points first.

1424
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,360
JUUN has won the first game.

1425
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,490
- Yes.
- Good.

1426
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,700
All right. The result of the 1st game
is ILLIT earning 4 points...

1427
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,170
and Hearts2Hearts earning six points.

1428
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,400
The second shooters are up.

1429
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,570
(Wonhee of ILLIT
versus JIWOO of Hearts2Hearts)

1430
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,740
I can understand
why Commentator Kim said...

1431
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,150
- JIWOO's posture was nice.
- Same.

1432
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:11,950
- Different, isn't it?
- She's got a straight posture.

1433
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,920
- That's right.
- Her back is straight.

1434
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,620
(JIWOO of Hearts2Hearts
is standing straight.)

1435
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,490
JIWOO said she was confident in
shooting high points...

1436
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,490
as long as she doesn't get nervous.

1437
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,290
That's a comment full of confidence,
isn't it?

1438
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,360
Yes.

1439
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,560
- You'll make a good shot.
- "I can make a good shot."

1440
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,300
- That was what she said.
- Okay.

1441
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,730
Wonhee also has
outstanding athletic skills.

1442
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,740
Wonhee, 5.2.

1443
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,470
JIWOO, 8.8.

1444
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,410
Isn't 8.8 quite a high score?

1445
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,580
Yes, that's right.

1446
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,950
You can say it's the score
of an actual shooting athlete.

1447
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,350
Really?

1448
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,350
- The beep has gone.
- Yes.

1449
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,550
- The second shot.
- That's right.

1450
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,190
- After a deep breath.
- Yes.

1451
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,620
Here's Wonhee and JIWOO's second shot.

1452
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,230
Her hand is trembling.
JIWOO must be nervous.

1453
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,260
JIWOO, 8.1.

1454
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,700
JIWOO has fired.

1455
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,170
Wonhee, 9.7.

1456
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,340
- That's 9.7. That's a high score.
- That's 9.7.

1457
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,480
- She's getting the hang of it.
- I know, right?

1458
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,180
They've tied. Both earned two points each.

1459
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,180
Exactly.

1460
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,710
(The 3rd shot)

1461
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,180
The pistols must be heavy for them.

1462
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,350
Our players' hands are trembling a lot.

1463
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,190
- Right?
- Totally.

1464
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,260
All right.

1465
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,130
- Focus.
- Focus.

1466
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,730
- Focus.
- Slowly.

1467
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,360
- It's a high score.
- Wonhee, 9.3.

1468
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,360
Focus until the end.

1469
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,370
- She has fired.
- JIWOO, 10.4.

1470
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,700
- JIWOO scored 10.4.
- Yes.

1471
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,240
- An X-10.
- 10.4.

1472
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,370
- Nice.
- Amazing.

1473
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,170
Didn't you say the perfect score was 10.5?

1474
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,410
- It's out of 10.9.
- Then she shot 10.4...

1475
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,180
- out of 10.9.
- Yes.

1476
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,210
(Hearts2Hearts has shot X-ten twice.)

1477
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,280
- Both players are very good at it.
- I know, right?

1478
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,550
- It's a neck-and-neck match.
- It really is.

1479
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,790
(The game matters
down to the decimal points.)

1480
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,360
Even though the laser pistol
makes a click sound,

1481
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,990
is there no recoil?

1482
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,160
No, the pistol shoots air,

1483
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,160
- so it does have recoil.
- So there is one.

1484
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,530
- It's exactly the same as a real pistol,
- Yes.

1485
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,130
- just without a bullet.
- Exactly.

1486
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,600
JIWOO, 9.3.

1487
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,570
Wonhee, one.

1488
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,710
Wonhee must feel the pressure...

1489
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,350
as JIWOO is doing a great job.

1490
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:25,950
- Absolutely.
- Right?

1491
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,220
But I hope she doesn't.

1492
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,650
Life is always lonely.

1493
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,090
Walk your own path.

1494
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,190
I'll hit my target.
That's the mindset you should have.

1495
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,060
Of course.

1496
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,230
Wonhee and JIWOO. Is this their last shot?

1497
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,230
- Yes.
- Wonhee and JIWOO's.

1498
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,460
As this is a group event,

1499
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,530
the game doesn't end
until it's actually over.

1500
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,930
Don't give up until the end.
You can do it.

1501
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,500
- If they shoot with sincerity, you know?
- Yes.

1502
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,310
- They've fired.
- Yes.

1503
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,440
They look...

1504
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,640
- Wonhee, 3.8.
- Okay.

1505
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,210
- JIWOO, 7.7.
- Oh, yes. 7.7.

1506
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,080
Her shots made it within the target.

1507
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,920
- I'm dumbfounded.
- Her shots...

1508
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,650
- were excellent.
- Exactly.

1509
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,290
- Yes.
- Didn't the points widen...

1510
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,020
because of the second game?

1511
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,690
The points have widened quite a bit.

1512
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,130
ILLIT has six points,

1513
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,630
while Hearts2Hearts
is advancing with 14 points.

1514
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,700
- That's right.
- Yes.

1515
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,930
We will now proceed with...

1516
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,540
- IAN and Moka's game.
- Good luck, Moka!

1517
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,110
She can turn the tables around, yes?

1518
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,440
If Moka wins 4 out of the 5 shots,
they will tie.

1519
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,680
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1520
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,810
(Good luck, Moka!)

1521
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,550
All right, the last game will now begin.

1522
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,780
- I'm sure Moka of ILLIT...
- Yes?

1523
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,620
feels a lot of pressure in this game.

1524
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,150
- Exactly, since it's a team game.
- Right?

1525
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,260
My mistake becomes the team's mistake.

1526
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,560
- Yes.
- Okay.

1527
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,560
Both of their postures show
they've practiced a lot.

1528
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,600
I agree.

1529
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,560
IAN has taken her shot.

1530
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,500
IAN, ten.

1531
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,030
- ILLIT.
- Right.

1532
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,140
- Moka.
- Moka.

1533
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,370
(What did...)

1534
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,940
(Moka of ILLIT score?)

1535
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,840
- Moka, 6.7.
- Moka.

1536
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,410
- Hearts2Hearts advances to the finals.
- Yes.

1537
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,520
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1538
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,080
They should celebrate
only for a short while...

1539
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,790
and prepare for the next game.

1540
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,360
Women's group pistol shooting.

1541
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,460
The second game is
between STAYC and MEOVV.

1542
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,170
It's a big match between
a veteran and a rookie group.

1543
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,230
- It's a big match.
- Indeed.

1544
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,870
STAYC, having debuted six years ago,

1545
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,940
- has solid skills and great teamwork.
- Yes.

1546
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,540
MEOVV, having debuted last year,

1547
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,440
has been the center of attention
with its striking performances.

1548
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,910
- That's right.
- MEOVV.

1549
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,280
When the two teams practiced,
I heard they gave it their all.

1550
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,820
How were they in the training ground,
Commentator Kim?

1551
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:47,560
Right. Possibly because
they played archery last year,

1552
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,590
STAYC had extraordinary breath control
and concentration.

1553
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:55,200
Their chemistry from the long years
of teamwork really stood out.

1554
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,330
MEOVV had great passion,

1555
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:00,230
to the point that they asked to practice
until the last day before the show.

1556
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:03,570
The ace player, as claimed by the coaches,
is GAWON.

1557
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,970
- GAWON?
- Yes.

1558
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,440
She had such great posture
and records that...

1559
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,610
the coaches wondered
if she had done shooting before.

1560
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,780
I see. That's nice.

1561
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,980
Isa of STAYC...

1562
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,520
and GAWON of MEOVV...

1563
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,420
- Yes?
- are the first shooters.

1564
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,190
- She's GAWON, the shooter you mentioned.
- Take your position.

1565
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,890
- Is that right, Commentator Cho?
- Yes.

1566
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,190
- The ace.
- Yes.

1567
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,560
- The coaches selected GAWON...
- Yes.

1568
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,500
- That's right.
- as the ace of the team.

1569
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,800
MEOVV has assigned the ace
as the first shooter...

1570
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,230
- to seize the momentum.
- Good luck!

1571
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,470
- That must be their strategy.
- Yes.

1572
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,870
- It doesn't sound like a bad strategy.
- All right.

1573
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:36,900
No, it's not.

1574
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,270
- Here they go.
- All right.

1575
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,540
(Each of them has a different eye closed.)

1576
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,210
- It's a tense moment.
- I see it's fine for them...

1577
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,850
to close different eyes.

1578
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:47,920
- That's right.
- Sure.

1579
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,150
- Our dominant eyes could be different.
- It's their dominant eye.

1580
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,250
- Isa, 6.8.
- It's the other eye for her.

1581
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,560
GAWON, 7.5.

1582
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,790
GAWON's definitely a top shooter for sure.

1583
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,060
- Like that, GAWON takes two points.
- Of course.

1584
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,160
- Right.
- That's right.

1585
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,630
(I've got this!)

1586
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,430
(You got this!)

1587
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,910
GAWON's ready again.

1588
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,740
- Isa, 4.6.
- Isa fires 1st this time.

1589
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,380
- GAWON, 7.4.
- She's steady as ever.

1590
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,180
- Nice.
- GAWON's quite skilled.

1591
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,520
- GAWON ended her turn on a strong note.
- Yes.

1592
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,220
What's impressive about GAWON is that...

1593
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,560
- she's been getting even scores.
- Yes.

1594
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,360
- That's important in a team event.
- True.

1595
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,660
- The beep must make them nervous too.
- It does.

1596
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,770
- Absolutely.
- I know, right?

1597
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,500
You have to fire in that time.

1598
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,500
How will Isa do?

1599
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:43,440
She should stay patient...

1600
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,010
- Of course.
- rather than feel anxious.

1601
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,210
- It's important to stay composed.
- Right.

1602
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,310
- Isa, 4.9.
- Isa fired her shot.

1603
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,310
- Did GAWON make her shot?
- How did GAWON do?

1604
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,220
- She hasn't fired yet.
- She's yet to fire her shot.

1605
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,320
- She hasn't fired yet, right?
- No.

1606
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,220
- She must stay calm.
- She has 27 seconds left.

1607
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,860
- She's using the time she has.
- She's even managing her time.

1608
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,660
- She knows what she's doing.
- GAWON, 8.3.

1609
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,660
She's like a professional.

1610
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,790
- She's still in the lead.
- Even though she had to rest her gun,

1611
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,960
she didn't get flustered
and managed to shoot...

1612
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,830
- a high score of 8.3.
- That's right.

1613
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:15,070
She even knows how to utilize
the time she has.

1614
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,400
That's impressive.

1615
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,570
She's tying her hair.

1616
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:20,210
It seems as though GAWON's ready...

1617
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:22,010
- to play for real.
- I love it.

1618
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,250
- She's ready to play.
- She's warning her opponents.

1619
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,250
Exactly.

1620
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,280
- She's done with her practice rounds.
- It's time she shot a ten.

1621
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,850
I can't wait.

1622
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,790
The two have been showcasing
a competitive game.

1623
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,590
They both made their shots.

1624
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,860
- Isa, 3.4.
- Yes.

1625
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,000
- GAWON, 8.1.
- That's 8.1.

1626
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,370
Her shots have been consistent,

1627
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:50,140
all landing in that inner circle.

1628
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,710
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

1629
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:52,870
Just like now.

1630
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,840
(Will it end in a perfect game?)

1631
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,480
Doesn't GAWON seem relaxed?

1632
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,950
- See her expression.
- I know.

1633
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,380
She's staying calm.

1634
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,220
- All right.
- Yes.

1635
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,860
- GAWON, 9.4.
- Isa is staying calm as well.

1636
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,990
- Isa, 7.8.
- She's doing well.

1637
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,460
GAWON takes two more points,

1638
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,670
creating a ten-point gap...

1639
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,000
between MEOVV and STAYC.

1640
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,700
GAWON of MEOVV stayed steady
through every round.

1641
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,310
- The second shooters...
- All right.

1642
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,740
- are taking their places.
- Yes.

1643
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,480
- We'll start the second match.
- Yes.

1644
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,680
- I mean...
- Did you see that just now?

1645
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,810
- I did.
- Did you see that?

1646
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:34,250
They are lining themselves up
with the target.

1647
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,980
- Both shooters are doing that.
- I see they've trained.

1648
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,090
That's right.

1649
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,350
Go, J!

1650
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,560
(We believe in you, J.)

1651
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:42,790
All right.

1652
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,730
(STAYC is backed into a corner.)

1653
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,130
Look at her focus. I'm nervous.

1654
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,560
Wait, her arm is trembling.

1655
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,530
(Shaking)

1656
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,670
Meanwhile, NARIN...

1657
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,640
How's her pose?

1658
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,710
NARIN has more stable control of her gun.

1659
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,680
- That's right.
- J, 4.7

1660
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,720
It shows.

1661
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,320
- NARIN, 8.9.
- NARIN scores 8.9.

1662
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:14,320
(MEOVV widens the lead even more.)

1663
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,360
(The 2nd shot)

1664
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,890
Let's see how they do.

1665
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,530
She's raised her gun.

1666
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,700
They're both aiming.

1667
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,300
NARIN raised her gun quickly.

1668
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,500
- J, 9.1.
- NARIN, go ahead and shoot.

1669
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,440
- She doesn't seem flustered.
- J ended her shot...

1670
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,270
- smoothly.
- NARIN, 8.4.

1671
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,610
They're now tied in points.

1672
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,480
That's right. It's 2 to 2.

1673
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,010
- Two to two.
- They're now tied.

1674
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,710
J and NARIN compete.

1675
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,880
That's right.

1676
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,820
(Will this change the flow of the match?)

1677
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,960
(The 3rd shot)

1678
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,660
J, seven.

1679
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,270
NARIN, seven.

1680
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,470
Would you look at that? Both shooters...

1681
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,440
Since they both shot a seven,

1682
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,710
they'll each gain one point.

1683
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:12,050
(The shot that'll change the flow
of the game)

1684
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,720
- Fifty seconds seems short.
- It is.

1685
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,150
Still, the shooters have been utilizing
their time well.

1686
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,620
Right, and that's important.

1687
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,490
J, zero.

1688
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,030
NARIN, 7.7.

1689
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,900
A score of zero?

1690
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,870
- Oh, dear.
- Earlier,

1691
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:34,140
she was very disappointed
after she made the shot.

1692
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,800
It turns out she shot a zero.

1693
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,240
That's too bad.

1694
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,440
Currently, STAYC has 3 points
while MEOVV has 15.

1695
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,680
- Right.
- MEOVV will advance to the finals...

1696
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,110
if she scores one more point.

1697
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:49,120
(Everything depends on this next shot.)

1698
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,890
I hope they'll try their best...

1699
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,490
- until the very end.
- Exactly.

1700
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,890
- That's the true spirit of sports.
- Absolutely.

1701
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,630
- J, 7.1.
- She made her shot.

1702
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,360
NARIN, 8.7.

1703
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,800
(Final score, STAYC:3, MEOVV: 17)

1704
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,800
MEOVV advances to the finals.

1705
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,640
Yes, congratulations.

1706
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:15,540
The women's group pistol shooting finals
will now begin.

1707
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,880
Hearts2Hearts versus MEOVV.

1708
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,780
All that's left is the finals.

1709
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,350
The crowd is even more enthusiastic...

1710
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,990
as this is
the first pistol shooting finals.

1711
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,960
Which group do you think will win?

1712
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,590
Jonathan, where do you stand?

1713
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,990
As for me...

1714
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,560
Well, there's this Korean saying.

1715
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:33,860
Even if you are in a lion's den...

1716
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,960
- You just need to stay...
- Alert.

1717
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,000
- Right.
- By staying calm,

1718
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,400
- Yes.
- you can accomplish anything.

1719
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,040
- Which group is calmer?
- Exactly.

1720
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,510
MEOVV is definitely more composed.

1721
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:48,280
I believe the members' composure
strongly shines through.

1722
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:51,080
I think differently
and believe that Hearts2Hearts will win.

1723
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,150
- I see.
- If I compare their styles of play,

1724
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,320
Hearts2Hearts seems more aggressive.

1725
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,290
- Right.
- We enter the first round.

1726
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,560
- JUUN and GAWON will compete.
- Yes.

1727
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,160
Once again, both groups sent out
their best shooters first.

1728
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,330
That's right.

1729
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,000
(The first shot that could set the tone)

1730
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,560
Keep calm.

1731
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,970
(Who will win the first round?)

1732
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:14,240
Just watching this makes me nervous.

1733
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,870
(Who will win the first round?)

1734
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,970
- GAWON gets ready.
- GAWON remains the same.

1735
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:19,970
That's right.

1736
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,980
- She always stays composed.
- How can she be that consistent?

1737
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,280
- There you go. GAWON made her shot.
- Yes.

1738
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:25,950
Keep calm.

1739
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,550
- And JUUN?
- She remained calm as well.

1740
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,980
- I think she did well.
- It looks promising.

1741
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,950
- Oh, dear.
- JUUN, 2.9.

1742
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,220
GAWON, 8.7.

1743
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,390
GAWON opens the game by taking two points.

1744
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,690
- She takes the round.
- She shot an 8.7.

1745
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,200
(GAWON of MEOVV takes an early lead.)

1746
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,870
From the moment GAWON lifts her pistol
to the moment she fires and lowers it,

1747
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:52,170
- she maintains a consistent flow.
- That's right.

1748
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:55,510
Her smooth flow is
resulting in accurate shots.

1749
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,350
JUUN, 6.6.

1750
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,780
GAWON, 7.7.

1751
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,690
- The pressure's gotten to her.
- To JUUN?

1752
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:06,820
She needs to regain her mental focus...

1753
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,690
- Yes, she needs to collect herself.
- and stay calm.

1754
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,560
- Absolutely.
- After firing that first shot,

1755
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,390
she might have lost
her composure a little.

1756
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,930
(Can the nervous JUUN
regain her composure?)

1757
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,660
In my view,

1758
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,830
while momentum is important in shooting,

1759
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:21,400
each shot should be taken...

1760
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,940
as if it's the only one that counts.

1761
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:29,780
- Again, she didn't fire.
- GAWON takes a break.

1762
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,710
JUUN, 10.2.

1763
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,780
- She knows how to use her time.
- Absolutely.

1764
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,550
GAWON's confidence shows
in her expressions.

1765
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,020
Managing your time well
is the same as being relaxed.

1766
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,090
- That's right.
- Right.

1767
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,860
- She fires.
- She knows...

1768
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,860
- how much time she has.
- GAWON, 9.4.

1769
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:50,530
JUUN takes 2 points
by scoring a 10.2 this round.

1770
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:53,000
What you're seeing
is strong mental strength.

1771
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,440
(The game comes down to
who is mentally stronger.)

1772
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,400
They're now on their fourth shot.
Here we go.

1773
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,770
I find myself holding my breath.

1774
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:03,440
I've also been holding my breath
while watching them compete.

1775
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,010
They both fired.

1776
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,310
JUUN, 5.1.

1777
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,950
GAWON, 8.6.

1778
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,120
Unbelievable.

1779
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,690
She shot her 4th shot,
but we can only see 3 holes.

1780
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:16,160
That means the shot hit
one of her previous shots.

1781
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,220
That's right.

1782
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,590
- That's the smile of a winner.
- I'm so impressed.

1783
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,690
This is incredible.

1784
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,500
- I've...
- They'll now fire their last rounds.

1785
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,700
- Yes.
- That's right.

1786
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,430
Go, JUUN!

1787
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,200
Focus until the end.

1788
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,170
They're doing great.

1789
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,110
Go, JUUN.

1790
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,840
Please focus.

1791
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,880
All right.

1792
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,620
JUUN, eight.

1793
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,420
- GAWON, 9.4
- Nice.

1794
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,790
- All right.
- Gosh. This means...

1795
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:55,860
MEOVV takes 8 points
while Hearts2Hearts takes 2.

1796
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:59,170
- Yes.
- MEOVV wins the first match.

1797
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,700
The second match...

1798
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,270
is between JIWOO and NARIN.

1799
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,210
Girls, don't be nervous...

1800
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,410
and just do it the way you always do.

1801
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,310
(NARIN, you got this!)

1802
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,410
It's their first shot.

1803
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,850
Center align.

1804
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:20,120
- JIWOO's posture is...
- It's great.

1805
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,560
She has the textbook posture.

1806
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,890
JIWOO, 9.2.

1807
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,190
- NARIN, 7.5.
- JIWOO.

1808
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,560
- JIWOO is definitely good.
- Yes.

1809
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,000
- JIWOO is good.
- Yes.

1810
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,630
If Hearts2Hearts earns many points here,

1811
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,500
- they might catch up.
- Absolutely.

1812
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,340
- They could turn the tables.
- They could turn the tables.

1813
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,040
It's not over until it's over.

1814
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,480
- It's their second shot. Let's go.
- Yes.

1815
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,640
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1816
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,150
(The 2nd shot)

1817
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,860
- JIWOO, 8.6.
- That was nice. JIWOO.

1818
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,870
- NARIN, 8.6.
- Yes.

1819
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,430
- Both got 8.6.
- Yes.

1820
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,440
It's so...

1821
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,870
- Yes.
- It's their third shots.

1822
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,010
(The two aces have met their matches.)

1823
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,350
- They shot at the same time.
- Yes.

1824
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,920
JIWOO, 8.1.

1825
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,760
NARIN, 8.5.

1826
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:31,960
(It's a neck-and-neck battle,
decided by the slightest margin.)

1827
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,000
- It's a neck-and-neck match.
- This is a close game.

1828
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,600
What are the scores now?

1829
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,400
Currently, Hearts2Hearts got 5 points,

1830
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,200
- while MEOVV leads with 11.
- Okay.

1831
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,240
Let's watch their next shot.

1832
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,570
(This could change
the result of the game.)

1833
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,920
Their hands must be shaking.

1834
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,950
Yes.

1835
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,720
Even so, they must...

1836
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,890
JIWOO, 5.7.

1837
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,860
- She looked disappointed after shooting.
- NARIN, 7.9.

1838
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,160
JIWOO...

1839
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:06,960
- slipped up for a moment.
- Yes.

1840
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,030
But she did well.

1841
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,530
It's their last shots. Let's do it.

1842
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,230
(Will JIWOO be able to redeem
her mistake?)

1843
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:17,400
Close your eye and keep calm.

1844
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,510
NARIN, five.

1845
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,120
- JIWOO, 8.1.
- It was good.

1846
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,390
(JIWOO earns 2 points.)

1847
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,190
- NARIN...
- This...

1848
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,190
- is getting interesting.
- Right.

1849
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,990
If Hearts2Hearts wants to beat MEOVV,

1850
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:40,590
- they'll need to dominate...
- That's right.

1851
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,400
- in the final match.
- Yes.

1852
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,730
Currently,

1853
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,170
Hearts2Hearts got 7 points,
and MEOVV got 13 points.

1854
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,400
- There's only a six-point difference.
- Yes.

1855
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:51,740
This gap is still small enough
to turn around.

1856
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:55,080
The last players are IAN and ANNA.

1857
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,080
"IANNA."

1858
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,980
It sounds like a name. "IANNA."

1859
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,250
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1860
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,620
They have 50 seconds.

1861
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,050
- She fired.
- That was quick.

1862
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,290
- That was a quick shot.
- Yes.

1863
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,490
She shot carefully.

1864
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,430
- All right.
- ANNA, 8.5.

1865
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:17,100
- This is unbelievable.
- IAN, 8.8.

1866
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,170
IAN scores 8.8.

1867
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,770
- ANNA scores 8.5.
- Yes.

1868
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,300
If IAN stays focused and shoots well,

1869
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,240
- she can still turn this around.
- That's right.

1870
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,480
It's their second shot. Let's go.

1871
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,310
(A tight match
with just a 4-point difference)

1872
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,780
- Only 4 points away from catching up.
- Only 4 points?

1873
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,250
- Yes. 4 points away from catching up.
- Only 4 points.

1874
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,550
Oh, my goodness.

1875
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:42,760
This is a close game.

1876
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,060
That was fast.

1877
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,160
- I really want to know the result.
- Shot fired.

1878
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,060
- ANNA, 6.7.
- All right.

1879
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,700
- Now...
- IAN, 9.4.

1880
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,430
- Hearts2Hearts.
- Yes.

1881
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,340
Only two points away from catching up.

1882
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,400
- Yes.
- Hearts2Hearts.

1883
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,510
It must feel like...

1884
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,710
- someone is right on their heels.
- Yes.

1885
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,140
- She's catching up.
- Yes.

1886
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,740
It's their third shot. Let's go.

1887
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:08,220
(This 3rd shot could even the score.)

1888
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:09,650
The more you lead,

1889
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,780
- You have to keep your cool.
- the calmer you need to be.

1890
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,320
This is exactly
when you have to stay calm.

1891
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,820
I think this is the beauty
of a team event.

1892
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,920
That's right.

1893
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,530
- IAN, 5.1.
- IAN, why did she smile?

1894
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,530
- Her gun was shaking a lot.
- I see.

1895
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,830
(Let's see.)

1896
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,500
ANNA, nine.

1897
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,470
(Disappointed)

1898
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,140
- The gap has widened...
- Now...

1899
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,710
- by another two points.
- Yes.

1900
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,440
- It's a four-point difference now.
- Yes.

1901
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,310
- It's so...
- IAN needs to outscore her opponent...

1902
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:40,280
- with both of her remaining shots.
- This match is so interesting.

1903
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,550
- It's their 4th shot.
- It's their 4th shot.

1904
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,150
Let's go.

1905
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:54,430
All right.

1906
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,870
She kept calm.

1907
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,640
It's their second match,
so they must be tired.

1908
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,640
ANNA, 3.9.

1909
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,710
Her face...

1910
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,080
- Her facial expression...
- It's hard to read.

1911
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,410
That's the look of a professional.

1912
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,010
What does it mean?

1913
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,180
IAN,

1914
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,280
miss.

1915
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,550
(IAN gets 0 points.)

1916
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:16,820
- It's a miss.
- She missed the target.

1917
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,190
- People sometimes miss the target, right?
- Yes.

1918
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,660
Her trigger...

1919
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,590
and follow-through looked clean.

1920
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:26,190
- So I expected a good score.
- Yes.

1921
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,430
She must be a bit disappointed...

1922
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,700
at the result.

1923
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,160
She might think
she could've done it better.

1924
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,770
(IAN made a terrible mistake.)

1925
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,270
(Final score,
Hearts2Hearts: 11, MEOVV: 17)

1926
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,000
- Then...
- So...

1927
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Now...

1928
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,670
For the first time
in Idol Star Athletics Championships,

1929
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,940
MEOVV earned the title
of "The Queen of Shooting."

1930
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,210
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1931
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:47,210
(MEOVV wins the gold medal.)

1932
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,880
(The 1st place's signature song ceremony)

1933
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,350
Where's the camera?

1934
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,950
It's our first time
in Idol Star Athletics Championships.

1935
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:26,090
I'm so happy to win the gold medal.

1936
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:29,520
PAWMPAWM,
I was touched by their loud cheers today.

1937
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,330
Ella, SOOIN,

1938
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,330
thank you for the loud cheers.

1939
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,930
Thank you.

1940
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,300
(Happy)

1941
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,030
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

1942
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,940
- This is the highlight...
- Yes.

1943
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,070
- of Idol Star Athletics Championships.
- Yes.

1944
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:45,770
It's dancesport.

1945
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,870
(Cheering)

1946
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,440
It's going to be the talk of the town.

1947
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,540
Ratings will skyrocket,
and views will explode.

1948
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,450
- And they could become...
- Yes.

1949
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,450
overnight sensations.

1950
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:55,520
- That's right.
- Yes.

1951
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,350
- Let me introduce the commentator.
- Yes.

1952
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,220
Gold medalist
at the 2005 East Asian Games in Macau.

1953
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,690
The legend of Korean dancesport,

1954
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,060
Commentator Jay Park.

1955
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,430
Hello, everyone.

1956
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,500
Isn't this event special to you, Eun Ji?

1957
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,270
- I used to be a dancesport athlete.
- Yes.

1958
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,170
- I debuted as a dancer.
- Right.

1959
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,310
That's why today is very meaningful.

1960
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,080
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1961
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,140
Seven teams are competing this time,

1962
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,050
and you can look forward to it.

1963
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,780
- From what you just said,
- Yes.

1964
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,720
it sounds like they've prepared
incredible performances.

1965
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,820
Yes. For a month, the seven athletes...

1966
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,720
practiced for 156 hours in total.

1967
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,290
(Surprised)

1968
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:39,460
- They practiced for 156 hours?
- I think...

1969
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,330
they actually practiced
even more than that.

1970
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,530
- The choreography is full of variety,
- Oh, my.

1971
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:48,140
and they've practiced a lot
for the performance.

1972
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,000
You can look forward to it.

1973
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,510
What are the criteria?

1974
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:55,280
The final score
is the average from three judges.

1975
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,740
The evaluation criteria
include partnership,

1976
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,850
stage composition,
technique, this is important,

1977
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,310
accuracy,

1978
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,580
and proficiency.

1979
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,080
Six points each, 30 points in total.

1980
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,150
This event follows...

1981
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,950
- a "King of the Hill" format.
- Yes.

1982
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,990
- Each competitor takes the stage 1 by 1,
- Yes.

1983
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,390
and after their performance,
they check the judges' scores...

1984
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:13,690
- in the Kiss and Cry Zone.
- Yes.

1985
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,960
The one with the higher score...

1986
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,700
- takes the throne.
- That's right.

1987
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,770
- They dethrone the previous winner.
- They'll dethrone them.

1988
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,700
- "Dethrone."
- That's the format.

1989
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,870
The last person on the throne...

1990
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:27,140
- will win the gold medal.
- Yes.

1991
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,440
The 2025 Idol Star
Athletics Championships, Chuseok Special.

1992
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,450
We'll now begin the first match
of the dancesport event.

1993
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,250
(Cheering)

1994
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,820
Let's go.

1995
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,760
Here comes the first player in dancesport.

1996
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,490
XIAOTING from Kep1er.

1997
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,590
(XIAOTING of Kep1er, Partner: Nam Gi Yong)

1998
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:48,660
- Here comes the first player.
- Yes.

1999
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,400
XIAOTING of Kep1er.

2000
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,800
- XIAOTING.
- XIAOTING of Kep1er.

2001
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:56,540
She's the 2022 gold medalist,

2002
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,240
- isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

2003
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,040
- The champion came out first.
- Yes.

2004
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,480
She's a professional dancesport athlete...

2005
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,250
who competed in the Standard category
for five years.

2006
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:10,750
In 2022, she received an impressive score
of 29.2 out of 30.

2007
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,120
A record that no one has broken...

2008
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,490
- to this day.
- Yes.

2009
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:16,660
She's the official dancing queen...

2010
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,090
- of Idol Star Athletics Championships.
- Right.

2011
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:19,290
The one who beats her...

2012
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,460
- will become the winner.
- Yes.

2013
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,960
Hold on.
What's the theme of her performance?

2014
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,870
- Inspired by the movie "James Bond,"
- Oh, my gosh.

2015
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,540
the theme is the romance
of a secret agent.

2016
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,610
Oh, my. That sounds dangerous.

2017
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:33,870
She chose the music herself.

2018
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:34,940
- She did?
- She came up with the story,

2019
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,310
prepared the costume, and even the props.

2020
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:40,980
We'll now watch the first performance
from XIAOTING of Kep1er.

2021
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:41,980
All right.

2022
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:45,620
(XIAOTING of Kep1er: Paso Doble and Rumba)

2023
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,590
- She's an actor.
- Yes.

2024
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,420
The music gives the feeling
of a secret agent...

2025
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,730
finishing his mission
and leaving the scene.

2026
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:56,260
Do you see her eyes?
They are so expressive.

2027
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,770
The theme is perfect.

2028
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:03,840
She first hid herself.

2029
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,670
She acted like she was going to shoot
while hiding.

2030
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,010
She points the gun at him, but...

2031
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:10,940
Let's see.

2032
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,490
It's a twist turn.

2033
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:26,960
(Twist turn:
a movement where the female dancer...)

2034
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,800
(walks around her partner
in coordination with his rotation)

2035
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,700
Here comes the lift.

2036
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,430
It requires the female dancer
to be held in the air for two seconds.

2037
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,800
They're in the hold position now.

2038
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,250
Beautiful.

2039
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,680
The techniques are evaluated as well.

2040
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,750
Right.

2041
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,220
She starts her follow.

2042
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,390
A twist turn.

2043
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:57,220
- He goes into a leap. Very nice.
- Oh, gosh.

2044
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,330
Good timing. And now, the drop.

2045
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,730
(Impressed)

2046
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:03,400
(That was amazing.)

2047
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,300
Good timing. And now, the drop.

2048
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,400
- That was clean.
- Oh, my.

2049
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:14,410
She brings in her expression here.

2050
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,140
XIAOTING is into the emotion.

2051
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,780
The rumba begins to play.

2052
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,810
Yes.

2053
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,980
She's holding her breath.

2054
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,150
Now in the hold.

2055
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,220
She's so good.

2056
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,660
This move requires strong support
from the male dancer.

2057
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,130
Okay. Hip swivels.

2058
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,600
- I love how she expresses the emotion.
- Yes.

2059
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,740
Speaking of technique,

2060
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,840
you can tell
she's put a lot of work into it.

2061
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,810
Yes. I can feel it.

2062
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,780
Compared to K-pop choreography,

2063
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,980
- the strength and energy...
- Yes.

2064
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,780
- are completely different.
- Yes. They're different.

2065
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:55,050
- A ronde.
- Yes.

2066
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,220
In the hold position
where they're holding hands like that,

2067
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,620
the way the female dancer follows her
partner's lead shows her level of skill.

2068
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,790
- That's right.
- Yes.

2069
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,190
- She looks calm.
- Sliding doors.

2070
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,860
- Hip action.
- They have great partnership.

2071
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,600
- Great hip action.
- Yes.

2072
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,600
She's calm.

2073
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,770
It's coming to an end.

2074
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,180
If she keeps this up until the end,

2075
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:25,280
she's bound to earn a very high score.

2076
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,220
The ending suits the theme.

2077
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,420
This rumba truly captures
the pain of love.

2078
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,420
(She owns the stage and finishes
her performance successfully.)

2079
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,420
- I love how she expressed the emotion.
- Yes.

2080
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,990
It was wonderful.

2081
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,830
- Bravo.
- Bravo!

2082
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,660
- I knew it.
- It was nice.

2083
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,030
- It's just as expected.
- I don't even know...

2084
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:47,500
- the concept of dancesport.
- Okay.

2085
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,970
But I really enjoyed this movie.

2086
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:51,500
- Was it like a movie?
- Yes. I enjoyed this movie.

2087
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:52,970
- It did feel like a movie.
- Right.

2088
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,410
- She's indeed...
- It was like a movie.

2089
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,210
the dancing queen
of Idol Star Athletics Championships.

2090
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,240
XIAOTING.

2091
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,950
The video of her gold medal performance
in 2022...

2092
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,380
- hit over 9 million views.
- Right.

2093
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:04,580
- Over 9 million views?
- That's right.

2094
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,690
She's already acknowledged
as the best dancer in dancesport.

2095
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,220
(XIAOTING, you're the best.)

2096
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,990
- A lift.
- A lift.

2097
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,460
So light.

2098
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,630
They're in the hold position again.

2099
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,760
- Another kick action.
- Yes.

2100
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,930
This drop is very difficult.

2101
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:21,940
- Yes.
- What if he misses her?

2102
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,240
- I know.
- That would be dangerous.

2103
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,240
Yes.

2104
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,610
She performed each technique...

2105
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,510
- with such natural expression...
- That's right.

2106
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:29,940
that it never felt like
she was just completing a task.

2107
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,410
- Right.
- It flew naturally with the performance.

2108
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,480
I agree.

2109
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,680
They had amazing teamwork.

2110
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,850
- They're waiting for their scores.
- Yes.

2111
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,450
What scores will they get?

2112
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:41,650
They're waiting for the judges' scores.

2113
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,290
I'm expecting high scores.

2114
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,660
Let's see what scores they get.

2115
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,560
They were the first performers,
so they must've been nervous.

2116
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,000
- They earned 26.5 points.
- It's 26.5 points.

2117
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,300
They earned 26.5 points.

2118
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:56,600
They still take 1st place.
They're currently in 1st place.

2119
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:57,940
- Yes.
- Oh, my.

2120
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,110
- It's a high score.
- It's a high score.

2121
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,210
- It's high.
- Yes.

2122
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:03,040
She got 29.2 points in 2022,

2123
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,540
- which is incredible,
- Yes.

2124
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,250
- but this is also high.
- Of course.

2125
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,850
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

2126
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,020
- It's very high.
- It's a high score...

2127
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,150
- that will make the next dancers nervous.
- Yes.

2128
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,320
- It has just begun.
- Yes.

2129
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,590
Who is the second dancer...

2130
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,690
to challenge her?

2131
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:21,360
Here comes the second player
in dancesport.

2132
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,730
E.JI of ICHILLIN'.

2133
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:25,930
The second competitor
is E.JI of ICHILLIN'.

2134
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,370
The costumes and performances...

2135
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:29,840
- are part of the fun.
- Yes.

2136
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,810
- Oh, my.
- It feels different from earlier.

2137
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,340
- Yes.
- It's very different.

2138
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,980
She's in pure white.

2139
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:39,750
She's going to transform
into a charming vampire.

2140
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,680
- Oh, gosh.
- Like XIAOTING's performance earlier,

2141
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,050
her stage also has a clear story...

2142
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,420
- and theme.
- Okay.

2143
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,290
But there's a chilling twist coming,
so stay tuned.

2144
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,290
All right.

2145
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:50,420
Competing against XIAOTING...

2146
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,060
- requires a high level of skill.
- Yes.

2147
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,860
She's well-trained in dance.

2148
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,060
Yes. She studied contemporary dance
in high school...

2149
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,730
- for three years.
- My gosh.

2150
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,500
She majored in contemporary dance,

2151
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,570
so pay attention to how she expresses
her technique, which is her strength.

2152
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:04,640
- Yes.
- Oh, my.

2153
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:08,680
We'll now watch the second performance
from E.JI of ICHILLIN'.

2154
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:16,280
I love her facial expression.

2155
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,380
- She's a vampire.
- A lonely one.

2156
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,450
Their theme is a curious vampire
approachinf E.JI.

2157
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:25,160
Yes.

2158
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,930
I don't see
any contemporary dance moves yet.

2159
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:31,660
She just looks like a dancesport athlete.

2160
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,470
This is unexpected.

2161
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,200
- Yes.
- She has great technique.

2162
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,570
Perfect timing. Nice.

2163
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,810
- Yes.
- She's doing great.

2164
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,150
They're showing great teamwork!

2165
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,150
(Surprised)

2166
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,490
(High-level technique you'd expect
from a contemporary dance major)

2167
01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:00,060
- The lift was nice and clear.
- Oh, gosh.

2168
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,860
That's a leap in paso doble style.

2169
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,210
(The moment she turns into a vampire)

2170
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:13,670
She was bitten by a vampire.

2171
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,480
(Her outfit change
completely shifts the mood.)

2172
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,510
The mood changes.

2173
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,710
Now we move on to the jive.

2174
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,180
The outfit change was so clean.

2175
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,220
Yes.

2176
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:32,230
It's the retro jive music.

2177
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,830
- Yes.
- That's a kick ball change.

2178
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,460
- They're dancing side by side.
- Oh, my.

2179
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,100
Just look at that chemistry.

2180
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,600
Nice.

2181
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,000
- I love her facial expression.
- She's an excellent jive dancer.

2182
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,110
- Gosh.
- That's a sugar push.

2183
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,110
(Sugar push:
a step where the female dancer...)

2184
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:50,110
(moves toward her partner
as if being gently pushed.)

2185
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:55,880
- How can she look so relaxed?
- That's a pivot.

2186
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,350
She looks so calm.

2187
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:00,120
I love their eye contact.

2188
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,450
She's following his lead so well.

2189
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,460
- She's doing amazing.
- Yes.

2190
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,190
Look at how relaxed she is.

2191
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,190
As expected, she's very flexible.

2192
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,930
She's extremely flexible...

2193
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,330
as she majored in contemporary dance.

2194
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,000
Side by side.

2195
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,240
When the male and female dancers
stand next to each other...

2196
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,540
doing the same moves,
it's called "side by side."

2197
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,810
I can tell they practiced a lot.

2198
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,420
A kick up.

2199
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:35,390
A round kick.

2200
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,390
Lastly...

2201
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,400
It's beautiful.

2202
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,830
She's into the emotion until the end.

2203
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,640
It was a nice theme. I loved it.

2204
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,240
She's holding his heart in her hand.

2205
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,280
- Yes. She pulled his heart out.
- She pulled it out.

2206
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,480
She started as an estrogen girl...

2207
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,080
- and finished as a testosterone girl.
- That's right.

2208
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,980
Why do they always kill the man, though?

2209
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,880
Shooting the man,
pulling the guy's heart out.

2210
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,750
- Two men died.
- Two men died already?

2211
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,790
Yes.

2212
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,160
E.JI portrayed a captivating...

2213
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,330
- femme fatale.
- Yes.

2214
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,590
Looking at the camera...

2215
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,030
She really looks like a vampire.

2216
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,600
I loved the theme.

2217
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:21,870
- This is really hard.
- This is a very difficult move.

2218
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,040
She turned...

2219
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,000
and walked backward
while changing the outfit.

2220
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,870
(She was charismatic until the end.)

2221
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:27,870
That was cool.

2222
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:29,640
(Go, E.JI!)

2223
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:34,250
All right. I'm excited to see
what their scores will be.

2224
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:37,050
I think XIAOTING should be nervous.

2225
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:39,750
XIAOTING is sitting on the throne.

2226
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

2227
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,460
E.JI of ICHILLIN'.

2228
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,620
What score will she get out of 30?

2229
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,590
(Dancesports final scores,
E.JI of ICHILLIN': 25.8 points)

2230
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:48,260
It's 25.8 points.

2231
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:51,700
Only 0.7 points behind.
She takes 2nd place.

2232
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,800
- This is intense.
- That was close.

2233
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,370
- Yes.
- It was a razor-thin match.

2234
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:58,810
XIAOTING remains...

2235
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,970
- Yes.
- on the throne.

2236
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:03,210
Yes. Please look forward to it.

2237
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,280
(Who is coming next to beat XIAOTING?)

2238
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,350
(Will XIAOTING win as expected?)

2239
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,220
(Says who?)

2240
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,520
(More mesmerizing than ever before)

2241
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,120
(Like professional Latin dancers)

2242
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:17,160
(Who will be the true dancing queen?)

2243
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,690
(Mixed shooting event,
representing their agency's pride)

2244
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:23,330
(The Avengers are ready to compete.)

2245
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:27,330
(Which agency will claim the honor
in pistol shooting?)

2246
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,370
(The competition hits its peak.)

2247
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,210
(Wrap up the Chuseok holiday with
the Idol Star Athletics Championships.)

2248
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:33,310
(2025 Idol Star Athletics Championships,
Episode 3 will air tomorrow.)
