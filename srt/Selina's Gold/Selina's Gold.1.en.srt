1
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:30,118
According to newspaper reports...

2
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:34,080
...American forces and the
Japanese Imperial forces in Tokyo...

3
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,251
...claim that Bataan peninsula
defense forces are still resisting.

4
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:40,295
But all the resistance
will be for naught...

5
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,798
...as it is expected to collapse
with the continuous attacks...

6
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,842
...by the Japanese forces.

7
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:48,636
However, Washington communique said that...

8
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:53,808
...24 hours of continuous artillery fire
by American and Philippine forces...

9
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:57,729
...have proven more superior
to the Japanese as their tanks...

10
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,232
...armored units, and infantry
concentrations have been shattered...

11
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:03,651
...and dispersed resulting
to heavy losses...

12
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,611
...on the Japanese side.

13
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,864
The Japanese headquarters in Manila...

14
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:10,908
...have issued a proclamation
strongly warning that...

15
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,121
...the death penalty awaits inhabitants
who resort to rebellious acts that...

16
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,733
...counter the security
of the Japanese forces.

17
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:26,899
1942, NORTHERN LUZON, PHILIPPINES

18
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,105
Stop whining.

19
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:42,832
You're going to get it!

20
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:51,240
Quickly.

21
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:52,992
Come on.

22
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:05,963
Stop resisting. Let's go.

23
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,258
No! I don't want to!

24
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:12,678
Keep up, or I'll hit you.

25
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,286
Berong, stop by for a moment.

26
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,900
When I return, I will be able to pay you.

27
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,565
That's good.

28
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:35,019
You will finally have some money,
and then I can borrow from you.

29
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:36,804
I'll give you a share.

30
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,402
Berong!

31
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,165
I don't mean to pry, but--

32
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,293
Good. Don't pry.

33
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,768
Everyone knows how Tiago is.

34
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,074
Miling!

35
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:57,823
Thank you.

36
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,326
Tiago's going to have fun again.

37
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,972
So much fun.

38
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:17,827
According to reports, as attacks
continue on the island of Luzon...

39
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:22,315
...resulting in a huge loss to
infrastructures, properties and lives.

40
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:27,996
A daring raid was executed on
Japanese ships embarked in Subic Bay.

41
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:45,241
Father.

42
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,912
Don't, please.

43
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,442
That ring costs thrice the amount.

44
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,760
If you could add a bit more, Tiago.

45
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,655
If you don't like my offer.

46
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,572
You can have your
paltry piece of gold back.

47
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:55,835
My grandmother passed on
that ring to my mother.

48
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,317
You greedy pig.

49
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,836
May you be cursed with bad luck.

50
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:17,145
Leave that man before
his evil rubs off on you.

51
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,770
Older women...

52
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,363
...bereft of beauty...

53
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,724
...shouldn't dare to hope.

54
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,867
They'll just end up being hurt.

55
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,618
You're right, Tiago.

56
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,313
They have to accept that...

57
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,974
...out of all the things
men give importance to...

58
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,734
...they rank the lowest.

59
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:30,924
Father.

60
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,988
Selina is smooth.

61
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,391
No scars.

62
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,714
Smells like young rice.

63
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,156
Her pubic hair is thin and sparse...

64
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,265
Not yet as thick as a jungle.

65
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,121
How old are you?

66
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:14,306
Kid, how old are you?

67
00:09:55,677 --> 00:10:00,399
From now on, I own you.

68
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,219
When I ask you a question,
you must answer with fear...

69
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:07,612
...and respect.

70
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:13,467
You will do what I say.

71
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:18,880
I am not of your blood.
I am not your friend.

72
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:22,183
You are my property.

73
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,453
How old are you?

74
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:31,075
I am 17, sir.

75
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,751
Take off your clothes.

76
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,687
Everything!

77
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,667
Don't crouch. I want to see your body.

78
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,749
Don't cover your breast.

79
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:53,092
Pour water on yourself.

80
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,596
I want to see your body getting wet.

81
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:09,350
Soap your breasts.

82
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,510
Soap everything,
including your nipples.

83
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,485
Soap your navel.

84
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,269
Wash your groin,
and the lips of your pussy.

85
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,463
Now your thigh... then your legs.

86
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:57,791
Everything that my tongue
will run through should be clean.

87
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,951
They say you're still a virgin.

88
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:09,603
Do you know the feeling
of a hard cock...

89
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:14,900
...being pressed
between your swollen breasts?

90
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,871
I'm sure, once I shove
my cock into your pussy...

91
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,374
...you'll get hurt.

92
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,543
That's what turns me on.

93
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,374
Virgins are delicious.

94
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:32,067
Pour more water.

95
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:49,518
More.

96
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:58,043
More, pour some more.

97
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,530
Tiago is lucky.

98
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,490
Aside from being powerful...

99
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:31,685
He has plenty of gold and money.

100
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,763
He needs to be careful, though.

101
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:37,807
He might be blinded by his wealth.

102
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,610
You're too serious.

103
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:44,030
Drink it sip by sip.

104
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,293
Men are fools.

105
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:16,554
How long will you make me wait?

106
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:20,650
If I force you, you'll move away.

107
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,593
If I get angry, I'll hit you.

108
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:30,110
Please have mercy on me.

109
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,653
You can fight back, but it's useless.

110
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,288
Don't make this any more difficult.

111
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,308
Come here.

112
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:47,498
I said come here!

113
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,630
I spent many years raising Selina.

114
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,267
As you should. She is your child.

115
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:18,762
It's only right that
I gain something from her.

116
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,099
But not that way.

117
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:26,420
Miling, shut up.

118
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:33,052
Berong, I understand you.

119
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,813
You got buried in debt.

120
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:39,127
I've paid back that son of a bitch.

121
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,330
You paid him back
with your own blood.

122
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,625
I told you to shut up.

123
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:51,565
Why are you butting in
on the affairs of men?

124
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,066
Since when did you give your
barren wife the right to talk?

125
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:14,818
You smell nice, fresh from your bath.

126
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,841
Yes.

127
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:42,763
Suck it, Suck it.

128
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,359
Suck it, Suck it.

129
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:57,236
Learn how to suckle.

130
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,487
You smell so good.
Flattened rice is delicious.

131
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:11,393
Do you feel my hard cock
inside your vagina?

132
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,688
Do you feel my huge cock?

133
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:33,582
Is my cock huge? Answer me.

134
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,585
Say it louder.

135
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,004
Answer me. Do I have a huge cock?

136
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,423
Your cock is huge.

137
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,675
Louder.

138
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,887
Stop stammering!

139
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,222
It's huge.

140
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,790
- More.
- It's huge.

141
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,433
- More.
- It's huge.

142
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,961
Your cock is huge.

143
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,355
Does my cock feel good inside your pussy?

144
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,455
Well?

145
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:02,569
Your cock feels so good inside my pussy.

146
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:05,155
Tell me you need my cock.

147
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,492
Tell me you need my cock.

148
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,019
I need your cock.

149
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:16,199
Tell me to go faster.

150
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,210
Faster.

151
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,962
Faster.

152
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:26,426
I'm coming.

153
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,544
Domeng, milk.

154
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,005
Domeng.

155
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:35,842
Give me milk, Domeng.

156
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,334
Were you able to relieve yourself?

157
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,988
Was she fast?

158
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:43,326
I heard her footsteps.
Her pace was quick.

159
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,701
What will happen?

160
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:56,693
She'll come back.

161
00:25:01,956 --> 00:25:03,958
They all come back in the end.

162
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,308
One more.

163
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,946
Carabao's milk is good for your health...

164
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:23,248
...a glass each after you
wake up and before bed.

165
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:42,890
Father, Father.

166
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,011
Father.

167
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,206
Take me away from him.

168
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,847
Father.

169
00:25:50,064 --> 00:25:53,785
Father, he is not human.
He is a monster.

170
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,553
He's a monster.

171
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:58,266
Father.

172
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:01,849
You stupid bitch.

173
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:04,198
You stupid bitch.

174
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,015
You woke me up.

175
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,201
Father.

176
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,504
Father, I will do anything.

177
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:10,648
Anything.

178
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:13,467
Please just take me away from Tiago.

179
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:15,380
Father.

180
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:20,072
I can't be with him. He is evil.

181
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,757
Have mercy.

182
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:23,515
I beg you.

183
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,516
You belong to him now.

184
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,064
Father.

185
00:26:28,164 --> 00:26:30,208
You belong to him now.

186
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,518
- Have mercy.
- He is your father now.

187
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,489
He is your father now.

188
00:26:36,718 --> 00:26:37,783
Leave!

189
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:38,967
No, please.

190
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:47,850
Father. Father.

191
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,398
Father.

192
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,894
Were you waiting for me?

193
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,228
Did he adopt you,
or are you his slave?

194
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:37,577
How did you get here?

195
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,667
Idiot.

196
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:45,702
Why didn't you store
the chickens in the coop?

197
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,361
I'm sorry, father.

198
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:52,182
Fool.

199
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:55,020
The rats feasted on the chickens.

200
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,530
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

201
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,375
Stop jacking off...

202
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:04,149
...so you have time for work.

203
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,204
Selina.

204
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,394
Come closer.

205
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,405
Come here for a bit.

206
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:26,553
Closer.

207
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,633
Closer to me.

208
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:45,454
Closer.

209
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:39,610
Delicious.

210
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:48,839
Next time, when you're inside the house...

211
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,337
Don't use underwear.

212
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,967
Make it easy on my fingers.

213
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,920
Go on.

214
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,022
Sit down and join me.

215
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:17,683
Domeng.

216
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:25,011
Don't sit there, join us.

217
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,834
Leave him alone.

218
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:48,788
Thank you.

219
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,000
Milk truly is healthy in the morning.

220
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:53,263
Come closer.

221
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,023
Come closer.

222
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,477
Press your body against the table.

223
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:00,450
Closer.

224
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,405
Closer.

225
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:55,394
Your underwear is getting in the way.

226
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,510
Father and I are not related by blood.

227
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,599
Like you, I was used as payment
for my parents debt.

228
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:45,752
I was just seven years old.

229
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,765
I owe him a debt of gratitude.

230
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,205
I have some business with Tiago.

231
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:05,430
Just go upstairs, ma'am.

232
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,944
This is of poor quality.

233
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,720
That should be enough.

234
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:25,460
Tiago... please, add a little more.

235
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,621
I don't want to hear groveling.

236
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:41,926
Please loan us some more.

237
00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:45,705
Cora, my daughter...
she's still unresponsive.

238
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,654
I don't care about your daughter.

239
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:56,883
You used her for payment
and then took her back...

240
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,102
...now you want to borrow money again?

241
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:05,561
How would you pay me back?

242
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:14,383
Do you have another young daughter?

243
00:43:35,118 --> 00:43:39,238
Here. I wouldn't want you
to think that I'm so heartless.

244
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:43,671
That's the last time.

245
00:43:44,547 --> 00:43:46,157
You're all useless.

246
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:47,326
Get out.

247
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:57,947
Your family owes me a lot.

248
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:05,722
I don't know what vices your father had
that it ruined his livelihood.

249
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:10,151
Your mother-- what a pity.

250
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:16,476
She was kind and hardworking.

251
00:46:18,348 --> 00:46:22,994
Marrying a powerless man was her downfall.

252
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:27,310
Power does not come from muscles or brawn.

253
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:30,209
Nor from having the gift of gab.

254
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:39,416
It is not from a kind heart
that gives generously to all.

255
00:46:40,281 --> 00:46:42,642
Power comes from money.

256
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:45,828
Not from family, but money.

257
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:49,533
Not from camaraderie, but money.

258
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,146
Every relationship has a price.

259
00:46:55,153 --> 00:47:00,350
Even the most principled can be bought
with the right price.

260
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:03,907
Things you thought you couldn't bear
to lay your eyes on...

261
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:08,318
...because they are unsightly
and foul smelling...

262
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:13,756
...you will endure for money.

263
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:19,803
Did you want to say something?

264
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:24,771
My father told me that
I'm now your property.

265
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:28,628
Is that truly what you think of me?

266
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:31,090
Shouldn't I?

267
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,258
Every time we have sex...

268
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,388
...every time you moan, or contort
your face, out of sheer pleasure...

269
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,804
...don’t those carry any feelings for me?

270
00:47:52,227 --> 00:47:54,530
Do you want me to say...

271
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:58,050
...that I have feelings for you?

272
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:34,211
It's so good.

273
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,504
Don't stop.

274
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,464
Suck it.

275
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,095
Bite it.

276
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:12,411
Your cock feels so good.

277
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,187
Your cock huge.

278
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:17,457
- Your cock feels so good.
- Louder.

279
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,254
It's so good.

280
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,597
It's so good.

281
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,933
Deeper.

282
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,561
Deeper.

283
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:42,049
News reports state that the
Philippine Island of Corregidor...

284
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:44,109
...was surrounded by Japanese forces...

285
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:50,741
...General Douglas MacArthur and his family
made a daring escape on board PT boats...

286
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:55,621
...braving the stormy seas
patrolled by Japanese warships.

287
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:59,541
Upon orders of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt...

288
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:04,004
...the General was commanded to
flee to Australia via a submarine...

289
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:07,883
...made available to him
but General MacArthur...

290
00:52:07,983 --> 00:52:13,555
...the symbol of Allied resistance to the
Japanese made the escape via PT boats...

291
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:18,477
...led by lieutenant junior
grade John D. Bulkeley.

292
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:21,410
Additional reports said
that General MacArthur...

293
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,982
...reached Mindanao two days later...

294
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:31,281
...and he and his group flew to
Australia on board B27 flying fortresses.

295
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:35,852
The recent fall of Singapore,
once considered impregnable...

296
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:39,437
...dictated the fate
of the American-British...

297
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,593
...Dutch-Australian command.

298
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,634
Tiago.

299
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:06,023
Drop by for a bit.

300
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,060
We're just about to start.

301
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:23,416
What is all the fuss?

302
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:27,518
And you're bothering me
on the way home?

303
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:32,625
Coconut wine.

304
00:57:34,878 --> 00:57:36,337
Coconut wine?

305
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:46,981
It doesn't look like you're worried
over the warning...

306
00:57:46,981 --> 00:57:50,493
...that the Japanese
are nearing the capitol.

307
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:54,696
I was there during the
time of the Spaniards.

308
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:57,796
I've clinked glasses with the Americans.

309
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:02,155
How different are these Japanese?

310
00:58:02,363 --> 00:58:06,409
They say the Japanese are ruthless,
which is why we should leave.

311
00:58:09,496 --> 00:58:10,565
Bino...

312
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:15,073
...won't you listen to your wife?

313
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:22,706
You seem to have changed.

314
00:58:25,787 --> 00:58:28,303
Your demeanor is lighter.

315
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,623
Is that a smile on your face?

316
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,398
You talk too much. You're better off
pouring me a glass.

317
00:58:53,623 --> 00:58:56,151
Selina, do you want water?

318
00:59:05,935 --> 00:59:08,416
Looks like you did a lot of shopping.

319
00:59:08,516 --> 00:59:10,734
None of which are for him.

320
00:59:26,155 --> 00:59:28,179
You are playing with fire.

321
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,914
Be careful.

322
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,040
Thank you, ma'am.

323
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:36,853
I'll be careful.

324
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:50,888
Don't let your guard down.

325
00:59:51,206 --> 00:59:53,334
Remember Magda's daughter?

326
00:59:53,597 --> 00:59:56,016
She went insane.

327
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,458
So have I.

328
01:02:54,075 --> 01:02:56,103
Don't leave the house.

329
01:02:56,303 --> 01:02:59,147
Father. Please, stop.

330
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:02,375
Stop it.

331
01:03:07,397 --> 01:03:12,244
Remember this... Do not leave the house.

332
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:15,155
Mother...

333
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:17,023
Stop it.

334
01:03:30,503 --> 01:03:32,139
Mother...

335
01:03:37,118 --> 01:03:38,437
Mother.

336
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:41,898
Mother.

337
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:06,089
Mother.

338
01:04:06,831 --> 01:04:08,425
Why?

339
01:04:10,877 --> 01:04:14,097
Mother, Mother.

340
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:24,993
Domeng.

341
01:05:26,428 --> 01:05:28,363
Tell me a story.

342
01:05:33,018 --> 01:05:34,728
You've changed.

343
01:05:37,439 --> 01:05:39,024
I needed to.

344
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:44,237
You make him happy.

345
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:49,476
Isn't that for the best?

346
01:05:53,997 --> 01:05:56,458
I've never heard him laugh before.

347
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:04,299
When he's happy, he won't hurt you.

348
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:10,472
You don't know him.

349
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:14,284
I want to get to know him.

350
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:17,537
Who is he?

351
01:06:20,023 --> 01:06:21,566
I don't know.

352
01:06:30,408 --> 01:06:32,277
He took me in...

353
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:37,791
...after ruining my parents' lives.

354
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:41,978
He's cruel.

355
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:47,033
Why are you still here?

356
01:06:52,973 --> 01:06:55,192
I tried to escape.

357
01:06:59,437 --> 01:07:01,414
I had nowhere to go.

358
01:07:05,277 --> 01:07:13,118
People are cold-hearted
to slaves like me...

359
01:07:14,217 --> 01:07:18,312
They see our lives as
something to toy with.

360
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:23,987
I used to think...

361
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:31,497
...that the kindness of others could fill
the emptiness of a cruel life...

362
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,802
But I was wrong.

363
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:47,155
We're already poor,
but we're treated worse than dirt.

364
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:59,963
Not once did I get to see the light...

365
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:04,096
...and I have stopped hoping.

366
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:11,462
But I wanted to live,
so I came back.

367
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,775
I begged father to take me back.

368
01:08:26,944 --> 01:08:29,197
What happened here?

369
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:35,328
I don't know.

370
01:09:27,255 --> 01:09:28,839
That's enough.

371
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:37,314
I don't want to miss a feeling I might
never experience again.

372
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:54,498
Have you ever touched a woman's body?

373
01:10:30,234 --> 01:10:32,461
Father might wake up.

374
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:36,632
He's drunk.

375
01:10:37,016 --> 01:10:39,668
He'll be asleep till past sunrise.

376
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,381
This is my breast.

377
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,425
Can you feel it?

378
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:46,803
This is my nipple.

379
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:53,376
If you play with it with your fingers,
it will feel even better.

380
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:05,138
You know, Domeng...

381
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,327
...it is a whole other level of pleasure,
if you play with it with your tongue.

382
01:12:14,856 --> 01:12:17,150
Do you want a taste?

383
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,743
It's in front of your mouth...

384
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:30,204
...stick your tongue out.

385
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:37,779
Bathe it with your saliva.

386
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,842
How does it feel?

387
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:04,046
My whole body is trembling.

388
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:36,723
Can you feel the hole?

389
01:13:43,069 --> 01:13:46,197
Is this the first time
you've brushed your hand against...

390
01:13:46,447 --> 01:13:48,991
...a warm and wet pussy?

391
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:56,991
Put your finger in...

392
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,958
It's so hard...

393
01:14:31,742 --> 01:14:34,745
It's swollen and throbbing...

394
01:14:41,919 --> 01:14:46,674
Does my touch feel good?

395
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,523
Don't be shy.

396
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:08,846
Next time, I'll let you cum inside me.

397
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:43,965
Your cum tastes sweet.

398
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,372
Would you like me to bring up your food?

399
01:16:19,016 --> 01:16:21,294
I'll eat later.

400
01:16:24,605 --> 01:16:27,049
You should rest for now.

401
01:16:30,111 --> 01:16:32,405
I'm going to do the laundry, okay?

402
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:37,563
When I come back,
I'll make you feel better.

403
01:18:37,991 --> 01:18:40,144
Aren't you Cora?

404
01:18:51,605 --> 01:18:53,991
Are you alone?

405
01:18:59,763 --> 01:19:01,290
Get up!

406
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:31,612
No, please stop.

407
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:39,186
Please, have mercy.

408
01:19:39,486 --> 01:19:42,289
Please stop.

409
01:20:17,007 --> 01:20:18,825
Cora, my daughter.

410
01:20:29,294 --> 01:20:30,921
My child, let's go.

411
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:32,589
Come now, dear, let's go home.

412
01:20:32,689 --> 01:20:35,300
Don't bring me back to the devil's house.

413
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,387
Please, I beg you.

414
01:20:45,969 --> 01:20:48,105
Let's go.

415
01:20:52,726 --> 01:20:54,945
Let's go Cora.

416
01:20:58,106 --> 01:21:00,033
Be careful.

417
01:21:00,984 --> 01:21:02,953
Come on.

418
01:21:04,137 --> 01:21:06,498
Mother's here.

419
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:28,571
Please stop.

420
01:21:35,427 --> 01:21:38,572
Where did you hide the jewelry?

421
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,510
I didn't! I didn't take anything.

422
01:21:43,227 --> 01:21:44,244
Where?

423
01:21:44,344 --> 01:21:46,596
Please stop, father.
Please have mercy.

424
01:21:46,696 --> 01:21:50,634
I'm not going to stop until
you bring out what you stole.

425
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:54,646
Please stop.

426
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:04,973
Just kill him.

427
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:32,534
Where did you hide the jewelry?

428
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,753
How can you be both blind and a thief?

429
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:36,613
I'm not a thief.

430
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:39,132
Look? You're a liar.

431
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,744
My rheumatism is flaring up again.

432
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,029
You shouldn't wear yourself out

433
01:23:43,129 --> 01:23:45,548
by punishing Domeng like that.

434
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:47,859
It's a waste of your energy.

435
01:23:57,552 --> 01:24:00,063
You need your milk.

436
01:24:22,644 --> 01:24:28,566
Catch it with your mouth.
Don't waste the milk.

437
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:16,973
How does it feel?

438
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:18,975
I want more.

439
01:25:19,951 --> 01:25:21,878
How good is it?

440
01:25:22,078 --> 01:25:25,799
It's good, It's so good.

441
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:27,333
Louder.

442
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:29,085
It's so good.

443
01:25:29,461 --> 01:25:30,528
Louder.

444
01:25:30,628 --> 01:25:32,630
You feel so good.

445
01:25:38,953 --> 01:25:40,163
I'm going to stop now.

446
01:25:40,263 --> 01:25:42,515
No, don't stop.

447
01:25:44,751 --> 01:25:46,836
I want you to beg.

448
01:25:46,936 --> 01:25:48,696
Don't, please.

449
01:25:49,714 --> 01:25:50,732
What?

450
01:25:50,832 --> 01:25:52,776
I beg you.

451
01:25:57,964 --> 01:26:00,500
Please. I'm begging you, don't stop.

452
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,227
- What?
- Let me cum inside you.

453
01:26:02,327 --> 01:26:04,805
Let me cum inside you.

454
01:26:57,423 --> 01:26:59,149
Damn idiot!

455
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,252
Thank you.

456
01:27:32,005 --> 01:27:34,174
What were you doing there?

457
01:27:39,846 --> 01:27:41,631
A while ago...

458
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:46,019
I thought of killing myself.

459
01:27:47,379 --> 01:27:49,373
But I chickened out.

460
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:54,361
My life is cursed.

461
01:27:56,305 --> 01:28:01,710
I feel like I'm paying for the sins
of all my ancestors.

462
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:05,806
I've only ever felt happiness once.

463
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:08,792
When?

464
01:28:11,461 --> 01:28:14,131
The night that I felt your body.

465
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,134
I wish…

466
01:28:19,428 --> 01:28:22,297
I never experienced any of that.

467
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:28,270
It only made my loneliness more unbearable.

468
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,389
I hope...

469
01:29:06,683 --> 01:29:08,752
...after tonight...

470
01:29:08,852 --> 01:29:10,996
...I'll draw my last breath.

471
01:29:12,464 --> 01:29:15,867
At least I'll leave
with some joy in my heart.

472
01:30:17,889 --> 01:30:19,798
Take me away from here.

473
01:30:21,023 --> 01:30:23,012
I'll be your slave.

474
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:34,412
You're the only person he's been with
that he's not beating up.

475
01:30:39,926 --> 01:30:43,438
He may be kind to you now,
but it'll only last...

476
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:47,200
...until he finds someone else.

477
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:13,401
What could the Japanese want
with the provinces?

478
01:31:14,086 --> 01:31:17,322
Especially with a poor village like this?

479
01:31:17,447 --> 01:31:20,970
It's scary that we're burning the body.

480
01:31:23,325 --> 01:31:26,854
Why would we waste energy
burying them?

481
01:31:27,354 --> 01:31:29,476
It's better for the flames to burn away...

482
01:31:29,576 --> 01:31:32,437
...every trace of them in this world.

483
01:31:37,648 --> 01:31:38,824
Domeng.

484
01:32:25,612 --> 01:32:30,751
I'm glad you're not wearing any underwear.

485
01:32:35,798 --> 01:32:38,909
There's a small gathering at Bino's.

486
01:32:39,485 --> 01:32:41,278
Are you coming with me?

487
01:32:50,412 --> 01:32:52,373
Do I need to?

488
01:32:53,499 --> 01:32:56,059
I wanted to get some rest.

489
01:33:01,759 --> 01:33:04,009
Go, rest.

490
01:33:04,493 --> 01:33:07,125
I'm not staying there for long.

491
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:23,529
When I come back...

492
01:33:23,737 --> 01:33:25,956
...I want you to serve me.

493
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:58,677
Here's something for what you
and your daughter went through.

494
01:36:17,475 --> 01:36:18,513
Bino.

495
01:36:18,895 --> 01:36:23,866
It looks like Miling finally
convinced you to leave, huh?

496
01:36:25,775 --> 01:36:27,569
Where are you headed?

497
01:36:27,794 --> 01:36:31,973
Wherever our feet will take us.

498
01:36:32,324 --> 01:36:34,200
For as long as we can.

499
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:38,079
If we can, until San Rafael.

500
01:36:39,205 --> 01:36:41,333
Far from everything else.

501
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,727
From what I heard...

502
01:36:44,069 --> 01:36:46,955
...there are only around
ten families living there.

503
01:36:47,297 --> 01:36:50,166
What of your coconut wine?
Who will buy it?

504
01:36:52,594 --> 01:36:56,581
Seeing as Miling successfully
persuaded me...

505
01:36:56,681 --> 01:36:59,151
...I concede to her plans.

506
01:36:59,351 --> 01:37:02,487
We'll set aside our business for now...

507
01:37:03,171 --> 01:37:05,795
...and put our safety first.

508
01:37:05,899 --> 01:37:09,427
Some people have seen with their own eyes,
the truth about the cruelty...

509
01:37:09,527 --> 01:37:13,506
...of the Japanese soldiers. It doesn't
matter if you're a man or a woman.

510
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:20,888
I, for one, am not leaving this place.

511
01:37:20,988 --> 01:37:23,949
I'm sure I can get along with everyone.

512
01:37:24,876 --> 01:37:26,870
The important thing is...

513
01:37:27,462 --> 01:37:30,715
...you give what the conquerors want.

514
01:37:30,882 --> 01:37:32,901
Then they won't bother you.

515
01:38:02,606 --> 01:38:07,593
You might need to take
a dip in the stream later...

516
01:38:07,693 --> 01:38:09,849
...to refresh yourself
and restore your sobriety.

517
01:38:09,949 --> 01:38:11,159
Bino.

518
01:38:13,299 --> 01:38:17,679
There is no wine that can put me out.

519
01:38:40,425 --> 01:38:42,402
I knew it.

520
01:38:42,502 --> 01:38:44,863
He might not be able to go home.

521
01:38:44,963 --> 01:38:47,732
Don't worry, I'll take him home.

522
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:23,950
You're a fool, Tiago.

523
01:39:25,662 --> 01:39:27,196
You're right.

524
01:39:27,697 --> 01:39:30,499
I am a fool.

525
01:39:32,243 --> 01:39:36,931
Did you have fun ravishing
Selina's body?

526
01:39:37,632 --> 01:39:39,484
Did she smell sweet?

527
01:39:40,093 --> 01:39:41,761
Was she smooth?

528
01:39:43,071 --> 01:39:48,710
Did you lick every crevice and entrance
she had on her body?

529
01:39:55,986 --> 01:39:57,196
Yes.

530
01:39:58,904 --> 01:40:01,539
Your daughter is all mine.

531
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:03,658
She is not my daughter.

532
01:40:06,953 --> 01:40:09,414
My wife didn't owe you anything.

533
01:40:10,181 --> 01:40:13,818
You courted her.
Then threatened her.

534
01:40:13,918 --> 01:40:15,535
You raped her.

535
01:40:17,005 --> 01:40:19,257
You ruined our lives.

536
01:40:22,735 --> 01:40:25,121
I'm infertile.

537
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:30,761
Selina is your child.

538
01:40:33,354 --> 01:40:35,181
You're right.

539
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:42,055
Selina is all yours.

540
01:40:44,286 --> 01:40:46,747
Now we're even.

541
01:41:07,878 --> 01:41:09,630
You motherfucker.

542
01:41:10,508 --> 01:41:12,527
You motherfucker!

543
01:43:01,085 --> 01:43:02,487
It's so good.

544
01:43:02,587 --> 01:43:04,338
Deeper.

545
01:43:08,525 --> 01:43:10,568
Get away from my child.

546
01:43:11,653 --> 01:43:13,279
You traitor.

547
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:16,507
- He's not your child.
- You monster.

548
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:18,384
He is your slave.

549
01:43:18,601 --> 01:43:20,478
You will never lay a hand on me again.

550
01:43:20,578 --> 01:43:21,704
You monster.

551
01:43:21,913 --> 01:43:25,208
- Come on, come here.
- You're a traitor, Domeng.

552
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:27,193
Come on, get over here.

553
01:43:27,293 --> 01:43:28,361
Tiago!

554
01:43:28,461 --> 01:43:29,796
You're a traitor, Domeng.

555
01:43:30,313 --> 01:43:31,614
Selina!

556
01:43:36,861 --> 01:43:39,205
Come on, come here.

557
01:43:42,892 --> 01:43:47,105
Does my blade feel good deep in your gut?

558
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:49,716
Selina.

559
01:44:22,156 --> 01:44:25,335
Come on, come here.

560
01:44:28,037 --> 01:44:30,089
Selina.

561
01:44:33,376 --> 01:44:36,721
Come on, come here.

562
01:44:38,131 --> 01:44:39,474
Come here.

563
01:44:41,217 --> 01:44:42,602
Domeng.

564
01:44:43,469 --> 01:44:44,938
That's enough.

565
01:44:46,539 --> 01:44:48,249
He's gone.

566
01:46:42,905 --> 01:46:44,048
What's this?

567
01:47:00,575 --> 01:47:04,162
We'll split Tiago's gold and money.

568
01:47:05,205 --> 01:47:08,066
Use that for your new life.

569
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:11,778
That is your power.

570
01:47:12,796 --> 01:47:14,689
I don't need this...

571
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:17,300
...because I'm with you.

572
01:47:20,028 --> 01:47:22,205
Forgive me, Domeng.

573
01:47:25,658 --> 01:47:28,378
We can't be together.

574
01:47:31,581 --> 01:47:33,383
Listen to me.

575
01:47:35,527 --> 01:47:37,170
Be brave.

576
01:47:39,139 --> 01:47:42,124
Don't let them abuse you,
or hurt you.

577
01:47:44,452 --> 01:47:46,830
You must love yourself.

578
01:47:54,921 --> 01:47:56,740
Don't leave me.

579
01:48:03,012 --> 01:48:04,789
Don't leave me.

580
01:48:12,147 --> 01:48:13,248
Selina.

581
01:48:18,194 --> 01:48:19,421
Selina.

582
01:48:47,223 --> 01:48:48,617
Selina.

583
01:48:54,397 --> 01:48:55,457
Selina.

584
01:48:58,443 --> 01:48:59,644
Selina.

585
01:49:02,697 --> 01:49:03,965
Selina.

586
01:49:12,624 --> 01:49:13,917
Selina.
