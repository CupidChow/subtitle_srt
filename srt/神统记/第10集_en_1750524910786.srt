1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The last one, Teogonia.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good girl!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Kofi...

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry...

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Makakesu!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Please, give me a hand.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to live on the moment of the unyielding flag.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to grab something, so I want to use it strongly.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm on a long road that's so refreshing.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Where are you?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Where is the goal?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Is that really true?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The moment I look at a different view from yesterday

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't say it well, but I can see the power of the progress.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
While reaching the light of the future, I'm going to live on the unyielding flag.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close, I won't dream of anything.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I want to grab something, so I want to use it strongly.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The King of the Dream

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It seems that the water has been drained out.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I also drank the poison extract.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was able to hold it in my hand.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I wish it could help me somehow.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll tell the King.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is this?

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They're all gone.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My name is Trude, the wolf of the dream.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tell us about our holy power.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The King is in trouble.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Explain it to me.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was crushed.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What is that?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That is...

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The land of the Demon Clan, the Hege.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The Hege was the reason why the land and the water were rotten.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The food was also gone.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have to wait for it to be destroyed.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The rotten god, the devil, the devil.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The devil?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The devil?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The devil?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Destroy it!

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Destroy it!

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lord.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How was it?

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's okay.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You and I were the enemies we had killed before.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You want to save us this time?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do you think?

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're too good at that.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're the ones who attacked us.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How many people are dead in the Lug Village?

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Lord Okami, we killed a lot of our friends.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Lord Trude, you betrayed the Lord.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How did you kill them?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You refused to bear the pain.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Listen.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If Lord Okami doesn't let you down,

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we'll attack the Lug Village again!

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You bastard!

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you really do that,

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll definitely forgive you!

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll kill you all!

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're so cool!

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Kill Lord Okami!

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We attacked your village because we didn't want to live.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We need a new land to live in.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're so annoying.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go home!

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Lord Okami!

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Lord.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What about the Lug Village?

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Everything is over.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And the power of this man's life.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I see.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's the purpose of those people?

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If they hadn't attacked the village,

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
they wouldn't have met Elsa.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you hear the purpose of those people?

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But, dear boy...

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you know that?

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Lord, the people's wishes are not fulfilled.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They can't be fulfilled without the help of the Lug Village.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not good to throw them away.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There are some things that are difficult to understand,

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but they are more useful than the Lug Village.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Our words are Lug Village.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The Lug Village is the king of the Kanae.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The way they call it is different,

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
but the gods who stand up are the same.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The gods have the power to control the power of the gods,

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and they are the ones who protect the Lug Village.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And when the world's financial situation is over,

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
they are the ones who are right.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's like a story about the Lug Village.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's like they're telling me to save the world.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you say it in a way that's right.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You mean...

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You mean you're telling me to do that?

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Lord, you have obtained the Five Godly Cards.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And the power of the gods is much greater than the power of the gods.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They are also the ones who are right.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The reason why they use the power of the gods is because

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
they are the ones who are right.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You guys are still...

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You...

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're telling me to save the world?

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The power of the gods is so special and amazing.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The reason why they use that power to control the world is

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
because they are the ones who are right.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If they don't do that,

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
will they attack the village again?

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why?

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The gods have given us the power,

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but why am I the one who did this?

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can't do this!

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The flowers... They look so pitiful.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What's wrong? The gods are scary.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It seems that the words of the gods are not enough.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This guy is a good boy.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The words of the gods are difficult. It's troublesome.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It seems that they have returned.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to the Rage Village.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you're going to send our holy mirror to the Rage Village?

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I still have no idea!

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Besides, if we don't return to the village,

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
we'll be worried about the people there.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm counting on you, Elsa.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I understand.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The wolf of the gods, will you come to the Rage Village?

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't think you have to answer now.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not the one who can escape.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I believe in that.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Kai is back!

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You're safe!

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Where's the Gandalf's bastard?

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I couldn't find him.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That bastard, who's going to return,

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is going to run away with Mama?

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Then, Elsa...

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a pity.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're tired, right? Take a little rest.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No, before that...

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have to tell the gods...

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The gods?

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The red one is coming back again?

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're so young now.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The gods are not good at fighting.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They like to fight.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Those bastards are all they can do.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The world is in danger.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We'll send them to the Rage Village.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We'll send them to the Rage Village.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then, let's go.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Kai.

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You did a good job of taking part in the war.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm looking forward to it.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll do what I can.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's a sin.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I brought you food.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Young Master?

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Where's the bone?

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Lily!

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Where's the bone?

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You said you'd take it back, didn't you?

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry. I really can't see you.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're Lily, aren't you?

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Miss Lily?

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You said you'd take it back.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Kai's Musuki!

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Kai.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Many lives are lost on the way to war.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Perhaps the gods are hoping for war.

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They're fighting to separate the strong and the weak.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They're fighting to fight and lead them to victory.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And the conflict kills the most of the weak.

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The people will die more.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If Elsa doesn't go to war...

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Did you take all of them?

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just a little more.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They're so red.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Maybe they have someone to cry for them.

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They're the ones who can take their own lives.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's terrible.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Big Brother?

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The creatures you killed.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're a little sad.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're crying for them.

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You should be happier.

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You killed them all.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're so proud of yourself.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't be that kind of person.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You should be proud of yourself!

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If you didn't get that curse,

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you'd have done the same thing to me.

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You should have been the one who fought for the army.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If the cursed Chakran did that,

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you'd have brought that curse to the kingdom

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and given that chance to the empire.

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You'd be able to open up a family.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you do that, you'd be a part of the Ragnarok.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They were all my animals.

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You bastards!

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Big Brother!

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I can't let them get away with the curse!

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Don't you dare...

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't you dare!

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Stop it!

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Leave me alone!

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Brother!

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't be so selfish.

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not the one who always takes your place!

223
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I hate red!

224
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But...

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If they can't attack the village...

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Is that possible?

227
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Our people and our ancestors...

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
...were the ones who killed them.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But...

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Then how long should we kill them?

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We can't just leave them like this!

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That kid...

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Is he going to attack me?

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He's not even a tiger.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is that really true?

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are you fooling around with?

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let the young people go down the mountain.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They're going to come back in two or three days.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What?

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They're just coming back.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you're going to leave the village again?

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're hiding something from me.

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No, nothing.

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, you're not a fool.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You have some idea.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll tell you something.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
A person with power is the one who should have the heart.

248
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You showed me the strength to be strong.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You have the power.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Even if you have a wall that can't be overcome by others...

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
...you can't even know where to cross it.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
My power?

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
For example, trying to get caught by a monster's agit.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you do, you can't escape.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can grab the agit and go on with it.

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Your power is the power of God.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't hesitate when you use it.

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, sir.

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Here, a new one.

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Take it.

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you.

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If you find the agit, you can run away if you think it's dangerous.

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Kai.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This one is also a new one.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But that's a princess.

267
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's okay.

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I thought it was a defense.

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a waste to use such a luxurious thing.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's something that can be transmitted to the monster.

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You shouldn't hesitate when you use it.

272
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If you hesitate, you can't get the real power to fight.

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's a good way to tell it.

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I wonder if I can come back.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm going to try to do it from now on.

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Can I really do it now?

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No, I've already decided to do it.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll do what I can.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going to do it.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm going to do it.

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm going to do it.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to do it.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going to bury all of them.

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But why are we doing this?

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If you leave the monster and the body, you'll find the people.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If you get this and find the other people, what will you do?

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Can you give it to the government?

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't be ridiculous.

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not lying.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But I'll make it clear.

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't let the people in the village get out of your hands while I'm gone.

293
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay?

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I won't let you get away with it.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
His hair is like a mohikan.

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A mohikan?

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's...

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I see.

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
A memory I don't know yet.

301
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then let's go with the people.

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you between the people and the red-banded.

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you have any concern for me as a person?

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This is a costume of a Kororozoku warrior?

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I heard that if you wear this, you'll think you're a Kororozoku warrior.

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's the most important warrior in the family.

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You can see it from anywhere.

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then I'll go.

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Um...

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I was scared of God yesterday.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I was angry and screamed in front of the grave.

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But God is different now.

313
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I can't say it well, but it seems like he's trying to be a new God.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
New God?

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I was worried about you, Lily.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll be out for a while, but I hope you'll be fine.

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Master.

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's the King of Adulacan.

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Why is this here?

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
After that battle, we were the ones who pulled it out.

321
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It must be useful to put it in a battle like a journey.

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's heavy.

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It seems that the information has been received from the Lagumura.

324
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It seems that the Ozaru people have been overflowing again.

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's hard to find the East Bridge.

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not just the Ozaru that should be under the control.

327
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Anyway, the place where we're going to be is the end of the Hendo Bridge.

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It has nothing to do with us.

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're right.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They're going to kill the Ajinids, so we can protect them.

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll be free in 100 years.

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There are also the Hendo Haku, who has defeated the first wolf in Hendo.

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We're going to the Ajinids.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Let's go.

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's that?

336
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A grave. A warrior's grave.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
A warrior's death will bring a lot of pain and a lot of pain.

338
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Many of the warriors of the Lagumura died in the war.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The grave of the one you killed might be here.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They also fought in the Lagumura?

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No. That was a fight against Diabon.

342
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Diabon?

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Can you tell me about Diabon?

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I've never been blind, and I only know it through the radio.

345
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I've heard that there have been many times in our world that we have appeared.

346
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And I think it was the warrior's body that was defeated by the god of others.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
My warrior?

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's what I've been told as a good use to various families.

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I see.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But Diabon, who has become unable to show his appearance,

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
has just appeared.

352
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It may be that our world is facing a change of times.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is the worst.

354
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Diabon, the cursed god.

355
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Take away the power of the city god and make the city's home a grave.

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If you go ahead, it's even worse.

357
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There is a great amount of debris.

358
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This way.

359
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Tornillo wins, right?

360
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
A gem, indeed.

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,140
There was a story written in the

362
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,480
さい-Staa Shprodu that pájaw عن grace for his一下�chi princess.

363
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,160
