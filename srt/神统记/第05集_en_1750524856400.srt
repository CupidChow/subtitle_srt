1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The last time you saw it, you were like...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ah, eat the rice balls!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's with that rice ball?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't know much about it, but I feel like it was really good.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get out! Kimahou!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's here!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Aigurako!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm aiming for...

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now or never!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to live on the moment of the endless waves

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I want to grab something, so I want to hold it strongly

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The heat is not changing, so I'm moving hotly

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a long road that's so refreshing

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Where am I right now?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where is the goal?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is that really true?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The moment I look at a different scenery from yesterday

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't say it well, but I can throw away the power to move on

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
While reaching the light of the future

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to live on the moment of the endless waves

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I won't dream of anything, but

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want to grab something, so I want to hold it strongly

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The heat is not changing, so I'm moving hotly

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The super-sacrifice

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't open it

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And the rice ball...

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Isn't that how you make rice balls?

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's rice ball?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Elsa?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you eat rice balls?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I don't know what to say

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's really good

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Where did you eat it?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've never eaten it

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I wanted to try it

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You want to try it?

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What's wrong, Elsa?

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Nothing

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Kai, bring the bag over there

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You bastard

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're the only one who's going to go to spring

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When I heard you were working

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I was in a hurry

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to get you

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to let you work in the car of the super-sacrifice

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is there any need to do this?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Elsa

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If it's a valuable property, you don't have to know

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's not good to be eaten by others

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There's not much of a village

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's a good thing to have a family

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It doesn't matter

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't die easily

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll give you a hand

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You should be able to get a hand in the middle

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's try to be more careful than necessary

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't go up to the top

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As I said, the village people are a kid

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't be too impatient

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're from the middle of the village, right?

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a rare customer

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're a good boy

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll take the food that you have to hide

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll take it with me

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is that a gunshot gun also a gun?

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It seems so

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That signal is more likely to be a secret from my father

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Is that power protecting the capital of the central kingdom?

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm Moroku Beijin, a former governor of the Laguna

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm Ganderl, a pure killer

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are many people around here

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I got a lot of attacks during the coming of the year

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This house is a red family

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What a coincidence

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There were about 10 of them

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Moroku

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I fought with them and killed them

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
10 of them are...

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Omigota

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're the famous princess of the Laguna

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm Jose

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You have a good skin and are raised by your father

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm Jose

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You have a good skin and are raised by your father

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm a woman

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm ready to fight with a mask

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're not going to be ashamed

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You should hide yourself in the house and be quiet

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You should aim at the wife's wife

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're not going to be mad

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to do the work on my own

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This way

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You killed Kiden too?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was in the army until I met him

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is that so?

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I was sent to the Great General's Marseille

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm Nara

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
From the General's Marseille?

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're not many

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Unfortunately

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Minori of the Saku-Motsu is a master of the Ryoshin

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not a master of the Ryoshin

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The Minori of the Saku-Motsu is different from the Ryoshin's Taren

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is because the Taren is short

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Father

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Among the Sackon's weirdness

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There are some people who hide their Chinese characters

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But if you're going to be mad

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's something special

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There's nothing special

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The Minori of the Saku-Motsu is not a good place to be

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're not a good person

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then why are you going on a trip?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll let you stay here for a while

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, in this Lagmora

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then let's have fun together

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, okay, let's go

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Stay here?

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're saying you'll let me stay here?

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And you're hiding women at home?

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're too stubborn

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Gundar is a pure killer

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's a man who's a great man of the King's

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But...

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Lagmora is a king of the East

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I won't forget that dream

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Thank you

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If this is also my role

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Um...

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's dirt on the back of the child

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I didn't have enough training

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to leave this kind of thing behind

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're the boy who ate a lot of new dishes

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And put a lot of effort into it

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, that's right

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm going home

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It seems like Kai and I are friends

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm actually the same

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm going to train as a soldier

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and eat a lot of new dishes

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm going to gain strength

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How strong are you?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Compared to the Kago mochi

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
New dishes?

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you Kago mochi?

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't have the God's permission

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then why?

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Even if you drink the soup and new dishes

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you can gain new dishes

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a countryside dish

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If you try it with the villagers

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it's a dish that can't be eaten for a lifetime

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then let me bring more

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's wrong?

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's natural to receive this amount of praise

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In any case, my lungs are pure sand used by the King of the Middle Ages

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hmm

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hey, you bastard, get up

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What a pure sand dish

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thanks to you, the food has become so cheap

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The sauce that's been added to it is being turned into us

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I wonder if it's going to come out soon

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The King's army

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes, until the end of the new part

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Moreover, this army is much larger than the soldiers

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is that so?

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is it true that we are the people's army?

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's not like that

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The fact that a powerful force is involved

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
must be a special purpose

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mars is doing that

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And they are aiming to achieve something

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
for that purpose

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What?

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm going to follow you to take that down

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But I'm not sure what's going on

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'd like to ask you to help me with the mission

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The children will be dirty

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I understand

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then let's choose the ones who can help the soldiers

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
God, can't you come to the temple for a while?

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't think it's going to be that long

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's the research of the Old Master

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What's wrong?

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
God, I can't go back to the temple

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I feel like...

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't worry

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The ones who have the power of the treasure

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
have responsibility for their land

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's why I'm going back

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have to protect this temple

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
God, you're cool

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
God

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Porek

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You said that you would follow the descendants of the Org

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you were to come here

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
to find the Org of your friends who defeated you

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's possible

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's okay

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm ready for that

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The Org of the Org

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Father

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you taking care of the girls?

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you're going to be the one to do the mission

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have to follow the descendants of the Org of the Org

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And you have to follow them

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Wait, Kai

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ul

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I said I wanted to eat this

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What?

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I tried to grab the radish

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I thought it was a rice ball that Kai was talking about

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How does it look like?

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, it looks like this

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Really?

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm glad

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What's wrong?

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I wonder why

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I remembered about my mother

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I haven't remembered for years

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Kai, I'll leave it to you

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you, I'll eat it carefully

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Be careful

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's not white anymore

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It looks like it was a black rain

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kai

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The girls are more quiet

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Forget it

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Everyone, come here

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What's this?

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So hot

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a black rain

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's not a black rain

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a black rain

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's a black rain

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a black rain

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's hot

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why did they kill us in this place?

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It seems that the Oog's army

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
was hit by the red sand

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The red sand is much more common than the Oog's

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It means that there was a strong difference in the force

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The Oog's side may not be a powerful army

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that was drawn to a strong response

261
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you trying to do with Oog?

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There is something that is following

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I heard about Narda with my father

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and I was looking for Narda

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and the same thing

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The father also...

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There was a rumor

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that a huge god who was involved in this

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
appeared

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A god?

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I, Oog, was also looking for

272
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
a god who appeared and found a voice

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The god who found that voice

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
must have a powerful voice

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
before he can be found by the Oog

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The mission I was given

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is to give them the voice

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and make them the god of the Oog

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What kind of god is that?

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The Lord of Mars was told about the prophecy

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The Lord of Mars was told about the Lord of Mars

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Man of Mars is awakened

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Theehreった again

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
His words were so terrible

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
внимание was the reason

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A god who re Depression

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
on what good this is...

288
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And this Oog

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
seems to be different

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
from those who fought at the Они

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Where is that?

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Looks like he's been attacked.

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's the Org?

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's go.

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Jose, it's dangerous!

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I won't let you leave!

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The house is being destroyed.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's the Usel family.

299
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Usel...

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He's a quiet and peaceful personality.

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He's not even a human family.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
His horns are cut off.

303
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He's the Org's son!

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Jose, we should stand up.

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There might be people hiding behind the attack.

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's search.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But...

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We can't abandon them.

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think I'm fine with any other actions.

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I want to see what's behind the attack.

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It might be the hands of the God I'm looking for.

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then let's put on the sword.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Okay.

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't do it.

315
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, right.

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, the village is empty.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Where did the village go?

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The house isn't destroyed.

319
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If it was the Org's technique,

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
it wouldn't be this bad.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Chid...

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He might be hiding behind the attack.

323
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is anyone there?

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't see anyone.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Be careful.

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The Org might be hiding.

327
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Kai isn't surprised, is he?

328
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hm?

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you look at my technique,

330
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
most people are surprised.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Have you ever seen it?

332
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well...

333
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've heard about it before.

334
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh...

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Look, the destruction is...

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's the Org's technique.

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Look, the destruction is...

338
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We're not enemies.

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Please be at ease.

340
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Org?

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's the destruction of the village's city.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's...

343
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm not a treasured person,

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
so I can't read the words of the destruction if I don't have one.

345
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The name of the village is...

346
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Azel Kazele.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Your Highness!

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This is...

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
All the Org's bodies are in this place.

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, we've found all of them around here.

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The destruction is at this level.

352
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It seems that the Org's body is not attacked by them.

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Look at the clothes they're wearing.

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This person looks like a village leader.

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
A leader? What does that mean?

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes, it's a treasured person.

357
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A woman can be a treasured person, but...

358
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's rare to find a woman.

359
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This deep wound...

360
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's the hand of the Org family.

361
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No matter how much you think of the Org,

362
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you can't defeat the Org's power.

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey, Karik...

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Wait a minute.

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What's wrong?

366
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a bit strange.

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I see. There's no doubt about it.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The order of the Orgs is given by this person's weapon.

369
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That means...

370
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes, the woman who defeated the Org is the treasured person.

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The person who defeated the Org's three bodies...

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I... I've shot this.

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Look at this.

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Three Org's bodies are in this one?

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The Org's power is high.

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The people who attacked the first person...

377
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and the woman who heard the scream was killed.

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's no way we can get the blood of the people.

379
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
She was standing and escaped from the village.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's why there's no other village.

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're so stupid.

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There's too much difference between Org and Uselger.

383
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
She knew that she wouldn't be able to defeat the overwhelming enemy.

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But she was able to overcome it.

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What do you think?

386
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This person must have supported her.

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
She was able to overcome the strong fear because she was supported by the people.

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The people's fear?

389
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And that's the truth that she can't be defeated by the Org.

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's what I think.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No matter how strong the enemy is, he won't give up.

392
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This is the real Org.

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I was wrong.

395
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This person's testimony was not true.

396
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sure Kago was tricked by someone new.

397
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
By the way, did this person's head have anything to do with the God he was looking for?

398
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No, that was the head of the people's head in this area.

399
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I understand it because I came here.

400
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Org's main body is in another place.

401
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The road is divided into two from the Org's battlefield.

402
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There's this village ahead of it and the Org has disappeared.

403
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So this is the road where the main body is.

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The road ahead?

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There seems to be a God's body in the back.

406
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's my body.

407
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm going to the temple.

408
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If the Org's speed is wrong, I'll confirm it with my own eyes.

409
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm confident in my legs.

410
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're an interesting person.

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Then, shall we ask for it?

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Satachi Keshu.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh.

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No.

416
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I won't let you do anything.

420
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll tell you a few words so that you don't understand.

421
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes.

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
As you've heard, the Org is aiming for this place.

423
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In the end, choose the number and decide on your own.

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There's nothing I can do about this place, but I can't just leave it like this.

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What was I expecting?

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's a summer-like sky.

428
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then, what's the point of this world?

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We'll disappear.

430
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't want this kind of thing, but...

431
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The blue moon is just a star.

432
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But people realize that it's loneliness.

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
In the night sky, I just want to talk about a life that I can't do just by existing.

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But I'm still waiting for the things to happen.

435
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If I let you go, I'll be myself.

436
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll be ready to lose to others.

437
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The Org is a place where you can't go.

438
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The Org is a place where you can't go.

439
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The Org is a place where you can't go.

440
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The Org is a place where you can't go.

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The Org is a place where you can't go.
