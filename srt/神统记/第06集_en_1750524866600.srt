1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the road.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The forest ahead of the road?

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There seems to be a god's hand behind it.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll go out to the main hall.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then, let's go.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes!

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll aim for it!

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, I'll shoot it!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fire! Fire! Fire!

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Fire! Fire! Fire!

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
While reaching the light of the future,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I live in the now that I don't stop.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to grab something, so I want to use it strongly.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The long road is so refreshing.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Where am I now?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Where is the goal I'm aiming for?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is that really true?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The moment I look at a different scenery from yesterday

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't say it well, but I can see the power that goes forward.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
While reaching the light of the future,

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I live in the now that I don't stop.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I won't be able to chase my dream.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I want to grab something, so I want to use it strongly.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Rigudanos.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is it really here?

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is it really near this village?

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's better to go back soon.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mr. Orha?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's the curse of the red-banded.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's the curse of the red-banded.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ganchi, Salamichi, Dendora, Ganjutsu, Mechireishi.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They're going to take us here.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I didn't expect this much.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can't hear it for 100 or 200.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please wait.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's too much to attack that.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But if you leave the Ajin-domo that Junsachi-sama attacked,

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
it will affect the Rage-mera.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a good idea to take a listen to this.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a bit of a mess these days.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The red-banded and the red-banded.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's going on?

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Did the red-banded guy find the Org's body?

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a shame.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Please, Kai.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you don't clear up where Org went,

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
we won't be able to do anything.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, Kai will come back anyway.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We can't move from here.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's good if you can come back safely.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is good.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I should have gone with you.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Princess.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not too late now.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I should have caught up with you.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Please don't say that.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But...

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's believe it.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
All we can do now is to believe in his return.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mr. Nada.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If you're Kai, you'll be fine.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
More than we think.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Um, which one?

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The one who can do the task of the army.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's only praying.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I knew it, Kai.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You'll guide me.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll keep going, right?

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is no joke!

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is no joke!

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is no joke!

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is no joke!

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ouch!

77
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
There's no doubt about it.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's the Oog's footsteps.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And that's a huge amount of money.

80
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,000
I knew it.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The one I was aiming for...

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ketchak!

83
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,000
God!

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
God!

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
God!

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You guys?

87
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Why?

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
As expected of the Lord.

89
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
You've already come this far.

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Porek?

91
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,000
I guess the Oog is heading for the valley.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
First, we need to confirm the location.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
That's the time for the investigation.

94
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I see.

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,000
That's why you guys don't have to come.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
Leave the valley to me.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If there's a reason to protect the valley,

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
there's one for us.

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
What?

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's a new village over there.

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,000
What's wrong with trying to protect it?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Ketchak...

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,500
We are the gods of the valley.

104
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
We have lost the Lord.

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,000
If we can be of any help, we'll be in great danger.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That will protect our safety.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I see.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
How can we be so brave to have such a great army?

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We must be careful.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How can we be so brave to be so brave?

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We must stop them as soon as possible.

112
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
We found them!

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is bad.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is bad.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is bad!

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It smells bad and doesn't fit in your mouth.

117
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,000
This is not just a piece of cake.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a symbol of the Kingdom of Raghumura.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's the name of that girl?

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm Elsa.

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The one with the sword is here.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, shall we eat?

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Um...

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Now...

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now...

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now...

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've brought you something.

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mr. Adelina...

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Please have some.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Mr. Junsatsushi.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mr. Adelina, thank you very much.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Um...

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I...

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You look so pale.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Even if a man who's in trouble comes back to life,

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
he'll be happy.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When will you be back?

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Really.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Adelina, we'll talk later.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We'll be busy from now on.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Kei-chan, you're doing it!

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I won't lose to Chibi's god!

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I won't let you go to Taniye!

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Toskuzuchi, do your best to get it.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What a fool.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll get it.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A box?

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That priest.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He's a big man.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's a big man.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A big man?

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He's a big warrior of the six realms,

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
a big man who's a big man.

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's a big man.

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He's a big man.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He's a big man.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He's a big man.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's the Rigdaros.

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You guys, get down.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's...

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He's going to kill me if I don't give him my heart!

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I didn't think it would happen,

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
but I finally found out

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that he was so close to me.

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The End

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Gwanbatengi, Jarkisnba Form Desk.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is that so?

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Is he dead?

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's dead?

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He's your descendant.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I haven't heard anything about him for a while.

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I should thank the bones of the dead.

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Bones?

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was able to find you because of them.

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kantei!

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll kill you!

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They're really the ones who got the gold.

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Wait here.

181
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I know.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is that all you got?

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What about this time?

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Kantei!

185
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There you go!

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's a good one!

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Kantei!

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Then...

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I did it!

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I won!

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's going to heal!

192
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's stuck!

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's going to heal.

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's the power of the skull.

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No, even if I make it into a skull,

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it's going to heal.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can't believe it.

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is this the next one?

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The man who's been caught.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He's gone.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There!

202
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have to finish him before God returns.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll steal you all.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll kill you and make the tiger my slave.

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll kill you!

206
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll make you...

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Fire!

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll kill you!

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I see. This is interesting.

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's that move?

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Will you be careful?

212
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The enemy's attack...

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll kill you all!

214
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll burn you all!

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Fire!

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How's that?

217
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Master!

218
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't hear you! Why?

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll always be here for God's sake.

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
God has the power to do his own thing.

221
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
For God who knows the world's words,

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
he's easy to protect the skull from the enemy.

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a hot day.

224
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Even if I get hurt, I'll heal right away.

225
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't think I can use magic.

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What should I do?

227
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Fire!

228
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Are you okay, Kai?

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Hurry!

230
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Prepare to start the fight!

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Shut up! I know!

232
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll be right back!

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's go.

234
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Fire!

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
T-this is...

236
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No way.

237
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There's too much power in front of the skull.

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not good.

239
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The power of the skull that I've found

240
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
will be in the hands of the evil.

241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You're so annoying, God of the Skull.

242
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If I don't do this,

243
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
everyone will have to protect me.

244
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't do this.

245
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I still have the hands.

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Lord.

247
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Lord Koeyu.

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It seems that you've lost your laugh.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have no time.

250
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's no other way to defeat the skull of God.

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're a master of the reality.

252
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
God of this world,

253
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll know it.

254
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
God of the Skull,

255
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'll know the power of the skull.

256
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
For the sake of our great king,

257
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll kill you, the Skull!

258
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What is this?

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That king...

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He should have been protected by the skull.

261
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Lord's light?

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll kill you!

263
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That beautiful girl

264
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
is the future that surpasses the reality!

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
God of the Skull,

266
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll kill you!

267
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
God of the Skull,

268
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'll kill you!

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's a trick I've never heard of before.

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's getting interesting.

271
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It seems that it's going to rain.

272
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Princess!

273
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Princess!

274
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Princess!

275
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Princess!

276
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll take your power.

277
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Princess!

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
All of you, become my power!

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What is this?

280
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What the hell happened?

281
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What's wrong with you, Lord?

282
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Hey, wake up!

283
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
God!

284
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wake up!

285
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
God!

286
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The End
