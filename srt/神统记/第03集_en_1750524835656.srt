1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The last one is...

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No way...

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A god?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is this the place where the skull is located?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I am the head of the Edamura village, the skull of Eidalen.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's why I have a responsibility here.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is my village!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The sun is hot, the moon is moving hotly.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am the long road of the day.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where am I now?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Where is the goal?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Is that really true?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The moment I look at different scenery from yesterday

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power that goes forward

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
While reaching the light of the future

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I live in the now of the unending flower

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won't be able to achieve my dream from the beginning

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to show you my strength because I have something I want to grab

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The heat is hot, the moon is moving hotly

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The End

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The End

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was so excited that I came out of the car in front of the enemy

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was so excited that I was about to throw my back at the enemy

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But now you know

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's useless to be a woman without a skill

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But even if you are a woman...

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What was the most important thing?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't get mad at me for that

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I will kill you from the middle of the world soon

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I understand

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will send my apology to the soldiers

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Father, I am sorry

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Did you say you were angry?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I am looking forward to seeing you have the nerve to beat the demon alone

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You are right

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's true that Edamura is a great role

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, it's not like that

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I just wanted to do it

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I heard from Akizata

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You were talking to Mr. Jiozai with a lot of affection

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hey, you must have smelled good

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm doing something again

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why is my man only a woman?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you doing here?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sorry

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think he was just a little bit too much

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
El, you really have a good eye for Kai

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then you should go to the fast place

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Otherwise, you will be kicked by another woman

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't think so

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Kai, wait

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Isn't that Kai?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
With Mr. Jiozai?

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Um, I was just talking to you

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you for helping me in Edamura

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I haven't said my thanks yet

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I will thank you again from the bottom of my heart

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, but you have a question on your face

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't know

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
When I was in front of the enemy, my legs couldn't move

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I told you that you shouldn't use your power

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You don't have the heart to use it with technology

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mr. Jiozai

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So I will start training every day from tomorrow morning

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will do it more seriously than before, so you should join me

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey, Kai, did you understand?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Kai's guy? Why are you angry with Mr. Jiozai?

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm so jealous

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm so jealous

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to be your partner from tomorrow

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Huh?

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Maybe it's me?

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Everyone is so noisy

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I was thirsty

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think it's better than usual

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm glad

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mr. L, help me out

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
See you later

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's spring

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, it's not

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Bird?

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Kai?

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I heard it somewhere

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I see

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I heard it with that bird

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to go to the bird

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm going to the bird

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Over there

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's this?

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's so fast! It's like it's gone mad

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I like this place

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You were crying at that time

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, I can't read it like the grave of Edamura

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You gave me the treasure because you saved me from that wound

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If that's the case, I haven't said anything yet

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to the bird

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I guess it's like this

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's strange

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It should be dark, but it looks good

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is this also the power of the skull?

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a tree

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's a tree

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a tree

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's delicious

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a rich forest, and there's plenty of water and food

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I wish I could live here

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then I should build a house here

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If I were to live here, I'd have to cut the tree first

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But this is impossible

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll do something with magic

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll kill this

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh no, the tree is burning

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I guess it's impossible

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I could've put out the fire from the place where there's nothing

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I should have gotten something

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's think about it

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That magic was a real reality because it was made to be like this

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can imagine it

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Cutting is to get the blood of a warrior

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you mean?

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A warrior? Blood?

134
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You don't remember me again?

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, that's what it means

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's right

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm not cutting the tree

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm cutting the blood of a warrior

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I can slip between a warrior and a warrior

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't see the evil spirit

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What?

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Something is approaching

143
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's a Terugut individual

144
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Gubolt

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Ionugut

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Takari Yazeta

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What are they doing?

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't think they can get in

149
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They're coming

151
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They're coming

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What are they?

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They're not kids

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They're just kids

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They're just kids

156
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Shut up

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you understand the word?

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What?

160
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
My name is Porek

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm the king of the Kororuzoku

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kororuzoku?

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've never seen him before

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I can speak the word of the people

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There's a lot of people in the people

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Our products are good for the people

168
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
First, we entered the forbidden land

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We have a lot of people in the town

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
On top of that, we have a lot of people

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
who want to be a part of the mission

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We look like the people

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What?

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait a minute

175
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We, the Kororuzoku,

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
live in the forest, where we celebrate the landlady's birthday

177
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But a few days ago,

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
many soldiers attacked us

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
without taking our landlady

180
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You mean the king?

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We were not against them

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We fled the landlady's land

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
after we were used to living for years

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So we came to save the landlady

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What?

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The landlady?

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Please, we'll save the landlady

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Please, we ask for your help

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Please, let us know

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait a minute

192
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The landlady?

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What is that?

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The landlady

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is a god who has the power to rule the whole world

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and protects the landlady

197
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That is...

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What?

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No, I don't know such a big deal

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't believe that this is the true god

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What?

202
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In the ancient times, the gods we have been to

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
were the warriors who gave us the precious punishment

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But the people who gave us the punishment

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
are the people of this landlady

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Who is the landlady?

207
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, I believe in the gods

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is the landlady who was in the water

209
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and was the god who was in the anger of the gods

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Did the god of the landlady meet the god?

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The light is gone, but we can see many things

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This world is full of all kinds of spiritual power

213
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You are also full of great spiritual power

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If you look at the light, you can see it for the first time

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You are the god who gave us the punishment

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Am I the god of the landlady?

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You are right

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And we have already given the word of the god

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The god?

221
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, I will go

222
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Our daughter, Louie, has already given her life to the gods

223
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
She is here

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't be kidding, I don't need anything

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Did you kill her?

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
She is falling

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Louie

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to come

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't be ridiculous

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I will not let you go to the people's base

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She is here

232
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Be strong!

233
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Hey!

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If you keep doing this, you will be able to heal your wounds

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You can do it!

236
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can imagine that you will be healed

237
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You will return the hurt part to the original

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The hurt cells

239
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The cells...

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know what to do

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But I will make them work

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Is it done?

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I should be sleeping for a while

244
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Can magic cure people's wounds?

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Org?

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Org?

247
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's go to the city!

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Ketchak, the king

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Maideko!

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I... I'm dead!

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm dead, jungle!

252
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What are you doing here?

253
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm going to the city

254
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The treasure?

255
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Kill them

256
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They are dead

257
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

258
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Kishame the fear

259
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The voice of the god of the birds?

260
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Kishame the fear

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I will help you

262
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I will help you to get the treasure

263
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We, the Kororozoku and Hacharumura, will take this time to the god of the birds

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I will give you my respect

265
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Now, we will just kill them

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ketchak, Ketchak, Zarande, Toshika

267
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Take this, you scoundrel!

268
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will kill you, Zarin!

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You are going to kill them, grandpa

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We, the Kororozoku and the Org, will take this time to the god of the birds

271
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We will just kill them

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I won't let you go back to the city

273
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wait!

274
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
We have no relationship with the Kororozoku and the Org!

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You are in the way!

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We have a relationship

277
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What?

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You are in this valley by yourself

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's enough

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Wait! We will go down!

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So let us go!

282
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let us go!

283
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The valley of the valley of the valley

284
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I will kill you

285
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What?

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is my valley

287
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, the god of the birds

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Please, please, please

289
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Then I will kill you

290
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
God!

291
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What happened?

292
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let us go to hell

293
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I will kill you

294
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Stop it! Stop it!

295
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I will kill you

296
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That is the god of the birds

297
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Lord Borek

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I will make a mistake

299
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The big fire that burned my eyes

300
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That god took away the fire

301
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And gave me the precious

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That Kororozoku

303
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The god of the birds

304
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The god of the birds

305
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The god of the birds

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The god of the birds

307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The god of the birds

308
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then, what about this world?

309
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We will disappear

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We are not like this

311
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We are not like this

312
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The blue moon is just beautiful

313
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But people realize that they are all dead

314
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
In the night sky

315
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Just exist

316
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I want to talk about a life that I can't do

317
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But I still

318
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I am satisfied that I am there

319
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
If I lose you

320
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I will be myself

321
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I will be myself

322
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I will be myself

323
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I will be myself
