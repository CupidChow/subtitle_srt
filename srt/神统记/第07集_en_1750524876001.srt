1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,860
The first mentioned Śo rally.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,240
No one konkex railroadring!

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,040
out team

4
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Where is it?

5
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Is it really true?

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,040
The moment I look at a different view from yesterday

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,040
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power of moving forward

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,040
While reaching the light of the future

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,040
I'm living in a moment of endless pain

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Even if I get close, even if I get close

11
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I can't dream from any point, but

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I want to show you the strength because I have something I want to grab

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,040
The heat is hot, the moon is moving hot

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
The psychological search engine

15
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Lord... Lord...

16
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,040
What happened to you two?

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,040
I heard that after you ate the new seat of the Yoroimusha

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
The wind blew and it was the first time I was born

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
I knew it, something terrible happened

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
If this Yoroimusha is as strong as the Adulakan

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,040
The power of the Earth God is also a brother of the Sazokashi

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,040
But the Lord took away the new seat

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,040
And was taken away by the Adulakan and the God's son

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Did I take away that power?

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,040
The first thing that happened to me was the secret of God

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Is the power that God gives you

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Is it so hard to do such a thing?

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm going to tell you how to use this power

29
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Didn't you notice that?

30
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Huh?

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
While I was fighting

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,040
I felt a bad sight like being swallowed

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
That's me too

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
I knew it

35
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,040
I didn't feel any enemy, but I don't know what that is

36
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Well, we're going back to Tani

37
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Be careful and go home

38
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Yes

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Oh, that's right

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Thanks to this, I was saved

41
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Thank you, El

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Is this the right way?

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Kai, you're back

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Kai, the Goddess has fallen down

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
What?

46
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
What happened?

47
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I was out of the heat and fell down

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
What?

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
This move?

50
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
I have a feeling

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Kai, how was the Org?

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
More than that, now...

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
The Goddess will take you home soon

54
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
So, where is Org?

55
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,040
When I found her, she was already killed by someone

56
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
What?

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
You're kidding me?

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,040
The Org was surrounded by a body of a captain who was in danger

59
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,040
The other soldiers ran away, but they weren't here anymore

60
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Is it possible that the captain was killed and the team was disbanded?

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,040
The commander of the cargo base is like that

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Then, it's better to return the Goddess to the village

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Let's go back to the Lag village

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
The Org is here

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
It's blood-sucking

66
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I'm sure it was when we were running in the mud

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Is that so?

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
What is this?

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Did you get attacked by the demon?

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
While we were chasing the Org?

71
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Go ahead and look at the situation

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
If you're in trouble, you can't take the Goddess

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I understand

74
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Kai, are you back?

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Master Pasuko, what is this?

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,040
You were attacked by the demon

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
So much?

78
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
You attacked me with a lot of force

79
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Master Goto was attacked by the demon himself

80
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,040
But the villagers' presence is also like that of the Org

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
This is terrible

82
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
It's a good thing to be here

83
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Kai, Kai

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Elsa!

85
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Kai!

86
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Kai!

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm glad

88
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Jose!

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
You too?

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Master Bejin, that girl must be...

91
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I know. She might have been attacked by someone

92
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Lord Orh!

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Lord Sard, you two should meet with the Org

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm going to get more and more

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm going to fight again

96
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Thank you

97
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I didn't know there was such a big damage in the village

98
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,040
I was here with my mother and my sister

99
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I was scared, but I was relieved when I saw Kai's face

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Then I won't come

101
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Thank you

102
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Be careful

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
That's right. I have to say thanks to Elsa

104
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
With the rice you gave me...

105
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Manso!

106
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
You came here to this place?

107
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
I called you from Master Goto

108
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,040
I see. Then the Org has no longer been in the village

109
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Yes

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
It's not just Jose

111
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,040
It's also the Orh

112
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,040
This is the result of the curse that was cast on the dead of the village

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Curse?

114
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
The red silk

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,040
It's the biggest force of the Kago-mochi, which attacks the village

116
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,040
And according to the report of the Monomi

117
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,040
The next attack will be a victory

118
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,040
If you curse, Lord Orh will be able to fight again

119
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Kai, I hope you will be with me and the Kai's people

120
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
You will curse at once

121
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I want to ask for your forgiveness

122
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Why me?

123
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Because I am watching over your power

124
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,040
The destination is that配-dry village where you are buried

125
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,040
The Orh's god is Elgmura and the Goddess of Jose is Edamura

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
The Rage village's treasure is on this person

127
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,040
I'm glad. I will give you one chance

128
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm counting on you, Kai

129
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes

130
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
You're not enough!

131
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm back!

132
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,040
What are you looking at? You're a bastard!

133
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,040
If Lord Junsatsushi is also a Kago-mochi, won't you give me a ticket?

134
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
I want you to do that

135
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,040
If you want to die, come with me

136
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Yes

137
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Elsa, are you there?

138
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Kai, what's wrong?

139
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Well, the rice ball was good

140
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Thanks to that, I was saved

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Really? Thank goodness

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
But I have to go again

143
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
But I'll be back soon, so it's okay

144
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Once this is over, I'll take Elsa to the place where she is buried

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Let's go there and eat rice balls

146
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Yes, I understand

147
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm waiting

148
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I'll be back

149
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm sorry, I made you wait

150
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
That's...

151
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
It's a gift from Lord Rejin

152
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I need you to be released

153
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Did Kai come to meet someone?

154
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
No, he didn't

155
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I have a life of a person who I've left far behind

156
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm a criminal of the Binbo family

157
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,040
I'm a person who was seriously injured to get the god of the Kaden

158
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
But I wasn't chosen as a Kago-mochi

159
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I lost my place at home

160
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,040
I was the one who knocked on the door of the camp

161
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
And then, every day, the days of the main camp

162
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Love and joy, sometimes sadness

163
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,040
I have to protect the life that overflowed with such emotions

164
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Lady...

165
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Let's go

166
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
The End

167
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,040
That's the Elgmura village, where Lord Oruha's head is buried

168
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Yes, I wonder how many red apples are there

169
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Let me see

170
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
It feels like I was seen at that time

171
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
At that time?

172
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
No, that's...

173
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
This is called the Hundred Eyes

174
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,040
It's a legendary technique that was invented by the Great In

175
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,040
No matter how far away it is, it's not a secret

176
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I understand the Elgmura village

177
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
There are five Kego

178
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Let's go

179
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,040
The Elgmura Village

180
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Lady, you're so nice

181
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
You finally came out

182
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I wanted to see that in person

183
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
I would like to say this again

184
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,040
I was used more than Mars by the name of the search for God

185
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
The true search engine, Nara

186
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Please forgive me, my apologies

187
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I would like to ask you to help me to report to the people

188
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,040
by the power of the God who is above

189
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Please, I beg you

190
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
I have to explain to Lord Oruha

191
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Then, excuse me

192
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Now, the people's kingdom of the East is in need of a new strong God

193
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Is that why you brought me here?

194
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Do you know why you need a strong God?

195
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,040
That's because the kingdom is getting stronger than it is now

196
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,040
To be honest, let me tell you

197
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Our kingdom of the East is in need of a new one

198
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,040
It's a time to reduce the age

199
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
No way

200
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Lord Gundar is a good example

201
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
The King's treasure, the King's treasure

202
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,040
is dirty and forgotten by the King

203
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,040
As a result, the power of the God who supports the King has been gradually increased

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Even in this village, if the kingdom is strong like it used to be

205
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
the army will be destroyed from the middle of the kingdom

206
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,040
and it will be destroyed without being abandoned

207
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
The kingdom is getting weaker

208
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
The tragedy that happened in this village

209
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,040
will only increase from now on

210
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
It's hard to support the King

211
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
even if the rotten dead die

212
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Even if the kingdom is destroyed

213
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
by the King's power

214
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,040
You must not be a strong God

215
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Lord Oruha, you are so selfish

216
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
That's...

217
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,040
The God of this village is the God of the Lagmura

218
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,040
The blood of the Bejin who has that treasure

219
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,040
The end of the meeting

220
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
The world is now facing a big change

221
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,040
To take the Lagmura, the red demon is a curse to destroy it

222
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,040
and to seal the battle of the treasure

223
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Even if the simple land is weakened and the land is destroyed

224
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,040
it is being chased

225
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
It's being chased

226
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,040
In my research, the red land seems to be in great danger

227
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,040
The danger of being unable to continue to live in that land

228
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,040
The new life of the Red Clan is not looking for a new life

229
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I think so

230
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Even if we are following the Oru

231
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Are the Oru being chased?

232
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,040
It is said that they are being threatened by the illegal business that is coming from the north

233
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,040
They needed the new God to do that

234
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,040
So they sent a rigged Arcan

235
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Now that the kingdom is facing a big change

236
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
it is no longer a matter of the destruction of the people

237
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Do you understand, Kai?

238
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
To save the people's million

239
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,040
will you be able to give the power of your God to the kingdom?

240
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Lord Oruha

241
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Kill him

242
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Kai, kill him

243
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,040
It's too big to talk about

244
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Let me think about it

245
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
I understand

246
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Next, Eda village

247
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Please reply to me before you leave the monster there

248
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,040
The mother's breath is blowing

249
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Oruha

250
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,040
She seems to be unconscious

251
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
I see

252
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Lord Narda's life is very difficult

253
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,040
If Oruha can fight

254
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
she will have a great power

255
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Call for help

256
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I wondered too much about someone like God

257
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
and what it would be good to use

258
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
But for the sudden revolt

259
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Maybe that's how you use it to prevent this kind of village from being built.

260
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,040
But why is the god of the other gods angry?

261
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Have you thought about it?

262
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
No.

263
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:59,040
If your god is added to the kingdom's chain, you will receive the divine love.

264
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Your power will also be even more powerful.

265
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,040
It will be easier to save the people of the Laguna.

266
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Of course, you are also important.

267
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
What's wrong?

268
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,040
If there are people who have to protect other than the Laguna...

269
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh, you mean the Kororusok?

270
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,040
You were in that battle field.

271
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,040
They have responsibility to protect me.

272
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Have you already disappeared?

273
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Yes.

274
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
I want you to show me what you have.

275
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
What? Why do I have to show you?

276
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,040
You can't accept the royal priest's request for the royal priest's death.

277
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,040
People are born as a family and are tested by heaven.

278
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Do you have anything else to do with other people?

279
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
They are not nice.

280
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I want you to give all your god's power to the kingdom of the east and the west.

281
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,040
If that's the case, I can't do it.

282
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,040
The Kagomachi has a responsibility to protect the people living there.

283
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,040
They can't do that until they abandon me.

284
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
You mean to change that thought?

285
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,040
No. I refuse to do that.

286
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Your decision is hard.

287
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I can't change your decision.

288
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Let's give up.

289
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,040
I'll let Mars do something.

290
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Your Highness!

291
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Forbidden!

292
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I'll kill you, you bastard!

293
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Well, what's going on with the Laguna?

294
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm sure there's still more to this.

295
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm worried about Jose and Elsa too.

296
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Let's go back.

297
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
What?

298
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
I'm so stupid.

299
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Your Highness!

300
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Wake up, Your Highness!

301
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm so stupid.

302
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm so stupid.

303
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
I'm so stupid.

304
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
I'm so stupid.

305
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm so stupid.

306
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
I'm so stupid.

307
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm so stupid.

308
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm so stupid.

309
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm so stupid.

310
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I'm so stupid.

311
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm so stupid.

312
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I'm so stupid.

313
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I'm so stupid.

314
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm so stupid.

315
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
I'm so stupid.

316
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm so stupid.

317
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm so stupid.

318
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
I'm so stupid.

319
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
I'm so stupid.

320
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
I'm so stupid.

321
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm so stupid.

322
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I'm so stupid.

323
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm so stupid.

324
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
I'm so stupid.

325
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
I'm so stupid.

326
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
I'm so stupid.

327
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
I'm so stupid.

328
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
I'm so stupid.

329
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
If you get rid of me,

330
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
I won't say right words.

331
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
I will be myself.

332
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
I won't lose my mind.

333
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I will be myself.
