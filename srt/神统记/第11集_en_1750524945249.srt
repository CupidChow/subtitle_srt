1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The last one is...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He's been killed.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He's gone.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We'll have to wait and see.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You and I were just killing each other.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You should save him this time.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Please.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're too reckless!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I should try a new one.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But that's a princess.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's a thing that's been passed down to the Morokuken.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You can't get lost when you use it.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you get lost, you can't get the real power to fight.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's a good thing to say.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In this form,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll forgive you, my prince.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want to grab you.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to hold you tight.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The heat is hot.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The heat is hot.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know the way.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a long road.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Where am I now?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Where is the goal?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Where am I now?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is that really true?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The moment I look at a different view from yesterday

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power to move forward.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
While reaching the light of the future,

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm living in a place where I can't see.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Even if I get close,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I won't be able to chase my dream.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to hold you tight.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The heat is hot.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The heat is hot.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know the way.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Diabo!

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A small thing like this is a strange coincidence with a wolf of the Kanae.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is he the father of Sard?

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know how much it's easy.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What happened?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll ask you what to do first.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Where did Diabo come from?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It seems that the darkness of the Demon Clan was created.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Darkness?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The king who lost his life was a coward and a coward.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The birds were stealing the seeds of our family and stealing the dam.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They didn't look at the life of the living people.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Demon Clan was just a bird.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Our dragon kingdom is now retreating tope the mutilies.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's Vernal and cadavering.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,840
The land will be tied to the�

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,000
But there's another taxes to be paid in order to clear the crops.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There was a boy named Sendor who went to the Northland.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
His name was Sendor.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There is a limit to the god who can give you the blood of the King.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you are a master, you have to take it from the side.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He didn't choose the master.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And he betrayed him.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The gods of the Northland who betrayed him were forced to surrender to the Northland.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A new disaster occurred.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The one who returned to the Heju was sent to the Northland.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He was forced to surrender.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And he is still sitting here.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Here?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
As long as Geek can live there,

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
our land is wild.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My crops are just weak.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Lord Amrildor.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We were cared for by god at this time.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It does not have the blood of單合.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,980
I have fallen backwards due to this cond.,

73
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,240
I have fallen backwards due to this cond.,

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,220
heroines,

75
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,800
Please, please, please....

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,600
Hey...

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll kill you.

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I'll kill you.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'll kill you.

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'll kill you.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I'll kill you.

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I'll kill you.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll kill you.

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I'll kill you.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I'll kill you.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I'll kill you.

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll kill you.

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I'll kill you.

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I'll kill you.

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I'll kill you.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I'll kill you, the king.

92
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Why do we have to do the murder of the king?

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm not mistaken.

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I just do what I want to.

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, it's fine, right?

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Me.

97
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,520
Halina oxygen- 我份化水

98
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,720
何時後花啊

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,640
《ワシの神 AE bad Colossus sedimentary sugnate swift 180% Max height習慣さ啦難時間量いろ

100
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,580
神味 The malicious injustice and implant causing others to live

101
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
好的向下離去

102
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,540
以後、雙半廳的何人

103
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,840
We're taking Deer Ball from here.

104
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,480
And we're taking him back.

105
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
What's that?

106
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
It's a house.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
What's with the royal family?

108
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,800
What are you doing at this time?

109
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,880
There's a wolf here.

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,120
We're the ones taking Deer Ball.

111
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,960
You're not going to die, Deer Ball.

112
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,360
It's the freedom of the world!

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,960
Freedom?

114
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,080
He's back?

115
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
Who's that?

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
That's the whole family.

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,520
Deer Ball.

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
Deer Ball.

119
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,200
The power of Deer Ball is so strong that the league is shaking.

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,360
You're not going to die!

121
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
You're not going to die!

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
Wait!

123
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,120
Kill him!

124
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,360
Kill him!

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Kill him!

126
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,720
That's Deer Ball.

127
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,760
It smells terrible.

128
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Do you know the century?

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
What do you mean?

130
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Master.

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes, that's right.

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,360
We can't meet him in this world.

133
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Zongeri!

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Deer Ball!

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Kutteib.

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Deer Ball!

137
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Deer Ball!

138
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Is that Deer Ball?

139
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
The royal family's evil spirit.

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
But it's just a beginning.

141
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
The next king is Abridor.

142
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
He's not as evil as the other demons.

143
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Deer Ball is...

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
And that woman is...

145
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Baralon Shigeite!

146
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Sarabandi Fall!

147
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Deuro!

148
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Deuro?

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
The power of the power that controls the blood of the north.

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,360
But why is the northern guardian here?

151
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Casviel Jingdeles Hylbionoris.

152
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
That demon?

153
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,360
He seems to be acting with a dragon.

154
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,360
He's controlling the guardian?

155
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Test Logget Deer Ball!

156
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Deuro!

157
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Deuro!

158
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Wow!

159
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
It's really the fire of the gods!

160
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Is he going to burn the Rear Ball?

161
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
What the hell is that?

162
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
No.

163
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Huh? He's not listening?

164
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,360
It seems that he's in a great deal of trouble.

165
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Tch, Tumoriya Sword.

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Jennas Kogen!

167
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Cavalot?

168
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
What the hell?

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Hey!

170
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
What did he do during the training?

171
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
He must have been trying to get the best of his life.

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
If he takes too much, he'll be poisoned.

173
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Poison?

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,360
He's trying to get him to do that?

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
What the hell?

176
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Maito-Dead!

177
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Stangarizun!

178
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Zantaki Ranch!

179
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Tubetsuka!

180
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
What happened?

181
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I couldn't see him being attacked,

182
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
but if he does, he might be able to defeat Deer Ball.

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Deer Ball's body.

184
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
His whole body is poisoned.

185
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
If he's bitten, he'll die.

186
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
What?

187
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,360
We're all friends now.

188
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Now, while they're in trouble, Deer Ball...

189
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
You're so stupid.

190
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Hey, Krabi!

191
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I came here to get you guys!

192
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Thunder, Cajipic...

193
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I came here as a super-deer!

194
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
The king of the world!

195
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
What's going on?

196
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
He's not dead yet,

197
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
but his soul is still weak.

198
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,360
I don't know if he's poisoned, but he must be able to get his life back.

199
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
It's no surprise that he's weak.

200
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Maybe...

201
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
he's got a sense of the gods in his heart.

202
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Then, I'll let him wake up one by one.

203
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Electric shock?

204
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I don't know what's going on,

205
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
but I'll use my power to...

206
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Kai!

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,360
You killed that girl with your own power!

208
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
You!

209
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I really...

210
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
have this power...

211
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
What are you doing, god?

212
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Captain!

213
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Don't do this!

214
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
You're going to get hurt!

215
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
I don't know what to do,

216
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
but let's all just keep going!

217
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I know!

218
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,360
The End

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
That's...

220
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
the memory of Deuro.

221
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Oh, god!

222
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
What's wrong with you?

223
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Don't think it's bad.

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,360
This world has always been stolen and taken away.

225
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Then, I'll take away the strong one.

226
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
That's the world's promise.

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Now, change me.

228
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
To change this broken-hearted man.

229
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Broken-hearted?

230
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Don't you feel better?

231
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Hurry up, Okinae!

232
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Let's go!

233
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm back!

234
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
You did it, god!

235
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
I managed to save you this time.

236
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
The End

237
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
This is not the end.

238
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
What should we do?

240
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Wait.

241
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Attack the Zashou.

242
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
God?

243
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
The Zashou, too.

244
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Wait!

245
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Zashou?

246
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Attack the new seat?

247
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Where is the new seat of the Ganjin?

248
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,360
How can I destroy it without touching it?

249
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
This world is so ugly.

250
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Sendor, I'm the same as you.

251
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
This is it.

252
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
You're a fool.

253
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,360
The strong one is just a piece of trash.

254
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,360
You and I...

255
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
What?

256
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
They're looking for the place where they came from.

257
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,360
You've finally decided not to go there.

258
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
You're a fool.

259
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
You're a fool.

260
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
You're already...

261
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,360
I'll give you my power.

262
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Kill them! Take them!

263
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
We have to take the new seat.

264
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
We have to take the new god.

265
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
There's no way we can survive.

266
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
We have to break this hand.

267
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
We have to take revenge.

268
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:59,360
I'm the one who turned the god into the body of the new god.

269
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,360
I've taken the Zashou with the power you've got.

270
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,360
I'll kill you and take everything.

271
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
I'll change this chain.

272
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
What are you doing, Deuro?

273
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
You...

274
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
What are you doing?

275
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
You're still a dirty god?

276
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Kill Diablo!

277
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Stop it.

278
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
He's still unwell.

279
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Don't be so hasty.

280
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
I'll buy you a knife to use as my shield.

281
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,360
So you want me to use it like a tool?

282
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
You're just born into a king.

283
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
You're such a big man!

284
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
What?

285
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
You're a king.

287
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,360
You're the old man with this dirty power.

288
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,360
You're a disgusting monster born into a god.

289
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,360
How did you get that power?

290
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Did you steal it or steal it?

291
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I know.

292
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,360
You were desperate to get rid of the world.

293
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,360
But that's what life is all about.

294
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360
That's...

295
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,360
You and I are living to survive.

296
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
What's the difference?

297
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,360
That's the bottom line.

298
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Don't make me laugh.

299
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Lord Haruji!

300
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
You...

301
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,360
You're still a king even if you touch Diablo?

302
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Yes.

303
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,360
As I thought, the god's power was the only thing that burned the planet.

304
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Deuro...

305
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
What the hell is this?

306
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,360
They're taking away so much meat that they're still alive!

307
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
They're going back to their main body!

308
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
What's wrong?

309
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
What's going on?

310
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Kai...

311
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
It's God...

312
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
God...

313
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Diablo's body is...

314
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Until the first fall of the world,

315
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
all things that exist will be swallowed by Diablo.

316
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
What?

317
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
You're the one, Diablo!

318
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Deuro!

319
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Xendolme...

320
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
I won't let you go!

321
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
What the hell is this?

322
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Keiga!

323
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,360
I can't live anymore.

324
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,360
What's the hope?

325
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
It's a guy I've been expecting.

326
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
It's a sky.

327
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Then, what's the point of this world?

328
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,360
We're all going to disappear.

329
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,360
We're not going to be like this.

330
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
We're not going to be like this.

331
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Even though we're just a few stars,

332
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,360
people will notice that we're alone.

333
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,360
We're just going to exist in the night sky.

334
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,360
We want to talk about our lives that we can't do.

335
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:08,360
But I'm still waiting for you to come.

336
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,360
If you're gone,

337
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
I'll be the one to say the last word.

338
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,360
I'll be ready to lose to you.

339
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,360
The End

340
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Destruction and Rebirth

341
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,360
What will the world see in the end?

342
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
The final episode, The Master of the Kanae.

343
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
The one waiting for the sky.
