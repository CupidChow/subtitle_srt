1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The last one, Teogonia, is...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, it's time for the new one.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Zero!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Demon Slayer!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It seems like my life is being stolen.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
While reaching the light of the future,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm living in a moment of unending pain.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to grab something, so I want to use it strongly.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, it's moving.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The long road that is so bright,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where am I now?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where is the goal I'm aiming for?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that really true?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The moment I'm looking at a different scenery than yesterday,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power that I'm advancing.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
While reaching the light of the future,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm living in a moment of unending pain.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close,

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't dream from any point, but

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to grab something, so I want to use it strongly.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, it's moving.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jyosei-sama.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Jyosei-sama.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Jyosei-sama.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jyosei-sama.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Jyosei-sama.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jyosei-sama.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Jyosei-sama.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Jyosei-sama.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Jyosei-sama.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Jyosei-sama.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Jyosei-sama.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The power...

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If I eat this...

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's the first time I've eaten a new stone by myself.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's deep.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The blood won't stop.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't do it anymore.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's beautiful.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can die while watching this.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But I didn't want to die.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's wrong, Manso? The war is over.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's wrong with him?

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Look, he always sticks to you.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Forget it.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's always the same.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm dead.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you alive?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was supposed to be injured.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It doesn't hurt.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm healing.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why?

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because I ate the gold stone.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But that wound is only healed by sleeping.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's this?

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a wound.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a wound.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What's this?

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is this a stardust?

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's nostalgic.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's being dug.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is this all written on it?

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Then, Kimahou!

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why is this power?

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't believe it.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A newspaper?

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Is this a proof of stardust?

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's gone.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's this?

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I've never seen this kind of text.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know why.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's impossible to find a newspaper or stardust.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't believe it.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have to go back to where everyone is.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Is this rock weak?

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My power?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Did I do it?

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This power is amazing.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's more than magic.

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But is it really stardust?

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I told you that you can eat stardust.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
When did you get it?

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When you were injured?

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If I really became a stardust,

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I might be a thief.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Wait.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I have a newspaper, but I don't think it's stardust.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I guess I should be quiet.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Everyone!

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That bastard.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Go to work.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's your job.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wait a minute.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What?

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How much stardust do you like?

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
How come you're so strong?

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're so serious.

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You don't show up when you're not serious?

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're a weirdo.

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why are you so strong?

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, I actually ate a lot of stardust.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What?

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
When I was in the war in Banyamura,

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
there were a lot of wolves in the forest.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
About 10 or 20?

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Did you eat that much alone?

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was hungry and injured, so I couldn't stand it.

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's because you have a lot of power.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey!

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Elsa, what are you looking at?

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did you find a good person?

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's not true!

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How is the preparation?

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Princess.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a good thing.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We chose the one we grew up because we were so good at raising the child.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hm.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We are a weirdo, but we can make this much stardust.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We call him the evil egg of the father who will make the land a better place.

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The treasure is the land's protection.

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
By being strong, the land will be rich.

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alright, no one is here today.

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Focus.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Get out!

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hima-ho!

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's here.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't feel any less power.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have no doubt that I have a lot of power now.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But, is it really the power of the treasure?

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Who is there?

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Princess, why is Princess Lyosuke here?

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That finger...

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Um, sorry.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wait.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What were you doing here?

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I won't go back until I talk.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sorry.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, this is what you mean?

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You said you could try the technique of the fire you heard in the morning.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes, that's right.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think you are a master of the technique.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The technique?

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The people who use techniques that are not possible in reality.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Some of the special styles of the central king and some of the main classes are called that.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The technique is not magic.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Magic?

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's nothing.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But, Miao.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes?

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You are not tired at all.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You?

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You ate a lot of shiiseki and became a power-man.

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I see.

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You used it because you were more capable than normal people.

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That means you are getting stronger.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You, come with me to my training.

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What?

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This is the face.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is that how much you are able to do with shiiseki?

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know how far I can get from this power.

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I will fight you.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's go.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
The

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The news seems to have not come out during the training.

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have to be serious, but I think I have a sister's partner.

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Kai.

170
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Will you bring water to me?

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hurry up.

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What?

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What?

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was wondering if the people of the Kago-mochi were as strong as everyone else.

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I see.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I am still weak.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What do you mean?

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
My father and my brother are stronger than me.

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If the strength of the Tochigami-sama is different,

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
the strength of the Kago-mochi will also be different.

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There is always a chance.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Of course, the Kago-mochi will be stronger to win the battle,

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
but it's not just for that.

190
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's already this late.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Someone will wake up.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't go there because I can't see it.

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This training is not for my father.

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Jyose-sama.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You said it's not just for the battle.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I told you to continue.

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want to talk about the continuation.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's right.

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There is a grave cleaning once a month.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Kai, come with me.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A grave cleaning?

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The Tochigami-sama of my village is waiting for you.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I will give you a hand to help you.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The continuation is there.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes.

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't worry.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The current Edamura is the leader of the Ozaru-domo.

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's okay.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There hasn't been a lot of attacks recently.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's what you're going to do first.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Kai, is that rumor true?

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What?

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The reason why our team put this story on this is because Jyose-sama killed you.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What?

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's...

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think so.

218
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Jyose-sama doesn't know Kai.

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I see.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But there seems to be someone who believes in rumors.

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This is one of the villages where Morokike used to live.

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He didn't get a big hit with the attack of the Ajin-shi that was passed on.

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But there is still a grave cleaning here.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's not good for the Tochigami-sama to treat the non-believers.

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's not good for the non-believers to be treated.

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's the way it is.

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It used to be a field.

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Now the soil is getting wild.

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's no one to take care of it.

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's not all.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The Tochigami-sama's sound is thin.

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's not enough to be snowy.

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The God's sound?

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The God's sound is being passed on for the first time.

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The soil is getting wild.

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Kurin, I want to look around the village.

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then, let's go.

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll go with that girl.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Me?

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Jyose-sama, where are you?

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Jyose-sama, what are you doing?

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Quietly.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I was asking you to gather the God's sound here.

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And the one you can do is to collect the treasure that is tied to the God of the land.

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Can the treasure do that?

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
As you just saw.

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But this Edamura is abandoned.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The Tochigami-sama's appearance is weak.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And this village's treasure.

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm weak too.

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What I can do now is to hold this small flower field in a cage.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're weak?

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
For example, the growth of the treasure of the Lagumura is because your father is strong.

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It is very important that the land's owner is strong.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,240
Your father will not be able to erase his

258
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
and give birth to a new one.

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The stronger the treasure is, the stronger the God's sound will be.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's why the land becomes rich.

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And we will eat more.

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Not only that, the Tochigami-sama will also become stronger.

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The stronger the God's sound will be, it's not just for the war.

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's right.

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There is no special reason for the relationship.

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Gokuro, you should stay in the surrounding security.

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The rest of you will go down to the ground with the princess.

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is the stone of the Tochigami-sama.

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There was also this kind of text in the stone in the valley.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So that means that the stone of that valley is also the stone of the Tochigami-sama?

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm Eidaren, the Ice-Curse.

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm Eidaren, the Ice-Curse.

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm Eidaren, the Ice-Curse.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The lower side is the god of the Raghda-Ratuka.

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll read it when I touch it.

276
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All right, I'll put the treasure together.

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why can't I read this?

278
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, I can understand one by one.

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The temple, the contract...

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But it won't be a letter.

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What's wrong?

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What?

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You said it all by yourself?

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No, no, nothing.

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Jishiro, eat this.

286
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn't know.

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The reason why the princess was trying to become so strong was for this Eidamura.

288
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I want to experience Eidamura someday.

289
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm the one who received the treasure of Eidamura, the Tochigami-sama.

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's why I have a responsibility on this land.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A responsibility?

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll become stronger and take back this village.

293
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll grow many treasures and show you my favorite grass.

294
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And I'll live with many people.

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's my wish, responsibility.

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
At that time, let me take the sound.

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll take the sound, too.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Me, too.

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Tochi, God, and people.

301
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And to people.

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Is the treasure that has such a responsibility?

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Then what about me?

304
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
To me, Tochi, God, and responsibility.

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Please come out quickly.

306
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Something's coming.

307
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Where does the enemy come from?

308
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's from the back.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I think it's young.

310
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Manso, you should meet the princess and get out of the house.

311
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Roger that.

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
All right, hide the message.

313
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The rest of you, go and meet them.

314
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll fight, too.

315
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I won't.

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The princess is an important body.

317
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You have to return to the Rage village safely.

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm a treasure.

319
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sorry, but the princess doesn't have the experience of actual battle.

320
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Please run away.

321
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Here you go, Jouze-sama.

322
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's here.

323
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I want to see the blind.

324
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll kill you.

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't let go.

326
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Stop.

327
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think she's here, too.

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't let go.

329
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Jouze-sama.

330
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is my village.

331
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Manso, there's another one.

332
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm the daughter of the Moroku Bejin, Jouze.

333
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The power of the power of the power of the Shining Flames.

334
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's see the truth.

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Jouze-sama!

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The appearance of the blind appeared.

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Did you do it?

338
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The appearance of the blind appeared.

339
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Manso!

340
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Is this all?

341
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes, that's right.

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you okay, Jouze-sama?

343
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes.

344
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you okay, Jouze-sama?

345
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Are you okay, Jouze-sama?

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

347
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The appearance of the blind appeared.

348
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The appearance of the blind appeared.

349
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The appearance of the blind appeared.
