1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,200
The last time I saw you, Oguniya...

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,560
What is this?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,880
Could it be that you were attacked by the Magakuna?

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,280
While we were chasing the Org...

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,600
This is the result of the curse that was cast upon the destroyer of the city.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,640
Kai, I want you to be the one to attack the Kaiju's people with me.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,240
Once this is over, I'll take Elsa to the place where she's fallen asleep.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,680
Yes, I understand. I'm waiting.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,000
To save the 100 million people,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,080
will you be able to give the power of your God to the kingdom now?

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,840
If there are people who must protect the city, too...

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
I want you to show them that.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Then I can't do it.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,520
What is this?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,680
A curse?

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,240
이른적서의 succor?

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,200
W-What is this?

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
I want to do it

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,240
The heat is hot, the heat is hot, the moon is moving

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm on a long road with a strange feeling

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Where am I now?

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Where is the goal?

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Is that really true?

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,240
The moment I look at a different view from yesterday

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power that I'm advancing

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,240
While reaching the light of the future

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm living in a moment of unending pain

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Even if I get close, even if I get close

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I won't be able to reach my dream from any angle

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,240
I want to control my strength because I have something I want to grab

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,240
The heat is hot, the heat is hot, the moon is moving

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Espírióé

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,240
What?

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,240
That sword is a god's kill

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,240
It takes away the protection of the past

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
But it takes away its power

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
It's a waste of time to be punished

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Why?

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,240
It uses your power of God

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Only the people and the land

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,240
That's a dangerous thing

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Strong power should be controlled

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,240
By being caught in the kingdom's rage

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I don't know about you

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
How much of that power is there?

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,240
No matter how much I'm charged with a sword

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,240
It's the light of the miracle

48
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,240
You don't know that!

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I will be grateful for your progress

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,240
The moment of pain and suffering

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Your achievements will be in the future

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,240
The kingdom of the East will be conquered

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,240
With my honor

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I wonder if the other villages won't support me

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
It's impossible

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm full of my power because I protect myself

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
If you can't do it, you can't

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,240
I'll give Espírióé to everyone

59
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Old man

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
The red-headed are going to be killed

61
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Don't lose them

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
I won't let you go

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
If you can't do it, you can't

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
I'll give you everything you can

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,240
We'll protect the village

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I don't need to worry about anything

67
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Adelia, I'm sorry

68
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Take a good rest, mother

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Will you be okay?

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Mother

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,240
If the war starts again

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I'll evacuate to a safe place

73
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm here with mother

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
It's okay, I'm with you

75
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Why don't you understand?

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Everyone is saved by your life

77
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
That's all

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,240
I lost my family

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Wait a minute!

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Your logic might be right

81
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,240
But I have to protect everyone there

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240
I decided to protect them

83
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Don't think about it

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Don't think about it

85
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
No!

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Kai?

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
You don't understand

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,240
This is the power of God

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,240
What is the power that gives us the power to protect the people?

90
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Is that so?

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,240
If you say so

92
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Don't be afraid

93
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
This is our village

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Our will

95
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,240
There is no place to go down from here

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,240
The power of the Ragmura will show us to the Tardes

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:32,020
A

98
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,040
Premen

99
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Cheath!

100
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,460
After you, you bear pain...

101
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,240
You were the ones who asked us to pay our good us homage!

102
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I won't let you go.

103
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,240
This is a tough fight between Chanmi and Kagomachi.

104
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,240
They'll curse Lord Jose and Lord Orh!

105
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
You guys...

106
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,240
Don't forgive me!

107
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Kagomachi!

108
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,740
Then you're the one!

109
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
You bastard!

110
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
The wound...

111
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,240
Is it because of that three-shot wound?

112
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
What's wrong with you?

113
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Huh...

114
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,740
You're using such a trick.

115
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,740
But it's not our enemy.

116
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll kill you.

117
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,240
You bastard!

118
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
You bastard!

119
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,740
You're finally able to steal the power of the God you've finally found!

120
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
You bastard!

121
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Don't let me down!

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
The End

123
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,740
What do you mean?

124
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,740
Why did you save me?

125
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,740
I tried to kill you.

126
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
You know what?

127
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I just moved my body.

128
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Why did the God give you such a huge power?

129
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I feel like I understand.

130
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
What?

131
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,240
Find him!

132
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
The enemy has three Kagomochis.

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,240
On the other hand, there's only one single Tegoi Kagomochis and a single Tegoi.

134
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,240
Tegoi?

135
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,740
You're the one who should be saying that.

136
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Well, I'm sure this is the wrong side.

137
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
If you want to live and return, please follow my instructions.

139
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
I'll... I'll take care of you.

140
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Are you sure?

141
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,240
If you survive, I might kill you this time.

142
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Let's think about it again then.

143
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I can't just die here.

144
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,740
How much power do you have?

145
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,740
Until you're satisfied, you'll be the only one who can survive.

146
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,740
What should I do?

147
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
The End

148
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
The End

149
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Tenang!

150
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
On me!

151
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
What's wrong?

152
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,740
Are you done with the hide-and-seek?

153
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
Are you done with the high-ranking?

154
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Then I'll take your punishment.

155
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
If that's the case...

156
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Behind you!

157
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
The moves we've been given are called...

158
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
The End

159
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
The End

160
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,740
It's okay. I'm watching.

161
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,740
Watch out! Right!

162
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Zakao!

163
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,740
The sword that looks right in front of you is really a sword that can't be used.

164
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Kai!

165
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Uelis!

166
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,740
This is the power of the god that makes you so helpless.

167
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
You're the one who woke up.

168
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
But it seems like you didn't see it.

169
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
It's a...

170
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
...a...

171
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
What?!

172
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
The End

173
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,740
Master Wakata!

174
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank goodness. You've been aware of it.

175
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
What the hell...

176
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
...is going on with me?

177
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,240
Chousen...

178
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,740
...are you all red?

179
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,240
I can't get on.

180
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
The condition of your body...

181
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
It's red.

182
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,740
Bring the sword and the sword.

183
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,240
I'll burn the parts of the Morokke!

184
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,740
Hurry up!

185
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,740
I understand.

186
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,740
I'll support you with all my strength.

187
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Look! Hurry up and do this!

188
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,240
You didn't kill me, did you?

189
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,740
Your body suddenly moved again.

190
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,240
Shut up and drink!

191
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
It's useless.

192
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I was defeated by the new stone.

193
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
I can't see much anymore.

194
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,240
I guess my journey of suffering...

195
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,240
...is over here.

196
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
What's that?

197
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Is this...

198
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
...a free technique?

199
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Where is it?

200
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Why?

201
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Why won't it stop?

202
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Your law-abiding squirrel knight况()

203
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,460
It was fallen upon physics...

204
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,240
I guess I finally believe in imagination.

205
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
Huh・

206
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,440
It requires us to suffer a creation!

207
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Gone now, but perhaps...

208
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,240
Lord Daishi!

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,440
The strength of the God and the God of the Chigirishi...

210
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,840
But I finally found out.

211
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,840
I wanted to see this.

212
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,140
That power...

213
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Kai...

214
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,040
Where are you going from now on?

215
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,340
I'm sure I'll be there.

216
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,240
Close...

217
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,840
Ispiryo...?

218
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
Nothing...

219
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,240
This is your father's room.

220
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,240
The village of the Useless Clan is being defeated.

221
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Jyose-sama, you woke up!

222
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,240
The war is starting?

223
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Yes.

224
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
The young people have attacked the village.

225
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,240
While we are following the royal army,

226
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
we have a message from the master.

227
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
From your father?

228
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I thought that if we were to leave,

229
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,240
we would have to run away from the village.

230
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,240
That's what your father said?

231
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Don't let them rest in the palace!

232
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,240
If you want to kill them...

233
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Master, I don't want you to fight the princess who is in the castle.

234
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Even if I call her to this castle,

235
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
I don't want to fight her.

236
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I can't fight her.

237
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Princess...

238
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
She is a woman.

239
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
What is this?

240
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Master Goto's grave has made the village's children and the injured people

241
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
be destroyed here.

242
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
That's not true.

243
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Everyone, please use this room.

244
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,240
You can't use the things in the room freely.

245
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Princess Chirahime...

246
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Princess...

247
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Don't worry.

248
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
We, Morokuke, will take over the royal army.

249
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
We will definitely bring back the injured people.

250
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Gundar!

251
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
This place is dangerous!

252
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Gundar...

253
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Did you go to the battlefield as a scout?

254
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
That's not true!

255
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,240
He has been running away somewhere.

256
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Gundar, that was a dangerous place.

257
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Where are you?

258
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,240
You can't use it when you're in danger!

259
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Everyone, I brought food for you.

260
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I was waiting for you.

261
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Thank you.

262
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
You can't go back to this place.

263
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
It was bad to go back to this place.

264
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,240
We still have some food left, so I'll bring it back.

265
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Thank you.

266
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,240
This place is dangerous, so be careful.

267
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
What do you want?

268
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Lord Junsatsushi?

269
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Are you trying to go to the battlefield?

270
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Hurry!

271
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,240
If you don't open the door, you can't go back to the temple!

272
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Temple?

273
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I will tell the temple to come back as soon as possible!

274
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
If you say you can go back, you can go back!

275
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
No way!

276
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
It's my power!

277
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
You bastard!

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Please stop!

279
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,240
We are not going to open the door.

280
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
We are going to tell the temple to come back as soon as possible!

281
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,240
If we open this door, we will forgive the young people's trespassings!

282
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Please stop!

283
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Don't interrupt me!

284
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Lord Junsatsushi!

285
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
What are you doing?

286
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Get back!

287
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,240
We can't touch the dead!

288
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Why did you do this?

289
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,240
You know what happened to this place?

290
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,240
You guys should kill each other!

291
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Lord Dander, we are waiting for you!

292
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I saw the city!

293
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,240
GUARANTINESS

294
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Seems that can take some time!

295
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,240
She is your plan!

296
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:34,240
If that's the case, then this world will disappear

297
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,240
We too, we too, we don't want this kind of thing, but

298
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Even though the blue moon is just a little bit,

299
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,240
People will notice that everyone is lonely

300
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Everyone will notice that everyone is lonely

301
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,240
In the night sky, just exist, you can't do it
