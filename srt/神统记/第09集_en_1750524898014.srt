1
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,000
Shit.

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,300
Ispilio?

3
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Akui, bring the distortable sword and give an old wood sword.

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,320
Hurry up and do it!

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,600
All right, I'llnow do my best to support this achiever!

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,140
Fighting!

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,780
Iä¿¡ my sister is the one who will betray us!

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to grab something, so I want to hold it strongly

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm in a long road, where am I now?

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Where is the goal? Is that really true?

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The moment I look at a different scenery than yesterday

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power that I'm moving forward

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
While reaching the light of the future, I'm living in a flower that I can't stop

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close, I won't be able to chase my dream

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to grab something, so I want to hold it strongly

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The power of God

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The daughter of the current village?

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's true that the place where the slaughterhouse is

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The gate is broken! Come here!

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Masuo! Akida!

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The gate was opened because the slaughterhouse was open!

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The evil spirit has entered!

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't move! We'll stop them!

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Master!

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Leave the back to us

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You'll be able to live from here

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The power of the current village and the power of the Bejii

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't stop them from being evil

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have to make sure I don't succeed

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know how to use the power of God I saved

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I'll use it to protect the Ragnarok Village

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The gate was opened?

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:33,220
It's bad, it's going to be taken to the

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I saved you, thank you

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The rest is the new seat

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you don't mind, I'll do it here too

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You guys are the new seats?

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I just painted the door on my face, but they're all shaking

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go!

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Close the door at the moment!

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't let them in any more!

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Keep them up!

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Alright, we'll die here

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They're going to get caught!

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We can't let them in!

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Report! The evil spirit army is gathering in front of the gate!

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What?

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We'll protect this place

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Please leave the Lord God to us

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're going to make me a fool?

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Lord Toshigami and Lord God are one body

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If Lord God is not around, the villagers can do it

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What do you say?

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's take care of the dance

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If they see us, we'll be in trouble

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Please do us a favor

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hurry up!

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The red guys are coming up like this!

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Transformers!

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The people of the Lagumura are the soldiers here

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And the people

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They're all the same, the innocent ones

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I beg you, please take care of the Lord God

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We can't let them in

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What are you saying?

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll stay here

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll leave the rest of the evil spirit behind

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't worry, if you're going to die, I'll let you escape

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're going to be destroyed!

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bring the Marutas!

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're going to die!

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They're coming!

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Lord Abethin, you're doing great!

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's the true power of the Lord

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll make you a fool!

79
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're going to die!

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll take your life!

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Father, I'm just about to die

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You shouldn't be so rude

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm fine, this is my will

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Akari, you can leave

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're going to die

86
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to die here, just like the King of the Kingdom

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm a traitor

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sure I can fight

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is Usel's spear

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Usel's master is a woman

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He risked his life to protect the people

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to fight too

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Lord Orphan is here!

94
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Lord Orphan?

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Lord Orphan, did the disease heal?

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes, it did

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We have two swordsmen

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then let's use the evil

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're going to die!

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's still alive

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're the one who's going to die!

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Lord Orphan!

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll protect the Ragnarra!

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Jyothen!

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're not afraid of the evil?

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's hard, I'm going to die

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Lord Jyothen is fighting like that

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hurry

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm done, too

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Go on with Lord Jyothen and Lord Orphan!

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Lord Orphan

112
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let go of me!

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't do it yet

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm going to protect you, even if you're going to die

115
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going to protect you, even if you're going to die

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Jyothen, I'm not afraid of women

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not afraid of women

118
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not afraid of women

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not afraid of women

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm not afraid of women

121
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What's wrong?

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let go of me!

123
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm going to die!

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There's no one to protect you

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What happened?

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please, Lord Tachigami

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Please, Lord Tachigami

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Please, Lord Tachigami

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please, Lord Tachigami

130
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Please, Lord Tachigami

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What the hell is this?

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's coming closer

133
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Kai, are you back?

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Take this!

135
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, sir!

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sorry, but I won't let you guys get in the castle!

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What the hell is this?

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How could you do this to me?

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's that?

140
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is that really Kai?

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How much power can you use to fight?

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How many new stones can you use to defeat him?

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Then, it's like the real treasure

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The power of God!

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The power of God?

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Zulin, we may have been able to defeat the lack of power

147
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The Lord Kaun was runs away

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Their abilities improved

149
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What an insane world

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't kill me.

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I fought well, didn't I, Akui?

152
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes. Thanks to you, the village was protected.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The one who saved the village was the one who was holding a hole in the fence.

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, you're still on your face?

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You were also drawing a pattern on your face?

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Even with this, I can fool them.

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you can fight like that, you don't need that kind of material.

158
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, that's not true.

159
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Kai, what happened to Lady Narda?

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
After the old lady died in Edamura, she was killed after she was killed in Makaku.

161
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What?

162
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The enemy was a three-armed cargo carrier, and I was also a total enemy of protecting myself.

163
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Even without the cargo carrier, she was so strong that she could show her true colors.

164
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But that person didn't take any of them.

165
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It was a great battle.

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I couldn't even take care of them properly.

167
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll send the army to the field later.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Kai, Lili-san...

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Your sister isn't home.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Elsa? I thought she was just trying to make things worse.

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We can't go back without sending her to the field.

172
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I saw a village girl being brought back to the village by the vassal who ran away from there.

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is that a fact?

174
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes, that's true.

175
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Kai!

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hey! What are you going to do?

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll chase her and take her back!

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What about the vassal and the other party?

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
How can he go after her?

180
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What?

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What's wrong?

182
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's safe to come this far.

183
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How far is the hut?

184
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is it around 1000 yards?

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's still a long way to go.

186
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not saying I'll give you a lot of love for a strange girl.

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What happened?

188
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you stupid?

189
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, I'm more...

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Aragur, something's...

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Come here.

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
My tribe is the kingdom of Chuana, Kizaku!

193
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Stop it!

194
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're a coward!

195
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Get out of my way!

196
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What are you afraid of?

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What?

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Wait, Uba!

199
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, Your Highness!

200
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't go, Bun-kan!

201
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you going to leave me behind?

202
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Elsa!

203
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Elsa!

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
My wife!

205
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You...

206
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Kai...

207
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait!

208
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wait, I'll save you!

209
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
With my magic...

210
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll make you live a life of your own!

211
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why?

212
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why won't you listen?

213
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're too ill to catch up with me.

214
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What should I do?

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Die, you bastard!

216
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll kill you!

217
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Did you kill Elsa?

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The light you saw earlier...

219
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Are you a village person?

220
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's your fault, Elsa.

221
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not my fault!

222
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your fault is that girl's death!

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What?

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Your strong power has made Uma angry!

225
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Even so, it's not your fault!

226
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is that so?

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're not even going to run away from me!

228
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's my fault...

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's not my fault to betray you!

230
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You're the one who killed that girl!

231
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No!

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No!

233
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Huh?

234
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The treasure of Raghumura should be Miha's.

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know who it is, but I'm sorry for raising your hand on the suicide death that caused you to die!

236
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's not the case yet!

237
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The one who has the power of God...

238
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll kill you, you bastard!

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll kill you, you bastard!

240
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll kill you, you bastard!

241
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I see.

242
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,000
In a village like yours, you'll be able to drown in your power and suffer the death of many more people!

243
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I see. If this is what you want...

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll kill you, you bastard!

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Elsa! Elsa, can you hear me?

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Kai...

247
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sorry...

248
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm sorry...

249
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No!

250
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We'll be together forever!

251
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If we drink this, we'll be healthy!

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Kai...

253
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We'll be together forever...

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If we drink the water of the new stone, we'll be strong and have a strong spirit.

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And we'll be able to heal the water of the treasure!

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Kai...

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Huh?

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Thank you...

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Elsa!

260
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Elsa!

261
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't know what happened, but I'm the only one who can rely on you.

262
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Did you give this girl a new stone?

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes, that's right.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You've done something bad.

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Why? You've given her a new stone to heal her wound.

266
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There's a problem with the name of the same person.

267
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If you give her a new stone at the same time, she'll be in a very strong and poisonous situation.

268
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If she's the worst, she'll die.

269
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Elsa's going to die?

270
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No way! She's not going to save us!

271
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's not like she's not going to save us.

272
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But I hope we can make it.

273
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Please! Do whatever you want!

274
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sure of it.

275
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Leave the rest to us.

276
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
First, we'll get rid of the water we've eaten.

277
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You two, please trust this person.

278
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If I had to chase Elsa, I wouldn't have to do this.

279
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Is my power just to make her die?

280
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
How am I supposed to use this power?

281
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Makaku!

282
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You're here at this point!

283
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Are you going to attack my body this time?

284
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not going to attack you!

285
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry for your misdeeds.

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What?

287
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm going to kill you, the wolf that's been killed.

288
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The wolf that's been killed?

289
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to wait for you to wake up.

290
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Please, give me a five-star ring.

291
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What?

292
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then, what about this world?

293
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We'll disappear, and we'll be like this, too.

294
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We're not really serious, but...

295
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The blue moon is just a little bit,

296
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but people realize that loneliness is the only thing that exists in the night sky.

297
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't want to talk about my life without doing it.

298
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool,

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but if I lose you, I'll be myself,

300
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and I won't lose to you.

301
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll be myself, who won't lose to you.

302
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Will you forgive me?

303
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The wolf that's been killed?

304
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The wolf that's been killed?

305
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The wolf that's been killed?

306
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The wolf that's been killed?

307
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can only do that.
