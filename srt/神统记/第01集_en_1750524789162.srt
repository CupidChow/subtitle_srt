1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where are you?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Where is the goal?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is that true?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The moment I look at a different view from yesterday

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't say it well, but I can see the power to move forward

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to live the days of my unending love

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't dream of anything, but I want to grab something

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to show you my strength

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to use it more than anything else

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm moving hotly

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The left side is in the front, and the right side is in the back

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But the right side is being controlled

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't move! Stop the force!

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Where are you?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where are you?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm here!

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Kai, you two, stop them!

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Watch out!

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm the boss of the Moroku Bejin, Orfa!

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Orfa! Orfa is coming!

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm the Demon Clan, who is ruling the land of the human race

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Watch out for the power of the landlady who is in my house!

24
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,140
The Deon

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
The trust in his face is…

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,000
So that's the proof the Bejin below wearing the surgery's stock?

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Deon

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,180
The

29
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,820
Middle Age

30
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,240
Shalon

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,440
Za

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,380
I know

33
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:34,620
Well, short

34
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,600
End of the Battle

35
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,900
Bring back Naggphetto!

36
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,200
6th Shin-chan municipality

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,940
You men line up today too

38
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,620
Oh.

39
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,820
Oryhasama, here is results for your WILD ORMAC ANDERINUM CLEANING PART II

40
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,340
Oro tantra astraments

41
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,060
From anotheront

42
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,020
достиgng the FALSE

43
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,660
This baby isn't my father.

44
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Now I'll give him full attention.

45
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Thank you very much motherức your mother.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,220
Thank you.

47
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,100
Stay at the point of order.

48
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,960
Take the pride ofˇMyself‬

49
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,740
those一點y me?!

50
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,940
I think the power is about to be lost.

51
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
The power is about to be lost.

52
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,940
If we take the power of the new stone,

53
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,940
the power will increase and become stronger.

54
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,940
Then I want more.

55
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Well, that's a difficult story.

56
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,940
We're just watching the growth.

57
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
We'll definitely carry it to the castle.

58
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,940
Okay.

59
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
The most important thing about the new stone is the power.

60
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,940
As long as most shipwrecks are印 creoids

61
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,940
If we can make it stronger in our men by making it settle around everyone around.

62
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
Baseko Asuna!

63
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Making it bigger needs more strength.

64
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Peace of the land is always fully 솔직히

65
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
You just say it like that.

66
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Do not you know what the word in this world is about?

67
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Ohh yes!

68
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,740
In hospitals like us,

69
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,940
we should keep the power of our new stone.

70
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
We must be strong.

71
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
That's right.

72
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,940
I can't live without that.

73
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,940
The Kai of the Lugmura.

74
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,940
The land of the Hendo people is under attack by the Ajin tribe in Nagaki.

75
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,940
But today, Lugmura is protected by your famous work.

76
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,940
This proud Bejin, I'm proud of you.

77
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Hurry up and eat.

78
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Thank you for your mother's love.

79
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Thank you!

80
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Finally, we made it.

81
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,940
We're full of this, but thank you.

82
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Eat!

83
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,940
I want to eat that much too.

84
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Then work harder.

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,940
You're a good eater. You have more food than me.

86
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm a leader.

87
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,940
If you're stronger, I'll eat more.

88
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Eat, wear, and become stronger.

89
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Eat!

90
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Ouch!

91
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,940
I'm so hungry that I can't even eat.

92
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Eat the rice ball!

93
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Rice ball? What's that?

94
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
When did you get it?

95
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,940
I suddenly got it in my head.

96
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,940
I don't know much, but it was really good.

97
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
You're eating that?

98
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,940
I don't know much either.

99
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,940
You're saying that you don't know much sometimes.

100
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I don't know much either.

101
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Manso, you can see that, right?

102
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,940
What?

103
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,940
The Hakodono.

104
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
The Hakada of the family.

105
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,940
The family of my family, my brother and my parents,

106
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
the Hakada of the family without a family.

107
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,940
You're really full of your own.

108
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,940
I don't think you'll ever die.

109
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,940
I just forgot about it.

110
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,940
It's like I haven't been to the village since the beginning.

111
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I can't help it, but I know it.

112
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm absolutely sorry.

113
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I'll get stronger even if I don't eat much.

114
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,940
That's why I'll eat less food.

115
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,940
I'll have to eat more than one.

116
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
But that's not enough.

117
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
What's there?

118
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,940
I don't know much about my life in the village.

119
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,940
It's a great skill.

120
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,940
You're saying something weird.

121
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,940
But, brother...

122
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,940
You're so mean, Jose.

123
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,940
You told your father that you don't want a job like me.

124
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,940
But I...

125
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,940
You don't need any skills, you're a woman.

126
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,940
I'm a man too.

127
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,940
If you just go back, you won't be able to decide.

128
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,940
What the hell is this?

129
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,940
What's this?

130
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
A chair?

131
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,940
A magic?

132
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,940
What's magic now?

133
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,940
What the hell is that?

134
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,940
It's too bad. Are you okay?

135
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,940
It's okay.

136
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Don't surprise me.

137
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,940
I saw it again.

139
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,940
I don't know my memory.

140
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
I was surprised.

141
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
I can't wake up because I'm back.

142
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Sometimes I see something I've never heard before.

143
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,940
I don't know my memory.

144
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I heard that you're sometimes like that.

145
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
I'm like that too.

146
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,940
I can't tell people.

147
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
I'm like a man too.

148
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
The question of the rice ball...

149
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,940
That's what I remember.

150
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,940
But I don't know anything about it.

151
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,940
That's what I remember.

152
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,940
I've never seen anything like that.

153
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,940
But I remember something.

154
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,940
The magic is about the creator.

155
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,940
It's about the fairy tale.

156
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,940
I wish I could be a real magician.

157
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,940
If I could use the next move.

158
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,940
The Great Vulture's village is overflowing in the west.

159
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
The west?

160
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,940
The battlefield is near the village of Varnia.

161
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,940
The dawn is a few days away.

162
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,940
We must hurry to the station.

163
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,940
The Great Vulture is yesterday.

164
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,940
We'll take a break.

165
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,940
But, father, to protect the land.

166
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,940
The army is the main source of the blood.

167
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,940
We must not delay the war.

168
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,940
You're right.

169
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,940
The villagers are all the children of the Vulture.

170
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
You're so clever.

171
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,940
You're so sharp.

172
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,940
Why are you so mean?

173
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,940
I was thinking about a little dream.

174
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,940
A dream before you go to sleep?

175
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,940
It's not like a dream.

176
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,940
There was a fairy tale of a journey.

177
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,940
There was nothing but a fire.

178
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
It was a dark place.

179
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,940
The fairy tale was standing on her finger.

180
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,940
She turned it off and turned it into a light.

181
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,940
Is that true?

182
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,940
I've heard about it.

183
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,940
A dream?

184
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,940
A magic that burns out from the tip of her fingers.

185
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,940
Can you do that for me?

186
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,940
The magic is used to use magic.

187
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:59,940
I don't know much about it, but it seems to be a power that collects mysterious power in the world.

188
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,940
And it's a mysterious power that is also the world I live in.

189
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,940
It's a power.

190
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,940
The one that we meet and gain the sense of responsibility.

191
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,940
That's the power.

192
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,940
If we gather that power together and do that, maybe...

193
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Okay, no one's here.

194
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
It's a power.

195
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
It's a fire.

196
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,940
I can't just ignore it.

197
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,940
The problem is how to gather the power.

198
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,940
The power is probably in the heart.

199
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
I feel it.

200
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,940
I feel something like heat in my heart.

201
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Is this even okay?

202
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Zero, come out!

203
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Zero, come out!

204
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,940
So the royal family is depending on this figure in the forest?

205
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Yes.

206
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,940
I heard that from the leader of the Barney village.

207
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Take the soldiers of the Lug village and the Barney village.

208
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,940
The royal family is here! Go!

209
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,940
Leave the Barney people alone!

210
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,940
You're not doing anything stupid, Kai!

211
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
Sorry!

212
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
I was hurt...

213
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
I was beaten up...

214
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
It hurts!

215
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,940
I was beaten up...

216
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
You're a bastard!

217
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
What are you doing?!

218
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,940
They're going to run away!

219
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,940
It's not good for you, Mr. Orca!

220
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
We're not in the eye.

221
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
Are you okay?

222
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Sorry.

223
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
They're leaving the people to us!

224
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
What?

225
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,940
They're still around here!

226
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Leave them to us.

227
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,940
I'll be sure to do it.

228
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,940
I'll help them if they come back.

229
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Let's get the others out of here!

230
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
They can't get away!

231
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Let's go and see how many of them are here!

232
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,940
I'll be late and have fun with them!

233
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,940
Yeah, I'll do that.

235
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,940
I'll take your grave.

236
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
I'm counting on you.

237
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,940
I'll kill you!

238
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
I'll kill you!

239
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Don't hide!

240
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Get out of here!

241
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Get out of here!

242
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Get out!

243
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
I can't do this.

244
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,940
Don't be so energetic!

245
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,940
I'll kill you!

246
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,940
My life, my power...

247
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,940
I won't let you go!

248
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,940
Is it... the moon?

249
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,940
I'll stretch it out!

250
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
I'll do it!

251
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Zero!

252
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Hima-ho!

253
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,940
No!

254
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
I did it!

255
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
I did it!

256
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
My technique...

257
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
Hima-ho...

258
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
It's still burning!

259
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Get out!

260
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
Why?

261
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
It's gone.

262
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
Wait.

263
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,940
It suddenly got cold.

264
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Why?

265
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,940
It's like my life is being stolen.

266
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,940
Maybe if I use magic,

267
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,940
I'll be taken away by my power.

268
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Then...

269
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,940
Then I'll die.

270
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,940
Calm down. I can't keep my eyes on you.

271
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,940
I'm sure I can stop you.

272
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Water?

273
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Water?

274
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
That's right, but...

275
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
I see.

276
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,940
The flow of water is the flow of power.

277
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,940
To stop the flow of water,

278
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,940
I'll stop the water from flowing.

279
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,940
I'll close the water door.

280
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
He's still alive,

281
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,940
but now, the water door is closing.

282
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
It's gone.

283
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
Stop it.

284
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,940
What is this place?

285
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,940
You can't see it.

286
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,940
If you die anyway...

287
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
Kill me!

288
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,940
You're dead!

289
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,940
What is this?

290
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
It's a sound.

291
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Ah, blood?

292
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,940
It's over now.

293
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,940
And now, I will come back to life again.

294
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,940
I have to sell my hope for a maroon supposed to be.

295
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
I was expecting...

296
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,940
Like a kind of kid who takes care of a mess.

297
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

298
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

299
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

300
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

301
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

302
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

303
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

304
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

305
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

306
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

307
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

308
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

309
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

310
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

311
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

312
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

313
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

314
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

315
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

316
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

317
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

318
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

319
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

320
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

321
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

322
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

323
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

324
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

325
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.
