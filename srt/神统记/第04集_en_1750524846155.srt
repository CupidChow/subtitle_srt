1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The last Teogonia is...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What the hell are you doing?!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm the one who's called Porek.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm here to take care of the people who're going to kill me.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The old-fashioned god.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's here!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll crush you!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll crush you with blood!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The god of justice who protects the gods.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This man is truly a god of justice!

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want to grab you, so I want to hold you tight.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm a long road that's so bright.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Where am I now?

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Where is the goal I'm aiming for?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that really true?

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The moment I look at a different scenery than yesterday

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't say it well, but I can see through the power that moves on.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
While reaching the light of the future

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm living in a world without a break.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Even if I get close, even if I get close

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I won't be able to dream from the beginning.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to grab you, so I want to hold you tight.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The heat is not changing, it's hot, it's hot, the moon is moving.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ste Similar sunny days

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
One of my dream

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,460
Theantis

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is your first time killing post-its?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The gods said that you are the one who will steal the treasure from the big pig.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Steal the treasure?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The one who ate the new stone of the treasure can take the power of the earth and draw it back to the new one.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's...

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's true, but it's impossible to keep the treasure.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is that so?

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But we can take the treasure and eat it.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This place will be used to raise the power of the earth.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
To protect this treasure.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's the secret.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Y-You mean it?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It was my grandpa's help.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you for your happiness.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is bad.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to ask you this.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is...

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The earth's treasure.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is the earth's treasure?

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes. When the treasure dies, the gods will welcome it to the place where it should be.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
God...

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The new stone...

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The effect of eating the new stone of the treasure?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It can't be helped.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's okay. I don't need it.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But...

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll go back to the other world.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll go back to the other world.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't come near me.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
God!

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A dream?

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What?

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing?

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you here?

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good morning, God.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Did you draw this?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
God, the wind is blowing.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No, I'm worried about Arwen.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Arwen's request to the Hacharu family...

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was invited by God.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll be by your side forever.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's the promise of Arwen.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's good. Go back to your friends.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I said go back.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If you go back to Arwen, everyone will be punished.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Anyway, go back.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll send you back.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
God, the life of Arwen's life.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If God wasn't there, Arwen would have died.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I'll be by your side forever.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What? Go back quickly.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Over there?

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, I have to go back.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You go back too.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Arwen, go back.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
God, please forgive us.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm grateful.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We, the Koror Clan, are in the hands of the gods.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In the hands of the gods?

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't care.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We are the land we should return to.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We are the gods of the Waruro.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't care at all.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to bury the land of the Karizumai in this valley.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I beg your pardon.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're going to live here?

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm begging you.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do it on your own.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't go into the valley.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll be in a hurry.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wait a minute.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I made it.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's late.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What were you doing?

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was just sleeping.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're a useless person.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll start.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I feel like this every day.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're so mean.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You don't have to be so mean.

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Lord Bejin.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Where is Kai?

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Kai?

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He's on the board of the army.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He's on the castle.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The enemy of the Mogi battle today is the 5th sister of Lord God.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Who is she?

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She was a great help to Lord Chose.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, it's her.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sure her name is...

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Kai.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why are you doing this?

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I just don't want to see her.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't expect Lord God to see me.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ega, don't use your dirty hands.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll get angry.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I know.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I heard about it.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I heard you knew the Mokaku people.

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You should show your true power.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't worry.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I won't kill you.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's better to be a hidden person for a while.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're still in the dark.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Until you can use that power,

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you'll be targeted by other gods.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry for the trouble.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I see.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll hold your power so that you won't get any questions.

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll cut you off.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's start!

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Kai...

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What's this?

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The interrogator...

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Looks like he was trying to kill you.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Kai...

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's gone?

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Good.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's have fun.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's...

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He's already killed my father?

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What?

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I won't let you do anything!

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This much?

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I like it.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll treat you to a meal tomorrow.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What?

159
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Tomorrow?

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll prepare for it.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That girl...

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
She's trying to kill my father?

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
She's too much.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I have to be more strict with her tomorrow.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're kidding me.

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm so sorry.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you laughing at?

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll show you my teeth.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Shut up!

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll definitely become stronger!

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why is this happening?

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The End

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, Kai!

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Give me a meal.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm so sorry.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I finally have a chance to meet you.

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I finally have a chance to meet you.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm home, God of the birds.

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What is it?

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Could it be that the Kororu Clan is trying to kill my father?

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
God!

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm home!

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you still here?

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was getting ready for God.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Did you put the Kororu Clan's chain in the bird's nest?

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All of them are from the Arue family.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No one in the village is coming.

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So, you're all alone?

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, I'm not.

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's why I told you to go home.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
God, give me a meal.

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Looks delicious.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
God, I'm going to eat.

196
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
God, do you want a change?

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This one!

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Is it good, God?

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Anyway, I can't eat this much in the village.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What?

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are you so shy?

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We're all here.

205
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're not like this.

206
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Shut up!

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You were working in the field before.

208
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you want to eat, work properly.

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This raw food!

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why are you so shy?

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know.

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's a real trip to Haru.

213
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's why I told you not to do that.

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sister?

215
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Elsa, are you that shy?

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm not!

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, I'm not.

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Really?

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I made a mistake, so please go home.

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm working!

221
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can't help it.

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm working!

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I can't help it.

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Huh? What's this?

225
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Just one more Brits?

226
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh my god!

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's no good. I can't get this far!

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Huh?

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How many Brits are there?

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey!

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Huh?

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Wow! As expected of the Brits!

233
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah. And now we have more Brits in the village.

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Huh?

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't get this far.

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I guess we still have more Brits.

237
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Right, God of the Brits?

238
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What are you doing, Ael?

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is there something unusual?

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, I thought you were doing a good job this year.

241
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
A good job? I never thought about that.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This flower is the first time I've ever planted a seed from our village.

243
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
When the village was burned, I only had flowers.

244
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The village was gone, but there were so many flowers.

245
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's so nice.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I see! Ael, you've also planted the same flower in the village as me.

247
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You've planted it in the village?

248
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Did you forget?

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No, I was still a little kid when the village was burned.

250
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But you're amazing, Kaikun. You can see God of the Brits.

251
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's not true. I'm still much stronger than God of the Brits and God of the Brits.

252
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
More?

253
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah.

254
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm much stronger than anyone who has no roots like me.

255
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I have friends like Mansa, but I've always thought that I'm stronger than anyone.

256
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But...

257
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You used to say the same thing.

258
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Back then?

259
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah. Kaikun cried alone at that time.

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're so useless!

261
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
No!

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I thought it was no good, but then the Brits who planted the seed fell down.

263
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm much stronger than anyone who has no roots like me.

264
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, I'm much stronger than anyone who has no roots like me.

265
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm much stronger than anyone who has no roots like me.

266
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
At that time, I was frustrated.

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Frustrated?

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Everyone believed that I was the only one who could kill them.

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But I couldn't do anything.

270
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's why I swore to myself that I would definitely become stronger.

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I was so frustrated.

272
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What are you talking about?

273
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I've forgotten about it all along.

274
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I didn't mean to do that.

275
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I remember.

276
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What?

277
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Kai-kun, you protected us back then, didn't you?

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It hasn't changed at all since then.

279
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But I tougher said...

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,080
You knew where the你是 lies.

281
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,500
What?

282
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What...

283
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What?

284
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:07,800
TO

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The Greatest of the All-Knowing

286
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The Greatest of the All-Knowing

287
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The Greatest of the All-Knowing

288
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The Greatest of the All-Knowing

289
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll set you up!

290
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Now, you're dead!

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The Greatest of the All-Knowing

292
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
How's that? God!

293
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Well, that's fine.

294
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes!

295
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll make you more and more!

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Do it on your own.

297
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The End

298
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I can't live anymore.

299
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm so desperate.

300
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm so desperate.

301
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm so desperate.

302
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's like a guy.

303
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's like a guy.

304
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then,

305
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll make you more and more.

306
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
This world

307
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll disappear.

308
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We're not like this.

309
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We're not like this.

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We're not like this.

311
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We're not like this.

312
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I like blue.

313
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Even though it's just beautiful,

314
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I can tell that people are lonely.

315
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
In the night sky,

316
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I just want to talk about my life

317
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
that I can't do.

318
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm in a dream.

319
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm in a dream.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
When I'm weak,

321
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and I lose you,

322
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll be myself.

323
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I won't lose to you.

324
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The journey from the Middle King

325
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
to the end of the world

326
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
will change the flow of fate.

327
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Next time on Soto Junsatsu City.

328
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Where will the flow lead us to?
