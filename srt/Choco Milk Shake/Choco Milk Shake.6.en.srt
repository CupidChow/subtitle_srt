1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,170
When are you gonna tell him?

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,256
Soon

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,717
We

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,386
Don't have too much time left

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,347
We have to tell him soon

6
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:01,853
Choco Milk Shake

7
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:06,191
Chapter 6 Fearless puppy

8
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,448
Did you guys fight?

9
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,159
What do you mean? We're not kids

10
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,870
Right. You're not kids. Why would you fight?

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,997
Get along well

12
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,717
Jungwoo

13
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,218
Yes?

14
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,804
Can you go to the storage and check the stock?

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,682
Check what we have to order as well

16
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,641
Okay

17
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,841
Jungwoo, do you need some help?

18
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,264
Are you okay, Jungwoo?

19
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,932
I'm fine

20
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,267
You?

21
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,810
I'm fine too

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,192
What do you mean?

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,735
Your head is bleeding

24
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,569
Huh?

25
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,840
Why do you keep avoiding me?

26
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,676
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,347
I never avoided you

28
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,726
You did. You were avoiding me

29
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,082
You

30
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,335
I told you not to look at me like that

31
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,339
Since you're taking care of me like this,

32
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,882
it brings back memories of old days

33
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,217
Old days?

34
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,970
When?

35
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,013
The day when you first found me

36
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,933
It was around this time

37
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,187
Right

38
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,108
It was raining too

39
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:57,380
I was abandoned in a plastic bag like trash on a rainy day

40
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,220
That day, Jungwoo found me

41
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,432
like a miracle

42
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,942
A soft touch I'd never felt before

43
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,444
A warm hug

44
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,655
Jungwoo saved me

45
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,449
Thanks to Jungwoo,

46
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,492
I could survive

47
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,662
I made a promise then

48
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,957
I'd do anything for Jungwoo

49
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,422
And now

50
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,091
Jungwoo is in front of me

51
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,609
I've never said this before

52
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,819
Thanks, Jungwoo

53
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,237
I've always been thankful

54
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,163
You're that thankful

55
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,456
And you always caused trouble?

56
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,415
Me?

57
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,750
What did I do?

58
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,959
Hey

59
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,545
You always bit my shoes

60
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,506
Ah, that

61
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,091
I don't do that anymore

62
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,093
If you do that now, you're a lunatic

63
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,553
You used to hug me and love me

64
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,013
Why don't you do it now?

65
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,849
I don't bite shoes anymore

66
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,976
It's the same now and then?

67
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,563
It's the same. I'm still Choco

68
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,577
I'm big, so I'm cuter

69
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,579
So love me more

70
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,039
Quiet

71
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,603
Your eyes might pop out

72
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,814
Don't mind it

73
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,733
Why

74
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,819
Did Choco do something wrong again?

75
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,070
Hey

76
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,117
He doesn't listen to me

77
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:36,956
Uhm... Didn't Choco hear what Milk said?

78
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,716
So reckless

79
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,429
I always tell him not to do it, but he's always reckless

80
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,389
Normally,

81
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,809
when you have something to protect, you become reckless

82
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:02,064
But it's too much to risk his own life

83
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,650
Because it's so precious

84
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,072
If it's so precious that he wants to sacrifice everything to protect it,

85
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,741
it's possible

86
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,744
That's called love

87
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,037
Love

88
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,542
Love, my foot

89
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,504
You must have such an experience

90
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,882
Of course. I'm an old man

91
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,134
Don't brag about your age

92
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,135
What?

93
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,810
You'll know one day

94
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,687
Young one

95
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,859
So annoying

96
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,919
Sorry, we're closed…

97
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,847
Jongwoo

98
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,725
Yes
