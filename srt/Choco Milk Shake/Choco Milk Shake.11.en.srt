Chapter 11 Jungwoo

7
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,591
Hey, Jungwoo.

8
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,347
Help me, Jungwoo.

9
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,015
I told you not to get in troubles.

10
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,058
Jungwoo,

11
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,227
Drink this chocolate milk. This is the one you like.

12
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,521
That was so long ago.

13
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,970
Is everything okay nowadays?

14
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,804
Yes,

15
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,472
Everything is okay.

16
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,391
I see.

17
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,726
What a relief.

18
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,733
Isn't it hard?

19
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,861
No,

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,738
It is not hard.

21
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,200
It shouldn't be

22
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,786
Hard.

23
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,375
Jungwoo,

24
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,002
Don't push yourself too hard.

25
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,630
It's okay if it's hard

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,131
Okay?

27
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,217
Okay.

28
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,099
Ah, by the way

29
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,185
are they doing well?

30
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,399
I don't know,

31
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,110
I really miss them.

32
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,738
Me too.

33
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
Choco, Milk

34
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,254
How are you?

35
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,424
I am doing my best for being okay.

36
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,679
Sometimes I think that I shouldn't have let you go like that,

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,014
I should have love you more,

38
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,642
Hugged you more.

39
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,644
I have a lot of regrets.

40
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,482
But, I understand

41
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,734
That I must be okay

42
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,529
So you are also relieved.

43
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,991
Jungwoo,

44
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,701
It have been too hard?

45
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,288
A little.

46
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,890
What is this?

47
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,392
This is the new menu.

48
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,145
It looks delicious.

49
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,868
Try it.

50
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,833
How is it?

51
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,169
It is delicious

52
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,505
Just…

53
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,007
Delicious?

54
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,051
A lot.

55
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,222
Ah, Milk was good at evaluating the taste.

56
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,101
Milk was a real gourmet.

57
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,021
If he comes back, he will have to eat all of this.

58
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,566
His belly will explode. 

59
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,445
- Is it good?
- Yes

60
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,574
Try this also.

61
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,707
What will you do after work?

62
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,667
Drink.

63
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,339
Choco,

64
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,300
I am still waiting for you.

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,095
If you come back to me,

66
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,097
That day I would be the first to run to you

67
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,099
And I will hug you.

68
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,744
It is cold.

69
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,290
Choco

70
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,918
Milk

71
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,516
After that,

72
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,561
Two winters have already passed.

73
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,029
This is the real Choco.

74
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,072
I am a little late, right?

75
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,491
Jungwoo

76
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,119
This is for real Choco's voice.

77
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,643
I missed you.

78
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,853
I missed you more.

79
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,022
Jungwoo.

80
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,409
Did you risk your life again?

81
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,954
The first one was difficult, the second one was easy

82
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,124
If I should come again, I will do it even with my eyes closed

83
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,835
How long will you be here this time?

84
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,172
Uhm...Around 100days?

85
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,467
Oh, longer than what I expected.

86
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,509
Yes.

87
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,594
Ah,

88
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,096
Milk didn't come back?

89
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,765
What? Yes, Milk also came back.

90
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,769
Where is him? Milk?

91
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,812
Ahem…

92
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,920
What?

93
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,631
What are you doing here?

94
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,040
How are you?

95
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,335
Not that good.

96
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,049
So, you will be okay from now on.

97
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,511
It seems like.

98
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,679
Yes.

99
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,474
Move, get away from me now.

100
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,144
- Nothing has changed, huh?
- Stop it, okay.

101
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,816
Was the balance okay today?

102
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,609
Well...

103
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,405
It is always the same.

104
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,048
Jungwoo, did you wake up?

105
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,763
Even when I wake up, you're in front of me.

106
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,229
Oh, come on.

107
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,243
Choco and Milk

108
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,203
Came back to me again.

109
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,624
But this time not for making me happy,

110
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,335
They came back because of their own happiness.

111
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,671
I think I look a little swollen today.

112
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,674
You look cute.

113
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,595
- Where are we going today?
- Ah

114
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,972
I looked for a good restaurant. Wait a little.

115
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,267
Oh! We are almost there.

116
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,269
Yes, is here.

117
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,527
Here...

118
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,620
Welcome.

119
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,502
This is the beginning

120
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,423
Of our real story.

121
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,526
I'll tell you an interesting story

122
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:13,490
It's a love story you've never heard before

123
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,454
The sun becomes the moon, the moon becomes the sun

124
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:23,751
Flying in the seas, swimming through the skies

125
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:31,508
Yeah that's right, It's a magical love story

126
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:40,476
Maybe, it'll happen to you, too

127
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:46,440
Remember our own stories

128
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,404
Remember, we were with you

129
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,200
So don't leave until our story ends

130
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,080
Don't leave me, then our story will go on

131
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:10,380
Yeah that's right, It's a magical love story

132
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:19,473
Maybe, it'll happen to you, too

133
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:25,479
Remember our own stories

134
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:31,443
Remember, we were with you

135
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,239
So don't leave until our story ends

136
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:41,036
Don't leave me, then our story will go on

137
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:49,461
This world doesn't always have a happy ending

138
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:58,428
Not before you two came along

139
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:04,393
Remember our own stories

140
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:10,357
Remember, we were with you

141
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,194
So don't leave until our story ends

142
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:22,452
Don't leave me, then our story will go on

143
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:28,458
Always remember, the moments between you and I

144
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:40,470
I will never let you go, forever

145
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:03,827
Choco Milk shake
