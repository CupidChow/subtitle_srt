1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,721
That's not really good

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,139
I like it

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,651
It's good

4
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,486
Okay

5
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,036
Move. I need to get ready for work

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,746
Are you going to work again?

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,955
Why are you going to work everyday?

8
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,790
You're supposed to do that

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,583
No

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,043
Stay with us today

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,713
Don't go

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,966
Let me go. I have to go

13
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,345
Let me go while I'm saying it nicely

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,433
Gosh, let me go. Seriously

15
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,897
Seriously

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,398
give me a break

17
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,406

Chapter 2 What brings you to my home?

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,656
You're here

23
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:55,865
Jung Woo...

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,267
I'm sorry

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,395
about bringing my friends suddenly

26
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,896
That's okay

27
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,441
It's nice that they're filling empty seats

28
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,985
Bring them often

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,297
It's my first time seeing your friends

30
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,924
They're so handsome

31
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,428
Well,

32
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,265
they are handsome

33
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,188
Oh, it's bitter

34
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,273
Are you a fool?

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,194
It smells good

36
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,322
Just don't drink it, like me

37
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,418
Stay out of trouble

38
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,628
Jung Woo

39
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,338
do it please

40
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,843
do you mind if I sit here?

41
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,678
Not at all

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,599
Nice to meet you

43
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,310
So your nicknames are...

44
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,729
Choco

45
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,439
and Milk?

46
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,401
Huh?

47
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,196
Aren't those the names of your dog and cat you had before?

48
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,322
That's right

49
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,616
I named them

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,451
because they look like them

51
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,788
Do they?

52
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,793
Geez... We totally look alike

53
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,920
Oh, really? I see

54
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,843
Okay, go ahead and eat

55
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,303
Eat the banana and whipped cream together

56
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,195
Let me answer my phone

57
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,580
- It's really good
- Yeah

58
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:40,882
What?

59
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,220
You little...

60
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,222
I told you to sit tight.

61
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,682
But I was.

62
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,852
You call that sitting tight?

63
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,400
Say sorry

64
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:03,821
Sorry

65
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,658
It's tasty

66
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,467
Give me a break...

67
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,850
What is it?

68
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,394
Something that makes me wanna drink

69
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,730
The landlord wants to raise the rent

70
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,986
Do you wanna have a drink after closing?

71
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,739
Well...

72
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,282
Shall we?

73
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,784
Yeah

74
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,495
Let's all drink together, then

75
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,542
Is that okay?

76
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,711
Let's drink together

77
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,063
hey

78
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,857
Jung Woo is drunk

79
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,903
What brings you here?

80
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,950
What do you mean?

81
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,078
We were bored staying home

82
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,163
No

83
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,622
Why...

84
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,208
did you...

85
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,378
come here?

86
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,463
Us?

87
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,298
We came because you called us

88
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,425
I did?

89
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,050
Yeah

90
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,886
When did I do that?

91
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,475
I don't recall

92
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,812
No, you called us

93
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,521
Yep

94
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,942
I don't remember that...

95
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,907
Gosh...

96
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,117
Then, how did you get here?

97
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,869
Well...

98
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,164
We risked our lives

99
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,041
crossing the Rainbow Bridge

100
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,709
passing through heaven and hell

101
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,835
Good grief!

102
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,674
It must've been so hard

103
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,136
What are you talking about?

104
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,975
Why did you come, though?

105
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,270
What do you mean?

106
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,065
I said earlier that you called us

107
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,110
I mean you came because I called you...

108
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,529
but why are you here?

109
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,782
What are you talking about?

110
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,284
Why?

111
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,161
Why?

112
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,873
Why...?

113
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,418
Just tell him why

114
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,177
We're there, Jungwoo. Here.

115
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,597
Gently.

116
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,558
Carefully.

117
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690
Gosh, he's quite heavy.

118
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,112
- I'll go wash first.
- OK.

119
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:37,887
We are here to make you happy.

120
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
That's the reason.

121
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,063
I'm glad you guys are here.

122
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,607
Me too.

123
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:56,238
It's so good that I can see you so closely, Jungwoo.

124
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,459
This time let's stay together for a long long time.

125
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:13,881
Sure.

126
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,348
I'll always be here with you.
