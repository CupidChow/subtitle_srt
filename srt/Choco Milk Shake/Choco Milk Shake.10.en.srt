1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:04,546
Choco Milk Shake

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:08,883
Chapter 10 Good Bye, Choco and Milk

3
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,646
I was used to being abandoned.

4
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:26,151
And Junwoo was the first one to give me love.

5
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,612
He taught me what it means

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:33,158
to be love and what it means

7
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,702
to be cared for.

8
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
So I liked it when Choco told me to come to meet Jungwoo.

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,127
Even if it's a short time

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,797
I was happy that I could be a part of Jung-woo's life

11
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,632
again.

12
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,890
Why are you leaving so early?

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,224
Just because.

14
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,435
I want to go on a walk

15
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,687
and look around here and there.

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,856
Do you want me to come with?

17
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,399
It's okay.

18
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,319
Let's just say 'goodbye' here.

19
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,037
Have a good life, Jungwoo.

20
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,373
Bye, Milk.

21
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,006
You have to be happy.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,258
Promise.

23
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,136
You have to be happy too.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,847
Okay?

25
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,494
I liked Jung-Woo because he was Jungwoo.

26
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,789
Though it wasn't an unconditional love like Choco

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,958
it was precious

28
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,459
and strong.

29
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,508
To be honest, it took me a while to think of Jungwoo like that.

30
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,385
I'm

31
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,470
scared of trusting someone

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,723
and having feelings for them.

33
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,397
But, why did I

34
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,318
come all the way here?

35
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,675
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,635
Just

37
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,346
I was passing by.

38
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,072
Isn't the cafe

39
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,949
not opened today?

40
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,328
I had something delivered here.

41
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,662
Ah...

42
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,711
Are you ready

43
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,212
to leave?  

44
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,343
Yeah.

45
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,431
When will you come back?

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,229
I'm not coming back now.

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,440
Ah...

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,069
You're completely going?

49
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,405
Yeah.

50
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,674
I must leave now

51
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,305
Um,

52
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,812
can you show me that look?

53
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,150
You hate it.

54
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,113
I just want to see it for the last time.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,420
Ah.

56
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,007
I knew I would feel weird.

57
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm leaving.

58
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,641
I think I didn't give a proper goodbye.

59
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,295
The 50 days that were a miracle to me.

60
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,258
After the long journey

61
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,260
I'm going back.

62
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,357
Do you think Milk got there okay?

63
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,192
Yeah.

64
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,902
He probably did.

65
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,283
Should we

66
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,743
go on a walk?

67
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,953
Yeah.

68
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,767
Why?

69
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,185
Why do you keep looking at me?

70
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,728
Just because

71
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,147
I want to.

72
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,877
Hey Choco.

73
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,670
Huh?

74
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,965
How was it when you were watching over me from heaven?

75
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,802
Um...

76
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,388
You often looked lonely

77
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,933
and looked tired a lot.

78
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,061
What about now?

79
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,771
You look much better.

80
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,524
You seem to be comfortable

81
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,276
and much happier.

82
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,114
You're right.

83
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,200
Now I'm happy and comfortable.

84
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,743
And I will continue to be.

85
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,872
Even if,

86
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,502
you don't dissapear.

87
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,316
You should follow Milk too.

88
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,361
No.

89
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,154
No.

90
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,114
You have to go too.

91
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,200
No.

92
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,118
Don't make me go.

93
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,081
I'm going to be next to Jungwoo.

94
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,958
Why are you trying to make me go?

95
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,669
I

96
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,589
because It is hard for me.

97
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,720
If I think about how you would dissapear,

98
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,226
my

99
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,604
my heart hurts.

100
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,677
But

101
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,223
if I think that you will be watching over me from the sky,

102
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,725
it gets better.

103
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,354
Though I can't see

104
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,315
we're together.

105
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,087
Don't cry.

106
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,759
It's my fault.

107
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,638
So go for me.

108
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,599
Okay.

109
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,900
You're nice.

110
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,950
Thank you for

111
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,702
coming in my life.

112
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,163
Jungwoo,

113
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,459
I love you.

114
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:48,082
When Choco arrived to heaven, he sat down and start crying

115
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:57,299
and Milk had to comfort Choco for a long time.

116
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,615
That's us!

117
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,492
I missed you so much, Jungwoo

118
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,202
Why do you keep following me?

119
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,495
Because I like you so much, Jung Woo

120
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,668
What's wrong with him? That's dangerous

121
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,794
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

122
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,879
I'm okay

123
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,756
Are you really okay?

124
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,673
Yeah, I am fine

125
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,926
Anyway, it was so dangerous

126
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,513
I've told you I am fine

127
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,764
What?

128
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,186
You little...

129
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,146
I told you to sit tight.

130
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,314
But I was.

131
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,818
You should have ordered bone-in chicken.

132
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,615
We

133
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,702
Don't have any resentment at you

134
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,183
Thanks, Jungwoo

135
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,018
I've always been thankful

136
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,979
I'm okay

137
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,523
Ah

138
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,905
Ask me again now

139
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,907
What?

140
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,325
Ask me

141
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,451
I will answer

142
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,962
I'm happy with you

143
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,923
And I love you

144
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,842
Since the day you found me

145
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,601
Why?

146
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,019
Why do you keep looking at me?

147
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,562
Just because

148
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,897
I want to.

149
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,660
If

150
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,080
you can be born again

151
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,247
what do you want to be born as?

152
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,415
A cat.

153
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,667
Again?

154
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:00,918
Yeah.

155
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,545
Then

156
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,798
I don't ever want to be caught

157
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,760
and as no one's possession

158
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,429
I want to roam around freely.

159
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,184
Jungwoo,

160
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,852
what about you?

161
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,813
I

162
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,817
I want to be human again.

163
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,029
I want to be the youngest of a big family.

164
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:32,991
What about you?

165
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,826
Me?

166
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,286
I just want to be by Jungwoo.

167
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,957
Be born again as a dog.

168
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,292
I don't care if I am born again as a dog.

169
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,128
As long as it's by Jungwoo.

170
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,134
Amazing.

171
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,179
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

172
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,597
Cheers.
