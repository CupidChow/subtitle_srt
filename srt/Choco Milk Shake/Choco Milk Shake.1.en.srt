Chapter 1 who is there?

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,654
These two guys who bother me

7
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:16,951
are ridiculously the dog and cat I had when I was little

8
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,704
We have to go back to last night

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,623
to explain this nonsense

10
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:30,465
The day before

11
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,823
Geez... What is it this time?

12
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,910
Sales don't match

13
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,955
Uncle, I'm taking off

14
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,748
Oh, okay

15
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,585
It's Friday night. You're not doing anything?

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,878
No

17
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,799
Or do you wanna have a drink with me?

18
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,385
Sorry, but I'm a little tired today

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,470
I see

20
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,265
You should go home and get some rest

21
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,851
Okay. You should go home, too

22
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,560
Okay

23
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,732
What's that?

24
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,843
Who are...

25
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,387
Jung Woo!

26
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,055
Excuse me?

27
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,597
Jung Woo!

28
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,556
Wait!

29
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,060
Hold on a sec!

30
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,062
Who are you?

31
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,855
Long time no see, Jung Woo

32
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,274
I missed you so much

33
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,608
Come on...

34
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,675
Are you kidding me?

35
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,385
You don't really expect me to believe that, do you?

36
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,431
We're not joking around. I'm Choco and he's Milk

37
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,058
We are the dog and cat you saved

38
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,853
I should say I chose you as my butler

39
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,356
You also named us

40
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,191
I'm Choco because my nose looks like chocolate

41
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,109
Huh?

42
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,902
He has white chest hair so he's Milk

43
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,863
Do you still have a scar on your right side?

44
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,907
I scratched you while  bathing me

45
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,784
- It was pretty bad
- A scratch?

46
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,619
I still feel bad about that

47
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,079
- When you were little
- You feel bad?

48
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,081
I ate the chocolate

49
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,875
you got on Valentine's Day

50
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,045
- and you got so scared that you took me to a vet
- I know. That was crazy

51
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,338
I sneaked into your backpack

52
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,715
and you went to school without knowing

53
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,718
- These stories are all about Choco and Milk
- I know. That was so funny

54
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,803
Don't you remember you fought with a dog that lived next door

55
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,306
and it almost turned into a family battle?

56
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,849
That Chihuahua?

57
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,393
- Yeah
- How do they know all about these stories?

58
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,689
Come to think of it,

59
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,316
those playful eyes do look like Choco

60
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,028
He's chic and a attention seeker

61
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,280
He definitely looks like Milk

62
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,575
This doesn't makes sense

63
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,328
They're really Choco and Milk?

64
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,081
Jung Woo! Jung Woo!

65
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,043
You really don't recognize us? We lived together for 10 years

66
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,377
11 years for me

67
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,505
Don't you remember that time with us?

68
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,924
I remember all about you, Jungwoo

69
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,638
Of course I remember Choco and Milk

70
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,265
That's us!

71
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,772
Don't you think

72
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,691
you've changed a little too much?

73
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,984
What's changed?

74
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,071
We're the same

75
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:46,781
Jung Woo!

76
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,949
Give me your hands

77
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,537
Gosh, I think it's Choco

78
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,289
That's what we're telling you

79
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,749
Now you remember us?

80
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,336
Didn't you miss us?

81
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,840
Of course I missed Choco and Milk

82
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,844
- But I never imagined this...
- Me, too

83
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,096
I missed you so much, Jungwoo

84
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,181
Jung Woo!

85
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,605
This is the incredible situation

86
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,691
what happened to me

87
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,127
Oh...

88
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,336
Did you wash up?

89
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,379
Yes...

90
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
Thanks

91
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,733
Why do you keep following me?

92
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,193
Because I like you so much, Jung Woo

93
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,741
Stop following me, okay? You are making me crazy

94
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,715
Give him a break

95
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,799
What did I do?

96
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,011
We still feel awkward with this look. How would he feel?

97
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,596
Especially you!

98
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,222
Me?

99
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,600
You don't look like a Maltese

100
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,769
You are too...

101
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,895
What about me?

102
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,275
Too big...

103
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,945
You think you're small?

104
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,657
Does he feel awkward that much?

105
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,369
Of course. So don't push him too much

106
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,954
Take your time...

107
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,172
Jung Woo!

108
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:08,965
Yeah?

109
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,925
I will... I'll do it, I want to do it!

110
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,759
What?

111
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,677
I will!

112
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,678
Hey!!!

113
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,098
It's mine!!!

114
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,557
Hey! What's wrong with him?

115
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,184
Hey! He's telling you to stop!

116
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,644
Just leave it!!

117
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,633
You ****

118
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,264
Troublemakers, Choco and Milk are back

119
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,099
Choco! Milk!

120
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,103
Please behave well

121
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,514
I am so tired...

122
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,814
Why did you come in?

123
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,858
We've got to sleep, too

124
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,152
Why here?

125
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,779
Get out of here. Sleep outside

126
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,364
Come on

127
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,493
Get out! I can't sleep with someone else

128
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,788
Come on! You liked sleeping with us

129
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,629
I told you to get out

130
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,757
Hey...

131
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,592
Let's get out...

132
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,511
Geez...

133
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,522
Come out already

134
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,524
Good night, Jung Woo!
