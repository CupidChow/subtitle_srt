1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,172
Sorry, we're closed…

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,971
Jongwoo

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,347
Yes

4
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:31,281
Choco Milk Shake

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:35,618
EP.7 On the night you were asleep

6
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,709
That guy

7
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:48,089
Wasn't he the nicest of all guys who Jungwoo dated?

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,382
Yeah

9
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,386
He cared about Jungwoo the most

10
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,597
Then isn't it better if they get back together?

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,851
Yeah

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,686
That would be better

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,445
Ahh

14
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,405
Shouldn't we go home?

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,657
Are you going to keep on waiting?

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,413
We have no idea when he's coming though

17
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,791
Or are you going to go look for him like you did last time?

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,552
Whatever

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,262
I don't care anymore

20
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,765
You do whatever you want. I'm leaving.

21
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,934
Pffft

22
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,102
I hope you get eaten alive by all the mosquitoes

23
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,198
Hey Jungwoo

24
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,784
You got here earlier than I thought

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,746
Pfff

26
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,539
What the

27
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,666
How did you know it was me?

28
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,252
Before you got to the alley way back

29
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,087
I picked up on your scent

30
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,255
Oh?

31
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,302
Do I smell?

32
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,930
Yeah a really nice smell

33
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,518
Kind of smell that I want to be around all day long

34
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,067
Aren't you going home?

35
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,486
Jungwoo

36
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,695
Yeah?

37
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,906
I've been waiting for you patiently

38
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,491
Aren't you going to show me some love?

39
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,681
Doesn't it hurt?

40
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,515
No

41
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,350
It doesn't hurt at all

42
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,688
It better not leave a scar

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,652
It would get better if you blow on it 

44
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,947
Do you want me to blow to your scar?

45
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,912
So cute

46
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,665
It really doesn't hurt?

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,750
Yeah I'm okay

48
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,003
Ah

49
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,898
What the

50
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,317
Why are you here?

51
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,777
You must be working overtime today

52
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,656
Yeah I'm having issues balancing the books

53
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,620
If you don't have any customers, why the sales balance never match?

54
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,917
Why are you still here?

55
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,507
Boss

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,094
Can you buy me a drink?

57
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,598
Now?

58
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,816
Okay

59
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,604
Are you happy to be out for a walk, Gurum?

60
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,815
Your mom's happy too

61
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,317
Do you love your mom, Gurum?

62
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,153
- I love Gurum so much
- Look at that
- Hmm?

63
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:52,203
Back when you were a puppy, I wondered about the same thing

64
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,413
Whether you love me or not

65
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,499
And if you are truly happy

66
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,753
I asked you everyday remember?

67
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,800
What's wrong?

68
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,845
Ask me again now

69
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,720
What?

70
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,265
Ask me

71
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,766
I will answer

72
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,395
Or do you want me to show you?

73
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,823
Can I?

74
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,660
What?

75
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,458
If I can show you my answer

76
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,377
to the questions you want to ask me

77
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,963
Is it okay if I show you instead?

78
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,420
Milk. No.

79
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,838
It's not safe

80
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,675
Cheers

81
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,769
- Cheers again
- No, no. Let's drink water

82
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,020
- Cheers again
- No no

83
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,481
Let go

84
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,235
Can I give you some water?

85
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,405
- Hey
- Hey?

86
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,741
Why you little

87
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,535
Hey I will sing you a song

88
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,049
Are you drunk already?

89
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,595
I thought you wanted to tell me what's been bugging you

90
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,972
No

91
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,019
I'm gonna go

92
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,898
Alone

93
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,567
I'm gonna go

94
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,987
Choco that bastard

95
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:37,868
is an idiot

96
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,121
Look at all the drinks

97
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,665
What are you talking about

98
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,834
It's clear
