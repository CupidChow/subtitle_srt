1
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:16,474
Jungwoo, you didn't forget about the blind date, did you?

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,935
No, I didn't. I was about to leave

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,821
Okay. I'm really sorry. And thank you!

4
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,167
What?

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,043
What?

6
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,629
I wanna go with you

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,965
I said no

8
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,925
Why not? I wanna go with you

9
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,139
Gosh...

10
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,184
If you behave well while waiting for me

11
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,895
I'll treat you nicely when I get back

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,313
Treat me nicely?

13
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,606
What would you do, precisely?

14
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,649
If you don't make any trouble when I get back, I'll do it for you

15
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,362
I'll be back

16
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,531
Stay

17
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,784
Don't get yourselves in trouble

18
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,577
Don't be late

19
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,120
Got it

20
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,809
I miss him already

21
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,686
Good grief...

22
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,189
Give me a break

Chapter 5 Jungwoo's blind date

29
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,734
Hello!

30
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,404
Were you waiting for long?

31
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,572
No, no

32
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,407
I just got here

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,158
Ahh...

34
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,592
I heard you never go on a blind date

35
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,469
But you're so my type

36
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,806
You're so handsome

37
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,807
Oh...

38
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,267
Thanks

39
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,769
Oh...

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,608
I'm not a person who has a hard time talking to someone

41
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,068
But I'm kind of nervous today

42
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,738
It's hot...

43
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,657
Oh,

44
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,451
Have some bread

45
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,037
- No thanks
- Okay...

46
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:26,873
Oh!

47
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,209
Where are you from?

48
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,210
I'm from Seoul

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,085
You are?

50
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,462
Me, too

51
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,755
Amazing!

52
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,341
What's your favorite food?

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:36,966
Well,

54
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,926
Kimchi-jjigae?

55
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,468
Wow

56
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,053
Kimchi-jjigae?

57
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,721
That's my favorite food

58
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,931
Amazing!

59
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,682
Oh,

60
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,559
I heard you live by yourself?

61
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,020
I live alone but...

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,063
Well,

63
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,774
Right now, I live with a dog and a cat

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,400
A dog and a cat?

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,151
Amazing!

66
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,111
I really like animals, too

67
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,363
What are their names?

68
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,740
Choco and Milk

69
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,367
Choco and Milk?

70
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,661
Wow, those are cute names

71
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,997
I've been so out of it

72
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,624
because of them

73
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,292
Once you look away, they'll get into trouble

74
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,086
They're supposed to sleep outside

75
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,629
But they sleep next to me

76
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,798
Wow, that's cute

77
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,133
Actually

78
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,094
I've been going through a hard time lately

79
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,806
I'm tired of a lot of things

80
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,107
Ha...

81
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,993
Ha...

82
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,579
Choco... Milk...

83
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,293
I miss you guys

84
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,422
A lot

85
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,899
That was true

86
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,111
I really called them

87
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,945
Excuse me?

88
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,904
Oh

89
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,322
it's nothing

90
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,951
Eat some bread

91
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,036
Oh...

92
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,037
I'll eat it later

93
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,912
Oh, okay

94
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,873
It tastes good

95
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,374
I see

96
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,968
What the heck?

97
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,678
Gosh, that's scary...

98
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,805
What is it?

99
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,184
It's just... A weird guy keeps staring at me from outside

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,518
A weird guy?

101
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,445
That guy...

102
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,660
Oh my, that's creepy

103
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,996
Well...

104
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,831
Do you wanna go somewhere else?

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,584
Yes

106
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,670
Excuse me

107
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,839
Can I get the rest to go?

108
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,425
I didn't even take a bite yet

109
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,155
Why do you keep looking around?

110
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,158
I feel like someone has been following me

111
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,917
I'm sorry but

112
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,545
I think I should get going

113
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,212
Already?

114
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:01,796
Oh...

115
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,006
My pets have a separation anxiety

116
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,715
Oh...

117
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,050
That's too bad

118
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,635
I'll take you home then

119
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,887
Thanks, but I'm okay

120
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,389
I'll go on my own

121
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,307
I just feel bad

122
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,269
It's really okay

123
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,855
Oh...

124
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,162
Wait a second

125
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,246
You...

126
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,581
Choco!

127
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,332
Don't do that!

128
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,167
Let him go

129
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,418
- Let him go
- Let me go

130
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,503
- You're not gonna?
- You're not? One, two...

131
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,964
Why is he so big?

132
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,216
Choco? You're raising a man?

133
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:47,967
What?

134
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,802
Oh, it's not what you think...

135
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,262
Why did you follow him?

136
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,805
I mean

137
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,142
he didn't eat any bread

138
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,560
What's he saying?

139
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,728
Ha...

140
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,940
They have good bread

141
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,693
I'm so sorry

142
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,195
Gosh...

143
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,705
Gosh!

144
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm bored

145
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,920
I should've gone with Choco

146
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,566
What about Milk?

147
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,695
He said you'd be mad if we get caught

148
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,030
He's at home

149
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,702
Should we take a break?

150
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,287
Yeah

151
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,306
- How long have you been following me?
- What?

152
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,476
Well...

153
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,812
I wasn't going to...

154
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,733
I mean I was gonna wait for you at home

155
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,070
I was wondering who you were meeting

156
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,198
and I was also worried you might meet someone dangerous

157
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,826
You're saying you followed me because you were concerned?

158
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,620
That too

159
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,080
I just...

160
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,708
wanted to see you from a distance

161
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,400
- You're back, Jungwoo
- Yeah

162
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,444
Did you behave?

163
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,196
Why are you coming with him?

164
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,698
I got caught...

165
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:29,003
You stayed home and didn't get in trouble

166
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,047
I'll treat you nicely

167
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,593
What about me?

168
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,348
You don't even listen to me

169
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,183
Geez...

170
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,439
Oh, I remember that now

171
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,734
Remember what?

172
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,320
When I called you

173
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,448
Really?

174
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,743
Thank you

175
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,121
For coming to me, risking your life crossing heaven and hell

176
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,958
I'm thankful for that

177
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,003
So, I'll treat both of you nicely this time

178
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,996
Can you do it more?

179
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,518
I should wash up now

180
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,266
Are you asleep, Milk?

181
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,976
Yeah...

182
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,773
What's it like to be human?

183
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,530
I like it

184
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,242
I can see Jungwoo as much as I want

185
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,039
and eat a lot of delicious food

186
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,460
I like it, too

187
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,504
Being with Jungwoo

188
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,179
What if...

189
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,306
What would happen

190
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,977
if we don't go back to where we were on time?

191
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,522
What do you mean?

192
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,941
We'll no longer exist soon after

193
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,072
We will, right?

194
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,244
Hey!

195
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,206
Hey!

196
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,917
What's on your mind?

197
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,460
It just...

198
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,131
I wanna be with Jungwoo

199
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,092
I wanna stay with him for good

200
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,428
Are you out of your mind?

201
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,347
If that happens, we can't see him forever

202
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,184
Okay, okay. I was just saying that

203
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,646
When are you gonna tell him?

204
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,318
Soon
