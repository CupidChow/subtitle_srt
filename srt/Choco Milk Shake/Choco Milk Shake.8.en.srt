1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,670
What's wrong?

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,297
Ask me again now

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,590
What?

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,135
Ask me

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,636
I will answer

6
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,932
Or do you want me to show you?

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,318
Can I?

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,156
What?

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,953
If I can show you my answer

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,873
to the questions you want to ask me

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,459
Is it okay if I show you instead?

12
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,955
Choco Milk Shake

13
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:25,293
Ep.8 What I Want to Ask You

14
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,819
Sit down

15
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,958
Come on, hurry up

16
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,430
Where did you sleep last night? Why are you coming this late?

17
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,765
I couldn't get ahold of you

18
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,811
Don't you think about people who are waiting for you?

19
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,656
What's with him?

20
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,290
What am I gonna do?

21
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,974
That's right. I've never done it before

22
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,102
So what?

23
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,606
You don't even know what I'm thinking

24
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,608
I'm the most precious to me

25
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,026
Jungwoo? He is important

26
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,987
but I'm the most important to me

27
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,572
I have no idea what you're talking about

28
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,616
Is it a crime not to have ever loved someone?

29
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:24,495
Where is the person who was so precious to you?

30
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,497
Milk,

31
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,918
Why are curious about that?

32
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:34,881
I'm sure she's very pretty

33
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,890
Don't look at me like that

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,350
Like what?

35
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,977
When you look at me like that

36
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,441
I feel weird

37
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,693
Like this?

38
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,697
You feel weird when I look at you like this?

39
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,128
Don't laugh

40
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,465
How can you be so cute?

41
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,136
Oh my gosh

42
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,649
I don't remember what happened after that

43
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,735
And when I woke up

44
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,407
I was at his house

45
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,751
What the heck?

46
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,047
Why are you kicking me?

47
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,674
Why am I here?

48
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,884
What do you mean why? You threw up and made a mess

49
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,969
so I had to clean up the cafe

50
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,763
I washed your clothes

51
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,058
Oh, my. My back really hurts

52
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,019
My back hurts, you punk

53
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,979
You

54
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,024
You're thinking something weird, huh?

55
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,652
I didn't do anything to you

56
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,656
I'm not interested in someone who's drunk at all. Okay?

57
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,367
- Gosh, I'm sleepy
- Go away

58
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,912
- Let me get some sleep
- Fine. Bring my clothes, then

59
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,373
How come you didn't dress me?

60
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,668
- You're not dressed?
- No, I'm not

61
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,174
I think you can't see my uncle for a while

62
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,343
Nothing happened

63
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,472
I mean that's what he said

64
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,015
You drink

65
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,225
and stay out

66
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,978
You've become a human now

67
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,482
I'm never drinking again

68
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,986
You can call me a dog if I drink again

69
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,946
Hey

70
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,115
Are you looking down on dogs now?

71
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,408
Yeah

72
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,377
I'm meeting someone. I'd better get going

73
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,337
Don't get in trouble while I am not here

74
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,005
Is it a date?

75
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,258
Yeah

76
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,557
I'll be back

77
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,726
Okay

78
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,313
See you

79
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm so embarrassed I could die

80
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,935
No one died from embarrassment

81
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,273
It's annoying that he keeps looking down on me

82
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,483
I don't think he's looking down on you

83
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,946
No, he keeps laughing at me

84
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,950
Why do you care about that all of a sudden?

85
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,079
- You don't care about anything
- I dunno

86
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,498
It just bothers me

87
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,011
By the way

88
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,762
What's with you and Jungwoo?

89
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,931
What?

90
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,518
Something must've happened yesterday

91
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,394
Huh?

92
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,522
- Oh, we kissed
- Oh

93
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,652
What?

94
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,905
You kissed?

95
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,211
What are you thinking?

96
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,046
Mind your own business

97
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,382
Even if you cling to Jungwoo

98
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,885
you will disappear soon

99
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,931
and he'll be all alone again

100
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,895
We should help him

101
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,691
to make sure he'll be okay even after we leave

102
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,488
- He's going to make him happy...
- I know

103
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,949
You don't think I know that?

104
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,083
But...

105
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,501
What?

106
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,295
Say "Woof"

107
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,551
What the...?

108
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,595
Who do you think I'm eating this for?

109
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,096
Walking along the Han River with you

110
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,182
reminds me of the old times

111
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,600
I know

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,937
We used to date a lot here

113
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,064
Because we didn't have much money

114
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,198
You've changed a lot

115
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,616
Like what?

116
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,453
You hear that a lot these days, right?

117
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,204
You look relaxed

118
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,081
I'm not sure

119
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,833
I think it was 3 weeks ago

120
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,835
I happened to see you working at the cafe

121
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,755
while I was walking

122
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,798
I was so surprised then

123
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,258
Why?

124
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,385
Because you looked happy

125
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,346
Is it because of him?

126
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,972
Choco?

127
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,807
No, it's not

128
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,893
Come on

129
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,146
Do you know how many times you mentioned choco?

130
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,816
I did?

131
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,860
Jungwoo

132
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,362
Yeah?

133
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,530
When we were together

134
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,991
before

135
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,287
you looked okay most of times

136
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
but sometimes

137
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,459
you looked like you were ready to leave me

138
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,213
Even if you were with me

139
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,174
you looked like you were by yourself

140
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,427
I made you feel lonely, didn't I?

141
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,639
I didn't know

142
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,267
But you don't look like that anymore

143
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,811
You...

144
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:31,107
You look so happy

145
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,693
You look excited

146
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,530
so don't let him go

147
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,990
For yourself

148
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,870
But

149
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,164
he's leaving soon

150
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,418
far away

151
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,427
Every meeting led to a parting

152
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,931
That's why meeting someone is so precious

153
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,268
So Jungwoo,

154
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,938
Don't be afraid of saying goodbye

155
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,500
So Jungwoo,

156
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,669
Don't be afraid of saying goodbye

157
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,213
Even if that happens tomorrow

158
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,591
Don't let it drag you down

159
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,510
and miss something precious

160
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,840
Were you waiting for me?

161
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,133
Yeah

162
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,010
You didn't even know when I'd come back

163
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,723
I will wait for you as long as it takes

164
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,601
Gosh

165
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,311
Did you drink?

166
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,021
You smell like it

167
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,731
Just a little bit

168
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,609
You're early by the way

169
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:43,572
There's someone who is desperately waiting for me at home

170
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,742
You're so kind

171
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,661
Good boy

172
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,665
Do you think I am like you?

173
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
That I like getting a pat?

174
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,626
Hmph

175
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,925
You know what?

176
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,051
Yeah?

177
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,391
I'm gonna ask you now

178
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,060
I've wanted to ask you this for a while

179
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,023
Are you happy

180
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,484
- with me?
- Huh?

181
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,697
Do you...

182
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,158
love me?

183
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,579
Yeah

184
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm happy with you

185
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,043
And I love you

186
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,338
Since the day you found me

187
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,736
Jungwoo

188
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,321
Yes?

189
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,453
If someday you feel ready

190
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,250
to meet someone again

191
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,173
Would you give me another chance?

192
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,719
Okay. I will

193
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,847
Okay

194
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,522
Should we say goodbye now?

195
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,981
Here?

196
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,070
Jungwoo

197
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,823
Let me hold you one last time

198
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,534
Good grief

199
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,245
My arms hurt

200
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,539
Fine

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,210
Jungwoo

202
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,088
I want you to be happy

203
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,674
Thank you

204
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,676
You, too
