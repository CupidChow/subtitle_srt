1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,480
Let’s go

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,231
Okay.

3
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,570
Where are you going? I don't want to go

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,740
No, I'm going to go with Jungwoo. Follow me or not

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,868
I came here because of you. How can you do this to me?

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,953
You said nothing happened

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,874
Hey, you can drink and tell him the truth

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,459
- Come on
- No

9
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,753
- Let's go
- I don't want to

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,880
No, please

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,966
No, wait. I don't want to go

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,057
Choco Milk Shake

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,394
Chapter 9 Everyone has secrets

14
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,400
You're here?

15
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
Hello

16
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,849
He’s coming, coming, coming, coming

17
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,643
I hope he won’t come, he won’t come

18
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,520
Is he coming? here?

19
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,234
Is there anything else you need? Sir

20
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,737
We have some customers today

21
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,199
There are two handsome male customers at our cafe

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,743
And there's a rumor that they will stay here

23
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,330
I can help you if you are busy

24
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,251
I guess you feel sorry for me

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,505
- If not, never mind
- No, it's not

26
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,382
I'd appreciate it if you could help me

27
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,133
Thank you.

28
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,176
You are so kind, Milk

29
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,808
Are you okay?

30
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,226
Be quiet

31
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,514
I'll do it.

32
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,868
I've never seen so many customers

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,996
The boss was so excited

34
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,800
Welcome

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,468
What?

36
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,053
Is there another costumer?

37
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,429
Hey

38
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,433
- When did you come back to Korea?
- Last week

39
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,143
And you are coming to say hi just now?

40
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,686
I came as fast as I could

41
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,230
You should've run over here as soon as you got off the plane

42
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,441
I came as fast as I could

43
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,282
How have you not changed at all?

44
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,742
I'm the only one who got older

45
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
You haven't changed at all

46
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,998
Yes, I'm the same

47
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,507
You're still cute

48
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,800
You're small

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,177
Are you teasing me?

50
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,264
- Why? I am telling you the truth
- I thought you were joking

51
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,855
Enjoy your coffee.

52
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,149
Oh, yes. Thank you

53
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,319
Yes, thank you

54
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,122
- Sorry
- It's okay. It's okay

55
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,170
What's wrong with him?

56
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,049
I think I know

57
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,390
What did you do in The United States?

58
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,474
Just studying

59
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,476
Waste money 

60
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,319
- How does the coffee taste?
- The coffee?

61
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
You haven't tried this in America, have you?

62
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,706
I gotta go 

63
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,833
Okay, go home safely

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,960
See you at home later

65
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,962
Yes, it's going to be fun

66
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,675
See you later.

67
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,260
- See you later
- Yes

68
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,729
isn't he close to you?

69
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,023
Yes. He's my junior from high school.

70
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,776
We lived in the same neighborhood since we were young

71
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,153
I think I have to go first

72
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,529
Do you think you can close the cafe?

73
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,114
Yes, of course.

74
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,991
Don't end it on time

75
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,410
Just finish it early

76
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,453
All right.

77
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,330
- Let's go clean up
- Yes

78
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,464
You're the owner of this cafe but you're very irresponsible

79
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,426
You're back as a feisty Milk

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,306
You didn't like it? Sorry

81
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,183
Oh…

82
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,644
I told you not to look at me like that

83
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,020
What?

84
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,316
What is this level of development?

85
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,777
I love this drama

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,160
Others will like it if you look at them like that,

87
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,913
But I don't like it

88
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,626
- That's how I see you….
- You have to hurry up

89
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,587
Aren't you supposed to meet him or something? 

90
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:06,050
Hey, that's because he came back to Korea after 3 years and our moms are close, so...

91
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,140
Look

92
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,309
Why should I give you this excuse?

93
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,228
I really don't know

94
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,636
It's gonna be okay.

95
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,730
I heard it from Jungwoo.

96
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,608
Soon, you guys

97
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,318
you are going to go far away

98
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,326
Let's eat something together before you leave

99
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,494
How did you find out?

100
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,956
Just by chance

101
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,250
I heard what you guys said

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,084
Jungwoo…

103
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,585
I'm fine.

104
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,087
I understand.

105
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,799
To be honest,

106
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,343
I wasn't that surprised

107
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,973
I think I kind of expected it

108
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,559
You suddenly appeared to me one day

109
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,191
So I thought, you would suddenly disappear one day

110
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,821
Sorry, Jungwoo

111
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,241
Don't be sorry.

112
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,329
Thanks to you guys,

113
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,498
I'm happy enough

114
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,920
Thank you so much

115
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,676
We don't have much time left

116
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,388
Let's save it and get along well

117
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,308
I'm not leaving

118
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,518
Dude.

119
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,562
You

120
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,439
Are you not going to see Jungwoo forever?

121
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,107
Even if we go back

122
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,735
Nobody knows if we'll see Jungwoo again

123
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,528
Maybe we won't be able to see him again

124
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,238
What's wrong with you?

125
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,117
Jungwoo, just let me be next to you

126
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,287
Just let me stay next to you, okay?

127
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,791
- I want to see you till the end
- You're crazy

128
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,793
Jungwoo

129
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,462
Please

130
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,713
Yes?

131
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,851
Okay.

132
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,103
Let's do that

133
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,990
I hate you guys

134
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,162
I don't like you either

135
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,959
I don't like Jungwoo who can't even stop Choco

136
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,550
I don't like the boss who makes me feel confused

137
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,012
I hate you all

138
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,890
Hey

139
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,519
Hey

140
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,729
Look at me

141
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,274
You

142
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,697
That's why you asked me to come with him

143
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,324
Yes?

144
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,952
You were planning to do this from the beginning

145
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,081
It's like that, right?

146
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,551
I came here for no reason

147
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,768
I shouldn't have come

148
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,072
Milk

149
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,572
What about Choco?

150
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,701
He’s waiting for us at home

151
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,787
Ha…

152
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,541
Since when he listens what you tell to him?

153
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm sorry that I got mad

154
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,437
I don't regret coming here for you

155
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,857
Thank you.

156
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,278
Thank you for coming for me

157
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,537
Don't worry about Choco

158
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm not going to let him disappear

159
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,132
When he was a puppy he had that accident because of me

160
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,428
This time

161
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,473
That won't happen again because of me

162
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,032
Thank you, Jungwoo.
