1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,476
Jungwoo

2
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,331
Don't do it. I'm tired

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,249
Get out

4
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,006
Let's go out

5
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,383
Let's go out

6
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:55,889
Come out

7
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,658
I think Jungwoo is really sick

8
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:16,868
Yeah

9
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,956
Should we wake him up and make him take medicines?

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,502
If we forcibly wake him up, he will hate it

11
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,545
Then do we have to just wait like this continuously?

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,093
Let's do what we can do

13
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,402
👦 Ko Hojung 👦

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,740
🐶 Lee Jaebin 🐶

15
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,787
🐱 Kim Seonghyeok 🐱

16
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,792
🧑 Park Seungbin 🧑

17
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:15,301
Chapter 4 Omurice

18
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,003
Hands up

19
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,517
Turn around, please

20
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,272
Let's go to work.

21
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,198
It has to be wiped

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,365
Okay, I will do it

23
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,199
The finger here...

24
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,160
Okay, I will do it

25
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,994
Hold it

26
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,787
No, not you

27
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,706
Make the fingers like this

28
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,083
This, I mean, huh?

29
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,127
Let go

30
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,924
Is this not right?

31
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,800
Move

32
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:39,677
Another thing

33
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,845
What kinds of draft beer are available?

34
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,680
Asahi

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,533
I heard it's your first part-time job

36
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,368
you are doing it good

37
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,286
I am quick-witted

38
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,289
Really? As expected

39
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,343
Are you awake?

40
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,850
Yeah

41
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,393
Here

42
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,062
You always had your medicine with chocolate milk

43
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,607
That was so long ago

44
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,901
Really? Then do you want me to change it to water?

45
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,488
No, it's okay

46
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,534
Thank you

47
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,913
No problem

48
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,915
Then take some rest

49
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,147
You are hungry, right?

50
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,066
Do you want me to cook something for you?

51
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,277
- Yeah, thank you
- Okay

52
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,343
Why? Do I look cool?

53
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,720
- Do you think you will fall in love with me?
- What are you talking about?

54
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,367
Thank you for the food

55
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,589
How is it?

56
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,217
Does it taste good?

57
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,055
It's really delicious

58
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,432
I'm glad it's delicious

59
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,184
It's been a while since I cooked it

60
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,771
It's delicious, why is it not on the cafe menu?

61
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,815
Oh, this

62
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,775
This is the recipe of my eldest sister

63
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,780
I couldn't make it as delicious as hers, so I just removed it

64
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,033
Oh, Jungwoo's mom

65
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,162
Ah…

66
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,708
Omurice made by my eldest sister

67
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,793
Was somewhat special

68
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,715
I can't dare imitate it

69
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,721
This is delicious too

70
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,431
Really

71
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,688
But

72
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,110
I think it will taste better with butter in the sauce

73
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,195
Butter?

74
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,671
Try them

75
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,758
All of them?

76
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,800
Yeah

77
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,242
I am so full

78
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,452
Such an evil boss...

79
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,287
What do you mean an evil boss?

80
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,165
Evaluating the taste of the dishes is also one of the duties of the employee

81
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,463
Cleanse your palate with this

82
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,384
I don't eat everything that is given to me

83
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,100
Oh, you are doing a good job

84
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,437
- Do you want more?
- No

85
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,273
- Hey, try this too
- I said no

86
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,941
- I don't eat vegetables
- Vegetables...

87
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,151
- I don't eat vegetables
- They are good for the health

88
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,080
What are you doing here?

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,710
Jungwoo, you are awake

90
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,503
You should get more rest

91
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
You would be hungry

92
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,548
Huh?

93
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,427
Jungwoo, are you hungry?

94
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,346
It's past meal time

95
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,889
Hold on, Jungwoo

96
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,935
I will cook it for you

97
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,228
What are you going to cook?

98
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,605
There is something I wanted to cook for you since before

99
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,140
Jungwoo

100
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,809
Jungwoo

101
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,437
Jungwoo

102
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,606
Jungwoo

103
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,233
Mom?

104
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,488
Are you sick?

105
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,034
You have a slight fever

106
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,913
I told you to rest instead of going to school today

107
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,956
Then I can't get the perfect attendance award

108
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,050
First, take the medicine and wait

109
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,719
I will cook something delicious for you

110
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,845
Okay

111
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,897
Jungwoo, did you fall sleep?

112
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,734
Oh. No

113
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,739
Can you eat?

114
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,619
Here

115
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,460
- It's omurice
- Yeah

116
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,461
Try it

117
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,338
Yeah, thank you for the food

118
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,843
How is it?

119
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,760
Is it delicious?

120
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,220
Is it good?

121
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,139
I haven't tried yet

122
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,855
Is it weird?

123
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,274
This is the omurice that was cooked whenever Jungwoo was sick

124
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,067
I tried following it

125
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,445
I tried to remember the time I ate it in secret before

126
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,367
Is it really weird?

127
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,375
Jungwoo

128
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,627
What's wrong?

129
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,879
Thank you for the food

130
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,012
Thanks a lot

131
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,513
Yeah

132
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,890
That's a relief
