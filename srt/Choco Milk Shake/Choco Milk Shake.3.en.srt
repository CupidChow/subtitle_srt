1
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,861
When will you come back?

2
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,106
Where are you going?

3
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,775
To the convenience store

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,026
Let's go together

5
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,110
I will be back soon

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,987
Please wait for me at home obediently

7
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,047
Where did Jungwoo go?

8
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,842
He said he was going to the convenience store

9
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,729
I want to follow him

10
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,232
Just sit down

11
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,859
Just wait quietly!

12
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:04,040

Chapter 3 The truth about Choco and Milk

17
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,198
Hey, Jungwoo!

18
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,411
I told you to wait at home

19
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,968
I've told you to wait at home obediently!

20
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,262
What will we do if an accident happens?

21
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,432
I am sorry

22
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,143
You are worried because of me?

23
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,859
Why did it take too long? 

24
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,530
You are hungry, right?

25
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,323
Just wait a little

26
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,261
What happened to Choco?

27
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,095
Huh?

28
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,096
Nothing

29
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,977
So why Choco looks so dispirited?

30
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,272
Milk

31
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,481
Yes?

32
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,694
Have you ever felt any resentment at me? 

33
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,448
What are you talking about? Why should I resent you?

34
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,159
Because, it was me

35
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,372
It was too late when I noticed that you were sick

36
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,878
Are you stupid?

37
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,006
Do you still thinking that it was your fault?

38
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,633
You think that we died because of you?

39
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,776
We don't think like that 

40
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,907
Do you know what was our biggest worry

41
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,410
Even when we were about to die?

42
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,707
That it would be difficult for you

43
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,836
That you would be sad for a long time 

44
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,424
That was our biggest worry

45
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,814
Really?

46
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,203
We

47
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,499
Don't have any resentment at you

48
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,594
Hey, Milk

49
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,805
Why are you hugging Junwoo? 

50
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,432
I also want to hug him

51
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,057
- Let's do the cleaning
- Ok

52
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,821
- Let's go, let's go
- Ok

53
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,574
Are you sleepy?

54
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,494
Do you want to drink some coffee?

55
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,411
Sounds good

56
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,497
A cup go milk for me, please

57
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,706
Aha, okay

58
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,333
A cup of milk tea for me

59
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,420
Cold

60
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,942
Excuse me

61
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,485
Choco

62
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,986
Yes?

63
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,450
About that burdensome stare

64
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,869
How can we fix it?

65
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,329
Stare?

66
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,623
What's wrong with the way I look at you?

67
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,919
Uhm...

68
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,674
You are too cheesy when you stare at him 

69
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,676
- What?
- You should do it like me

70
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,970
Look carefully

71
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,764
When your eyes met like this

72
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:18,849
Ehem

73
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,643
Pretend that you are not looking at

74
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,062
- Like this
- Mmmm

75
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,439
When Jungwoo looks to another place, look at him again

76
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,650
Not burdensome

77
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,610
Got it

78
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,864
Exactly, like that

79
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,037
Right

80
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,664
Good job

81
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,544
- Right?
- Right

82
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,088
Ah...

83
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,432
- Not bright gaze
- How do you open your eyes with such a beautiful gaze?

84
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,684
But, why Jungwoo haven't said anything?

85
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,312
Because you look at him like this

86
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,318
- What are you looking at, look again
- Huh? Got it,  practice again? Just wait a little   

87
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,196
Okay, last time, focus all your energy for the last time 

88
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,825
- Open your eyes just a little and a little more
- Hey, just try it

89
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,817
- Why do you look so excited?
- No, it is nothing 

90
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,117
What? Do I have something in my face?

91
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,118
No

92
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,413
It's been a long time since I've seen you looking this comfortable

93
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,247
Me?

94
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,417
- Me?
- Yes, you 

95
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,298
It is because of them?

96
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,007
Excuse me?

97
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,928
Of course not

98
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,808
Hey, if you're bored, go ahead and clean some tables

99
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,771
Gosh...

100
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,733
Do it fast

101
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,121
- Hey, Choco
- Yes?

102
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,374
Shouldn't we tell to Jungwoo now?

103
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,168
Yes

104
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,009
We have tell to him

105
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,682
We should tell him that we have to leave

106
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,270
Let's talk  before it is too late
