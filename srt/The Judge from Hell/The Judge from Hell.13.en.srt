1
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:38,999
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,960
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,045
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:51,970
It's time to go to court.

5
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,221
No. 1935.

6
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,017
Yes.

7
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,470
You can stop playing judge now.

8
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,226
Bael.

9
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,774
For finding the Kylum
and sending Satan back to Hell,

10
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,693
I forgive all your sins.

11
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,864
I have one last mission for you.
Release Jeong Taegyu,

12
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,617
punish him, and send him directly to Hell.

13
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,868
If you refuse,

14
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,955
you will be dragged to Hell...

15
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,961
...and face a terrible death.

16
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,515
Judge...

17
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,477
Something's happened.

18
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:27,482
The Judge from Hell

19
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,484
EPISODE 13

20
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:36,074
Isn't she late?

21
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,627
All rise.

22
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:03,143
There will be...

23
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,318
no trial.

24
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:23,496
Due to unforeseen circumstances that
have arisen regarding today's witness,

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,458
the trial cannot be held properly today.

26
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,378
The first trial shall resume in two days.

27
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,511
DEFENDANT

28
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:58,406
Jeong Seonho was attacked
and taken to the hospital.

29
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,423
He laughed.

30
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,557
- I'm back.
- Hey.

31
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,101
How did the trial go? Cancelled, right?

32
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,936
Yes. How's Jeong Seonho?

33
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,396
He will live.

34
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,941
Jeong Taegyu's home
and company were searched today.

35
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,610
They didn't find the camcorder and tapes
Seonho mentioned.

36
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,366
Maybe Jeong Seonho
hired someone to set all this up.

37
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,370
Because he didn't want to testify
in case his lies might be exposed?

38
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,872
Yes. Don't you think it's possible?

39
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,583
We can't be sure of anything yet.

40
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,378
Go over everything again to ensure
nothing was missed during the search.

41
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,713
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

42
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,382
-Keep checking on Seonho's condition.
-Yes, sir.

43
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,467
YEONSEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

44
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:02,095
VIP 2
PATIENT: JEONG

45
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:06,725
Right.

46
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,270
I'm Lieutenant Han Daon
from Nobong Police.

47
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:13,315
I need to speak with Jeong Seonho
about his court appearance.

48
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,948
Are you doing all right?

49
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,995
He went for a vital point.
I'm sure he was trying to kill me.

50
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,580
Jeong Taegyu did this, right?

51
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,251
Who else would
want to stop me from testifying?

52
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,423
The trial has been postponed for two days.

53
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,342
No, I can't.

54
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:43,094
I won't testify, Detective.

55
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,555
-Mr. Jeong...
-I'm too scared.

56
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,475
Please leave.

57
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,207
Coward.

58
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,376
I never liked the looks of him.

59
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,419
I can understand Jeong Seonho.

60
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:17,879
He's afraid of his brother.

61
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:22,509
By the way, how did you end up
taking Jeong Taegyu's trial?

62
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,597
CIVIL PROCEDURE

63
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,868
Did you come to watch me drink?

64
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,621
About why I'm here,

65
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:53,748
can we talk in private?

66
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,303
How are they treating you?

67
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,306
See for yourself.

68
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,184
Where are the camcorder and tapes of
Seonho's mother being tortured to death?

69
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,561
Oh, that.

70
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:16,688
Damn.

71
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,648
Such masterpieces.

72
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,277
That's not for you to know.

73
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,029
I had to ask.

74
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,365
I want to watch them. They sound fun.

75
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:30,577
Enough with the boring jokes.

76
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,538
Why are you really here?

77
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,083
Let's make a trade.

78
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,378
I'll have you released.

79
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,588
In exchange for what?

80
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,095
Kill for me and bring me
the victims' body parts.

81
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:50,972
Why?

82
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,934
I want to live forever in human form.

83
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,061
The Kylum...

84
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,813
I took it from Jeong Jaegeol.

85
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,943
You're pathetic just like him.

86
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,154
Killing isn't so hard.
Why ask someone else to do it?

87
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:09,074
I can't have the police on me.

88
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:12,327
The killings need to appear
as if committed by a human.

89
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,247
And while the police
chase after someone else,

90
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,499
I will become immortal.

91
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,671
I'm sure he made you kill for him
for the same reason.

92
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,431
Thanks, but no.

93
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,683
You know,

94
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,269
I don't like you.

95
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,853
Right.

96
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,524
We were never on great terms.

97
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,194
That's a shame. I was being generous.

98
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:48,822
But it's all right.

99
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:53,034
Finding killers to do my bidding
is a piece of cake.

100
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:54,703
Be well.

101
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,164
How many do I have to kill?

102
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,674
Will Jeong Taegyu fall for it?

103
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,927
If anyone else tries him,
he'll never be released anyway.

104
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:14,598
It's better for him to cut a deal with me.

105
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:16,141
He has nothing to lose.

106
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:18,810
More importantly,

107
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,772
when I mentioned the tapes,
he referred to them as masterpieces.

108
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:25,692
Maybe it's not just Seonho's mother...

109
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:30,071
The tapes might also contain
the last moments of the other victims.

110
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,907
We must find them before the trial ends.

111
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,575
I'll find them as soon as I can.

112
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,660
What should we do about Jeong Seonho?

113
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,787
Should I beat him up and make him testify?

114
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:39,331
Let's wait for now.

115
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,709
If I got through to him,
I'm sure he'll come.

116
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,047
THE JUDICIARY IS DEAD
THERE IS NO JUSTICE

117
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,924
IF SHE'S A JUDGE,
SO IS MY DOG

118
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:53,595
CORRUPT JUDGES ARE ENEMIES OF OUR COUNTRY

119
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,640
THERE'S NO JUSTICE IN ROTTEN JUDICIARY

120
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,605
Hyeongseok.

121
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,440
I was too scared to come.

122
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,485
Because I might kill him.

123
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,987
I'll be with you.

124
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,711
Case number 2024GoHap615.

125
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,713
The first trial shall begin.

126
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:32,467
Prosecution, please read the charges.

127
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:38,932
"On June 26, 2024,
the defendant, Jeong Taegyu,

128
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:42,852
shot Inspector Kim Soyeong,
who was an active officer,

129
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:46,273
then kidnapped and tortured her
before murdering her."

130
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,857
"He even mutilated her body."

131
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:50,610
Thus, the prosecution
would like to request

132
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:52,612
he be imprisoned for life.

133
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:54,114
Defendant's counsel.

134
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,491
Do you accept the prosecution's case?

135
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:57,993
We do not.

136
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,369
Defendant.

137
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:03,582
Since the statute of limitations
has expired, I will ask you this.

138
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,875
Are you the culprit
of the J serial killings

139
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,545
that took place 25 years ago?

140
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:17,846
Oh, right.

141
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,765
Don't be surprised
if I ask you difficult questions

142
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:23,143
or act like a real judge during the trial.

143
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:28,982
We may know the end of it,
but we need to play our parts.

144
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:35,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

145
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,622
Then do you admit to killing Kim Soyeong?

146
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:49,628
I did

147
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:51,922
not do it.

148
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,887
Your fingerprints were on the ax
with the victim's blood on it.

149
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:02,432
I'm curious

150
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,935
about that, too.

151
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,606
Your Honor, the person who shot the victim

152
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,901
is not the defendant
but his brother, Jeong Seonho.

153
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:17,113
Jeong Seonho illegally purchased
the firearm and ammunition five years ago.

154
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,908
We submit evidence of it.

155
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:23,703
The firearm and ammunition in question
may have been purchased

156
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:27,082
under Jeong Seonho's name,
but the actual owner is the defendant.

157
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,502
That's Jeong Seonho's
one-sided claim.

158
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:33,838
How can we trust a statement
from someone who has spent

159
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,382
half their life on drugs?

160
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:36,841
Your Honor.

161
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,927
That is unrelated to this case.

162
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:42,138
Agreed. Please omit it.

163
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,015
Your Honor.

164
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:48,687
There is a witness
who saw the defendant kill the victim.

165
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:59,030
The witness is currently
injured and cannot move easily.

166
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:01,032
Please wait a little longer.

167
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:05,036
Your Honor, he is still not here,

168
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,747
which shows he is unwilling to testify.

169
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:11,418
Please use your best judgment.

170
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,091
As the witness is not present,
today's trial...

171
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,033
I'm sorry I'm late.

172
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,874
I won't testify, Detective.

173
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,710
-Mr. Jeong...
-I'm sorry.

174
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,755
Please leave.

175
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:05,972
You want to reveal the truth
about your mother's wrongful death.

176
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,516
Do not pass up the opportunity

177
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,019
to speak the truth

178
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:14,064
and save yourself.

179
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,503
COURT IN SESSION

180
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:40,715
Did you just stand by
while the victim was being murdered?

181
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,218
The detective suppressed my brother,

182
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:47,389
but before she could cuff him,
I stabbed her in the shoulder.

183
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:59,150
Then my brother used the ax

184
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:00,902
on her arm...

185
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,489
Even if I die,

186
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,616
my colleagues will catch you.

187
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,619
You'll be put on trial
and punished for your crimes.

188
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:20,338
Why did you stab the victim?

189
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,716
I thought if my brother was arrested,
I'd be too.

190
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,176
Because I was the one
who attacked that woman

191
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,429
in Hwangcheon.

192
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,231
I was afraid
I'd get caught for that.

193
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,985
Why did you attack
a resident of Hwangcheon?

194
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:47,657
My brother told me to.

195
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,202
Because those residents
refused to leave the villa,

196
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,163
he said they all had to be killed.

197
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:00,837
Only then
could the redevelopment go ahead.

198
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:10,013
Is there anything you'd like to say
to the victim and her family?

199
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,267
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:27,405
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,116
I was wrong.

202
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:34,621
Please forgive me. I did
a terrible, unforgivable thing. I'm sorry.

203
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:36,331
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,419
No more questions.

205
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:49,427
Defendant's counsel,
please cross-examine the witness.

206
00:16:56,726 --> 00:17:01,231
You argue that the defendant
is the one who shot the victim.

207
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:03,233
But do you know that your fingerprints

208
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,860
were found on the firearm
used in the crime?

209
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:07,529
Yes, I do.

210
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:11,825
My brother wiped his prints off the gun
and gave it to me.

211
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,410
He told me to keep it.

212
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:14,953
You have a drug conviction, correct?

213
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,331
I do.

214
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:20,166
One of the side effects of drugs

215
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,502
is hallucinations.

216
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,548
- Did you take drugs that day, too?
- Your Honor.

217
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,050
That's unrelated to the case.

218
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,553
Counsel, this is a warning.

219
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:39,352
During the police investigation,

220
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:43,106
you claimed the defendant was
the culprit in the J serial killings.

221
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,317
Do you have proof?

222
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,110
I saw it.

223
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,154
On a rainy day

224
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,072
in Hwangcheon,

225
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,368
my brother killed a boy.

226
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,625
I saw him killing him

227
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:05,795
but couldn't do anything
because I was so scared.

228
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,781
I felt terrible
and returned to that spot.

229
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,826
And I ran into the boy's mother.

230
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:43,166
Do you know my Yechan?

231
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,296
Why are you running away?
Did you kill my son? Did you?

232
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,756
No. I didn't!

233
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,261
- Stop!
- Let go!

234
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:55,512
Let go!

235
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,479
Yechan!

236
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:20,495
My brother is a murderer.

237
00:19:21,204 --> 00:19:23,748
He killed innocent, poor people.

238
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:26,251
And he killed my mother too.

239
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,838
As if it wasn't enough
to lock her up and starve her to death,

240
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:34,009
he filmed my dying mother with a camcorder
and showed it to me.

241
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:36,052
Jeong Taegyu.

242
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,014
That man is a demon.

243
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:43,935
Please, calm down.

244
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:46,062
Then where are
the camcorder and the tapes?

245
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,693
They were in our basement last December,

246
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,530
but my brother moved them.

247
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:57,324
So you're saying

248
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:00,744
that you don't have evidence
to support your claim?

249
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:02,120
I saw it myself!

250
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:03,914
Please just reply "yes" or "no."

251
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,666
Do you have evidence?

252
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,505
- No.
- No more questions.

253
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,805
We will conclude today's trial here.

254
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,935
SEOUL NOBONG POLICE STATION

255
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,562
- Did you find anything?
- No, there's nothing.

256
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:30,440
This is huge.

257
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,734
Taeok Industrial Development building, B5.

258
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,779
What... What is it?
Catch your breath and talk slowly.

259
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,908
Taeok Industrial Development building
basement level 5 wasn't searched.

260
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,370
If you see here on the plan,
there's definitely a basement level five.

261
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,288
Probably an equipment room
before it was closed.

262
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:48,083
It doesn't connect to the elevator,
so we missed it.

263
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:51,044
Freeze! We'll shoot if you move!

264
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,264
Did you find something?

265
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,848
Yes.

266
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:12,065
It's locked.

267
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:14,276
Donghun, let me.

268
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:18,321
RESTRICTED AREA
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY

269
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:24,160
- Get inside.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:26,329
Freeze! We'll shoot if you move!

271
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:55,859
What is this?

272
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,870
What the hell is this?

273
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,247
I think this is
Jeong Taegyu's personal space.

274
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:24,054
JUDGE KANG BITNA

275
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,243
There's more here.

276
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:49,871
YEONJU-DONG
HWANGCHEON-DONG

277
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:56,002
MAY 8, 1999 - YEONJU-DONG

278
00:22:58,338 --> 00:22:59,881
EVIDENCE

279
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:01,258
Please
don't kill us! Please!

280
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:05,512
Please spare the children!

281
00:23:06,054 --> 00:23:07,055
Please!

282
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,809
Please!

283
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:13,603
Please let us go!

284
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:20,986
Please!

285
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,008
The police submitted

286
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:45,051
additional evidence
related to the crime, correct?

287
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:50,265
Yes. They're videos the defendant recorded

288
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:51,892
of his past serial killings.

289
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:55,562
Your Honor.

290
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:59,649
That evidence is unrelated to this case.

291
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:00,859
But, Your Honor,

292
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:04,112
it is evidence that can expose
the defendant's lies.

293
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,197
The evidence in question is not admissible

294
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:09,367
because of procedural defects
that did not ensure the suspect's right

295
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:11,912
to participate in the process
of obtaining the evidence.

296
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,372
Well, obviously I'm aware of that too.

297
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:17,375
Of course, it is not admissible
as evidence.

298
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:20,378
As the defendant's counsel
has stated,

299
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:23,340
this piece of evidence
is not related to this case.

300
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:25,300
However, those tapes clearly

301
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:30,222
contain footage of the defendant killing
the victims of the J serial killings.

302
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:33,058
I've confirmed for myself.

303
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,851
Defendant.

304
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,896
Let me ask you again.

305
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,565
Are you the culprit

306
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:43,443
- in the J serial killings?
- Your Honor!

307
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,111
Counsel.

308
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:02,712
Yes, I killed them all.

309
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,685
There are 15 video tapes
capturing

310
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:19,479
the death of who we assume
to be Jeong Seonho's mother.

311
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:23,775
One video for each of the second
through fifth J serial murder cases

312
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:25,777
capturing the victims' killings.

313
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:30,115
There are a total of 19 tapes
submitted as evidence,

314
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:33,076
and a total of 13 victims killed.

315
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:35,996
The families of the victims
are here today.

316
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:38,248
Anything you want to tell them?

317
00:25:56,725 --> 00:26:00,312
I grew up poor.

318
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:03,398
So I know very well
what it's like to be poor.

319
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:07,527
If you believe you can
lift yourself out of poverty,

320
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:10,488
then you've never been poor before.

321
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:12,490
Being poor

322
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:14,951
means having no hope.

323
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,495
To satisfy the immediate hunger,

324
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:20,707
you give up any possible future
you've ever dreamed of

325
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,628
and throw away your pride
for a few pennies.

326
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:27,130
That's what it means to be poor.

327
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:35,138
When I became rich by someone's goodwill,
I made a decision.

328
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:39,517
I was going to liberate people
without hope or a future

329
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:40,936
like my past self.

330
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:48,818
Yes. That's why I killed them.

331
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:50,987
I only selected the poor.

332
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:55,951
Of course, I will not deny
the fact that I took pleasure

333
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:57,494
in killing them.

334
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,120
-That son of...
-Calm down.

335
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:01,039
At first, it took some getting used to.

336
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:03,083
But it got easier.

337
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,256
When they clung to me,
begging for their lives...

338
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:11,800
At least in that moment,

339
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:14,177
I truly was God.

340
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,933
Looking down on someone from up high,

341
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:23,186
judging their entire life,
and handing down sentences...

342
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,522
It's just so pleasurable.

343
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:29,609
I'm sure you know the feeling.

344
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,622
I don't feel any remorse at all.

345
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:50,547
No, you should be thanking me.

346
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,092
Because I liberated
your precious family members

347
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,261
from wretched poverty!

348
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,933
Pain is only fleeting,

349
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:04,519
but rest is eternal.

350
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:08,273
Thanks to me, your family members

351
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:11,651
escaped poverty and became happy.

352
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:16,615
It's incomparable to the miserable life
they had with you!

353
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:19,326
You asshole!

354
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:22,203
I'm going to rip you to shreds!

355
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,666
You bastard! I'm going to kill you myself!

356
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,126
Asshole!

357
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:33,298
Just you wait, asshole!

358
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:42,182
We will take a short break.

359
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:56,154
Were you the first to discover and report
the inspector's disappearance?

360
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:57,447
Yes.

361
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,700
Can you describe
the situation at the time?

362
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,370
When I got there,

363
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:06,456
there was blood all over the ground.

364
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:17,175
I am

365
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,428
a family member
of the victims of the J serial killings

366
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,597
and the only survivor.

367
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:29,229
Your Honor.

368
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,856
I know this trial is
unrelated to that case.

369
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,608
But if not here in this trial,

370
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,820
I will have no opportunity
to share my story.

371
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:38,989
Please...

372
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:41,408
give me some time.

373
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:44,703
The witness is speaking about
something unrelated to this case.

374
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,705
- I know.
- Your Honor.

375
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,040
Counsel.

376
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,002
Don't you know what kind of judge I am?

377
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,797
If you talk back one more time,
you're out.

378
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:00,510
Witness.

379
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:02,762
Please continue.

380
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:06,558
That day, 25 years ago,

381
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:12,522
I was with the person
who murdered my family.

382
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:22,282
Hey, kid.

383
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,035
If you don't open the door,

384
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:28,288
your mom, dad, and brother

385
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,291
will all die.

386
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:35,629
Will you let them die because of you?

387
00:30:35,712 --> 00:30:39,549
Daon. Don't open the door.

388
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,593
Don't...

389
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,303
Stay there.

390
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:47,057
Don't come out.

391
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:52,938
I wanted

392
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,899
to become an officer to catch him myself

393
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:58,944
and make sure he's punished.

394
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:03,657
Let me repeat myself.
This is unrelated to this case!

395
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,116
Escort him out.

396
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:09,329
Your Honor,
why am I being thrown out?

397
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,665
I have the right
to defend my client!

398
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:14,834
What kind of trial is this, Your Honor?
Your Honor!

399
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,881
Your Honor!

400
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,219
Is there anything more you'd like to say?

401
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,931
Your Honor. Please show in this court

402
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:31,434
that the world
may have forgotten about us,

403
00:31:31,518 --> 00:31:33,562
but the law has not abandoned us.

404
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,735
It's only right
that a criminal must be punished.

405
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:45,365
Let that be a reality, not a miracle.

406
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:47,993
So we can break free from the past

407
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:50,203
and live for tomorrow,

408
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,330
I beg of you to please

409
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:56,835
save us
from this bottomless pit of suffering.

410
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:14,477
You scared me.

411
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:15,979
Aren't you hungry?

412
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,568
Who said you could do that?

413
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,695
Friends share like this.

414
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:27,324
Why are we friends? Have you gone senile?

415
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:30,535
Stop talking and just eat the damn burger.

416
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:33,038
You haven't eaten all day
because of the trial.

417
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:40,629
Damn it.

418
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:42,505
Why is this so hard to open?

419
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:44,507
Just eat without the damn ketchup.

420
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:51,097
What are you looking at?
You open it, then.

421
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:52,182
Here.

422
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:59,189
Bael came to see me today
before the trial.

423
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:00,857
And?

424
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,652
Are you scared you might die?

425
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:07,530
Did you tell Han Daon?

426
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:10,742
What am I supposed to tell him?

427
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,536
That I have to release Jeong Taegyu
if I want to live?

428
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:16,248
And if I don't, I'll die a horrible death?

429
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:20,460
I can't burden him with that.

430
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:25,340
As a friend,
can I offer some friendly advice?

431
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,592
Let him go.

432
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:32,889
Don't make things messier than they are.
Just do as you've done.

433
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,432
Do you mean that?

434
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,851
You said you'll die
if you don't let him go.

435
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:37,978
What can you do?

436
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:40,981
Then what about Han Daon?

437
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:45,151
And everyone else
who wanted him to be punished by law?

438
00:33:46,194 --> 00:33:48,280
They've suffered all their lives.

439
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:51,408
But I'm supposed to
make it worse for them?

440
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:56,079
I already told you what I think.

441
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:57,372
It's up to you.

442
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,459
Are you serious?

443
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:02,877
Have you gone mad?

444
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:05,922
Sit down. You're blocking the light.

445
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:10,302
If you don't release Jeong Taegyu,
you'll die.

446
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:13,054
Just wrap up the trial
and let that bastard go.

447
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,515
I can't do that. I'm a judge.

448
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,559
You're a demon first.

449
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,437
The moment you lock Jeong Taegyu up,

450
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:23,732
you'll no longer be a demon.
You won't survive.

451
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,109
But if you release
Jeong Taegyu and kill him,

452
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:29,529
you will go back to Hell
and be reinstated as a judge in Hell.

453
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:30,947
There are many sinners

454
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:33,950
waiting for you to hand out
your sentences there, too.

455
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,911
Justitia. Detective Han

456
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:39,831
suffered his whole life with the guilt
that his family died because of him.

457
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:42,500
If he finds out
that you died because of him,

458
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,628
he won't be able to carry on.

459
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:45,921
He's right.

460
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:48,632
I read in a book that love is doing

461
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:51,718
what makes the other person happy
and not what you want.

462
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:52,969
You didn't read a book!

463
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:54,095
Shut up, you ass.

464
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,263
Either way, Justitia--

465
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:57,515
Don't say anything to Han Daon.

466
00:34:58,141 --> 00:34:59,851
I've warned you.

467
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,813
Justitia.

468
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:07,692
Don't let her go! Justitia!

469
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,110
Justitia...

470
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:17,869
Fire gazing?

471
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:21,706
Judge Kang.

472
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,626
Have a seat.

473
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:37,055
If I give Jeong Taegyu a light sentence,

474
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:38,682
will you hate me?

475
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:46,940
You worked so hard to arrest him.
So if I let him go,

476
00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:49,067
I think you'd resent me.

477
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:53,947
When I didn't kill Jeong Taegyu
myself and arrested him,

478
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:56,616
my role in the matter was over.

479
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,245
It's up to the judge
to make a decision according to the law.

480
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:02,539
I trust you.

481
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:04,291
Promise me.

482
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:07,419
That no matter how
I sentence Jeong Taegyu,

483
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:09,963
you will not hate or resent me.

484
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,677
But that if you end up hating me anyway,

485
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,554
you'll forget me.

486
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:22,267
I will not hate

487
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:24,144
or forget you.

488
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:28,899
The statute of limitations
on the J serial killings expired.

489
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:33,069
So I know it'll be difficult to give him
a death sentence anyway.

490
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:36,698
So don't worry about me,
and do what you have to.

491
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:38,074
I'm really okay.

492
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:46,499
You have to keep the promise
that you'll be okay.

493
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:52,672
What?
Should we pinkie promise, then?

494
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:02,849
While Judge Kang
has caused a stir

495
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,684
for allegedly verbally abusing

496
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:07,520
the defendant's legal counsel
during the last hearing,

497
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:10,607
the sentencing hearing
for CEO Jeong Taegyu

498
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,609
of Taeok Industrial Development

499
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:15,737
for murdering an active police officer
will soon commence.

500
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:20,825
I didn't know
we were in the same boat.

501
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,914
You've grown into an amazing person.

502
00:37:27,082 --> 00:37:28,917
We should go inside now.

503
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,002
Right.

504
00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:37,133
Your daughter is probably
too pregnant to come.

505
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:39,135
I'm sure she'll call you
after the hearing.

506
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,554
Okay.

507
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,725
Mother!

508
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:50,814
We're not late, are we?

509
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:53,608
Oh, my. I know you're busy. Why did you...

510
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:58,154
After the hearing,

511
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:00,657
can you make japchae for me at home?

512
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,118
I've craved and missed it a lot.

513
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:04,744
Your japchae.

514
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:05,829
Goodness.

515
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:15,213
Let's go.

516
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,017
JUDGE'S OATH

517
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:23,657
All rise.

518
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:46,096
Please be seated.

519
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:56,064
Defendant, before the sentencing,

520
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,608
do you have any last words?

521
00:40:07,158 --> 00:40:08,577
I trust

522
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:13,707
that you will make a wise decision,
Your Honor.

523
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:33,310
The court will pronounce the verdict
on case number 2024GoHap615.

524
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:36,605
The defendant, Jeong Taegyu,

525
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:40,108
shot and killed Inspector Kim Soyeong,

526
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:42,485
and brutally mutilated her body.

527
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,112
The testimony of Jeong Seonho,

528
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:46,907
who was present at the time of the murder,
is consistent,

529
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,493
and the defendant's fingerprints
were found on the murder weapon.

530
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:53,413
Considering these facts,

531
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:57,500
it is indisputable
that the defendant committed the crime.

532
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:01,171
Furthermore, blood of
the victims of the J serial killings

533
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:05,258
committed 25 years ago was found
on the weapon used to kill Kim Soyeong.

534
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:09,721
Video footage was also found
of the defendant killing the victims.

535
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:11,681
However, for these crimes,

536
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:15,518
the statute of limitations expired in 2014
without charges being filed.

537
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:19,981
Thus, in this sentencing,
those crimes are not considered.

538
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:23,860
The sentencing must be based on
the case involving Kim Soyeong alone.

539
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:25,987
However,

540
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:31,034
the victims' families filed a petition
calling for severe punishment

541
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:33,703
for the defendant.

542
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,290
The victims' families know very well

543
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:40,835
that sentencing the defendant to death
will not bring back

544
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,296
their loved ones.

545
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:46,508
They do not want to be compensated
for time lost

546
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:48,927
by sentencing the defendant to death.

547
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:51,555
They only wish to heal their wounds.

548
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:54,975
They just want to be assured that the law

549
00:41:55,058 --> 00:41:56,726
has not abandoned them.

550
00:41:57,894 --> 00:42:00,105
In the end,
what they truly want

551
00:42:00,689 --> 00:42:03,650
is to mourn the victims
who lost their lives wrongfully

552
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,654
and to be consoled for the terrible years
they have endured since.

553
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,031
Thus, this court

554
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:14,536
shall base the sentence
on the single most important criterion.

555
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,747
The law shall not forgive
the crimes that the victims

556
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,250
and their families do not forgive.

557
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:24,254
Taking all these circumstances
into consideration,

558
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:27,215
the court sentences
the defendant as follows.

559
00:42:28,717 --> 00:42:32,721
I... hereby sentence
the defendant Jeong Taegyu

560
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,141
to death.

561
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:49,070
Thank you, Your Honor!

562
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,742
Thank you!

563
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:23,813
Thank you, Judge.

564
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:25,523
Thank you!

565
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:49,714
Thank God.

566
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:51,299
Finally.

567
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:56,763
Finally...

568
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,905
THE HEAVENS MAY FALL
BUT THERE WILL BE JUSTICE ON EARTH

569
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,157
COURT

570
00:44:16,241 --> 00:44:17,534
Here she comes!

571
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:20,412
- Please look here!
- A comment, please!

572
00:44:20,495 --> 00:44:22,330
- Here!
- A comment, please!

573
00:44:22,414 --> 00:44:26,668
Did the serial killings
from 25 years ago influence this ruling?

574
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,295
Article 50 of the Criminal Act.

575
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:31,423
"A person who kills another
shall be punished by death

576
00:44:31,506 --> 00:44:33,341
or sentenced to five years to life."

577
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:35,719
I have always ruled according to the law.

578
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:37,304
As I have in this case.

579
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:42,559
Just a moment!

580
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:52,694
Did you wait long?

581
00:44:54,446 --> 00:44:56,239
The reporters were hounding me.

582
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:00,410
Thank you.

583
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:12,047
Can you come with me somewhere?

584
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:20,889
Dad, Mom.

585
00:45:20,972 --> 00:45:23,308
Jion, Soyeong.

586
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:25,602
It's all over now.

587
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:29,773
So forget about everything there

588
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,942
and rest in peace.

589
00:45:33,652 --> 00:45:35,695
But I will never forget.

590
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,281
Because when we meet again,

591
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,286
I need to recognize you.

592
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:48,291
Until then,

593
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,127
I will be well here.

594
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:56,883
You don't need to worry about me.

595
00:46:01,263 --> 00:46:02,764
The defendant, Jeong Seonho,

596
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,141
attempted to assault victim Yoo Jeongim

597
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:06,893
and confined and assaulted

598
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:09,854
victim Kang Bitna before fleeing.

599
00:46:09,938 --> 00:46:14,401
Furthermore, he brandished a weapon
at victim Kim Soyeong.

600
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:17,028
These offenses
should not be considered light.

601
00:46:17,696 --> 00:46:20,699
Thus, this court shall rule as follows.

602
00:46:20,782 --> 00:46:21,950
I hereby

603
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:26,830
sentence the defendant, Jeong Seonho,
to 15 years' imprisonment.

604
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:31,501
The court also grants the prosecution's
request for supervised treatment

605
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:34,212
and orders the defendant
to complete 80 hours

606
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:36,673
of drug rehabilitation
and treatment under custody.

607
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:49,185
What are you doing? Get in.

608
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,150
You bastard!

609
00:46:56,568 --> 00:46:57,611
Stop, bastard!

610
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:01,865
Please help me.
The safe in my room...

611
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:06,369
PRISON BUS

612
00:47:15,754 --> 00:47:19,299
Contrary to expectations, Jeong Taegyu
has received a death sentence.

613
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:23,094
The legal community and the public
are reacting very differently.

614
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:24,221
Reporter Kim Horang.

615
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:27,682
For handing down the death sentence
to Jeong Taegyu

616
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:30,977
for murdering Inspector Kim Soyeong
and mutilating her body,

617
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:34,105
the legal community
is harshly criticizing Judge Kang.

618
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:35,440
The defendant was

619
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:39,444
practically punished for crimes
beyond the statute of limitations.

620
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:42,822
You could say it was
devoid of any common sense,

621
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:44,449
a very uneducated ruling,

622
00:47:44,532 --> 00:47:48,745
fueled by the public's anger
and lack of legal understanding...

623
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:51,790
Citizens, on the other hand,
are welcoming the ruling.

624
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:53,458
It was such a relief.

625
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:56,169
I hope there are
more rulings like this going forward.

626
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:58,338
Judge Kang is awesome. So cool.

627
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,506
Well,

628
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:02,300
I think the judges should look back
and ask themselves

629
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:04,344
why people are going wild
over this ruling.

630
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,947
- Yes, this is Na Yeongjin...
-  Hey, Chief Judge.

631
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,574
A death sentence?

632
00:48:25,657 --> 00:48:29,077
We clearly told you
to rule in favor of Jeong Taegyu.

633
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,246
I'm a sitting assembly member--

634
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:32,414
Damn you!

635
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:34,624
I can't take this filth anymore.

636
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,459
Have you forgotten who I am?

637
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,421
I'm an assemblyman!

638
00:48:39,504 --> 00:48:41,923
You may be an assemblyman,
but I'm a judge!

639
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:44,092
Goodbye! You take enough of our taxes!

640
00:48:44,843 --> 00:48:47,846
Who does he think he is?
He can't mess with me!

641
00:48:52,392 --> 00:48:55,186
I'm a judge!

642
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,646
Hello, Judge Bitna.

643
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,731
-You're the best!
-Best!

644
00:48:57,814 --> 00:48:58,940
It felt so good.

645
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:01,026
- So satisfying.
- You're so cool.

646
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:05,822
Judge Kang, you're a star now.

647
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:09,075
I know, right?
I might be asked to do a commercial.

648
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,952
I don't think that will happen.

649
00:49:11,036 --> 00:49:13,663
The chief just dropped a bomb.

650
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:15,457
What bomb?

651
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:22,505
He exposed how Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol
and other assembly members

652
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,090
asked him to influence trials.

653
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:26,343
You know, whistleblowing.

654
00:49:27,385 --> 00:49:28,428
Wow.

655
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:31,097
TO SEE MORNING SUN
IN THE EVENING

656
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:32,265
Why did you do it?

657
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:38,271
Watching your trial this time,
I remembered

658
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:39,981
that I was a judge, too.

659
00:49:40,565 --> 00:49:43,652
And I felt ashamed
of the things I've done.

660
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:48,240
You know, that kind of introspection
doesn't suit your face.

661
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:49,699
Why you...

662
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:53,828
When I became a judge,

663
00:49:54,537 --> 00:49:58,083
my mother and father were so proud of me.

664
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:01,086
I've forgotten about that for too long.

665
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:02,504
Wow.

666
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:05,382
That's something
no one's interested to know.

667
00:50:05,465 --> 00:50:06,591
Right.

668
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:09,302
I should have kept it to myself.

669
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,346
But I forgot about it, too.

670
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:14,766
Anyway, I feel bad
I've put you in a difficult position.

671
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,184
It's karma, I guess.

672
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:18,603
But the public
is happy with you,

673
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:20,730
so they won't get rid of you so easily.

674
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:23,900
You should lie low for a few years
by the coast and come back.

675
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,570
And what are you going to do from now on?

676
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:27,654
Me?

677
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:30,282
I'll become a YouTuber.

678
00:50:30,865 --> 00:50:34,035
"Legal common sense from a former judge."

679
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,329
"Bang, bang!" What do you think?

680
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,375
SEOUL JUNGBU DETENTION CENTER

681
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:57,642
My Yechan.

682
00:50:59,477 --> 00:51:00,562
Why did you kill him?

683
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:07,277
He was an innocent kid.

684
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,364
Why did you have to kill him so brutally?

685
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:14,910
I already said all that in court.

686
00:51:16,995 --> 00:51:18,538
I'm curious about something, too.

687
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:23,209
Why did you have kids when you were poor?

688
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:25,337
And you had two.

689
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,340
Think about it. A wealthy family...

690
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:30,508
No.

691
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:33,303
Even an average family would have

692
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:36,848
provided a better home
than that dumpy neighborhood.

693
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:40,352
Then he wouldn't have had to walk
through those alleys going to school

694
00:51:40,435 --> 00:51:42,187
and he never would've met me.

695
00:51:44,898 --> 00:51:46,900
Your son died

696
00:51:46,983 --> 00:51:49,444
because of you.

697
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:54,074
Apologize to my son.

698
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:58,078
You don't seem to get it.

699
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:00,455
It didn't take long.

700
00:52:00,538 --> 00:52:04,125
He was a minor, so I made sure

701
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:06,002
to make it quick.

702
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:10,382
It only took five stabs.

703
00:52:14,386 --> 00:52:15,387
Oh, right.

704
00:52:16,304 --> 00:52:17,347
At the end,

705
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:19,891
the kid said...

706
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:25,438
"Mister,

707
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:28,108
please don't kill me."

708
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,859
"If I die,

709
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:34,197
my mom will be really sad."

710
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:37,409
And I told him,

711
00:52:38,326 --> 00:52:39,369
"No."

712
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:41,580
"Your mom will be happy

713
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:46,293
because there will be
one less mouth to feed."

714
00:52:47,752 --> 00:52:49,671
And then...

715
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:52,048
I...

716
00:52:52,841 --> 00:52:55,969
I will never forgive you.

717
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,889
I've already been forgiven.

718
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:02,684
You know that.

719
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:05,812
Are you...

720
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:08,481
Are you even human?

721
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,026
Damn it.

722
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:15,864
You should thank me for saving your son.

723
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:17,282
Just as I thought,

724
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:20,827
you poor people are shameless.

725
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:23,747
Die. You die, too!

726
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,833
That's too bad.
I think I'll live a long time.

727
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,294
I'm not being executed.

728
00:53:30,462 --> 00:53:33,548
And they're feeding me well.

729
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:35,342
It's very nutritious.

730
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:36,718
Hey!

731
00:53:36,801 --> 00:53:37,802
Hey!

732
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:41,056
Get over here!

733
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:44,893
Come out of there!

734
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:10,543
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT OF HWANGCHEON-DONG!
FROM ALL HWANGCHEON VILLA RESIDENTS

735
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:11,628
HWANGCHEON VILLA

736
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,608
Read this first.

737
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,111
It's from Jeong Seonho.

738
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,737
Jeong Seonho?

739
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:54,379
March 1999.

740
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:57,173
I still remember that day vividly.

741
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:01,845
Because I was so scared.

742
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:04,681
I was scared,

743
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:09,311
but I was curious to see
what he might have left behind.

744
00:55:11,271 --> 00:55:14,441
When I learned what it was,
I couldn't throw it away.

745
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,694
It reminded me of my mother.

746
00:55:22,616 --> 00:55:25,493
I'm sorry it took me so long
to deliver his letter to you.

747
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:27,704
Sincerely, Jeong Seonho.

748
00:55:43,386 --> 00:55:48,975
TO MOM

749
00:55:55,982 --> 00:55:57,275
Yechan, I'm leaving!

750
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,028
Can you wake Jueun up?
She can't be late on the first day.

751
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:03,365
Get some bread with Jueun
on the way to school.

752
00:56:03,448 --> 00:56:06,576
There's food in the fridge.
Make sure your sister eats dinner.

753
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,911
Okay.

754
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:09,412
- Mom.
- Yeah?

755
00:56:09,996 --> 00:56:11,665
Let's talk later tonight.

756
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,221
Mom. They say
this will make your hands softer.

757
00:56:26,304 --> 00:56:28,056
I'm going to grow up fast

758
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:31,601
and be a good son
so you don't have to work so hard anymore.

759
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:33,770
I will take care of Jueun, too.

760
00:56:34,437 --> 00:56:36,773
I love you, Mom. From Yechan.

761
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,930
- Hey, get him down!
- Hurry!

762
00:57:09,014 --> 00:57:10,056
Medic!

763
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,433
God damn it.

764
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,351
Medic!

765
00:57:13,435 --> 00:57:14,436
THE HOLY BIBLE

766
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,247
SPECIAL LEAVE

767
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:44,883
Excuse me.

768
00:57:49,554 --> 00:57:52,474
I heard my brother is dead.

769
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:53,558
And?

770
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:55,227
I'd like to apply for a leave.

771
00:57:55,894 --> 00:57:57,062
A special leave.

772
00:57:57,771 --> 00:57:58,980
Special leave?

773
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:05,070
You really won't regret this?

774
00:58:06,238 --> 00:58:08,281
I wouldn't have started if I was going to.

775
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:14,663
You're coming
to the farewell party tonight, right?

776
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:19,668
The landlady thinks
you're just being transferred.

777
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,752
Hey.

778
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:23,088
Leave if you're
just going to sit and sigh.

779
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:26,299
It's distracting me.

780
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:28,593
You're being mean until the end.

781
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:34,933
See you later at the villa, okay?

782
00:58:49,614 --> 00:58:53,118
Warrior of Hell,
follow Bael's command

783
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:55,704
and atone through death.

784
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:03,712
Give me some time.

785
00:59:04,963 --> 00:59:06,381
I have one thing left to do.

786
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,925
I may soon perish,

787
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:12,262
but my underlings will repay you someday.

788
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:32,324
JUDGE KANG BITNA

789
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:34,743
Can we meet now?

790
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:51,134
What brings you here?

791
00:59:52,052 --> 00:59:53,762
I just wanted to see you.

792
00:59:56,431 --> 00:59:59,267
When I killed you at the campsite,

793
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:02,812
I thought our meeting would be fleeting.

794
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:05,857
But you came back to life
and started following me around.

795
01:00:07,776 --> 01:00:10,028
Then I grew
more and more curious about you.

796
01:00:11,279 --> 01:00:13,740
And eventually,
I began to want to protect you.

797
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:17,118
I wanted to kill everyone
who made you cry.

798
01:00:17,202 --> 01:00:21,164
And I wanted to make you happy
so you didn't have to cry anymore.

799
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:25,543
Let me apologize first.

800
01:00:25,627 --> 01:00:26,836
That promise...

801
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:29,548
I can't keep it.

802
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:32,676
Why not?

803
01:00:34,386 --> 01:00:35,929
I have to go far away.

804
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:39,057
Because you're being transferred
to the coast?

805
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,434
It's okay, I'll come visit you often.

806
01:00:49,234 --> 01:00:50,902
You're the only blemish on my life,

807
01:00:51,945 --> 01:00:53,321
my only weakness.

808
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:57,075
I loved you a lot, Han Daon.

809
01:00:57,742 --> 01:00:58,827
I love you, too.

810
01:00:59,828 --> 01:01:00,954

-Here you go. Sure.
-Thanks.

826
01:02:38,218 --> 01:02:39,844
Why is it so quiet?

827
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,764
Should we check?

828
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:47,936
What the...

829
01:02:49,145 --> 01:02:50,272
He's gone!

01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:40,405
Goodbye, Han Daon.

835
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:46,620
Sir, I'm going to step out for a bit.

836
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:47,704
Sure.

837
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:50,040
Han Daon!

838
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:54,794
She said not to tell him!

839
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:56,463
-Please, wait.
-Move, damn it!

840
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:57,923
What's going on?

841
01:03:58,006 --> 01:03:59,132
Hey, Han Daon.

842
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:00,258
Go and stop her.

time of death, September 21, 2024,

The fake passport and money.

869
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:21,937
Good job.

870
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,023
- Passport has to be made again.
- Jeong Taegyu's missing?

871
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,193
Bitna...

872
01:08:32,405 --> 01:08:34,407
Damn it!

873
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:38,119
We'll get him again soon.
