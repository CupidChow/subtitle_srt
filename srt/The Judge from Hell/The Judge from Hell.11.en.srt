1
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,994
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,913
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,999
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,073
Han Daon.

5
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,242
Han Daon!

6
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,455
Gosh, that hurts.

7
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,253
I told you not to come down!

8
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,562
From now on,

9
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,690
rely on and trust only me.

10
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,526
I will protect you.

11
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,876
Let's go.

12
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,343
EPISODE 11

13
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,385
No!

14
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,329
Go to Hell.

15
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,581
geenna

16
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,627
Don't look so surprised.

17
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,128
I'm great at killing...

18
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm sorry for going behind your back.

19
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,411
But I did it for you--

20
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,668
I'm Venato.

21
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,087
And hunting traitors down...

22
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,673
is my job.

23
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,300
I understand you're Venato.

24
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,802
And I get why you lied to me.

25
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,430
Thanks for protecting me
although I'm a traitor.

26
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,932
But you put Han Daon in danger.

27
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,726
I can't forgive that.

28
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,150
Han Daon is nothing.

29
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:19,279
I never want to see you again.

30
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,324
And don't you dare
go anywhere near Han Daon.

31
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,288
Justitia.

32
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,373
You...

33
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,544
You will eventually die
because of Han Daon.

34
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:47,933
Just a moment.

35
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:51,937
SERGEANT CLEANING

36
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,607
And the back.

37
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:02,697
It's all done.

38
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,079
The coffin's been stamped and sealed.

39
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,705
Yes.

40
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:14,334
Bael is the only one
who can release him into the world.

41
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:18,088
Why are you helping me?
You could end up in trouble.

42
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,923
We think we understand

43
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,551
why you did this.

44
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,720
Thanks.

45
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,058
What did she say?

46
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,352
She just thanked us.

47
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:34,854
She's human now.

48
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:51,139
You have fallen in love with a human.

49
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:55,560
As if breaking the rules wasn't enough,
you even killed Paimon

50
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,021
to save that human.

51
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,397
What do you have to say?

52
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,109
Nothing.

53
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:05,028
Just kill me.

54
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,947
It will be lonely going alone.

55
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:10,533
I better kill the man you love, too.

56
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,038
You'll have to risk your life first, Bael.

57
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:19,626
You've become quite foolish.

58
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,790
From now on, Demon Justitia

59
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,250
shall lose all her powers.

60
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:07,841
Justitia will remain on Earth
as a mere mortal

61
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,259
and atone.

62
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:13,054
Soon, a heavy punishment
will fall upon you.

63
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:23,690
The Judge from Hell

64
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,028
You met
with Detective Jang Munjae

65
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,529
at the construction site that night,

66
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:32,198
but you soon parted ways
and don't know where he went.

67
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:34,284
Is that correct?

68
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:35,869
Yes.

69
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,371
What did you two talk about?

70
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:41,166
He told me he was struggling
to adjust to his new posting.

71
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,543
You talked about that
at that hour?

72
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,087
In the middle of nowhere with no cameras?

73
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:49,633
I only went to the address
Detective Jang gave me.

74
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,385
It seems you want
to accuse me of killing him.

75
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:54,638
But you should stop.

76
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,097
I'm a busy man.

77
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,559
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT OF HWANGCHEON-DONG!

78
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:00,644
HWANGCHEON VILLA

79
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,563
- How did the questioning go?
- There's no need to worry.

80
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,066
I realized I'm a decent liar.

81
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,610
I guess I rubbed off on you.

82
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,655
They say you become
like the person you like.

83
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,954
I told you J is likely Satan, right?

84
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,623
Yes. Did you find who he is?

85
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:24,292
Jeong Seonho, I think.

86
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,044
Jeong Seonho is J?

87
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:29,214
He's the one who killed Soyeong?

88
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:32,842
What are you going to do? Kill him?

89
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,136
Do you expect me to let him live?

90
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,515
He's a demon.
Do you want to die before you get revenge?

91
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,942
I am suspicious of Seonho,

92
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,610
but I'm not certain he's J.

93
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:51,903
I'll find out.

94
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:54,656
You'll only raise suspicion. I'll do it.

95
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:57,325
-But you...
-What about me?

96
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,411
No, nothing.

97
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,913
I have a way.

98
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,498
If it's dangerous, don't do it.

99
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,458
You almost died because of me.

100
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,378
I won't die and leave you. I promise.

101
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:13,800
You're not done yet.

102
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:15,260
I am. There.

103
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:18,013
That's not enough...

104
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,181
Why did he...

105
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,768
Do you know how to peel apples?

106
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,228
I'll do it.

107
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,193
You're peeling it too thick.

108
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:40,744
Just a second.

109
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:41,995
Get over here now.

110
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,998
I think you need a beating, don't you?

111
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,669
DETECTIVE HAN DAON

112
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,975
How was the questioning?

113
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:05,936
It was fine.

114
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,980
I'm sorry for making you worry.

115
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,610
I don't know
why bad things keep happening to our team.

116
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:16,821
Look at your face.
How can you call yourself an officer?

117
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:19,241
How ridiculous. Damn it.

118
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,534
We'll head out.

119
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,828
- Let's go.
- Okay.

120
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:27,207
We'll be back.

121
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:33,797
You don't usually eat with us, sir.
It's an honor.

122
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,591
I try to have a meal

123
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,718
with every employee at our court.

124
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,971
It's my motto.

125
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:42,639
It's so good.

126
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:45,141
Never mind. Go on.

127
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,434
We love the menu these days.

128
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:49,271
Chief, might you be running for...

129
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:51,439
Gosh. Just enjoy your lunch.

130
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:58,113
Have you heard from Judge Kang?

131
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:01,825
No. I think she's planning

132
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,078
- to open her own practice.
- What?

133
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,913
Or she's just being her strange self...

134
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,792
Goodness, was that too honest?

135
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:15,130
I can't have her causing trouble
before she gets back.

136
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:22,512
By the way,
why are you two always together?

137
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,598
Are you dating?

138
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,641
No!

139
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:34,399
Why do you think Judge Kang
wants to come all the way here?

140
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:37,193
Does it make you uncomfortable or anxious?

141
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:38,778
You know how I feel.

142
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:39,946
Right.

143
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:42,449
I understand how you might feel.

144
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,204
A guest has arrived.

145
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,081
Okay. Let her in.

146
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,010
Could you please take these?

147
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:03,762
It's premium beef and fruit.

148
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:06,014
I bought them at the department store.

149
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,140
I see.

150
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:08,725
You really didn't have to.

151
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,645
By the way, what are you wearing?

152
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:14,356
-First, please let me bow to you.
-What?

153
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:27,160
Judge Kang? What are you doing?

154
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,537
Father.

155
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,706
Please let me marry your son.

156
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:47,180
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm suddenly asking to marry your son.

157
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,976
I haven't thought about it much so far,

158
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,769
but I realize now.

159
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,688
What it is I have to do.

160
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,649
Is that marrying my son?

161
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:01,361
To be exact, it's attaining success
and wealth through the marriage.

162
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:03,613
I want to go into politics.

163
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:06,199
I'm a great liar, shameless,

164
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:07,867
selfish, hypocritical,

165
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,245
and I like money.

166
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:13,790
I think I have what it takes
to be a great politician.

167
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:16,376
You decided to break off
our engagement on your own.

168
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,461
Why are you doing this now?

169
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,922
I'm not interested in you.

170
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:24,843
He's...

171
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,803
the one I want to marry.

172
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,982
Then...

173
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,110
you two should get to know each other.

174
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:45,822
Father.

175
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:52,579
Gosh, how scary.

176
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:06,635
- I need to use the ladies' room.
- Of course.

177
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,176
-How long have you been there?
-Since just now.

178
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,516
What did you see?

179
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,101
What should I have seen?

180
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,521
You really better stop now.

181
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,481
There's only so much I can stand.

182
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,568
Can you get your ugly face out of mine?

183
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,737
We're not even married yet.
Let's keep a safe distance.

184
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,221
What about our agreement?

185
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,640
Don't you know how to knock?

186
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,311
Who cares about that now?

187
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:42,856
I haven't forgotten about it.

188
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,524
How could I?

189
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:47,068
Then why did you let
Kang Bitna back in here?

190
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,862
I think she may be useful.

191
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:50,614
No, not to me.

192
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:53,658
So you should've
gotten the redevelopment done already.

193
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:54,910
That's the reason?

194
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,703
Jeong Taegyu.

195
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,248
Do you want to go back to how things were?

196
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,839
If you keep acting as you like,

197
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,467
you'll find yourself in trouble,

198
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,177
Father.

199
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:24,189
IAN DAILY
REPORTER JO ARAN

200
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,278
JUDGE KANG WAS BEHIND
JEONG'S LIGHT SENTENCE

201
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:31,947
Reading your article,

202
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,658
we assumed you must know Judge Kang well.

203
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:37,118
I don't know her well.

204
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,371
I'm following her
as her rulings are absurd.

205
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,206
Did you ever come across

206
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,167
anything unusual about Judge Kang Bitna?

207
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:47,712
Do you know
that a few days after she was attacked,

208
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:50,298
an article about her broken engagement

209
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:51,800
-was published?
-Yes.

210
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:54,636
Isn't it strange
the two happened so close together?

211
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,596
And an incumbent judge was stabbed,

212
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,224
but the culprit still hasn't been caught.

213
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,061
Then do you think the attack on Kang Bitna

214
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:05,605
is related to Jeong Jaegeol's family?

215
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:06,731
Yes.

216
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:09,109
Then why haven't you written about it?

217
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,318
I did.

218
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,529
But it was removed right away.

219
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:15,156
I asked my company why
but got no straight answer.

220
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:16,783
Oh, right.

221
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,660
When Judge Kang was attacked,

222
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,204
I heard she was taken
to Yeonseon University Hospital.

223
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,292
The reporter was right.

224
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,752
Someone exerted their influence.

225
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:29,212
Let's talk in the car.

226
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,297
Okay.

227
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:37,637
Kang Bitna left Jeong Taegyu's home
at 8 p.m. on December 19, 2023.

228
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:42,601
And she was taken to the hospital
the next night, on the 20th at 9 p.m.

229
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:45,812
Right before the incident,
Kang Bitna sent a text to Jeong Taegyu.

230
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:48,315
And since then,
the two haven't contacted each other.

231
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:51,693
They must have broken up
at Jeong's house the night before.

232
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,820
She could've asked to break up via text.

233
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:55,447
Either way, the conclusion is,

234
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,074
Kang Bitna was stabbed
after the breakup was mentioned.

235
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,745
Kang Bitna asked
to break off the engagement,

236
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,955
and Jeong Taegyu got angry
and stabbed her?

237
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:08,251
Let's first check Jeong Taegyu's alibi
for that night.

238
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,754
Right. There's a junkie
in that family, right?

239
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:12,589
-Check his alibi, too.
-Okay.

240
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:23,558
Hey!

241
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,063
Are you going to ignore me?

242
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,941
You ignored him first.

243
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,817
Shut up, you little...

244
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:35,570
Follow me, you bastard.

245
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,574
Not you. You!

246
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:03,557
Slow down.

247
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:05,684
You'll get indigestion.

248
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:12,732
Why do you have to be so nice?

249
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,528
I can't even hate you.

250
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:26,788
You know Judge Kang
was stabbed a while back, right?

251
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:30,500
I think Jeong Jaegeol's family
is in some way related to that incident.

252
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,669
But you're suspicious of Judge Kang.

253
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,338
-So why are you...
-I am.

254
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,008
I'm still suspicious of her.

255
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,260
But I need to know why she was stabbed

256
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,512
and what kind of person she is

257
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:45,557
to find any clues about the incident

258
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,559
that I suspect she was involved in.

259
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:49,978
That's why I'm doing this.

260
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:56,902
If Detective Kim was alive,
she would've told me to.

261
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:01,156
Kang Bitna was the victim of that attack.

262
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,784
So she would've told me
to catch the culprit.

263
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,204
That it's an officer's job.

264
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:12,375
Donghun.

265
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:18,757
I'm sorry I hit you.

266
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:22,469
It's all right.

267
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:29,684
And I'm sorry I couldn't protect her.

268
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:37,359
What happened to Soyeong isn't your fault.

269
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,952
I'm really sorry.

270
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:53,792
If you're sorry, you pay for dinner.

271
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:57,671
Gosh.

272
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:00,340
Here.

273
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:11,685
Meet Professor Lee Jihye
at Yeonseon Hospital.

274
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:14,896
She's the psychiatrist
who treated Kang Bitna back then.

275
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,357
She'd know well
about the night she was admitted.

276
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,693
YEONSEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

277
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:23,280
I can't share with you
information about the patient's treatment.

278
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:26,491
Professor, I really need
to catch the culprit.

279
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,619
You're a police officer
who must catch the culprit.

280
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:31,913
And I'm a doctor
who must protect my patient.

281
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:33,498
What should we do then?

282
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:39,588
Then, the night Judge Kang was admitted,
was there anything unusual to note?

283
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,756
Please tell me what you remember

284
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,717
within the scope of what you can say.

285
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:47,262
A man

286
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:50,015
came looking for Kang Bitna.

287
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,894
KANG BITNA

288
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:57,063
-Can you check the rest at the desk?
-Yes, doctor.

289
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:58,148
Thanks.

290
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,527
- Was it him?
- No.

291
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:06,615
Then...

292
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,450
Yes. It was him.

293
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,369
You said you only saw him briefly
a few months ago.

294
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,079
How do you remember his face?

295
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:14,998
He seemed very anxious.

296
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,833
As if he were guilty of something.

297
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:28,511
I told the police I saw a suspicious man.

298
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:30,722
But they said
the investigation was closed.

299
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:36,269
Jeong Seonho killed me?

300
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:38,897
I mean... Kang Bitna?

301
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,566
Yes. I'm sure he's J.

302
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,401
Don't get close to him.

303
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:44,945
But that's not enough.

304
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:47,489
We need more solid evidence.

305
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,908
He killed Kang Bitna and Soyeong.

306
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:53,286
And J's serial killings began
right after he returned from the US.

307
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:54,788
He's a murderer.

308
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:58,500
If Jeong Seonho is J
and the one who killed Kang Bitna,

309
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:01,544
why wasn't her body dismembered?

310
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:03,004
That's true, but...

311
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,800
We need to check and be more certain.

312
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:08,593
Is that why

313
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,263
you're trying to marry Jeong Seonho?

314
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:13,265
I'm not really going to.

315
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:15,934
I just need to get his guard down
to get closer.

316
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,060
Still, I don't like it.

317
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,732
-Are you jealous?
-I'm worried.

318
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:25,819
-That's disappointing.
-Half worried,

319
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,321
half jealous.

320
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,494
Just wait a bit longer.

321
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:38,081
-You trust me, right?
-I do,

322
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,916
but I don't feel good.

323
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,545
Then I should cheer you up.

324
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:53,013
It looks great on you.

325
00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:56,016
Doesn't wearing hanbok
make you feel better?

326
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,561
Well, it just seems like
we're doing this so you can feel better.

327
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:04,149
Hanbok is so beautiful.
Of course, I'm more beautiful.

328
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:07,068
Right. We have no time for this.
We have somewhere to go.

329
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:08,695
Where?

330
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:22,709
Since the subjects are perfect,
the pictures came out amazing.

331
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,878
You're right. The photos are unique.

332
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:28,340
This is what young people do
on dates these days.

333
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,426
Are we on a date, then?

334
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,678
Here you go. Enjoy, Detective Han.

335
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:35,764
You, too. Enjoy.

336
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,059
Turkish ice cream.

337
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:40,936
Goodness. There's no cone!

338
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:42,395
You have to grab it.

339
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,480
- Can't do it?
- I can.

340
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:45,607
You look like a fool.

341
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,442
Can't do it, right? Thank you.

342
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:48,902
Are you done already?

343
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:50,779
Enjoy! Oops.

344
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:52,364
- Give me ice cream!
- Where is it?

345
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:55,242
-Wait, Judge Kang. Stop.
-Give me ice cream!

346
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,661
-Can you just...
-Sorry.

347
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,205
It's ice cream.

348
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:02,791
This reminds me of that man from earlier.

349
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:07,045
"Can you get it? You can't, right?"

350
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,880
"You look like a fool."

351
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:12,342
I should've gotten his name.

352
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:13,677
"The Petty Demon"?

353
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:17,347
Why does he think demons are petty?

354
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,140
There are beautiful, strong,

355
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:21,393
smart, and perfect demons like me, too.

356
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:22,686
Yes.

357
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:23,895
You're perfect.

358
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:24,980
Right?

359
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:27,107
I'm not petty.

360
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:28,984
How was today?

361
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:31,945
I had fun.

362
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:35,824
Though we mostly did
what you wanted to do.

363
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:40,495
Well, I must have fun
to make it fun for you too.

364
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:42,789
You're right.

365
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,918
So how do you feel?

366
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:54,175
Good. I loved it.

367
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:55,260
Love...

368
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:58,805
I wasn't asking about me.

369
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,849
I know. I loved it and feel good.

370
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,895
What did you think I meant?

371
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:07,939
Nothing.

372
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:12,944
Thank you.

373
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:14,112
For everything.

374
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:19,868
So pretty.

375
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,749
That. The lighting is pretty.

376
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,294
They did a good job here.
The Stonewall Walkway.

377
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:32,672
They did.

378
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:34,841
It's really pretty.

379
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:45,727
Lord.

380
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:53,109
My son's killer is back.

381
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:57,364
This time, he killed the officer
who was trying to protect me.

382
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:03,870
Innocent people are dying.
Why aren't you doing anything, Lord?

383
00:29:10,293 --> 00:29:11,378
You should've...

384
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,215
had him kill me

385
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:18,802
instead of that police officer.

386
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:23,682
Then at least I could've
seen his face before I died.

387
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,810
Don't you hear my prayers?

388
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:30,939
I've prayed to you for 20 years.

389
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:33,149
How much longer must you test me?

390
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:37,779
I'm not asking for much.

391
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:42,450
I'm just asking that I see him once.

392
00:29:42,993 --> 00:29:43,994
So why?

393
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:46,788
Why?

394
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:49,874
Why...

395
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:05,599
Why is it raining so much?

396
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:15,942
Are you filming a music video?

397
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,402
Why walk in the rain?

398
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,905
Bitna.

399
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,073
Gosh, that's hot!

400
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:26,244
Myeongsuk! Deaconess!

401
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,872
That's hot!

402
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:33,209
Wake up! Hey!

403
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:47,057
She's burning up.

404
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:54,397
Are you awake?

405
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:56,691
Why are you so heavy?

406
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:58,443
I almost dislocated my shoulder.

407
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:01,947
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:06,826
Well,
the end justifies the means.

409
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,246
I had to get your fever down.

410
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:15,335
Just know I almost died
carrying that back.

411
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:16,711
Thank you.

412
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:17,796
THE HOLY BIBLE

413
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:19,256
Get some rest.

414
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,717
Did you find him? That man.

415
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:32,936
I've seen him before.

416
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:36,147
It was raining like this too that day.

417
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,779
I was afraid
my baby would be wet and cold.

418
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:46,491
So I went there
to hold an umbrella over him.

419
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:51,288
HWANGCHEON-DONG

420
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:06,428
Do you know my Yechan?

421
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:11,558
Why are you running away?
Did you kill my son? Did you?

422
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:13,059
No. I didn't!

423
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:17,522
- Stop!
- Let go!

424
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:20,025
Let go!

425
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:25,530
Yechan!

426
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:36,374
I've only prayed
for one thing since that day.

427
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,546
To let me see him one more time.

428
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:46,009
So I can ask him why he killed my son.

429
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:56,311
But He hasn't heard me.

430
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:06,404
Since I'm a believer of God,

431
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:11,201
I was going to forgive him
if he apologized.

432
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,203
But I can't seem to.

433
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:15,664
I want to...

434
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,042
tear him limb from limb.

435
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,295
I don't even know his face,

436
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:25,632
but I've killed him in my mind
over and over again.

437
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,720
But I'm still angry.

438
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:36,309
I'm frustrated and resentful.

439
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:42,732
Honey.

440
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,442
Honey.

441
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:46,403
You told me last time...

442
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:50,448
that you were tracking him down.

443
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:54,035
You're a judge and you're very smart.

444
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:56,621
Please find him.

445
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:57,872
I'm begging you.

446
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,709
Please, find him.

447
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:04,212
I'm begging you, please.

448
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:05,714
Please find him.

449
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:08,174
Please.

450
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,639
Please.

451
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:18,935
-Are you out of your mind? You'll die.
-I won't.

452
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:21,521
What if you get caught by him
in that house?

453
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:23,857
You don't have your powers anymore.

454
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,609
Do you think you can beat Satan?

455
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:27,319
I can slip out before he sees me.

456
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,486
Tyson said,

457
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,157
"Everyone has a plan
until they get punched in the face."

458
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,242
Daon must've cried alone like that, too.

459
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,953
And all the other victims' families...

460
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:39,998
probably cried their eyes out.

461
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:42,292
How can I turn away from them?

462
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,543
You can. Just do it.

463
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:44,920
That's how you've been.

464
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,133
I'm scared, too. So I hesitated.

465
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:53,803
But if someone has to do it, I'll do it.

466
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:55,222
But why?

467
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:56,681
Because I'm a judge.

468
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:02,729
I'm telling Detective Han.

469
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,984
Why aren't you stopping me?

470
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,569
Because you're on my side.

471
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:11,363
So creepy.

472
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:14,866
Make sure Arong doesn't get near Daon
while I'm gone.

473
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,869
Arong's been gone for a while now.
Don't worry.

474
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:19,246
When...

475
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,248
When will you go?

476
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,626
Soon.

477
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:35,929
Thank you, Assemblyman.

478
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:38,598
There's no need for that, Mr. Jeong.

479
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:40,225
Don't worry about the business.

480
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:41,935
Okay.

481
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:46,731
Nice shot!

482
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:51,861
You should retire
and start golfing professionally.

483
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:53,822
Gosh, you flatter me.

484
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:55,615
Perhaps a little too much.

485
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,618
- Thank you.
- Of course.

486
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:02,289
-What time is Judge Kang coming?
-At seven.

487
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:05,542
We still have time. Let's enjoy our round.

488
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:06,751
All right.

489
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,597
I was expecting you for dinner
at 7 p.m. You're early.

490
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,140
I've got too much time.

491
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:22,684
Is no one home?

492
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:24,519
His younger son is on the second floor.

493
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:26,980
Seonho's home now?

494
00:36:27,063 --> 00:36:29,482
He probably took some sleeping pills
and is asleep.

495
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:31,359
I see.

496
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:36,907
Do you know
that big department store in Yeouido?

497
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,618
Could you get some egg tarts from there?

498
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,244
I'm sorry.

499
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:43,455
I'm afraid it's too far.

500
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:45,665
And it's just me here, so I can't leave.

501
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:48,043
I'm soon to be married into this family.

502
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:55,217
All right, then.

503
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:30,961
What did you see?

504
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:20,760
What is this place?

505
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:28,268
What?

506
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,050
Why did they build this?

507
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:32,434
The candles blew out.

508
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:35,312
Could it be...

509
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:19,935
JUSTITIA
MY ICON AND ROLE MODEL

510
00:43:20,018 --> 00:43:23,021
As I thought,
this junkie attacked Kang Bitna.

511
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:27,234
The night Kang Bitna was attacked,
he took a taxi near the park.

512
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:29,611
This was highly suspicious,

513
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:31,780
but the investigation
was closed because...

514
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:32,864
Someone told them to.

515
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:36,826
Then Jeong Jaegeol or Jeong Taegyu,
which one could it be?

516
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,161
It must be Jeong Jaegeol.

517
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:41,957
What are you doing?

518
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,543
We weren't trying to hide this from you.

519
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:47,170
We had to be sure before--

520
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:49,214
You should eat properly to work late.

521
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:55,637
Detective Yoo.

522
00:43:56,888 --> 00:43:58,056
Won't you eat with us?

523
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,812
Why isn't she picking up?

524
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:06,815
The number you've dialed is--

525
00:44:06,898 --> 00:44:08,191
JUDGE KANG BITNA

526
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:15,740
Mando, it's me.

527
00:44:16,908 --> 00:44:19,119
I can't get a hold of Judge Kang all day.

528
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:22,247
What?

529
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:28,628
I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen.

530
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,342
You're a tough one.

531
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:36,011
You're just weak.

532
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:39,639
Seeing how fiesty you are,
I didn't get you right the first time.

533
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:41,433
You little...

534
00:44:48,982 --> 00:44:50,984
-Why aren't you going in?
-What are you saying?

535
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,944
-Aren't you Satan?
-That nonsense again?

536
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:28,021
You should have just died then.

537
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:31,942
Why are you doing this to me?

538
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,860
Because you keep butting in.

539
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,154
You barged into my mom's room.

540
00:45:37,072 --> 00:45:38,782
If you're not Satan, then who is?

541
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:41,284
Your father? Brother?

542
00:45:41,368 --> 00:45:43,787
Don't try stalling with that nonsense.

543
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:47,916
No matter how hard
you try to get out of here,

544
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,501
you won't make it out alive.

545
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:56,091
Why did you try to kill Kang Bitna?
I mean...

546
00:45:56,925 --> 00:45:58,760
me. At the park last December.

547
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:08,853
DECEMBER 2023

548
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:11,439
Mr. Jeong will be
a bit late, I'm afraid.

549
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:12,691
I can wait.

550
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:15,193
Can I take a look around the house?

551
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:47,893
My goodness.

552
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:01,990
Oh.

553
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,959
This is so cool.

554
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:00,840
Taegyu.

555
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:03,885
Yes?

556
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:05,929
I thought I was just a bastard to you.

557
00:48:06,596 --> 00:48:07,597
Water.

558
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:11,226
Damn it. Say, "Water, please."

559
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,270
Water, please.

560
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:15,355
Don't.

561
00:48:15,522 --> 00:48:16,565
Ah.

562
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,208
What are you doing here?

563
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:38,253
Fuck.

564
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,216
Good. Very nice.

565
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:50,056
Do you want to watch that woman die too?

566
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,141
It's fun.

567
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:55,937
I should get going.

568
00:48:57,188 --> 00:48:58,398
What about our dinner?

569
00:48:58,481 --> 00:48:59,983
I'm not feeling so well.

570
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:01,067
Bye.

571
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:12,412
You shouldn't have entered
that room.

572
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:23,548
Taegyu!

573
00:49:23,632 --> 00:49:26,635
Taegyu! Just once, please!

574
00:49:26,718 --> 00:49:28,470
I'll do anything you ask. Please.

575
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:30,722
Please give me the drugs.

576
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:47,322
Anything?

577
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:49,908
Yeah, anything.

578
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:02,087
This is why you shouldn't spoil your kids.

579
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:19,688
TAEGYU, LET'S CALL OFF OUR ENGAGEMENT

580
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:27,946
Damn it.

581
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,746
Why are you doing this?

582
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,457
My brother told me to, so don't resent me.

583
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:42,919
I haven't told anyone
what I saw in the basement.

584
00:50:43,003 --> 00:50:44,754
So please, just let me go.

585
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:49,384
I'm a judge.

586
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:52,178
Do you think
you can get away with killing a judge?

587
00:50:52,762 --> 00:50:55,473
Please. Please don't kill me. Please.

588
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:56,808
- Die!
- Please!

589
00:51:01,646 --> 00:51:03,607
Shit.

590
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:13,283
Shit. Damn it.

591
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:35,931
You really don't remember, do you?

592
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:38,475
It doesn't matter.

593
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:41,603
You know now, so you have to die.

594
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:44,481
Did your mother die here?

595
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,779
She must have been

596
00:51:51,947 --> 00:51:53,823
in a lot of pain before she died.

597
00:51:56,284 --> 00:51:57,577
What do you know?

598
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,458
Tell me who killed her.

599
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:07,796
Then I'll send them to Hell for you.

600
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,759
Don't mess around with my mom!

601
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,806
But it's okay for you
to kill someone in front of her?

602
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,643
Shut up!

603
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,771
Come here. Die.

604
00:52:25,397 --> 00:52:26,731
Die!

605
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:28,984
You have to die now.

606
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:31,236
My father and brother will be home soon.

607
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:34,322
You're a sad sack
who's leeching off the demon

608
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:35,574
who killed your mother.

609
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:48,587
I don't have time. Move!

610
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:53,633
I heard from the chubby guy
that Justitia's in danger.

611
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:56,511
That's the blueprint for Jeong's home.
I stole it.

612
00:52:56,595 --> 00:52:59,472
There's a secret passageway there.
It's the fourth green book.

613
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:03,101
If you need this, take it.

614
00:53:05,353 --> 00:53:06,605
Let's go together.

615
00:53:07,606 --> 00:53:08,607
Justitia hates me.

616
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,443
She's lost her powers and is vulnerable.

617
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:12,903
So you have to save her.

618
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,614
Stop, you bastard!

619
00:54:03,828 --> 00:54:05,747
Don't kill him!

620
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:09,167
Han Daon!

621
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:15,966
Stop hitting him.

622
00:54:19,678 --> 00:54:21,137
I have to hit him, too.

623
00:54:21,221 --> 00:54:23,640
How dare you...

624
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:28,144
Are you all right?

625
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:44,578
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I didn't have to. You still came.

626
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:48,790
-Let's get to the hospital first.
-Before that...

627
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:51,751
Jeong Seonho isn't J.

628
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:53,461
Or Satan.

629
00:54:53,545 --> 00:54:56,172
It's either Jeong Jaegeol or Jeong Taegyu.

630
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:03,430
You could have died,
do you realize that?

631
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,181
Don't act alone again.

632
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:08,393
How adorable.

633
00:55:09,936 --> 00:55:11,980
This is why I can't quit you, Han Daon.

634
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:18,778
What is that?

635
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:37,756
Are you feeling dizzy?

636
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:39,633
I'm fine.

637
00:56:04,074 --> 00:56:05,450
Come closer.

638
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:12,666
Thanks.

639
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:20,715
You can hit me, too.

640
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:22,926
I hit you twice.

641
00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:24,177
Oh, no.

642
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:25,971
Go on.

643
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:30,350
Then I'll just hit you once.

644
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:48,243
Justitia.

645
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:52,664
You're good.

646
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:55,750
Thank you... I mean, sorry.

647
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,091
Now that I'm all better,

648
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:05,552
shall we get started?

649
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:12,434
SEOUL NOBONG POLICE STATION

650
00:57:12,517 --> 00:57:14,185
What's Jeong Jaegeol doing?

651
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,520
He won't leave his house.

652
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:17,105
And Jeong Taegyu isn't going to work.

653
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:20,483
A judge was confined in their home,
but they're still not talking?

654
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,030
By the way, where is this punk?

655
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:28,450
Kang Bitna is being discharged today.
I sent him there.

656
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:30,076
Where's Jeong Seonho?

657
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:32,871
Here. I ran his license plate.

658
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:34,289
He's in Gangwon-do.

659
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:36,207
- Let's move.
- Yes, sir.

660
00:57:39,252 --> 00:57:41,004
VIP
PATIENT: KANG BITNA

661
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:43,840
- Hello.
- You're here.

662
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:45,675
- Yes.
- Hello.

663
00:57:45,759 --> 00:57:46,760
Where is she?

664
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:49,512
We heard she was being discharged
and came to help,

665
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:50,722
but she's not here.

666
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:06,279
I give my life to summon
the Demon of Death. Bael.

667
00:58:31,263 --> 00:58:33,223
A sinner
in the middle of her punishment

668
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:35,392
has dared to summon me.

669
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:38,853
I found Satan.

670
00:58:40,188 --> 00:58:42,065
Please give me my powers back.

671
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:44,943
Then I'll catch Satan
and bring him to you.

672
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:50,991
You're my sole heir.

673
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:53,201
Do not disappoint me again.

674
00:58:55,203 --> 00:58:56,246
I won't.

675
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:25,150
PHOENIX INN

676
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,761
Who is it?

677
00:59:53,261 --> 00:59:56,765
I'm from reception.
Can you open the door for a moment?

678
00:59:56,848 --> 00:59:58,934
The police called.

679
01:00:12,864 --> 01:00:15,825
You should have just died then.

01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:45,290

If it's murder,

685
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:12,984
I did not kill my brother.

686
01:02:13,068 --> 01:02:15,028
I killed him.

687
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:16,655
Must I express...

688
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:17,989
my condolences?

689
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:20,492
- Who are you?
- Demons.

690

Keep an eye

691
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,748
Let's go together. To Hell.

692
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:29,793
I can't stop Han Daon
from going to Hell.

693
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:32,379
Don't worry. Even if he goes to Hell,
I'll protect him.

694
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:34,631
- That's...
- Kylum!

695
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,175
Be honest.
You're Satan, aren't you?

696
01:02:37,259 --> 01:02:38,343
It was you?

697
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:49,688
There are ranks
even among demonic powers.

698
01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:53,984
You're wrong. The demon of all demons

699
01:02:55,068 --> 01:02:56,486
is me.
